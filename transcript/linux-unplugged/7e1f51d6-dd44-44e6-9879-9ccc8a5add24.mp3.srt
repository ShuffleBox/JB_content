1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
You know, I came across something kind of interesting today.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,040
Do any of you guys in the mumble room ever struggle with like anxiety problems or things

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,040
like that?

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,920
Anybody ever have battle with that kind of stuff?

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,960
I know like it's kind of not like a normally socially acceptable thing to talk about, but

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,200
I think a lot of geeks and probably the geekier you are sometimes, the more likely you could

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,460
be to have some sort of anxiety problem.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,120
Maybe there's social anxiety, maybe it's just, you know, stress anxiety.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,320
I found a really interesting article today that kind of put it all in perspective that,

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,600
you know, it felt like it connected me to one of the OG geeks and that is Darwin.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:42,520
There's a post over on brainpickings.org that was posted on the 28th of last month and it

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,160
goes into detail on Darwin's struggle with anxiety.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,160
And there's a couple of interesting things in the article that I found.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,400
So here is a quote from Darwin that he wrote in 1865.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,160
He says, for 25 years, extreme spasmodic and daily and nightly flatulence, occasional vomiting

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,160
on two occasions prolonged for months.

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,840
Vomiting proceeded by shivering, hysterical crying, a dying cessation or half faint and

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,400
copious pallid urine, I'm not even sure what that is.

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,200
He says, now I have vomiting and every passage of flatulence proceeded by a ringing of my

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,480
ears.

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,940
He says, I have nervousness when E leaves me and E refers to his wife.

22
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,280
He would be stricken with horrible anxiety.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,520
He goes on to say that, this was in the Chronicle of Darwin's Problems, it says, Darwin was

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,880
frustrated that dozens of physicians beginning with his own father had failed to cure him.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,640
By the time he wrote to Dr. Chapman, Darwin had spent most of the past three decades during

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,640
which time he struggled to write on the origin of species because of his anxiety.

27
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,320
He was bound to his household based on his diaries and letters.

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:57,040
It's fair to say he spent a full third of his daytime hours since the age of 28 either

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,560
vomiting or lying in bed because of crippling anxiety.

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,200
You know, you hear a lot about these historical figures but you don't ever hear about this

31
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,240
part do you?

32
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,120
You never hear too much about the background.

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,520
And their own personal struggles like this.

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Oh yeah.

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,080
A lot of people have struggles with anxiety.

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,400
I for one am somebody who suffers from anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified.

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,080
I've actually been diagnosed and yeah, I can totally relate to that.

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,560
Do I believe in Darwin's philosophies?

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
No.

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,640
That's just because of all sorts of other factors but in terms of struggling with anxiety

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,920
I totally get that.

42
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,760
And I think it's something that a lot of intelligent people are probably afflicted by a lot too

43
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,920
because your mind maybe wanders more than it should, or faster than you can control

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,200
it in some cases.

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,360
I have described that over and over again to friends and family is that like at night

46
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,400
my mind will just take all sorts of different paths which is why I have to read before I

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,000
go to bed otherwise I don't sleep.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You got to do what I do.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,040
Just call up Aaron Saigo and then hang up after he answers the phone.

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Yeah.

52
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
That's what makes me feel better.

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Huh.

54
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
He's in here with us.

55
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
Hey there, Aaron.

56
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,040
Hey, I always wondered if that was you.

57
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Yeah.

58
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,600
I thought maybe you'd recognize the breathing but it's fine, I hoped.

59
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,960
I'm glad you could join us today.

60
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,080
Congrats on the new project, by the way.

61
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
That's very cool.

62
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Oh, thank you.

63
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:34,280
Yeah, I suppose you're referring to the Luminosity Reboot.

64
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,520
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that always recommends building

65
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,000
your own online photo backup.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,520
My name is Chris.

67
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
And my name is Matt.

68
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Hey there, Matt.

69
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,560
Happy post-labor day to you.

70
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,040
Are you all rested up and ready to go?

71
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,440
We got a big show today.

72
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Absolutely.

73
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,920
Joining us in just a little bit will be Aaron Saigo.

74
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,280
He's launching a new project that I'm pretty excited about.

75
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,120
And he's also been talking a lot about convergence.

76
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
What is the desktop?

77
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
What are laptops?

78
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,440
Where does mobile fit into all of this?

79
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,400
Sort of really doing a good meta-analysis of a lot of things we've been talking about

80
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
lately.

81
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
So we'll chat with him in just a bit.

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
I'm excited about that.

83
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,360
Plus, I don't know if you caught it.

84
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
We mentioned it earlier, but Linus was at DebConf, the Debian conference.

85
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,020
And I guess they had it in Portland.

86
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,020
So Linus showed up.

87
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,720
You know, he just threw on his socks, then he threw on his sandals, in that order, like

88
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
a man.

89
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,160
Went down there and talked to the DebConf folks about what was going on.

90
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
And I love it.

91
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
We're only going to...

92
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,480
I haven't even seen the whole video yet.

93
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,480
But the first five minutes of the video are like, I got to play this in the show.

94
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:40,200
Because he goes into a rant, and he perfectly summarizes kind of what's wrong with distributions.

95
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,920
And it turns out, kind of around the same time, the System Decabal app, they called

96
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
that themselves.

97
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,200
I'm not making that up.

98
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,440
The System Decabal thinks they have a solution to some of Linus's complaints.

99
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,800
And also, if we have a little time, we'll see, I'm not quite sure, but if we have a

100
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,400
little time, we'll also discuss Fedora's future package manager, what it can do and what it

101
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,600
can't do quite yet.

102
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,400
But what you should be seeing, starting in Fedora 21, and why DNF might be a big deal.

103
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,520
But first, Matt, as is tradition on the Linux Unplugged show, it is time for emails.

104
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,720
Dave writes in on a pre-show discussion we had a week or so ago about System D. He says,

105
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,800
hey guys, I've been listening to Linux podcasts for a few months.

106
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
I enjoy them very much.

107
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,760
Your discussion of System D seemed to come down to innovation versus stability.

108
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,600
I've seen this tension throughout my 30-year career in the Unix arena, and in the past

109
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,120
20, developing a couple of big commercial Unix operating systems.

110
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,620
Customers love stability.

111
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,120
And many will place stability over innovation to a large degree.

112
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,680
Innovation in these operating systems has to come from something completely new that

113
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,840
doesn't disturb the old stable features.

114
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,640
Or at defined points, where an OS vendor can warn the customers, there could be breakage

115
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
ahead.

116
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,600
What we're seeing play out in the Linux arena is a maturing of the operating system and

117
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,520
a growing group of users valuing stability over innovation, particularly when innovation

118
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
is disruptive.

119
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,600
Fortunately, with Linux, the different distributions are free to introduce these innovations in

120
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
ways that make sense for them.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,360
E.g., I wouldn't expect Red Hat to put System D into Red Hat Enterprise Linux for a while,

122
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,960
but other distributions might choose to jump right in.

123
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,920
And I don't know if I totally, completely agree that it comes down to the camp that

124
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,040
likes System D is for innovation, and the camp that doesn't like System D is for stability.

125
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,080
Because A, it implies-

126
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,720
Yeah, I can't speak to that.

127
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,640
Yeah, it to me implies the people that don't want System D are curmudgeons.

128
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,560
And they're afraid of change.

129
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,680
I wouldn't go that far, but I think it's assuming a lot in both directions, and I wouldn't necessarily

130
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
go there.

131
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
Because I don't know what their opinions and thoughts are on it.

132
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
Yeah, I agree.

133
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
I think it is going too far.

134
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,760
And I think that sometimes it's not so much about avoiding change as it is just a philosophy

135
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
disagreement.

136
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
And that's what makes-

137
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
That I would agree with.

138
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,720
It's a multi-spectrum thing, I suppose.

139
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,360
It's some people that are curmudgeons about change, some people who don't like the design,

140
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,400
it's some people who don't like the people behind the design, it's some people who question

141
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
the political reasons.

142
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,480
And if it's all of these things that make it into one big issue, then that's why it

143
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,480
won't die.

144
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,560
If it was just one or two things, people could rationally debate and argue it and shut that

145
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
down.

146
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
It's not just one thing, though.

147
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Jeremy writes in.

148
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,400
He says, my thought on Linux desktop managers.

149
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Get ready for this, Matt.

150
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Are you ready?

151
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,520
He says, hello, all, and thanks for the Jupyter broadcasting Netcast.

152
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,000
And he says, not just Netcast, but resources as well.

153
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,480
Now, I'm thinking, I'm wondering if-

154
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

155
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,040
I'm wondering if he's a Leo fan.

156
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
He says, but he likes to Netcast.

157
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,600
You caught that with Netcast, huh?

158
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,540
I said, I recently wrote a little blurb slash rant on my thoughts of Linux desktop managers.

159
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,640
He said, and he links us to it.

160
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,520
I'll read a highlight from a second.

161
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,000
But the TLDR is I avoid all desktop managers and I run my own lean environment, which makes

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,440
my life easier.

163
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
And here's what he does, Matt.

164
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,680
Get ready for this.

165
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,400
So he wrote on his blog, he says, I've always felt that at some point, someone out there

166
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,280
would develop a manager that would not try to be an all-encompassing ecosystem, but rather

167
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,200
maybe just something that attempted to just simply be a powerful desktop manager.

168
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,760
That time, though, never came.

169
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,480
It seems that every iteration of every major open-source desktop environment, the wheel

170
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,680
is being reinvented again from scratch, and the idea of how things should look, feel,

171
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,320
and behave kept changing unnecessarily.

172
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,520
They rarely provided any improvements that I felt were positive.

173
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,120
So if I'm not using a desktop manager, what do I use?

174
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,880
Well first of all, I removed the default window manager and replaced it with a highly customizable

175
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,800
window manager called Sawfish.

176
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,240
Sawfish is very customizable, with themes, keyboard shortcuts, customizable menus, and

177
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
scripts.

178
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,760
It focuses on being a great window manager and doesn't attempt to be anything else.

179
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,560
It's easily exceeded my expectations of what a window manager could be.

180
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,720
So I switched to Sawfish about 10 years ago and never looked back.

181
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Anybody in the mumble room using Sawfish?

182
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,920
Never tried it over here.

183
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,720
Nobody in the mumble room is using it either, Matt.

184
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Nobody.

185
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
Never heard of it.

186
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
No, no.

187
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Been around for a while.

188
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
But I just, I don't know.

189
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
I'd have to...

190
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Makes me want to try it out, though.

191
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Yeah, I'd be curious to see what you could do with it.

192
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,240
And I like that he's stuck with it for 10 years.

193
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,720
Yeah, that's really says something, actually.

194
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
Quick question.

195
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,240
Wasn't Sawfish the window manager in older GNOME releases?

196
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Yeah, I was wondering about that too, actually.

197
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
I wasn't sure.

198
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
I didn't want to say anything.

199
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,240
You know, I'm Googling it right now.

200
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Sawfish.

201
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,240
I'm going to search for it right now.

202
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
Window.

203
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Yeah, look at this.

204
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
And look at this.

205
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,240
This is the 1.x times.

206
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
Yeah.

207
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Yes.

208
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Yeah, yeah.

209
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Yeah, yeah.

210
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
That sounds right.

211
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Yeah, here's a screenshot of it, actually, on Wikipedia.

212
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,240
Boy, that's pretty hardcore.

213
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Wow.

214
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Yeah.

215
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Well, I mean, you could...

216
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
I think it was...

217
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
More power to him.

218
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Wasn't it extensible with Lisp or something?

219
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Yeah.

220
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,240
And yeah, he mentions...

221
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,240
I think that was the scripting aspect to it.

222
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,840
And he also mentions that all the key bindings are totally customizable too, which is kind

223
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
of cool.

224
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
Yeah.

225
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
I like that too.

226
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
That's really funny though, looking at that.

227
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
Huh.

228
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
Yeah, I don't know.

229
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,840
I mean, you know, a little comp file massaging, that's fine, but I don't really want to get

230
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
into scripting something.

231
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
So I don't know.

232
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
Yeah.

233
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
I'd have to try...

234
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,840
I'd have to kind of weigh that out.

235
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Yeah.

236
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Yeah.

237
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Maybe on an older system, that'd be a great way on a...

238
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Yeah.

239
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
On a resource.

240
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,400
Or if you have a DigitalOcean droplet, which brings us to our first sponsor this week,

241
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
DigitalOcean.

242
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,440
And you know, I mentioned if you have a DigitalOcean droplet, I actually have a droplet up there

243
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,200
that I've installed Exxon, and you're going to laugh at me, audience, but you got to understand

244
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
the way I work.

245
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,840
I even installed Chrome on my DigitalOcean droplet.

246
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,800
I SSH in, I turn on compression and X11 14, and then I can manage all of my server side

247
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,000
stuff just using local host, and I don't have to expose any of that stuff to the web.

248
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,200
And that's just another layer of security for me.

249
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,800
So for me, because I'm always on an X11 based system, well for now at least, I can SSH in.

250
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,200
You guys know about SSH and X11 14.

251
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,920
You use compression, it runs like a champ, and you can start Chrome up.

252
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,800
And to be honest, I've actually had more success with Firefox.

253
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,920
I've both of them installed.

254
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
And Opera too.

255
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
I have Opera installed.

256
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
Hey, man.

257
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
I can't help it.

258
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,360
You know, Firefox runs really well under X11 14.

259
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,720
Yeah, it does.

260
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,080
It does work quite well, as a matter of fact.

261
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,480
So there's a lot of options you could do with a DigitalOcean droplet.

262
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,880
Go over to DigitalOcean.com and arm yourself with the knowledge of Unplug September.

263
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,960
That's the promo code you're going to want to keep in mind as I tell you about DigitalOcean

264
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,400
because it's going to get you a $10 credit.

265
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,240
So what is DigitalOcean?

266
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,760
It's a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

267
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
to spin up a cloud server.

268
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,480
And users can create a cloud server in under 55 seconds or 25 seconds if you're our audience.

269
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,600
And the pricing plans are incredible.

270
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,680
They start only $5 a month for 512 megabytes of RAM.

271
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,440
That gets you also a 20 gigabyte hard drive, one blazing fast CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

272
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,160
DigitalOcean also has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

273
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
and London.

274
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,920
The interface is simple and their control panel is crazy intuitive.

275
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,880
But on top of all of that, they have an amazing straightforward simple API that you could

276
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,920
just write your own scripts against or take advantage of any of the community applications

277
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
that are out there.

278
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,480
There's plenty of them that you can get your hands on.

279
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,640
They're really nice too because once you get a system spun up, you still have the option

280
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,440
to do one click deployment of applications.

281
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
You're like, oh, that's interesting.

282
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,600
Yeah, they're going to use Docker to do some of that stuff.

283
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
How cool is that?

284
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,440
They're using KVM for the virtualization and they're sitting on top of those SSD drives

285
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,400
and they work their butts off to make sure that they're at some of the best data centers

286
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
in the world.

287
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,200
They just spun up a new one with IPv6 in New York.

288
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,600
They got that new one in London.

289
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,160
They're growing like crazy.

290
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,640
Tons of you out there in the community have been trying out DigitalOcean because it works

291
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,000
so many for you.

292
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,060
That's why they invested in those SSD drives to get you that performance.

293
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,780
That's why they use the amazing hardware all wrapped up in this incredible interface.

294
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,320
They recognize that it takes all of that together to make an amazing product.

295
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,000
Go over to digitalocean.com and use the promo code unplugseptember.

296
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,720
You get a $10 credit.

297
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,560
You can try out the $5 rig that I've been getting a heck of a lot of use out of for

298
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,240
two months for absolutely free.

299
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,040
Digitalocean.com and the promo code unplugseptember.

300
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,000
And a really big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged Show.

301
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Love my D.O.

302
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Rufflets.

303
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I got multiple now.

304
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,160
It's like phones up in here with me, Matt.

305
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
It's like phones.

306
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,520
Yeah, I think you've got me beat.

307
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,000
I had like four of them at the peak.

308
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I dropped back to three.

309
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,720
Well, actually looking at doing a fourth one again.

310
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,200
Oh, what are you running on there?

311
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,720
Are you doing WordPress?

312
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,760
I'm actually doing more WordPress than anything.

313
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:18,480
I'm still rocking BitTorrent Sync, this big thing for me.

314
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,240
I do a lot of data back and forth.

315
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,080
But WordPress, it's like it's the best WordPress experience I've ever had and I've had a lot

316
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
of them.

317
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Same here.

318
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
It's really, really smooth.

319
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
Super fast.

320
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Love the setup.

321
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
You control it from top to bottom.

322
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,640
My wife, Angela, has been talking about how she kind of wants to get back into blogging

323
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,640
more regularly.

324
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,200
And one of the things we're thinking about doing is we're looking at all the different

325
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,200
options but definitely one of them on the list is just set up a WordPress site on a

326
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,600
DigitalOcean droplet and she can manage it even.

327
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,000
It's really straightforward.

328
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's kind of awesome.

329
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I would recommend it.

330
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's fast.

331
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's just DIY.

332
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But it's also easy.

333
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's really great.

334
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah, absolutely.

335
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Okay, Matt.

336
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,860
So we've got a couple more emails we're going to get into.

337
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,280
This next one came from Ryan and this is a topic I love.

338
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,360
First of all, Ryan wants to know, just to clarify off the top, all he has to do to be

339
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,480
a guest on the show is take a shower with me because apparently when Eric was here last

340
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,720
week we implied that Eric took a shower with me so therefore he was allowed on the show.

341
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,360
So Ryan, just to clarify, that only works under two circumstances.

342
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,940
Number one, you're a lady.

343
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,760
Number two, if you're not a lady, I'm really lonely that day.

344
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,440
And then if you get me on the right day, you take a shower with me and I do have a shower

345
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,480
here in the studio, I'll probably let you on air.

346
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,280
I mean, you know, I'm a nice guy after all.

347
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
So that happens.

348
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Hey, man.

349
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,120
Just telling it like it is and Ryan wanted to know, I'm just here to help the people

350
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,320
with the information they require.

351
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,480
So he says he's been a listener for a while now and he wanted to get to his actual question,

352
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
not just the shower question.

353
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,120
He says, I'm relatively new to Linux.

354
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,440
I tried to switch my five-year-old desktop last September but I had to switch it back

355
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,160
to Windows for both game-related and school-related reasons.

356
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,840
I recently bought a laptop with explicit intent of installing Ubuntu 14.04.

357
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,000
It took about eight hours because it came pre-installed with Windows 8.

358
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,120
Don't get me started on that OS or UEFI.

359
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,520
But I got it loaded and it works beautifully.

360
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,600
With the next six to eight months, I'm looking to get a refurbished desktop with a faster

361
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,000
processor, more RAM slots, and the MMOs I want for it aren't friendly with Linux.

362
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,400
So unfortunately, Windows 7 for that one.

363
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,920
Once I get the second desktop, I'll be looking to repurpose my current desktop as a local

364
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,880
file server for cohabitating my girlfriend and my files with a little backup action.

365
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,920
She has a Windows-based PC, so we have a mixed OS environment.

366
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,240
When I repurpose it, I plan on using Linux for this new machine.

367
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,320
What would be your top choices for distros to use for a home file server?

368
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,880
I'm going to set this up in VirtualBox on my laptop in the meantime so I can play around

369
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,760
with it before I actually go into it and put it in production.

370
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,720
Thanks for everything and I hope we had a great Labor Day.

371
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,680
So I have a few suggestions.

372
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,200
Matt, I'm sure you have a few.

373
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,120
Anybody in the Mumber room have a home file server distro recommendation for our email

374
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,240
Ryan here?

375
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Not really.

376
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:12,200
It's not a Linux distro, but I can't speak of FreeNAS high enough.

377
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,760
I run an OpenMedia file.

378
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,040
Yeah, something's up, guys.

379
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
No, go ahead.

380
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,680
I was just seeing what else I was giving you guys a chance to say.

381
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,680
So we've got OpenMedia, FreeNAS.

382
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,640
Oh, sorry.

383
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
What else?

384
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
What else do we use?

385
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:37,360
Well, I just use SFTP into an OpenSUSE server and that's how I get my stuff done.

386
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
Matt, do you think...

387
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
I mean, come on.

388
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Nobody's going to say Ubuntu LTS, right?

389
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
Come on, right?

390
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,080
But Matt, that makes a good home server.

391
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,560
I think Ubuntu's good.

392
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,300
I think anything Debian-based is certainly worthwhile.

393
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
That's kind of my go-to thing.

394
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,000
I think really moving more toward a Debian situation is just a comfortable place to be.

395
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I like that.

396
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,920
I think even if it's not Ubuntu, I think Debian's good.

397
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,280
I also think OpenSUSE, like the Evergreen release, would be quite good.

398
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,640
Wouldn't recommend Fedora.

399
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,260
And if you're in the Red Hat camp, check out CentOS.

400
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,760
That's also a pretty solid option to go.

401
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,360
But like Wimpy says, OpenMedia Vault also a great opportunity to look into and one we're

402
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,240
going to do a review on soon here on the show.

403
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Maybe we should do that next week.

404
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,840
Those of you doing the OpenMedia Vault, would you be ready to do the review next week?

405
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Yep.

406
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
Okay.

407
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
Yep.

408
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
Okay.

409
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,840
So we'll do on Linux Unplugged next week, unless something changes, we'll have a review

410
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,400
of OpenMedia Vault, Ryan.

411
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,200
So that might help you as well.

412
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Okay.

413
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,600
Last but not least, Sean writes in with the real cost of a MacBook.

414
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,120
He says, I know I'm a little behind on this comment, but I just started looking to Linux

415
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,260
within the past year and I came across Linux Action Show a few months ago and he's been

416
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,260
catching up.

417
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,400
I have a MacBook from the spring of 2008.

418
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,360
It runs better than Windows was my thought when I bought it.

419
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,200
Now my thought is I can only run up to 10.7 and that's as far as I can go?

420
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,080
In fact, he's stuck at 10.68 right now because as some of you may or may not know, after

421
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,720
a little while, Apple kind of discontinues support for these older MacBooks and they

422
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,240
don't really allow you to install the newer OSs on them anymore after a point.

423
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,360
He says, I tried running Linux distros on a VM in the MacBook, but it's slow and sketchy.

424
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,160
So I know I'm stuck with it for a while, but I got a hold of a couple of old desktops and

425
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,480
I've been running Ubuntu 14.4 and I want to set one up as a home server as well.

426
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
So I've downloaded CentOS.

427
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,640
Well, there you go.

428
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,940
All that to say the inability to move forward without shelling out major cash for a new

429
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,120
hardware has made me look back towards Linux.

430
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,040
Also getting back into computers and I'm in the process of getting an A plus and looking

431
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
at Linux 101 course.

432
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,720
So he says, keep up the great work.

433
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,880
Boy, isn't that true though about the MacBooks is like one of the things is you could throw

434
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,880
Linux on there and probably get a couple more years out of that, right?

435
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,780
I think that's really it because I think that really when you're in their own ecosystem,

436
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,760
they set the rules, they set the pace and you're limited to whatever they want to do

437
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
with you.

438
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,000
They, for example, have a old power PC, a Mac mini that runs a Linux.

439
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,200
And the reason why is because that's all you're going to do with it short of using it as a

440
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,200
doorstop.

441
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,240
It's not, it doesn't have any benefit in the OS 10 universe.

442
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
So very good.

443
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Very good.

444
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
All right.

445
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,880
Well, uh, we have, uh, we, I, we're having some connection problems with Aaron, so, uh,

446
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,520
we'll see if he's able to make it back on.

447
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
Okay.

448
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Oh, I hope he can.

449
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,960
If not, we'll still give him a good plug for his project he's working on cause it's pretty

450
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
exciting.

451
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,480
So, uh, what we'll do in the meantime as the guys work that out on the server end is I'll

452
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,000
tell you a little bit about our next sponsor and that's Linux Academy.

453
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,240
And Linux Academy is a great sponsor for the Linux Unplugged show because it's an opportunity

454
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,480
for anyone in the audience that's learned on their own or like if you're like me, self-taught

455
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,680
on the job, you'd be surprised going back and taking some of these fundamentals, how

456
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,400
much little bits of details they'll fill in and, and in my case at least, I won't speak

457
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
for you.

458
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,160
In my case, I learned, oh, I could have been saving myself quite a bit of time if I had

459
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
learned this the right way.

460
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,120
You ever had that now where you're like, oh, I guess I could have done this a lot easier.

461
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,880
I've been doing this the hard way the whole time.

462
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,240
So I have that at least once a week.

463
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
So yeah.

464
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,120
So here's just a little friendly reminder from someone who's been in this position.

465
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,200
Uh, maybe it's time to just check up on things.

466
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,800
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

467
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,280
That's going to get you the summer of learning discount.

468
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,160
You should go jump on that right now because it's a 33% off offer and Linux Academy is

469
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,300
offering new content every single week, so you're going to want that sub.

470
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,680
So what is Linux Academy?

471
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Let me tell you.

472
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,960
It's kind of an awesome service created by Linux enthusiasts and educators who really

473
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,960
wanted to put something together that Linux users could go to and know they're getting

474
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,880
really good content from people who love Linux.

475
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,640
They have step-by-step video courses, downloadable comprehensive study guides, and each course,

476
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,120
when you need it, comes with its own server, spins it right up.

477
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,320
You can pick from seven plus Linux distributions and they'll automatically adjust the courseware

478
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,140
to match the distribution you've picked.

479
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,160
So if you're a Red Hat guy and you need to get in on a little bit of Debian, you can

480
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,760
take care of that or vice versa.

481
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,300
It's really kind of neat and I've heard from a lot of you out there who've tried this out

482
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,880
and say, you know, you mentioned the downloadable comprehensive study guides.

483
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,680
You didn't mention that was also video and audio that happens to work really well as

484
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,740
a podcast or you forgot to sometimes mention they do live events so you can ask the educator

485
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,520
directly when you've been taking courses.

486
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,680
I love all of that, but me, I'm a recluse.

487
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,160
I sit up in my, on my office late at night when I'm not sleeping very well or when I

488
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,320
want to accomplish a little something, get a little intellectual stimulation, I bring

489
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,800
up my Linux Academy dashboard, I look at how long a course is going to take me, and I just

490
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
go to town on it.

491
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,560
And sometimes that's a scenario where I'm building something from beginning to end on

492
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:22,320
S3 using S3, EC2, all of the Amazon web services, or maybe it's something on a Linux box.

493
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,600
It's maybe something using OpenStack because it's not something I've had a lot of in-production

494
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,280
experience with, but I still want to talk about it from an educated standpoint.

495
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,320
That's what I love about Linux Academy is they're constantly adding this new stuff that

496
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,420
I can continue to test myself, see where I'm at, they give me progress reports, and I can

497
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,160
also see if there's a new kind of technology that's coming up that interests me, that sort

498
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,120
of excites me, because it's, sometimes you run the risk when you work on a particular

499
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,080
area of getting a little stale.

500
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,840
This is my opportunity to prevent that.

501
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,280
Go over to LinuxAcademy.com, check out their OpenStack Essentials, it's now 100% complete

502
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,840
with tons of content.

503
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,640
Their AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Prep Course has over 14 hours of content that you

504
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
can check out.

505
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,680
I think it's a pretty neat system.

506
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,760
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged to get that Summer of Learning discount.

507
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,360
Go over there right now, let them know you appreciate them supporting the Linux Unplugged

508
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,360
Show.

509
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,000
That's LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged, and a really big thank you to Linux Academy for

510
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,880
sponsoring the Linux Unplugged Show.

511
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Check them out, guys.

512
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
They're great.

513
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,760
I don't see Aaron back just yet, so while we work on that, I got another topic, we can

514
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,280
move to our next topic because this, we've actually got, we've got way more show than

515
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,240
we can fit anyway, so either way, we're totally fine.

516
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,880
The meta story we've been covering is, is it too late for the Linux desktop?

517
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,760
We covered John C. Dvorak's trolling in the Linux Action Show, right?

518
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,960
And then the week before, actually for the last couple weeks on Linux Unplugged, we've

519
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,280
been talking about the perceived threat that the Mac desktop represents to the success

520
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,960
for Linux on the desktop.

521
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,160
Well, this past week, Linus Torvalds, your buddy and mine, was over at, he actually wasn't

522
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,720
just over there, he lives in Portland, so it's not that far for him to go, but he was

523
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:08,360
at the Deb Comp 14 in Portland, and Linus' style these days is to do more of a Q&A session

524
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,320
than it is so much to go up there and do a big speech, and so he sat, and just kind of

525
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,480
right off the top of his talk, started taking questions from the audience.

526
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,200
It's kind of cool when he does that, too, because anything goes, right?

527
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,020
And it's not like it's this pre-manicured experience where he's going to hit on these

528
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,760
bullet points and go out there and give the Linux talking point speech and really pitch

529
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,840
Linux to all of the people, he's just a guy going out there answering questions, and I

530
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,160
love that about him.

531
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,960
So the first question is the one we're going to start with today, and then we'll move into

532
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,920
what the System D cabal is trying to do to address this, and I think it should be for

533
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
an interesting discussion.

534
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,040
So I'll start with Linus' question here.

535
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,440
I think he's wrapping up a statement and then the question begins, and we'll let him go

536
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
for a bit, it's a great talk.

537
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,680
I have a really hard time just doing something else because that means I have to switch over

538
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:05,680
all my kids' machines, my wife's machine, and that's just painful, so that's why.

539
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:11,040
Okay, so this is a little difficult.

540
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,320
I guess we're all, at least for me, I'm kind of wondering very much like I think you are

541
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:21,080
lately, how to get to the year of the Linux desktop, if you will, right?

542
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,360
And we'd all like it to be the year of the Debian desktop, if possible, and I'm trying

543
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,640
to figure out if anything, if you have any insight as to possibly how to get closer towards

544
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
that.

545
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,400
So, I mean, there's a lot of things that are getting closer to that, and I think, I mean,

546
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,520
people, technical people don't tend to use Chromebooks, but I think that Chromebooks

547
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,540
are the kind of thing that will make the year of the desktop more possible, right?

548
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:53,520
Because once people get used to running their applications basically as a browser, that

549
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,040
makes a lot of things much easier.

550
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,840
That said, let me go on my first rant of the evening, right?

551
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:10,180
One of the problems desktop has, I mean, ignoring all the purely market and getting free installs

552
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:17,200
and making it just so that normal people, and by normal people I mean obviously non-technical

553
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,640
people will just buy a machine and it just works.

554
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:28,720
One of the things that none of the distributions have ever gotten right is application packaging,

555
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,280
right?

556
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:36,800
And now somebody will say, hey, dpackage is way improved and much better than RPM, and

557
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,280
that's not at all what I'm talking about.

558
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:48,080
I'm talking about actual application writers that want to make a package of their application

559
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:55,000
for Linux, and I've seen this firsthand with the other project I've been involved with,

560
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,800
which is my dialogue application, right?

561
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,120
We make binaries for Windows and OSX.

562
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,560
We basically don't make binaries for Linux.

563
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Ouch.

564
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
That's Linus.

565
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
Ouch.

566
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,560
Why?

567
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,760
Because making binaries for Linux desktop applications is a major fucking pain in the

568
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,560
ass, right?

569
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,960
You don't make binaries for Linux.

570
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:29,440
You make binaries for Fedora 19, Fedora 20, maybe there's even like rel 5 from ten years

571
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
ago.

572
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,040
You make binaries for Debian, well actually you don't make binaries for Debian stable

573
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,520
because Debian stable has libraries that are so old that anything that was built in the

574
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,240
last century doesn't work, right?

575
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:54,320
But you might make binaries available for Debian whatever the code name is for unstable,

576
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,000
and even that is a major pain because, Christ, we had this small local flame fest just a

577
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,720
couple of days ago, Debian has these rules that you're supposed to use shared libraries,

578
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
right?

579
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:17,440
And if you don't use shared libraries, getting your package in, like, is just painful.

580
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,720
But using shared libraries is not an option when the libraries are experimental and the

581
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,560
libraries are used by two people and one of them is crazy.

582
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:32,660
So every other day some ABI breaks, right?

583
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:40,120
So you actually want to just compile one binary and have it work.

584
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,800
Preferably forever.

585
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,600
And preferably across all the Linux distributions.

586
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,820
And I actually think distributions have done a horribly, horribly bad job.

587
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:57,280
One of the things that I do in the kernel, and I have to fight this every single release

588
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,680
and I think it's sad, we have one rule in the kernel.

589
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,880
There is one rule.

590
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,600
We don't break user space.

591
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,480
Everything else is kind of a guideline.

592
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,060
The whole security thing, it's a guideline that we shouldn't do stupid shit, right?

593
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,800
But that's not a hard rule.

594
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,080
People do stupid shit all the time.

595
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,800
I don't get that upset.

596
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,880
People break user space.

597
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,800
I get really, really angry.

598
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,760
This is something that is religious for me.

599
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,680
You do not break user space.

600
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:34,360
And even in the kernel, every single release I have people saying, okay, I'm changing this

601
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,360
ABI because it's cleaning stuff up.

602
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,520
And I'm like, no.

603
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,480
You're not changing that ABI because I will crush you, right?

604
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,800
All right.

605
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,680
So I'll link to the rest of the talk.

606
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,440
It's available in WebM if you'd like to watch the whole talk in its entirety.

607
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,440
Obviously it's a good one.

608
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,400
I mean, Linus, that's what he does now.

609
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,440
I love his frankness about these matters.

610
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,440
And I think it's so telling that Linus does not package his own application for the Linux

611
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,440
desktop.

612
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,640
He makes binaries for Windows and Mac OS 10.

613
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,880
Tell me that doesn't sting.

614
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
That's just wow.

615
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,560
I mean, that's really telling.

616
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,200
I think we could debate all day long if the system is broken or not or if it's technically

617
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,960
feasible or not.

618
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,440
But at the end of the day, when the creator of the fricking Linux kernel won't package

619
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,600
his own software, I think that's an indication of a failure at some point in the system,

620
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
right?

621
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,640
I mean, I think it's, and I don't think like a small failure, right?

622
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,920
I don't think it's like a small failure.

623
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,280
I think it's kind of like a fundamental failure.

624
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
Am I wrong?

625
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
It seems like a big deal.

626
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,760
He said it was a major pain.

627
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,480
I mean, at the end of the day, I mean, the fact that someone comically earlier asked,

628
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,320
Hey, is, you know, when's the year of the desktop coming?

629
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,560
Um, well, there you go.

630
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,720
I think these are things that still have to be overcome.

631
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
Big time.

632
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Right?

633
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
I mean, okay.

634
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,840
So is there a solution?

635
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,360
In fact, we've had people write in, Matt, you might recall to the Linux action show

636
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,120
and been like, guys, this is so frustrating.

637
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
Is there ever going to be a solution?

638
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
And I kind of joked.

639
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,800
I said, huh, I wouldn't worry about it.

640
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,520
I'm sure the system D guys will eventually come up with a universal package format for

641
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
all.

642
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
Well, guess what?

643
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
Oh boy.

644
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
Oh boy.

645
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
What?

646
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
Guess what?

647
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,080
Uh, you might've heard of him.

648
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
His name is Lenart.

649
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,680
Uh, he, he's done, he's, he's been around.

650
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
He's done a few things.

651
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,560
Um, Avahi, you might be familiar with Avahi project is the, uh, auto DNS discovery.

652
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:32,100
Uh, you could be familiar with pulse audio, perhaps, uh, you may have heard of the system

653
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
D project.

654
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,640
Uh, you might've be familiar with a company called Red Hat.

655
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,800
These are all things that you might attribute to Lenart Pottering.

656
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:45,320
Well, another thing you can contribute to Lenart is fundamentally attacking how we put

657
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:52,800
together a Linux system, changing what defines a distribution forever.

658
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,240
And the best part is it's all powered by butter FS.

659
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,920
Of course it is.

660
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,080
It's all powered by butter.

661
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,040
I'm sure a little system D is in there too.

662
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,960
It feels like a big Reddit meme, doesn't it?

663
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
All right.

664
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,640
Before we get into this, I can see the mumble room has a few things they want to talk about.

665
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,280
Let's start with Fred and then we'll go to Wimpy.

666
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,840
Fred, what are your thoughts thus far with that Linus talk and all of that?

667
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,400
What are you thinking right now?

668
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Yeah.

669
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:23,400
So, um, somebody asked him later in the talk, if you did watch till the end, uh, you know,

670
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,360
uh, he, he built this sparse C front end and then he, to solve a problem.

671
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,720
And then he built Git to solve a problem.

672
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,760
And then now is he going to build some solution to solve that packaging problem?

673
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Yeah.

674
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,760
Yeah.

675
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
And then he says, no, this is a hard problem.

676
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,840
And I actually really do think it's a hard problem.

677
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Oh yeah.

678
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Oh yeah.

679
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Big time.

680
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,080
It's hard because of packaging issues.

681
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,000
It's hard because, um, I just, uh, so I thought up an example while you were playing, uh,

682
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,400
the video, even containers, I don't think containers can even solve that problem.

683
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,640
Let's talk about GTK and GTK themes.

684
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,080
So now you have this settings application, which you can go in and choose your GTK theme,

685
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,080
right?

686
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,480
And this changes for all applications, right?

687
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,560
So the theme, the same, all applications get the same theme.

688
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Yeah.

689
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:21,320
So, um, now everybody's statically linking, which, uh, doesn't cause problems, but then

690
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:27,600
now everybody is bundling up applications dynamically linked with GTK, but they're just

691
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,160
in their own separate container or bundle or whatever you want to call them.

692
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:41,200
Which configuration file do you use to set the theme, are they separate configuration

693
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
files?

694
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:51,120
Uh, do you have a separate configuration file for GTK 2 and 3 or for GTK 2.12 and 2.14 or

695
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,120
for GTK 2.12.1.

696
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,560
All of the things, all of the things, my friend.

697
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
Yeah.

698
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,600
But then you cannot add new settings or, you know, like add more features to the configuration

699
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,880
files without breaking everything else.

700
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,880
Yeah.

701
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,200
Well, how do you do that?

702
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,400
And this is a simple problem.

703
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,440
That's not also not so important.

704
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,820
Theming is not that important functionally speaking, but it's a very good example.

705
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,400
It's a very good use case.

706
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Something that would drive me nuts.

707
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Yeah.

708
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
All right.

709
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,200
A few of us in the Mumble Room were talking about this, uh, yesterday, I think.

710
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
Oh yeah.

711
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Okay, great.

712
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:37,840
And in general, I am, I am very pro-System B. I like System B, and I don't mind that

713
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,080
they've taken a lot of the little stuff.

714
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:48,000
That being said, anything to do with package management and changing that scares me because

715
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,260
one of the things I, my favorite things about Linux, the thing that I think sits at above

716
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,960
every other operating system is its package management.

717
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
And I'm not saying that this will screw it up.

718
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,640
I'm just afraid this will screw it up, or at least screw it up for a little while like

719
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
Pulse Audio did.

720
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,420
Well, I'm going to get into how they're going to pull it off in a second from like a package

721
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,680
management standpoint and things like that, but before we do, I wanted to give Wimpy a

722
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,200
chance to jump in, then Daredevil, and then we'll get into the meat of what the system

723
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
do you guys want to do.

724
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,720
So Wimpy, uh, what are your thoughts at this point so far?

725
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Okay.

726
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:23,160
Well, I read Leonard's post this morning, that was my morning reading, so I had some

727
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:28,200
time to think about that on the commute into work and I read it again and had to think

728
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,200
about it on the way home.

729
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,920
Yeah, I read it twice too and I'm still thinking about it.

730
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,800
I was going to say, I think, I think it needs a third read to really absorb it, but, um,

731
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:44,400
I think he, he and his team are very good at tackling the tough problems in the Linux

732
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,400
world.

733
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Yeah.

734
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Yeah.

735
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,080
And what they've fleshed out, I really like.

736
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:56,720
So I noticed somebody referred to it in one of the comments as, Oh, it's, it's complicated.

737
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,960
And I don't think it's complicated.

738
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,140
I think it's complex, but not complicated.

739
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:10,000
And if, if you're a Python programmer, one of the edicts in the Zen of Python is, uh,

740
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,360
uh, choose complex over complicated, and it is a difficult problem to solve.

741
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,000
So there needs to be some complexity to it, but I really, I'm really quite enamored with

742
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,480
the approach and I say, I say, bring it on.

743
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm really looking forward to a world in which we can isolate the user environment, the framework

744
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,120
environment for the desktop and, and with the appropriate configuration and then keep

745
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,080
the staple OS separate from that.

746
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm really excited by that.

747
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,320
So I would, for those of you who haven't read this yet, I bet a lot of you are probably

748
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,600
thinking, you know, this is, they're going to use Docker.

749
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,960
This is going to, this is not what containers can play a role in this, but in a way it almost

750
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,000
demotes everything to the same playing level.

751
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,920
The, the, the base OS containers and VMs, uh, in some ways are, are, uh, from a file

752
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,720
consistency standpoint are the playing fields a little more leveled.

753
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,920
So essentially you could see why they want to do this and, and Lenart summarizes it very

754
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,120
well and Wimpy, please feel free to jump in as, as, as I go over this, uh, he says, what

755
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,040
we want to do is an efficient way for vendors to package their software, regardless of it's

756
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:17,000
just an app or the entire operating system directly to the end user and know the precise

757
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,800
combination of libraries and packages it will operate within.

758
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,640
I, you know, if we were to ship a Jupiter broadcasting media player that just played

759
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,880
Jupiter broadcasting content, was all themed up with our logo and stuff, I'd have no idea

760
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,040
what video libraries you might have on your distro.

761
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,480
So I would want a way to know what libraries would be used when I gave you the Jupiter

762
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
broadcasting app.

763
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,560
He says, we want to allow end users, uh, and administrators to install these packages on

764
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:45,000
their system, regardless of which distribution they have it installed on.

765
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,120
We want a unified solution that ultimately can cover updates for full systems, OS containers,

766
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,800
like Docker, end user apps, programming, ABIs, and more.

767
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,920
These updates shall be double buffered.

768
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,680
And what he means by that is like, if you guys have ever had a motherboard that has

769
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,240
two bioses or like the way the Mars Rover does updates, there's two computers and what

770
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,520
you do one update.

771
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,700
And then once you have a successful boot, then, you know, you update the second install.

772
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,000
So you have it, it's the, or in, in actually in the case of their approach, you'd have

773
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,640
infinite buffering depending on your free storage.

774
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,540
But they say we want at least in the minimal double buffer.

775
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,040
He says there's an absolute necessity if we want to prepare the ground for an operating

776
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,600
systems that can manage themselves, that can update safely without administrator involvement

777
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:32,000
a la core OS, or maybe some of the directions Fedora cloud wants to go in where yes, the

778
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,960
server OS is rolling, but the applications are protected.

779
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,900
He says we want our images to be trustable.

780
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,080
Now this is one that might have some controversy because he means signed and he doesn't just

781
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,480
mean like the application signs, they want a fully trustable OS starting to sound a

782
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,640
little bit like Microsoft here with images that can be verified by a full trust chain

783
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,200
from the firmware, meaning secure boot through the bootloader, through the kernel, all the

784
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,720
way up to the init cryptographically secure verifications of the code we want to execute

785
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,320
is relevant on the desktop, just like Chrome OS does now, but also for apps for embedded

786
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,480
devices and on servers, particularly in a post Snowden world.

787
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,360
So what they are proposing on how to accomplish this, it's amazing.

788
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,040
It's essentially a scheme built around a variety of concepts that are available either today

789
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,960
or hopefully soon in ButterFS.

790
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
I want to caveat something here.

791
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,320
Everything they're talking about in ButterFS is in a read only capacity.

792
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,880
So you're not really talking about ButterFS manipulating live data to accomplish this

793
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,180
so much as basing it off of snapshot of data and working from that snapshot of data.

794
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:40,040
So before you get too ButterFS freaky, do keep that in mind, although you probably are

795
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,920
legitimately concerned.

796
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,000
So they want to use the ButterFS file system namespacing.

797
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,720
There's a large number of features in ButterFS that neatly fit this concept today, he says,

798
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,720
and maintainers are busy working on a couple of others they want to eventually make use

799
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
of.

800
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,960
As part of the proposal, they will make heavy usage of ButterFS's sub volume capabilities

801
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,520
and introduce a clear naming scheme for them.

802
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:06,200
So you would have a user file system with a vendor ID, the architecture like ARM or

803
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
x86, and then the version.

804
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,320
And these would be volumes that could be mounted and mapped to your file system like a drive.

805
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,720
So when an application launches and it needs a particular version for a particular architecture,

806
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,880
it thinks it's talking to slash opt slash proprietary garbage slash bin, when in reality

807
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,680
it's actually in this deeper ButterFS sub volume that's been mapped to that location.

808
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,280
Kind of a little bit like that distribution we talked about a little while ago that would

809
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,840
let you run applications from any distro and do a whole bunch of cherooting on the background.

810
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
Oh yes.

811
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,520
Wimpy, am I getting everything right so far?

812
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,760
Yeah, you've totally summarized that correctly.

813
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:47,960
And they talk about how you wouldn't even necessarily have to have a ButterFS file system

814
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,960
to do this.

815
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,220
A lot of this functionality could be contained within a loopback device that is formatted

816
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,220
with ButterFS.

817
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,400
If you still wanted to use XFS or ZFS or Extended 4 for your primary file system, some of this

818
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,480
functionality may be capable of, I bet that's limited, but I bet some of the functionality

819
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,160
could work out of a loopback device.

820
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,840
Here's a couple of things that are really, really, really, really interesting and would

821
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,200
fundamentally change the way software is distributed on Linux.

822
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,600
They are taking advantage of a feature built into ButterFS called Send and Receive.

823
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:24,080
ZFS has something similar where you can take the blocks from your drive, from your storage

824
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:29,800
device, and send them over the network, over an SSH connection, or over the SATA cable,

825
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:36,120
and write those blocks to another storage device in another computer or on another drive.

826
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,120
It's kind of cool.

827
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,960
It's kind of crazy because you can just take the whole thing, suck it up and spit it on

828
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,680
another machine, and write it all down there.

829
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,280
Well, they want to use that same technology to distribute software, so it would be bit

830
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,960
by bit exactly what you got.

831
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,800
And using some of things like ButterFS's deduplication features and things like that, even though

832
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,760
you'd have a lot of the same libraries, on the back end, ButterFS would be doing dedupe

833
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,840
to clean it all up, and they would do Delta differentials too.

834
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,280
So if you're doing a Send and Receive of a ButterFS file system, it would just be the

835
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,360
bits you don't have.

836
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,320
So you would essentially have some Delta capability there too.

837
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,340
Now, they're also saying all of this doesn't even eliminate RPM or deb because the distro

838
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,060
maintainers would still be building the distros with those tools.

839
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,960
This would be more for the users.

840
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,360
The users would stop using the package managers as much, and would use systems more like this.

841
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:29,720
And they paint a scenario where you would have Gnome and LibreOffice and Firefox all

842
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,840
doing this system, and it escalates from there.

843
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,960
Any gaps you need to fill in there, Wimpy, you think?

844
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,960
Yeah.

845
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,920
I think one thing you've missed there is you mentioned LibreOffice and Firefox, but in

846
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,560
this brave new world, you can have the last six versions of Firefox, and the last three

847
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:53,560
versions of LibreOffice, and the beta release, and you can transparently switch between them.

848
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,720
Yeah, and that's, I think, where people think it seems a little complex.

849
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:05,400
And it is complex, but SystemD is already capable of doing some of those switching activities

850
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,400
now.

851
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,120
So this is building on what SystemD is already doing with its stateless booting and all that

852
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,120
sort of stuff.

853
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,540
And in this system, everything, as they're calling it, is double buffered, or really

854
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,800
end-fold buffered, depending on your storage, because user and the runtimes and the frameworks

855
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,060
and the app sub-volumes can exist in multiple versions.

856
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,220
You could roll back after a bogus update.

857
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,760
You could see how a rolling OS becomes a lot more reasonable because you could individually

858
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,080
or completely roll back different components or all of the components.

859
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,640
You're doing bit-by-bit transfers.

860
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,960
Wimpy, what do you think of the method they're proposing for software installation?

861
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,760
Does it blow your mind a little bit?

862
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,240
It's a little bit different, but there are some parallels to the way that we do some

863
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,000
things at work currently.

864
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,320
So we work almost exclusively with Python at work.

865
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,080
And if anyone out there is a Python developer, they've almost certainly come across Virtual

866
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:03,080
Env, which is a way of isolating a Python runtime and then installing just the packages

867
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:08,680
and tools that you need for your application into this sandboxed, isolated environment.

868
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,880
And it means to say that you can keep that separate from the system and stop the system

869
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:20,680
packaging from stepping on your applications and new libraries breaking your application.

870
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:24,820
And it's more complex, but it's like that.

871
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,280
It's like virtual environments, but for all of your partitions.

872
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,280
Right.

873
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,880
And in an example, Lenart says, I've got three vendor operating systems installed.

874
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,400
He's got like, I think it was two Fedoras and Arch Linux.

875
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,200
He's got KD and Gnome and the home directories are shared.

876
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:48,640
And using these namespacing concepts in ButterFS, he's free to mix and match apps and OSs or

877
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,720
develop against specific frameworks and specific versions on any operating system.

878
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,600
It doesn't matter if you booted the Arch instance or the Fedora instance, he can execute both

879
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,360
LibreOffice and Firefox just fine because the execution time gets matched up with the

880
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,960
right runtime at launch time.

881
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,520
And all of them are available for all the operating systems you have installed.

882
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,600
Kind of, I mean, part of this... Yeah, go ahead.

883
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,160
As a developer productivity tool, that's really powerful because right now, if I want to develop

884
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:21,960
against the Marte 1.9 branch, for example, I need to boot into a virtual environment

885
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,560
with all of that, a virtual machine with all of that stuff installed and develop that sort

886
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,440
of separately from my main machine.

887
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,200
But being able to step in and out of environments like that sort of at will is extremely powerful

888
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,600
and could in some way sort of usher out the hypervisor world altogether.

889
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:48,600
Yeah, and he also points out that one FAT binary, if you wanted to, could include all

890
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
of the architecture.

891
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,480
So, you could have, sort of like when the Mac was transitioning from PowerPC to Intel

892
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,640
and you could run either the PowerPC code or the Intel code with one icon.

893
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,920
He says the same thing could be possible with this.

894
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,400
An installer image could include the Fedora version compiled for x86-64, one for i386,

895
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,760
and one from ARM, all contained in the same ButterFS subvolume.

896
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,680
And due to ButterFS's deduplication, they'll share as much of the code as possible.

897
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,300
And when the image is booted up, the right subvolume is automatically picked based on

898
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,720
what architecture the system has detected it's had.

899
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,640
Yeah, brilliant, isn't it?

900
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:26,200
And he says here in this new system, it would also make installations of operating systems

901
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,240
much easier.

902
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,120
You could do it manually, but you could also automate this.

903
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:35,360
Here is the process to install a Linux distribution with this new ButterFS-inspired subvolume

904
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,360
system.

905
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,440
You would create a GPT partition table.

906
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,940
You would add an EFI system partition to that partition table.

907
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,780
You would create a ButterFS volume, obviously.

908
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,080
You would deserialize, that's what they call when you write one of these volumes right

909
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,080
to your hard drive.

910
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,400
You would deserialize a single user subvolume into that ButterFS volume.

911
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,520
You would install the bootloader into the EFI system partition, and then you boot the

912
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,760
system, and it's done.

913
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,320
There's got to be a downside to this, other than the complexity.

914
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,640
And the other thing is, he says right in here, he's like, A, we recognize this would take

915
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,460
a massive level of adoption.

916
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,600
That's why we're putting it out there right now.

917
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,540
And he says, we think this could also help us accomplish things like factory resets and

918
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:21,580
power wash features where users could press a button and all of their data would be protected,

919
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,800
all of their apps, everything they depend on, but everything could go right back to

920
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,800
a default.

921
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,560
That could be incredibly powerful for users.

922
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,640
But they've got to get adoption, number one.

923
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,400
They've got to make sure people are comfortable with ButterFS, number two.

924
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,320
And the real question is, how irrelevant does this make a distribution's built-in package

925
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,320
management tools?

926
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,840
Because for some distributions, their package manager sort of defines them.

927
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,320
You look at Arch or really even, you know, dev distributions.

928
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,500
There's folks that will only use dev-based distributions.

929
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,080
If you're an RPM-based distro, you're de-qualified.

930
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,800
This would sort of nullify that differentiator, right?

931
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,800
It could do.

932
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:08,240
I mean, you could build your framework and application sub-volumes just by compiling

933
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,840
and installing the code into them.

934
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,640
And maybe that's the simpler way to do it, thinking about it.

935
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,360
Maybe that reduces some steps and some overhead.

936
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,880
So yeah, thinking about it, yeah, maybe it does kill off the package manager.

937
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,600
But it doesn't necessarily mean you have to do that.

938
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:31,040
There's still some value in being able to package things and install things in a reproducible

939
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,040
way.

940
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,040
Right.

941
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,040
Yeah.

942
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,040
And in fact, I want to talk about that in a second.

943
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,680
Before we move to that aspect of it, does anybody else have any thoughts on...

944
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,440
It's early days on this proposal, so I know a lot of you haven't chewed on it yet.

945
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,480
We'll have a link to it in the show notes, too, if you guys want to read it all.

946
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,840
But anybody else in the Mamba Room want to chime up before we jump to...

947
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,840
Yes.

948
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,840
Definitely.

949
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:53,520
Definitely. So this is one of those things that I actually think...

950
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,440
So far from the proposal, I can see the feasibility of implementing it.

951
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,720
I can see the benefits of implementing it.

952
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:06,280
But I think we're misleading a little bit on a couple of things that we gained from

953
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,800
not doing that before.

954
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,960
So one of the things is people are now statically linking.

955
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,620
And the reason we weren't doing that is because there was this major benefit of updating the

956
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,560
library and getting it all updated.

957
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:24,840
Yes, it breaks packages and makes the distro and the package manager much more relevant.

958
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:31,960
However, it does make our applications to be following the path of later security, the

959
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:39,800
path of the latest upgrades that were made in technology, which is no longer true when

960
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,000
you have these kind of hybrid system.

961
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,160
The other thing that I also think that this can actually provoke is a situation where

962
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:57,880
you start just bringing everything to a monolithic state, and you lose the distro variety.

963
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,960
It's not really the software, it's not really the...

964
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,960
I think it's the experience that developers from different distros are trying to convey

965
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,960
to their users.

966
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:14,200
And I think that might be harder to tackle that philosophical issue of getting people

967
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,240
on adopting it than the technical sides of it.

968
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,520
I agree, that could be a big issue.

969
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,960
I understand why Linux is looking at it.

970
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,320
I don't package for Linux.

971
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,640
I mean, I developed the kernel.

972
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,720
I want to use wherever my kernel runs, and that's why he looks at it that way and he's

973
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,160
not packaging it.

974
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:40,280
But to be honest and fair, I think this will eventually become something of the past and

975
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,520
be simple.

976
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,140
If you want to develop an application, you want to target your end users.

977
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,680
Actually currently, if you're developing a server application, chances are you're developing

978
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,840
for Red Hat, OpenSUSE, or something like it.

979
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,640
And if you're trying to get to the end user, you're doing it for Ubuntu.

980
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,640
And that's simple.

981
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,720
You are focusing on an OS.

982
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,720
For now.

983
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:09,320
And having said that, the Docker idea is pretty cool and dandy, but you're just bringing all

984
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,840
your baggage to the desktop of the user.

985
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,880
And that's just assuming that our machines are ready to just take it all.

986
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,400
And yes, we have the hardware right now.

987
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,360
We didn't have in the past, but I think that's completely bloated.

988
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:27,440
It can be fixed in tooling for developers, not necessarily on this.

989
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,160
And to that point, the storage point, the chat room is mentioning, what about ButterFS

990
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,160
storage limitations?

991
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,880
I assume as this gets worked out, storage will go up and those things have to be worked

992
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,880
out too.

993
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,000
I know Heavens wants to jump in and bring this one home.

994
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,360
And then we'll move on to, hey, while package managers are still relevant, there's some

995
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,720
big changes coming that I want to talk about.

996
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,560
But first, let's thank Ting.

997
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,600
Go over to linux.ting.com right now.

998
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,600
Everybody go there.

999
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,600
Linux.ting.com.

1000
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,920
First of all, that'll put Linux in your history.

1001
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,920
Let's be honest.

1002
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,760
Let's put Linux in your browser history, because I know what else is in there.

1003
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,760
And it's not what you want in your history.

1004
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,760
Linux.ting.com.

1005
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,760
Go over there.

1006
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,160
That'll also get you a $25 discount off your first Ting device.

1007
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,440
If you've already got a Ting compatible device and you want to bring it with you, well then

1008
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,440
good news.

1009
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,840
They'll give you a $25 credit for a lot of you out there.

1010
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,160
That gets you more than your first month.

1011
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,260
So why Ting?

1012
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,300
It's mobile that is zero BS.

1013
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,960
You only pay for what you use.

1014
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,480
Ting takes your messages, your megabytes, your minutes, adds them all up at the end

1015
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,440
of the month, whatever bucket you fall into.

1016
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,440
That's what you pay.

1017
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,080
It's flat, $6 for the line, and your usage includes hotspot, tethering, picture message,

1018
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:33,960
caller ID, all the stuff, everything, all of the things, plus more, all controlled by

1019
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,360
an amazing dashboard.

1020
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,720
Ting gives you the controls you need to see exactly where your account's at.

1021
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,840
Maybe turn something off, turn something on, disable voicemail, enable voicemail, set up

1022
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:48,360
caller ID, disable caller ID, all those things exposed for you right there in a crazy easy

1023
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,360
to use interface.

1024
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:54,080
Go over to Linux.ting.com right now and you can check out there's Ting savings calculator.

1025
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:59,720
You put your current usage in that bad mama jam and not like what you pay, but your actual

1026
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,240
usage and just get an idea of what you'd save by switching to Ting.

1027
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,120
If you're listening to this right now between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. Eastern, why not try giving

1028
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:11,120
Ting a call, 1-855-TING-FTW, guess what?

1029
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,240
No hold customer service.

1030
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,540
They'll answer your questions right then and there on the spot.

1031
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,720
It's kind of incredible.

1032
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,720
And if you want to sort of charge up your Ting device, if you're a recent Ting customer,

1033
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:27,560
they just posted a great top five app pick from one of the Ting associates, Ben, and

1034
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,000
he talks about some of his favorite apps for Android.

1035
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,440
He's got Waze on there and a couple of others for those of you in relationships or not in

1036
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,040
relationships too or that one which might break up a relationship.

1037
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,600
He's got a whole list over there on the Ting blog.

1038
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,480
You can go over to Ting.com slash blog, but do me a favor.

1039
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,440
Start by going to Linux.ting.com.

1040
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,040
Linux.ting.com.

1041
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,040
Go grab a device.

1042
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,640
I've got the Nexus 5 on Ting right now and I got multi-ROM on there.

1043
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:56,520
Rekai did and I've got Sailfish OS on that, badmama jamma, Firefox OS on that guy, Ubuntu,

1044
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,560
Touch and Android L all on the Ting system.

1045
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:03,600
It's cool because there's also other Ting customers who are doing the same thing and

1046
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,960
every now and then I chat with them in the Ting forums.

1047
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,760
Yeah, Ting has forums too.

1048
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,260
They have a great community where people are trying out stuff all the time, always pushing

1049
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,260
the envelope.

1050
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,600
Linux.ting.com.

1051
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,300
Go find out why so many of you out there have switched over to Ting and been super happy.

1052
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:20,880
You might just save enough money to buy a new laptop every couple of years.

1053
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,160
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

1054
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,440
All right, heavens, did you want to jump in before we moved off of the new universal package

1055
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,880
format that's going to save all of us proposed by Lenart and the system decabal?

1056
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,440
Oh, may I?

1057
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,080
Yes, sir, you may.

1058
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,360
All right.

1059
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,840
Sounds wonderful.

1060
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:46,560
Well, anyway, this is, okay, what happens if this wasn't from Lenart?

1061
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,080
Would people be more accepting of it or not?

1062
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,640
I would actually be more skeptical.

1063
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,640
Yes.

1064
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,640
Yes.

1065
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:59,700
Well, that too, but there is another situation here which, okay, most of the time or way

1066
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:05,680
back when system D was just coming out, we were saying there is a future here of Linux

1067
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:11,500
that we are going to come to that we have never seen before and guess what?

1068
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:18,000
This is one of those side effects that the creation of system D has spawned.

1069
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,040
It's actually one of those future things that we pretty much need because, what, libraries?

1070
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:29,680
That's a figment of our GCC linking past just because we need to statically or dynamically

1071
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,460
link to a certain library in the system.

1072
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,300
That's pretty much GCC's legacy.

1073
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:41,040
Just as rolling distributions and statically released distributions, this Lackware model

1074
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:45,280
versus the rolling model, I think those are a figment of the past.

1075
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:51,320
This is a very good headway into our future when it comes to partitioning the system.

1076
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:56,540
Even though I'm not very much of a big fan of this butter FS, it just so happens to provide

1077
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:02,360
the technology required in order to make this feasible or at least not insane.

1078
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,880
Yeah, I agree there.

1079
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,360
It does seem like it is a glimpse of the future that kind of has to come and Crossroads-

1080
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,360
And we know.

1081
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,360
Oh, go ahead.

1082
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:16,720
It's really, well, yes, because Lenart, he has the overview of the system which none

1083
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,480
of us have ever seen before because this is the future which we are coming to.

1084
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,280
No one has seen the abstraction level that he has.

1085
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,680
He is at that point.

1086
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:31,440
He's the epitome of where he sees all these distributions and all their problems.

1087
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,540
He's the person at the forefront.

1088
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:41,160
If he can see all these little weird discrepancies and can have a reasonable way or at least

1089
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:47,760
an idea on how to bring us forward, he's in a pretty good position when it comes to his

1090
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,920
position, where he is and what he sees to propose something like this.

1091
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,920
All right.

1092
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,760
So I want to give Crossroads a chance to chime in because he's been waiting.

1093
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,500
Crossroads 2 though, isn't this kind of a big win for Red Hat if all distributions are

1094
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,480
more like Red Hat, then Red Hat wins?

1095
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:13,120
I don't know about that, however, I think we can all acknowledge that this is an issue,

1096
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:19,080
that developing software for Linux is more difficult because of Linux's variety.

1097
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,600
I think we can all recognize that that's an issue.

1098
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,040
Once we realize it's an issue, we have to think who can solve this?

1099
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:32,480
In the Linux community, what in the Linux community can solve this?

1100
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:37,720
Systemd I think is the only thing that can because with the exception of Gentoo and Crux

1101
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:43,440
and a few of those other things, Systemd is on every Linux distribution, is or will be,

1102
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,200
on every Linux distribution.

1103
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:50,120
So if there's going to be one thing that can unite the package management of every Linux

1104
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,160
distribution, it has to be Systemd.

1105
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,720
Yeah, I agree.

1106
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,000
I know that's why I made that joke a few weeks ago in Linux Action Show, it's going to almost

1107
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,240
have to be.

1108
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:05,520
And you almost have to have a company that has some real reason to put that much effort

1109
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,560
into the game, and I think Red Hat is that company.

1110
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,300
Wimpy, I know you wanted to kind of, did you want to touch on anything else before we wrap

1111
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,300
up on the topic?

1112
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:18,520
Yeah, I think Crossroads and Heaven's Revenge have totally hit on the right point here.

1113
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:24,760
For decades, Linux has often been described as a Unix-like operating system.

1114
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,880
It was neither one thing nor the other.

1115
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:33,120
It wasn't, I mean, when I worked at Sun Microsystems, we used to joke that it was Solaris for a

1116
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:35,360
pro and Linux for show.

1117
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,360
Oh.

1118
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,400
Yeah, oh, indeed.

1119
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,280
And I think that what Systemd is doing is it's very clearly setting out the future of

1120
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:51,640
Linux and it's giving Linux its own identity for the first time, a distro agnostic identity.

1121
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:57,600
And Linux and Systemd are going to be the future of our platform, and I think people

1122
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:03,520
are either going to have to choose to adopt it and learn it and like it.

1123
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,840
And maybe now ButterFS is in that.

1124
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,840
Yeah, definitely.

1125
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:12,480
But I mean, I've said that despite ButterFS's foibles, I do use it on my root file system.

1126
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,760
Yeah, that's why I've been using it too.

1127
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,000
I felt like this was coming too.

1128
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,960
Linux has to have a file system with these capabilities, and this entire initiative gives

1129
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:24,720
you some insight as to why it's necessary to have functionality like this to have an

1130
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,840
operating system to overcome these limitations, despite its problems.

1131
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:35,760
Yeah, and I think the only question that leaves to be debated is do we continue calling it

1132
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,760
GNU slash Linux or Systemd slash Linux in the future?

1133
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,760
Ouch.

1134
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,760
Wow.

1135
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,240
We'll wrap the discussion there on that.

1136
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,240
We'll talk some more.

1137
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,600
I know Fred's got some stuff he wants to chime in on.

1138
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,840
We'll do that in the post show, but the show's gone long, even though we didn't get a chance

1139
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,040
to get Aaron in or the DNF discussion.

1140
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,240
And Eric's been looking at DNF too, so maybe we'll just bust that into its own segment

1141
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,200
next week and talk about Fedora's new package manager, because we've got to call it right

1142
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,000
there because I've got to get home.

1143
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,920
But a fascinating conversation.

1144
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,360
If you're curious, go read Lenard's post.

1145
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,120
He wants as many people talking about it as possible right now because I think he acknowledges

1146
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:16,120
to make this work, to make this successful, it's got to have huge community adoption.

1147
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,120
Buy off.

1148
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,200
You thought Systemd had to have big buy off?

1149
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,200
No.

1150
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,200
No.

1151
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,200
I mean, this is right.

1152
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,200
I mean, think about this, Matt.

1153
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,520
Universal package management using the file system across every Linux distribution.

1154
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,960
You just have to have ButterFS support and this version of Linux kernel.

1155
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:32,960
I mean, that's the biggest change ever.

1156
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,320
It sounds awesome, but there's huge changes.

1157
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:39,320
I mean, it's absolutely mountain moving, and it's one of those things to where you can look

1158
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,280
at it seven days from Sunday, and you think you got it all figured out, and then you're

1159
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,280
thinking, oh, wait.

1160
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,280
What if you do that, though?

1161
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,280
Yeah.

1162
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,280
What if you do that other thing?

1163
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,280
Yeah.

1164
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,280
There's so many things.

1165
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,280
How will it work on mobile devices?

1166
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,280
How will it work on embedded systems?

1167
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,280
Exactly.

1168
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,280
All these kinds of questions.

1169
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,840
How will we distribute software to switches running Linux now?

1170
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,840
Yeah.

1171
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,560
It's fascinating, and it's going to be one I think we will probably track for a while

1172
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,440
as it sort of develops and grows.

1173
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,420
And we'll be curious to see, A, if it makes it, and B, how much it changes from this point.

1174
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,200
But I think tonight I'm going to give it another read.

1175
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,240
I've got it saved up to Instapaper, and I'm going to give it a go through.

1176
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,360
But Matt, guess what?

1177
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,480
That brings us to the end of this week's Linux Unplugged.

1178
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,120
Now, I don't know exactly what we've got scheduled for Sunday.

1179
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:23,080
I'm waiting to hear back from a guest, but I already have kind of like a let's get serious

1180
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:28,040
about A, productivity under Linux, but B, how to take the Chromebook and actually make

1181
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,760
all these Chromebooks that are coming out right now a drop-dead awesome Linux experience.

1182
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,280
Not a second-class experience, but an awesome experience.

1183
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,280
How to do that.

1184
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,920
I might cover some of that on the Linux Action Show.

1185
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,080
We've got a whole range of topics, so Matt, I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

1186
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,080
All right.

1187
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,080
See you then.

1188
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,080
All right, everyone.

1189
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,200
Well, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1190
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,200
Don't forget us.

1191
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,200
Join us live.

1192
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,240
We'd love to have you here on a Tuesday over at jblive.tv, jupyterbroadcasting.com, slash

1193
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:54,760
calendar to get in your local time zone, and jupyterbroadcasting.com, slash contact to

1194
01:00:54,760 --> 01:01:00,360
send in your contact info, and jupyterbroadcasting, or also our subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com

1195
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,360
is a great place to go.

1196
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,360
All right, everyone.

1197
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,920
Well, if we don't see you on Sunday for the Linux Action Show, I hope we'll see you right

1198
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:25,800
back here next Tuesday.

1199
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,720
And Fred, why don't you, in the post-show now, get a chance to jump in with what you

1200
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,680
were going to say, because I know you were mentioning you're seeing some problems if

1201
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,000
the distribution's kind of normalized out.

1202
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Yeah.

1203
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,160
First of all, you shouldn't feel that bad.

1204
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,120
I mean, you have to run the show, and for me, it's really no problem if I don't get

1205
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,120
to speak.

1206
01:01:53,120 --> 01:02:00,760
So, first of all, I'd like to say something about Linux, or at least how I see the whole

1207
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,360
distribution thing, you know, spanning out.

1208
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:09,960
So essentially, it's free software and open source is an evolutionary type of thing, yeah?

1209
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,040
So made the best win, yeah?

1210
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:17,920
And distribution's essentially branched off to solve different kinds of problems, to sort

1211
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,200
of even solve the same problems in different kinds of ways.

1212
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,720
And it's time to converge back by taking the best of each, right?

1213
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:33,920
So you know, it's really not a problem if they all just converge back, right, into a

1214
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,160
single system.

1215
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:39,160
It's actually a good thing, because we get the best of each of them.

1216
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,160
That's a good perspective.

1217
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,160
I like that.

1218
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,160
Yeah.

1219
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,280
I actually think it's like the natural course of things, right?

1220
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,200
It is the sort of organic evolution that open source seems to take, where it sort of forks

1221
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,200
out the strongest survive, and then it gets reincorporated, and we kind of focus on that

1222
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,200
thing.

1223
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,200
Exactly.

1224
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,200
Exactly.

1225
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:01,320
And also, on that point, you have so much of the differentiation between the different

1226
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,960
distributions is the low-level plumbing that defines them.

1227
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,800
So ultimately, it's the package manager and the release cycle.

1228
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:15,720
If you take package management and release cycles out of the equation, and Upstream is

1229
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:24,680
now responsible for distributing their binary subvolume, the distributions are going to

1230
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:30,960
have to focus on the end user experience to differentiate from one another, rather than

1231
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,320
technical masturbation.

1232
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,320
Yeah.

1233
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:34,320
Yeah.

1234
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,320
And philosophy and things like that.

1235
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,240
Oh, I wanted to give, before we go too far there, I meant to give a quick plug to Aaron

1236
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,240
Saigo.

1237
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,240
He has a Patreon page up.

1238
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:48,200
He is bringing back Illumination of Free Software, kind of like a talk show discussion show.

1239
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,400
He's going to have it structured.

1240
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,400
He's looking for backers.

1241
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:57,000
You can go to patreon.com slash L-O-F-S, and I'm a backer, and he's got a video up there

1242
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,880
talking about what he wants to do.

1243
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:04,160
And we talk a lot about getting good open source coverage, and I think the thing about

1244
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:10,640
a Patreon campaign, just like a Kickstarter, you can back a Kickstarter and get absolutely

1245
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,160
nothing, or you can back a Kickstarter and actually get the product, and I think it depends

1246
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,720
on who's running the project.

1247
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,360
I think if anybody's going to be able to pull it off, it's Aaron.

1248
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,160
I think if he sees success with it, he'll keep at it.

1249
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:24,040
So go over to patreon.com slash L-O-F-S, and kick him a few over on Patreon if you want

1250
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,040
to.

1251
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,040
I wanted to give him a plug for that.

1252
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,200
In other words, we're going to have him on the show, but we had some mumble connection

1253
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,200
problems.

1254
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,200
Okay.

1255
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,040
So what about the fact that this is powered by ButterFS?

1256
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,840
That does seem to be the elephant in the room that we're just kind of glossing over.

1257
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,840
Yes.

1258
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:39,840
Sorry, Fred.

1259
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,840
Go on.

1260
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:50,560
No, I have a much bigger problem here, and so Leonard is the guy who should be doing

1261
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,560
this.

1262
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,560
I absolutely agree.

1263
01:04:52,560 --> 01:05:02,040
I think he has the view and everything, but the problems he tackles usually, they're quite

1264
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,040
big.

1265
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,040
They're complex.

1266
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:11,580
They're made of many small parts, and he has always a grand vision, but never a stepwise

1267
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:14,720
vision for solving something.

1268
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:20,180
He never gave out like, okay, now we're solving this little piece, and then that little piece

1269
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,960
on top of that, and so on.

1270
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,840
He just goes out and says, I'm groundbreaking.

1271
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,960
I'm changing everything, and it's good for everybody.

1272
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,280
Might be good for some people, might not be good for some people.

1273
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:38,040
Until this day, I've been running Arch with systemd on my laptop, and I have some serious

1274
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:44,040
problems because I encrypt, so I raid my encrypted partitions.

1275
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:49,800
I don't encrypt my raided partitions, and systemd does not handle that properly.

1276
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:54,400
So there are special cases where, sorry?

1277
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,760
It actually does if you handle the dependencies correctly for your file system startup, if

1278
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:08,160
systemd is in your init read, although I don't think Arch has systemd in the init read.

1279
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,440
So I've read quite a bit.

1280
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,760
I have went on the systemd IRC channel asking, I've read a lot of the documentation.

1281
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,400
My system starts up fine.

1282
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,960
It does not shut down properly.

1283
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:26,660
And then actually for debugging shutdown, by the way, I have to log to a text file.

1284
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:30,160
So I'm back to CSV init style of logging.

1285
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:34,400
I cannot use journal CTL for some reason, this journal D stuff.

1286
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:40,400
So there is a huge fuss, and then there is this one corner case that maybe somebody did

1287
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,560
or didn't think about, and that he didn't manage to cover or systemd didn't manage to

1288
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,400
cover or think about it somehow.

1289
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,920
And this is the kind of problem we have in today's technology.

1290
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,200
And Linux is going to turn into Windows if we keep doing this stuff.

1291
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,200
Windows works fine.

1292
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,200
No, I'm serious.

1293
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,200
I'm serious.

1294
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:04,680
Because Windows works fine for the general case, not for the corner cases, right?

1295
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:13,520
And this is why Linux was so flexible and susceptible on a use case basis.

1296
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,160
That's why it worked fine for so many technical people.

1297
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:21,720
But if we're going to keep skipping those, skipping that, we're really going to end up

1298
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,720
quite badly.

1299
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:28,160
I also, I think I want to, you know, blackout24 in the chat room brings a good point that

1300
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,920
it's not just a Lennart effort.

1301
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,560
I think he's the name that has clicked the most with everybody because it does add some

1302
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,720
credibility to the effort in a sense.

1303
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:43,280
But I don't want to, but I guess I don't want to over-cult a personality, this thing, too,

1304
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,280
because it is not just his thing.

1305
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:50,200
However, let's not kid ourselves, he will become, if it's successful, he'll have to

1306
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,400
become the figurehead of this, and it will become Lennart's baby.

1307
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,520
Well, he's done it before, he might be able to do it again.

1308
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:00,880
Well, he's just, simply put, he's one of the most followed online.

1309
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,840
He's one of the most well-spoken from like a, he'll come at you with a technical rebuttal

1310
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:10,540
that is both scathing but yet also technically accurate, so therefore hard to quibble with.

1311
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:13,680
He's really good at that, and he's got the name brand.

1312
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:20,080
So I mean, this is not a Lennart quote-unquote initiative, but I think by the end of it,

1313
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,080
it'll look like one.

1314
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,080
Well, you know-

1315
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,080
A lot of the time.

1316
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,080
Go ahead.

1317
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:30,040
I just think this trend continues forward is that we keep seeing innovation starting

1318
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:34,640
around the Red Hat Fedora-type people like Lennart.

1319
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:40,080
So I just wanted to point that out, that's pretty interesting.

1320
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,400
I wonder if our pace of development is getting a little bit too quick in a way that scares

1321
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,880
most of our technical users now.

1322
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,120
Oh, one Linux that fits all is not bad.

1323
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,120
I'd say-

1324
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,480
Well, you know, that's the thing that we have.

1325
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,520
Our problem that we have so far is our variety.

1326
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,860
A lot of people bitch about there's too much choice in Linux.

1327
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:01,480
This helps, you know, unify.

1328
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,480
Just choose a district.

1329
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,480
A lot of people just like the village.

1330
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:07,440
I mean, I think part of the problem, I think we are part of the problem each time that

1331
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,480
we go and we say we're using Linux.

1332
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,440
I mean, seriously, I'm not coming for the GNU plus Linux thing.

1333
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:18,280
I'm just saying you use a distribution and the distribution represents a whole set of

1334
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:22,600
things, not only the kernel, they could actually change.

1335
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,880
That shouldn't matter to you.

1336
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:28,560
When you're using your computer, like for us technical people, yes, we care about it,

1337
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:34,120
but let's face it, a regular user comes to the desktop and he doesn't know or care about

1338
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:38,440
what kernel is in there, what is going on on the background.

1339
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,320
If it's called Unity, if it's called Gnome, they don't care.

1340
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:42,320
They care.

1341
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:46,440
It works for them and that's the experience they want and that experience is under a name

1342
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,280
of the distribution.

1343
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:56,120
That's the name you go for and if you do that, a lot of the issues of, oh, it's so fragmented,

1344
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,420
just don't exist.

1345
01:09:57,420 --> 01:09:58,720
That exists for us.

1346
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:03,520
We like to bitch about it, but let's face it, the user doesn't care.

1347
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,960
The user just wants it to work.

1348
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:11,920
Also, if we don't allow for change, if we don't allow for innovation, we can't move

1349
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,920
forward.

1350
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,920
Of course, but just a minute.

1351
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,800
Let's turn off distro so it can always happen.

1352
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:25,340
He can do it in the distro he's on and if people in there like it, some people like

1353
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:31,840
everything else, when it proves useful and it proves to be worthy, it appears on others'

1354
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:32,840
distros.

1355
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,840
It can work.

1356
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:34,840
Yes.

1357
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,840
Thank you.

1358
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,840
Thank you.

1359
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,440
I'm trying to avoid the whole celebrity hacking topic because it's funny, not to even get

1360
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:46,760
into the body parts aspect of the celebrity hacking, but I feel like so much of what we've

1361
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:51,640
been talking about, building your own cloud, Team Fortress Chris or going with own cloud

1362
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:56,560
or SyncThing or BitTorrent Sync and all of the encryption and all of this stuff and then

1363
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,880
you just have this huge story that drops, this sort of the personification of all of

1364
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,560
the stuff that we've been a little worried about, people have been a little nervous about

1365
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,840
and it has flavors.

1366
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,640
If you zoom out and look at the meta story, it has flavors of NSA spying and now it's

1367
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,640
a new angle.

1368
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,640
Look at that.

1369
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,920
It has flavors of personal privacy and protection.

1370
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,200
It has flavors of controlling your own data.

1371
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:22,280
It has flavors of what the responsibility of these new corporate overlords that are

1372
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:26,160
sort of forcing you into these new systems and these new ecosystems that just do this

1373
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:30,560
stuff for you and at the same time, one of their marketing messages is, don't worry about

1374
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,680
how it works.

1375
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,880
That's the selling point.

1376
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,000
You never have to think about it, which then encourages exactly these kinds of things to

1377
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,800
happen.

1378
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,280
So I think it's a huge meta story.

1379
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:46,800
So yes, there's girly parts that are involved and of course, there has to be that adolescent

1380
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:51,280
aspect to it that sort of gives it the traction, but I think when you take that away from it

1381
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:55,280
and look at more of the violation and privacy aspect of it and the implications that this,

1382
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:00,440
I mean, this is happening to very public figures and so the reaction is very public and a lot

1383
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,480
of people are talking about it and a lot are aware of it, but I was just saying a little

1384
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:09,160
while ago that if you actually follow the news on this kind of stuff, this kind of thing

1385
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:14,020
happens almost on a weekly basis on a much smaller scale and usually it involves kids

1386
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:18,040
and it involves a high school and the shaming of someone and then that someone either sometimes

1387
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,160
gets suicidal or they have to leave the school.

1388
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:28,440
There is a very real life aspect to this story and I think sometimes when we start talking

1389
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,640
about it from a technical aspect, we'll talk about it from a, oh, well, they need local

1390
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:37,400
encryption or we need transparency or the solution is open source code that can be publicly

1391
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:43,080
audited, but we forget about the fact that on a much smaller scale and probably realistic

1392
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,720
on a daily basis really, if you think about the amount of devices around the world that

1393
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:51,060
are out there that this kind of stuff happens on, there is probably these kinds of violations

1394
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:55,360
going on almost daily, but this story has given us the opportunity to actually stop

1395
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:01,440
and think about it because it involves people with names we know and faces we recognize.

1396
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:11,120
Although these women have had an egregious privacy breach for which there is no apology

1397
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:16,480
by anybody, I'm not so sure they were the target of this.

1398
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:22,520
Do you not think that Apple were actually the target of this in that this is, the timing

1399
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,920
of this seems to be very precise?

1400
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:29,680
Oh, snaps, look at you wimpy busting out the conspiracy bacon, very nice, sir, very nice.

1401
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,680
Where's this bacon from?

1402
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:40,520
Well, okay, so they're about to have their big unveil, this is Apple's time of the year.

1403
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,920
They're going to introduce a new payment system supposedly partnered with Visa, MasterCard

1404
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:50,640
and American Express, right, built on NFC, probably connected to your iTunes account,

1405
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,640
I'm sure.

1406
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:58,320
Yeah, and you look at the scale of what was disclosed improperly, this wasn't something

1407
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,640
that just happened overnight, this must have taken weeks of planning.

1408
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:02,640
Yeah, I agree, I agree.

1409
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:08,520
So I think that the timing of this is very deliberate and I think it's designed to embarrass

1410
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,600
Apple.

1411
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:14,040
So it definitely accomplishes those things, it publicly shames famous people for using

1412
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:19,160
iProducts, which is something that, you know, it's one of these things where you'll see

1413
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:23,800
like Samsung will pay a celebrity to take a selfie and like Ellen, for example, she'll

1414
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,480
be out on stage, she'll take a selfie with the Samsung camera and then she goes backstage

1415
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:30,520
and tweets about it on her iPhone and that drives people crazy.

1416
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:34,720
So wimpy, are you implying then that this was orchestrated by someone?

1417
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:39,760
Well, I don't know who it might have been orchestrated by, but I'm wondering if the

1418
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:47,480
motivations of the individuals behind it was to sort of slander Apple and use some salacious

1419
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,360
means in order to accomplish that.

1420
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:54,480
Maybe it was an activist that wanted to derail the centralization of the payment system,

1421
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,480
right?

1422
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,040
Maybe it was like...

1423
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:03,400
Possibly that or possibly it's just simpler, I don't like Apple and I'm going to, you know,

1424
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:11,040
show them in a bad light because I want product X to win, you know, the mobile wars.

1425
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:16,440
I'm watching a video of my daughter right now on the baby monitor at home.

1426
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:21,280
I think that bacon was brought to you from Frank's meat market in Black Diamond, Washington.

1427
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,280
Ha ha.

1428
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,280
Oh, man.

1429
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:32,960
Well, yeah, I think that reasoning about us as activists or just a few people because

1430
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:39,600
the nature of the simplicity of the brute force and it doesn't look like there's been

1431
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,160
that huge of a technical effort behind it.

1432
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,160
Right.

1433
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:50,080
But also the other reason why I think this is an attack, I'm not sure if that's the right

1434
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:57,800
word, an attack on Apple is looking at some of the files that were taken, it's implied

1435
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:04,040
that other storage, you know, cloud storage platforms were potentially compromised.

1436
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:08,240
But those cloud storage platforms haven't been mentioned.

1437
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,920
They've very squarely pinned this on iCloud.

1438
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:16,360
I do recognize that as well, but I also I've noticed just in the tech news industry, quote

1439
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:22,240
unquote, if you can even frickin call it that, if the story has Apple, you put that in the

1440
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,500
headline.

1441
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,200
It does not matter anything else.

1442
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:30,360
Because A, headlines are of limited length and B, it seems Apple headlines drive traffic.

1443
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:36,440
If you put Microsoft, you could put Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon, Google, eBay in the headline

1444
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,720
and they still drive less traffic than when you put Apple in the headline.

1445
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:43,720
So I think that might explain that aspect of it, is that's just the click baiting nature

1446
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,400
of the tech media.

1447
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:52,160
But yeah, I mean, I think also if it is a simple, if it is truly as simple as a password

1448
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:58,920
breach and perhaps aided by an inadequate lockout timer after a certain amount of invalid

1449
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:03,200
attempts, then this is truly something that could affect any cloud service.

1450
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:08,720
Because for example, if I have a script and a computer and time on my hands and say Dropbox

1451
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:14,040
allows me to do nine invalid login attempts, on the 10th attempt it locks my account, well

1452
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:18,240
then I would just make a script that tries to log into Jennifer Lawrence's Dropbox account

1453
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:22,720
nine times and then sleeps for the hour or whatever it needs to sleep and then tries

1454
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:25,660
another nine and I would let that sucker run for a year.

1455
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:29,840
Just like people Bitcoin mine when they get nothing because if you get anything at all,

1456
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,360
it's going to be such a payday, it's totally worth it.

1457
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:36,800
So yes, it absolutely makes a difference if you rate limit the login attempts.

1458
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:42,280
Fundamentally though, if these kinds of things, something this private, something this important

1459
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:46,700
is being protected by a password and a password alone, I think that's a failure of the system

1460
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:51,880
and I think you can give some of the blame to the user for using a dictionary password.

1461
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:56,360
But I'll tell you guys, I've been guessing people's passwords since I was literally in

1462
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,360
elementary school.

1463
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,760
I figured out my teacher's password just by looking around at their pictures.

1464
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,520
I've been doing it for years.

1465
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,520
Nobody has changed.

1466
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:08,760
I mean, I am, I'm getting to be an old person now and I'm telling you for 20 years now,

1467
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:12,560
human beings have been using the most ridiculous, 25 years, people have been using the most

1468
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:17,020
ridiculous passwords to log into their computers and that has not fundamentally changed.

1469
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:20,580
And you know, it's funny because people think they're really good at picking passwords and

1470
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:23,920
they think they're really clever, but I've been able to figure out my mother's passwords,

1471
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:24,920
my father's passwords.

1472
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,140
I won't say other people's passwords that might be listening, I've been able to figure

1473
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:28,560
out teacher's passwords.

1474
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:35,120
Human beings are not good at picking passwords unless you are educated on how to do it.

1475
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:41,840
The nature of this attack was to use the find my iPhone, which I believe you need to supply

1476
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,920
an email account and a password combination.

1477
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:52,200
And once you get a valid credential, just think how many systems that can unlock, bearing

1478
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:56,840
in mind the majority of people use the same password everywhere.

1479
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:02,720
Email accounts are often used as the assert your identity field.

1480
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:08,320
So you've now got an email account and password and you can just go around trying that Google

1481
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,000
Dropbox and everywhere else.

1482
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,280
Well for most of those, you don't even need to try the password, you just need the email.

1483
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,880
Because you take your email and you go to whatever the service is and go, I forgot my

1484
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,880
password.

1485
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,540
I mean, that's one of the brutal things about current online identity is that it's built

1486
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:32,520
around your email and maybe your phone, two things which are remarkably easy to get your

1487
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,520
hands on.

1488
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,520
Right.

1489
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,520
And especially when you have physical access.

1490
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,800
Like if you can sit at somebody's desk and you go to any website that they ever visit

1491
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:45,080
and the chances are, even if that website's logged in, their Gmail or Yahoo or AOL Mail

1492
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,720
is logged in and you just initiate a password reset.

1493
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:51,060
It sends the email to a tab they might already have open on their computer.

1494
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:52,060
You open up the email.

1495
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:54,720
I mean, it's ridiculously easy to do this.

1496
01:19:54,720 --> 01:20:00,580
We talk about this constantly on TechSnap because people really, really, really underestimate

1497
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:03,480
the quote-unquote value of their email inbox.

1498
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:05,360
And really, that's where it's all at.

1499
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:10,040
And I think too, we have to ask ourselves if you can't consider a service secure unless

1500
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,880
it requires more than a password.

1501
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:16,880
And would it be ridiculous, A, for a company to require two-factor, and B, if any company

1502
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,560
could pull it off, wouldn't it kind of be Apple?

1503
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,760
I mean, they do all kinds of stuff that's just like, you can't do that, and then all

1504
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,320
of a sudden it becomes normal.

1505
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:29,400
What if Apple required to make iCloud changes like this, touch ID and a password?

1506
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:35,080
If you have an Apple device that has touch ID, then they just require you use that as

1507
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,340
a form of two-factor authentication.

1508
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,340
They could do it.

1509
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,340
Yeah.

1510
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:43,800
At least what I see among my peers and people that I know is the reason they, how they justify

1511
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:48,340
using the same password and the same weak password is because they think, oh, no one

1512
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:52,320
will attack me, or no one will ask me.

1513
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,320
Yeah.

1514
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,320
I'm not important enough.

1515
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,320
Yeah.

1516
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,440
But they don't realize it's not them that someone's going to try to hack.

1517
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:02,640
They're going to attack Facebook or some site they have an account on, get all those accounts

1518
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,840
and then automate the attacks against everyone else.

1519
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:05,840
Right.

1520
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:06,840
Yeah.

1521
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,840
Yeah.

1522
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,840
Yeah.

1523
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,200
Then everybody just gets swept up in it.

1524
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,560
So back to the app thing that you mentioned about, they could do it.

1525
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:18,240
What would be their motive, like what would motivate them to do this?

1526
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,240
Marketing?

1527
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,960
I mean, it's a good marketing point, right?

1528
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,560
So two reasons why I think Apple could be the company to do it.

1529
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:31,480
One, because they'll do things that seem almost like suicidal sometimes, like they'll launch

1530
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,840
a product that kills another product of their own.

1531
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,920
The other reason is because they're not making money off the monetization of the data.

1532
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,440
They're making money off the monetization of the hardware.

1533
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:44,000
So Google and Microsoft, both of them monetize the data for advertising purposes, but Google's

1534
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
way beyond that.

1535
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,040
We all understand that.

1536
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:49,600
So Google, for example, even though they're working on encryption for Gmail, I would be

1537
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,560
pretty impressed if they ever actually encrypted the actual email contents that they couldn't

1538
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:57,800
read themselves, because then they lose out on a huge AdWords opportunity that would probably

1539
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,820
literally cost them millions of dollars.

1540
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:04,740
But Apple, if they can't read my data, if it's impossible for them, if it's encrypted

1541
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:10,960
at the operating system level on the device using their 64 bit fancy processor, they lose

1542
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:11,960
nothing.

1543
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:12,960
It doesn't cost them a dollar.

1544
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:13,960
Wouldn't that take longer to send the message though?

1545
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:14,960
I mean, that would be, you know, one of the, it's not acceptable.

1546
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,960
It's just not a sexy feature.

1547
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:28,880
It wouldn't be a time thing, but I'll tell you what, after what's happened, it's a sexy

1548
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,880
feature now.

1549
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,800
Well, maybe, maybe.

1550
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:35,240
I was hoping the NSA stuff would make it a sexy feature, but that seems to have sort

1551
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,240
of petered out.

1552
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,240
Most iPhone users don't care.

1553
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:41,120
I mean, they just don't care.

1554
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:44,240
Most people I know really don't, it doesn't matter to them.

1555
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:45,240
They don't care.

1556
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:50,080
The thing about my generation is that we've grown up with Facebook and we've grown up

1557
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,680
with sharing everything about ourselves.

1558
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:57,680
So most of us, and I'm not included in that, but most of us really, it doesn't matter to

1559
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,520
us if our information is out there.

1560
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,320
Maybe to an extent, but so take one of these friends you're talking about.

1561
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,960
They care if all of a sudden their dick's on the internet.

1562
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:05,960
Yeah.

1563
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:10,720
Although, as long as their dick isn't on the internet, they'll just say, oh, he shouldn't

1564
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,720
have done that.

1565
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,720
Right.

1566
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:16,400
So anytime a dick or a booby gets on the internet, I think it brings it a little more home.

1567
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:20,720
Because now it's somebody you know, it's a face you recognize, it's a body part.

1568
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,720
It's not an abstract concept anymore.

1569
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,360
It's a dick or a booby.

1570
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:29,920
And I think that is more powerful than an abstract PowerPoint presentation published

1571
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,800
by The Guardian.

1572
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,800
That is true.

1573
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:38,840
So maybe in regards to the nudes they're sending, sure that might get them to care a little,

1574
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:44,980
but especially about all the stuff that Google collects, it doesn't matter to them that everyone

1575
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:47,720
has a huge database on their life.

1576
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:54,660
I bet amongst Joe Public, this story has resonated more and made them think more about their

1577
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:59,920
own personal privacy and how they use their, not just Apple devices, but how they use these

1578
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:05,480
devices than anything that was disclosed by Snowden and The Guardian over the last 18

1579
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,480
months.

1580
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,480
Yeah.

1581
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:11,400
My favorite day weekend here in the United States was millions of US consumers going

1582
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,200
through and purging their photo streams.

1583
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:17,000
And then there's the other half of them that were actually going and looking for those

1584
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
other photos.

1585
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Right.

1586
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,920
And I'm thinking, hey, you know, maybe I should be taking, that was my thought process, hey,

1587
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,220
maybe I should take some nudie photos.

1588
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:24,560
And how would I do that exactly?

1589
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,560
Polaroid.

1590
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:26,560
That's what I was thinking.

1591
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:27,560
Just grab a Polaroid.

1592
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,560
If you want to succeed, you've got to have a sex tape.

1593
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,560
That's the thing.

1594
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:33,920
Jupiter broadcasts can really be catapulted into the spotlight, but not in the right spotlight.

1595
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:37,920
I feel like a calendar train wreck out of me.

1596
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,920
All right.

1597
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:44,720
At work, when Heartbleed hit, I just quietly went about the business of patching our stuff.

1598
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:48,160
And then at the next board meeting, I said, you know, there was this thing and did you

1599
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:49,520
hear about it?

1600
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,160
Nobody knew what I was talking about.

1601
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,160
Really?

1602
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:56,160
We weren't affected in the first place, but we've done the necessary things.

1603
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:59,880
Today, my boss comes up to me and says, can I have a word with you for a minute?

1604
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:00,880
And I say, yeah, sure.

1605
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:06,120
I go into his office and he says, so what do you know about this iCloud hack with all

1606
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:07,680
of these celebrities?

1607
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,240
Really?

1608
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,240
So it is great.

1609
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,240
So I think this story resonates.

1610
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,240
Heartbleed knows not so much.

1611
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,240
Not on the radar.

1612
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,240
No.

1613
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:16,880
But then this, everyone wants to know.

1614
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:17,880
Well, there you go.

1615
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,240
It's got everyone's attention.

1616
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:22,880
It's another reason to brag about that you have an iPhone.

1617
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:28,520
Boobies bring us life and maybe they'll finally bring us some privacy and concern about security.

1618
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:32,200
I feel really bad for those gals that, the women that had to have this happen.

1619
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,200
Oh, I do too.

1620
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,560
I can't imagine if that were like my wife or whoever.

1621
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:36,680
I know.

1622
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:37,960
It's really awful.

1623
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,840
I think it's important to remember it's not just them it happens to.

1624
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:46,600
It's happening on a smaller scale that is affecting lives all the time.

1625
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:51,240
We can't do a lot in our position, but as advocates of free software and as folks, I

1626
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:55,320
think a lot of you in the audience are those of you who work with your friends and family

1627
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,440
to help them do these things.

1628
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:02,220
You have an opportunity to at least help the people around you, show them alternatives.

1629
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:04,280
Don't be heavy handed about it.

1630
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,280
My mom's using iCloud.

1631
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,280
I let her go ahead.

1632
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,280
Mom, have at it.

1633
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,280
Whatever.

1634
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,240
But if you want an alternative, I'm there to help you set it up.

1635
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:11,240
It's more secure.

1636
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:12,240
Here's the benefits.

1637
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,460
We don't have to be heavy handed about it.

1638
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:18,600
But as folks in our position, I think we do have some opportunity if we want to engage

1639
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,840
in it to help people with this.

1640
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:21,840
Yeah.

1641
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,680
I was just thinking back, it was a couple of years ago, I saw this on ABC.

1642
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,520
There was this girl who got hacked.

1643
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:31,680
She was like maybe 14 years old at the time.

1644
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:35,320
And her life was essentially ruined by all these pictures that she was taking for her

1645
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:40,880
boyfriend who I believe she's now engaged to or something or at the time of the thing.

1646
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:45,320
And they were kind of risque photos in a lot of cases.

1647
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,720
And her life was ruined from that point.

1648
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:53,560
Everybody, once her account got hacked, her high school friends spread all over the internet

1649
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:58,720
and her high school friends called her a slut and whatnot.

1650
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:02,120
And she probably wasn't that way.

1651
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:05,400
But the fact that they were treating her that way is just sad.

1652
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:08,880
And a young person is probably not properly emotionally equipped to deal with it either,

1653
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,880
which is sort of the unfortunate part.

1654
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:11,880
Exactly.

1655
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,760
The withdrawal from school and everything.

1656
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:15,960
This happens every day.

1657
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:19,720
And a lot of people don't understand that and don't recognize it.

1658
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:25,520
And I hate that it took a celebrity gang hacked, or several celebrities, I guess, before this

1659
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,440
became a public problem.

1660
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:29,980
It's like natural disasters.

1661
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:34,520
People don't care until it happens to them, unless they have sympathy.

1662
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:39,180
We're kind of a martyr for our security systems at the moment.

1663
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:44,020
And at least right now, we know there's a problem or at least normal jails of America

1664
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:48,680
and hopefully the world because it's not just America celebrities that got used here in

1665
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,160
this situation.

1666
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:53,880
The world's, or at least a lot of different countries, got involved in this.

1667
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:58,240
At least everyone will know that there's a problem that needs to be fixed versus just

1668
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:04,240
the ladies being exposed or used for this sort of publicity.

1669
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:07,960
I just hope we don't have an overreaction from the political side of the spectrum, but

1670
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:08,960
we'll see.

1671
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,960
Now, I think we'll leave it at that.

1672
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:19,960
I think we've probably said enough.
