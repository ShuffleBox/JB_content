1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Did you guys see the Amazon echo?

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,420
The Amazon echoes really something and there's been some really really great parodies and I want to play one of my favorite Amazon echo parodies

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,420
For you, it's pretty fantastic

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:23,220
What are you doing there? What is it? Is it for me? It's for everyone

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,660
Is it on? It's always on

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:38,340
Can it hear me right now? It can hear you from anywhere in the room. I've put wrapping paper on your shopping list

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,340
So what day is it?

8
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,640
Today is Thursday, November 13th eight minutes starting now. I

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,560
Can play music answer questions get the news and weather create to do this

10
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,440
Much more

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,300
Wow introducing Amazon echo she's listening. I wonder why they didn't just call it echo

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,960
creepy, yeah

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,200
Everyone's being harsh on it, but it's like it's kind of interesting. Yeah, I thought it I actually

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,560
Was kind of impressed like it doesn't look like it has a guy over ambitious feature set. No. Well, it's pretty

15
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,720
Pretty I mean it so who doesn't want Jarvis, right? Everybody wants everybody wants to be Tony Stark with Jarvis

16
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,720
Everybody wants the enterprise computer in their house

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,680
Obviously, I want to be in my studio and I want to say

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,760
Obviously, I want to be in my studio and I want to say, you know

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
Alexia or computer or Jarvis or whatever

20
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,360
Whatever it is, you know set the temperature in the other room to 75 degrees turn the TV to this channel and you know

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,240
Whatever and by the time I walk out there the TVs are ready to go and stuff like that

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:01,240
Obviously that would be amazing. But this thing what does this do the Google now can't do and it's always with you in every single

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,160
Great. No, it's not about that. It's about that being a device that does that

24
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't know of any because I went around I looked yeah, as soon as I saw it

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,480
I thought I don't really want Amazon's thing. I'd rather have the Google one, but I looked around it's like wait a minute

26
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,280
There is none. Yeah, it's really about my device. It's a

27
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
culture phone

28
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
I

29
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,800
Understand where you're coming from, but there's no sit-in-house device that I can just sit down

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Yeah, that's

31
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Well a tablet

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,040
Yeah, but you know something you can plug in and use and kind of just have stand there as a little piece

33
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,360
I've got yeah, I've got a couple of couple of questions

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,800
The first is is this available in the US now and has anyone got one it is available. I believe I

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Know I don't leave. Okay

36
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,240
I don't feel like buying one. So I didn't even bother

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,360
Yeah, you have to go and sign up on the list and then they'll let I think it was a hundred people of

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Hundred or so. I can't remember

39
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,560
As anyone as anyone in here got an Amazon fire TV

40
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,280
Now that I will probably be getting for the studio in a little while. I have a few

41
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,240
Friends who told me they are pretty good, but I don't have that they're not just they're not just pretty good

42
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,080
They're damn storming amazing

43
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:26,040
Yeah, but I was gonna say one of the features on the Amazon TV is voice recognition and it makes it makes the Google voice

44
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,500
Recognition look like amateur hour. It is absolutely amazing. How can that be because what I don't know, but it's so good

45
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,160
Well, no, I mean think about what Google does to get their voice

46
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,060
Yeah, that is a shame if if Amazon

47
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,540
I mean, where would Amazon Amazon doesn't have millions of voice samples a day. Where's Amazon getting this from?

48
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,940
Alone is creepy because that means it's gotta be the fire tablets or no, maybe they're just licensing nuance

49
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,780
Maybe it's because so many people have the fire phone

50
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,020
But we've handed the remote around in the house between different people who've got different voice cadence

51
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,140
So different sexes and this thing just works every single time never misses a beat

52
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,020
It's absolutely brilliant daredevil and says he seems to know it though. What is it?

53
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,420
They have two things. First is they have actually very good machine learning algorithms, which they already use

54
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,020
to know what to buy and

55
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,780
They've been investing actually hiring on that department. Okay for a while. It's in-house

56
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,340
And the there's I'm not sure if it's totally in-house, but they hired people at least

57
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:51,340
And during these last year, they've been hiring all like a lot of people in this area machine learning algorithms and natural language processing

58
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,780
Okay, and they also have another service they do is something like

59
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:03,200
Actually persons go in surveying something. I'm not sure on the specifics, but it's some sort of service that it's to

60
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,640
Get people to audit sites and things like that

61
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,520
So I'm figuring that the process of getting some data from them and shouldn't be too hard. Hmm. Yeah

62
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:21,560
Actually, it's the problem with the actual natural language processing now isn't really getting samples anymore. It's actually

63
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,580
You know being able to

64
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,120
Have an algorithm that can understand. Yeah

65
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:36,600
I was just gonna say that the Amazon voice recognition is excellent

66
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
And whilst Amazon might understand

67
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,760
My buying habits and preferences because it's basically a narrow field of science fiction titles when I hand the remote to my wife

68
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,280
Who's into romantic comedies it picks up and understands everything she's asking for just fine

69
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,380
You know, I suppose in that sense if they know maybe the context is movie titles

70
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,380
Right that really narrows the scope

71
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:05,780
Because because it's it's movies television music apps and a whole load of other stuff

72
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:11,860
I'll tell you the only the only trick that Amazon have missed and this is the one thing about the Amazon fire TV that I

73
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:19,220
Really irritates is that they've that they've walled off this brilliant feature of voice search

74
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,100
from all of the other providers

75
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,100
So you

76
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,820
Yeah

77
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,340
Exactly, so you can

78
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:33,580
And you can install Netflix, but when you go and ask it to go and search for the walking dead

79
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,660
Yeah, it will only search Amazon

80
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:43,340
It won't go to any other places and that's that and that is just such a fail because you can see why Amazon are doing it

81
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:49,060
But they're doing it for all the wrong reasons. Oh, of course they are but they're gonna be very successful at it. Yeah, but

82
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,660
Everything else about it is is it's just brilliant. It's it's

83
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:59,040
Replaced our Roku in the front room. Yeah, that's what I was thinking too is it might be our Roku

84
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,940
And and it's actually a half decent gaming machine as well as you know, I'm not much of a gamer

85
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,820
So I'm probably not a good reference candidate here

86
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:12,620
But I play games on my Amazon fire TV now and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best thing I've ever had so

87
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,860
Wimpy once we get into the show a little bit

88
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:21,620
We got a little something we're gonna tell people about I don't don't say anything but a little something something. Yeah

89
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,620
All right. We'll do that a little bit in the show

90
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:34,020
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's loaded with protein and which is a very grateful

91
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:39,180
Happy Veterans Day to all the vets in the audience. My name is Chris and my name is Matt

92
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,100
Hey there Matt, happy Veterans Day to all the vets like we say and Matt. Happy Tuesday to yourself

93
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,100
And happy Tuesday

94
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,020
I know I feel like such a slacker on this this is like the day of the year that I feel like the biggest slacker

95
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,620
Ever doesn't matter how hard I work or how many hours I feel like today. I've been a slacker

96
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,620
So I went out and to celebrate I got I got one of those monster breakfasts

97
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:07,220
Where it's so much breakfast that you don't eat for pretty much until dinner and I'm still good. I got steak and eggs Matt. Oh

98
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:14,100
It was nice. Oh Matt. Oh, it was a really there's just there's Tuesdays have been good eat days

99
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
I guess so I'm ready to go

100
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,180
You know, hopefully

101
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:25,180
Hopefully we will avoid the flames in today's episode. We're gonna follow up on the Firefox challenge run through some of the

102
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
experiences and challenges that I had

103
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,660
We've got something really fun coming up towards the end of the show and we're also gonna discuss this whole gnome

104
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:40,300
Versus Groupon over the trademark where that's at right now what Groupon's been saying and how much damn money

105
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,220
The gnome foundation has raised a lot of stuff plus we've got a ton of great feedback

106
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:52,340
Going on in today's episode. So I think probably the best thing to do is arm ourselves with knowledge that knowledge supplied directly

107
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,460
Thanks to cranial implants that are connected to mumble time appropriate greetings mumble room

108
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,460
I

109
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:05,300
Thought let me eat at that amazing place nearby the studio. Yeah. Ellie's yeah. Oh gosh. I love that place

110
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,220
It's it's so good. It's so good and like all the people there and I'm like, I'm the only guy

111
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,980
We're not I don't know everybody's name. It's like cheers up in that joint and only it's breakfast

112
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,420
Yeah, it's great

113
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,260
Yeah. Alright, so let's start with let's start with some follow-up emails just a quick one

114
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,160
I'll leave the details in the show notes

115
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,740
But Ben wrote in with sort of one of the best write-ups on how to fix the NVIDIA

116
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,680
V-sync issue that we were seeing or that we had an email about last week

117
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,540
We had a few solutions a Ben had one where you just toss an export line into your dot profile

118
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,980
File and then that will take care of it and he says I love the show

119
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,780
I just wanted to chime in on the game v-sync issues that David from Alabama was experiencing in Linux on plug 65

120
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,740
Basically, he fixed his v-sync issues by forcing the unity compositor to v-sync for him

121
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,220
And he's looking for a way to do the same in gnome

122
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,260
this is not the way to go every time someone suggests using Compton or turning off unit directs full-screen or

123
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,780
Using another way to force the compositor during games. I scream in frustration

124
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,400
You're losing out on a ton of performance and you're increasing input latency in games

125
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,800
Which makes playing twitch games like counter-strike global offensive darn near impossible

126
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,200
So he's got a command in there. You can put in there that I should take care of it

127
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
If you're out there having some tearing issues

128
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,800
On video games. Yeah, so thank you Ben for we had a bunch of good responses to now

129
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,240
No, you're in here on your quote-unquote cheap

130
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,480
Podcasting Linux rig right now, right? I am. Okay. Well, I think we'll start this

131
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,720
I'll toss this question to you and then we'll get everybody's input. But here's the here's our first

132
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,240
sort of like I we're putting it actually in the show coverage of

133
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,720
USB headphones on Linux we get this question all the time. We talk about it on the pre-show live stream all the time in the

134
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,560
Mumble room, but now we're gonna get it right here wiggle waffles writes in says hi all I'm absolutely horrible

135
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,240
I have I've had a horrible time troubleshooting tech issues with my mom's c720 running Ubuntu gnome 1404

136
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,600
She now I do it over the phone and she needs a USB headset to make Skype calls while traveling searching the web for Linux compatible

137
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,240
Headphones has proved totally useless and of course manufacturers don't include any such info in their product descriptions

138
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,720
Matt mentioned some arcane sound controller name on last regarding this issue, but I have no idea what headphones they were

139
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Or what type of controller headphones you wouldn't have in them. So any help would be appreciated

140
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,520
I'm looking for something low-cost and basic for Skype calling so no high-end suggestions, frankly

141
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,540
I've decided I'm never installing Linux on a family members computer again because once you install Linux

142
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:39,700
Your own you're the only tech support they have oh I see his point he says he goes on to say that there's also always

143
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,780
That one hardware feature that doesn't seem to work which is frustrating for him and that they need that has no Linux equivalent

144
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,060
The only success in this area though is he moved his dad to a Linux machine with email web and nothing else and it works

145
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,660
For him, so I suppose it depends on the use

146
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,840
So now he's in a spot where he hasn't been able to success. I think he needs to work on his Google foo

147
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,300
Because there is there are some threads out there for good headsets Matt. What are you wearing right now? Do you know?

148
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
It's a pellet

149
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:09,460
Yeah, I never pronounced this right but a platronics I have you know other Mike set up to the other computer

150
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,620
But on this one specifically now, I have a headset that I got a goodwill for $3. That'll work

151
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:20,580
I'll send him. I mean hell it's it's not hard to find if it's USB and it goes on your ears. It works

152
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:25,940
Yeah, that's why that's the big secret is it pretty much works. All right Colonel Linux. You've got your cheap rig there

153
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:32,660
Can you tell us a little bit about your setup and what kind of Linux any if any you compatibility issues you ran into right?

154
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:38,700
So my experience is the same essentially almost every USB audio interface. I've used recently

155
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,900
Works there was one exception. That was quite a while ago. I

156
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,700
Plantronics works really really well. In fact, that's what's used in the spaceship

157
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,700
So obviously they know something or two about making headsets, but I've also found that Logitech like the 8 390 for example

158
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,260
They're like 20 bucks Best Buy office max carries them

159
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:02,700
Amazon of course has them Amazon Prime and then my latest thing because this question keeps coming up is I want decent audio quality

160
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,220
what was the cheapest I could put together a

161
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:13,760
System that is totally Linux compatible. So you take it out of the box you plug it in no configuration. No, no compiling drivers

162
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,340
No downloading anything. I just wanted to work out of the box. How cheap could I do that and

163
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,100
Now mind you this is not meant for putting in your bag and traveling, right?

164
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,100
This would be if you want to get a little bit better audio quality than you get from USB headset

165
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
but I was able to whittle it down to

166
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:35,020
Just under 200 bucks and I have another microphone on order that's gonna come in and I'm gonna see if I can get it down

167
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,020
to about 150

168
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,260
But I think for for $200 and I'm talking on it right now

169
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:46,740
I think I think this sounds really good and that gets your USB interface that gets you a mixer get your microphones headphones and a microphone

170
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:51,000
That's a full Linux audio podcasting rig, which I think we should do a full segment on to be honest

171
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,740
I guess we should but a wimpy you sound pretty good today and you're on a new headset, right? What did you get?

172
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,080
I am well, I asked the question last week because I had a massive audio fail

173
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,500
And I went away and did a bit of research so this week I bought myself

174
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:14,860
Logitech h800 headset and it's not the cheapest and I'll explain why I used it

175
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,740
First of all in terms of Linux support

176
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:24,860
It's a wireless headset and mic all built-in with some buttons on the side for volume control and muting and track skipping and stuff

177
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,680
Like that all those all those media keys work

178
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:35,820
So it's wireless. It has a USB port plug that you put in your USB that shows up on your machine and you just go

179
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
So you're using Bluetooth Bluetooth?

180
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:44,140
It's both so it has two buttons on the headset one to use the USB dongle

181
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,900
Okay, which is how I'm using it now plugged into my Linux workstation to do mumble

182
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:53,740
And then you just go into your mixer and just say what your mic is and what your headsets are and all that works

183
00:14:54,140 --> 00:15:01,580
But it also has Bluetooth. So you switch the headset to Bluetooth mode and then you compare it with your tablet and your phone

184
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,300
So this device now does all of my audio needs

185
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,200
So you can use it for your computer or to listen to a podcast from a phone or music or something exactly

186
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,700
Yeah, if I'm sitting downstairs and I want to watch a bit of BSG on my tablet

187
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,460
I just put the headset on pair it with the tablet and off I go. So what do you do for the mic?

188
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:26,940
What's the mic using? Is it the mics built-in? It's built into the headset support pull down integrated mic

189
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,260
Okay. Wow, that is a really cool. It says logic H 800 H 800

190
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:37,660
Yeah, and there's a there's slightly cheaper models as well, but I quite like this one because of the versatility

191
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,060
We've been able to use it with multiple devices. How do you charge it?

192
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:48,700
It's a micro USB charger and and so when you plug the receiver in just shows up to Linux as a USB sound card

193
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,780
It does sweet nice recommendation good fine wimpy

194
00:15:53,460 --> 00:16:01,260
Okay, this is something I think about a lot and we're gonna we're gonna get into this discussion around Firefox and Chrome and

195
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:09,200
And you know, it's one of the things I've noticed a lot in my switch for the week is when something doesn't work, right

196
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,740
you know, there's a lot of different suggestions that come at come at a person and

197
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:21,500
I I feel like there's a lot of parallels between when we have people switch to Linux and things don't go right for them and

198
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:27,340
How we respond to that and how when I switched to Firefox and things didn't go right and how people have responded to that

199
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,100
I see a lot of parallels there

200
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:35,160
so I've been thinking a lot about how what I've just gone through reflects how we handle newcomers to Linux and

201
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:42,220
This first email or this next email that we're gonna get to sort of follows that that lat theme that we're gonna be talking about

202
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,580
Later today, so mount agent. I think is how you say it

203
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,880
Rodin or mount tangent. I'm not sure says on Sunday show Chris and Matt

204
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,220
We're reminiscing about the good old days of comp is and how the desktop cube and rad flame effects

205
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,180
We're pretty good at starting conversations and getting people to try out Linux

206
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,880
I'm wondering what features are beloved OS is you found to be the most pervasive or I'm sorry persuasive

207
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,120
to new Linux users

208
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,120
To be clear these would be outside the good well-reasoned arguments for switching

209
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,620
He says you can believe in the open source philosophy all day long

210
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,580
But willing to make the leap well sometimes a little shiny helps with that

211
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:25,100
That's what I'm asking about mine would largely be about Mac users looking at Linux since I work primarily with that user base

212
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,540
I'll second the desktop effects thing as an ongoing on and off again KDE user

213
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,420
I also find that Katie's incredible level of customization cuts both ways with this for some

214
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,020
It's a major draw for others

215
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:43,220
It's intimidating Mac users seem to have really enjoyed Cairo doc again with the flame effects before iOS and seven and eight

216
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,500
The ability to plug in iOS devices and read external storage was a big hit for them, too

217
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Oh and hilariously for Mac users

218
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,980
Snapping the tiles of the windows, you know, so when you snap a window to the edges, they love that

219
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,640
I still can't understand why Apple doesn't do that in Mac OS

220
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,100
So he says what other shiny features of Linux say be at a desktop environment or otherwise

221
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,080
Do you show folks to start them down the road to switching the Linux?

222
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:15,900
Multiple desktops multiple desktops is a great one. Of course Windows 10 is getting that finally and Mac OS has spaces

223
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:22,460
Yeah, but it's it's not nowhere near as good as like, um, I run Cinnamon. I mean I have

224
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,900
10 desktops. Wow all hockey. Wow

225
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,780
Xerox, what do you show them a gnome that you really seems to grab their attention?

226
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,180
If somebody is watching me use my machine and I'm using gnome 3 the first thing they notice is when I

227
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:43,260
Mouse over to the top left hot corner and everything kind of backs out and I get a nice everything gets out of my way

228
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,220
That kind of thing activity overview, right? They get all over that stuff. Yeah

229
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,540
Yeah, well though when you go to activities overview all the windows you have

230
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,020
Yeah, that's a good one that's a good I also you know what one I find really sweet for Mac users

231
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:06,100
Which is just hilarious that the Mac doesn't have this. I know I just like when you click the when you click the

232
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,900
Clock in Mac OS it doesn't drop down a calendar like

233
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:16,580
This is 2014. How do you not? So anyways, so on gnome, you know when I drop down the calendar on gnome

234
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,860
Like I always show them like yeah, and it syncs with my own cloud server and puts all my appointments in there

235
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:26,380
So that's something that the gnomes got going for it. That's it's pretty nice for the shiny features, too

236
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,300
I it depends on who your audience is right because different people find different things to be shiny

237
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,580
Some people find the ability to boot off of a USB live

238
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:40,700
Thumb drive and recover your system a shiny feature. Some people think that's not so also the desktop cube. Yeah, you could always

239
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah

240
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:46,980
well

241
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,980
So if you have any ideas leave us some feedback

242
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,040
On what the shiny thing is go go put compass back on your rig or if you've got

243
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:59,600
A unity go turn on the compass settings manager and turn on the fire if you're writing plasma, you can it's native in Kadewin. Yeah

244
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,120
All right, RA writes in with our last email today says hey JB

245
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,120
With fedora 21 when it does finally come out in December

246
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,060
Probably you guys should review it

247
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:21,120
I know you will but there's just so much great stuff in there gnome 3.14 system D DNF butter a fart better butter butter

248
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,720
She's for easy for me to say Wayland and all of the new core apps and there's some extra dev tools in there, too

249
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,000
I was I was able to set up my C and C++ and Java environments with just five clicks and

250
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,840
Everything is butter smooth. So this is the first time I've got run and a gnome running under Wayland actually and it's quite good

251
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,320
All the apps I have run nicely probably though with X Wayland now that I think of it

252
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,600
I should look I would love to be in the mobile room when you guys review it would that be possible?

253
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,820
Yes, so stay tuned. We will win fedora 21 comes out have a review and we will probably do the whole comprehensive thing

254
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:59,080
Where we start the review in Linux action show and we're planning to do some pretty solid follow-up in that following weeks unplugged

255
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,480
The mumble rooms open

256
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,480
So RA you would always be welcome to join us

257
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,080
Yeah from time to time at least so

258
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,760
Haven't kicked you yet. Yeah. All right. So I want to talk about the Firefox switch

259
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,560
I think that's something we should probably get to plus. It's also the 10-year anniversary of Firefox before we get to that though

260
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,200
I'd like to thank digital ocean

261
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,480
They're our first sponsor this week head over to digital ocean comm right now and use our promo code

262
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,040
Unplugged in November when you check out to get a $10 credit now digital oceans only five dollars a month for their droplets

263
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,360
So that's gonna get you a droplet for two months for free to try them out now

264
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,160
Why would you go over to digital ocean my friends?

265
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,440
I will tell you because they rock it's simple cloud hosting and they're dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up

266
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,800
A cloud server. I got an email today from Jason who got started in 33 seconds

267
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,280
But they say on average probably get going about 55 seconds or so and pricing plans start at five dollars per month

268
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,600
Their pricing structure is very logical. It incrementally goes up you get all of the more of the things

269
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,500
It's very clearly laid out. They even have hourly pricing if you just need to do some testing

270
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:11,660
but for five dollars you're gonna get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer connected to

271
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:17,900
Tier one bandwidth at some of the world's most amazing data centers you can see some of the awesome pictures on their Instagram feed

272
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,540
I'm super jelly. It's one thing

273
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,540
I really miss about working in IT is the really awesome data centers

274
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:28,340
And they have locations in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam and London multiple data centers you can do private networking

275
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:34,100
It's really sophisticated stuff, and they manage it all with this dashboard. It is

276
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,640
Amazing the dashboard is super intuitive the control panel is

277
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:43,340
One of these things that I I wish I could just take it and like make it my idea because I would I would just take

278
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,420
This alone and make this the product and I would become super rich

279
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,780
That's how incredible is and this is just part of DigitalOcean

280
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,920
And they wrap up all of these great features like the ability to do one-click application deployments

281
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:01,180
Or if perhaps you want to do something like DNS management or a backup or a one-click install of GitLab

282
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,500
You can do all of that right from the dashboard

283
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,940
It's super slick and when you're over there use our promo code

284
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,540
Unplugged November to get a $10 credit and try it up for a couple of months for free and

285
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,420
DigitalOcean is also looking for folks to write tutorials will pay up to $200

286
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,260
So if there's something you're an expert on go write tutorial for me

287
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,860
You might get paid they have editors that will work with you in fact

288
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,280
They even have an open editor position right now for those tutorials

289
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,440
So you could you might be able to get a job over DigitalOcean too if you want to edit some tutorials

290
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:36,200
That'd be pretty cool. So go over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code Unplugged November when you check out try them out

291
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,640
It's pretty great. I've got I got cray-cray droplets. I got so many droplets now that Rekai has got droplets on my account

292
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,560
That's I got Rekai's got droplets now. How cool is that right?

293
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,600
And he's doing you better watch out though because I think he might be using it to develop Skynet

294
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,080
So you probably want to get on his good side

295
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,180
DigitalOcean.com use the promo code Unplugged November when you check out and a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged

296
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:07,920
Okay, so let's start off by saying happy 10th anniversary of Firefox right version like 1.0 came out 10 years ago

297
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,920
They had a big old ad didn't they have it didn't isn't that am I right?

298
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,840
They bought a big ad in like the New York Times or something. I think so. Yeah

299
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,480
If I remember correctly it is pretty cool, and they as part of that

300
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,800
They've released a new developer version of the browser Aurora

301
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,640
They've taken the Aurora name and now it's sort of like it's a development release with a bunch of tools and a new theme

302
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,520
I download and tried it out last night

303
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,460
They also introduced a new feature in Firefox called forget since they've having to go into an entire

304
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:41,140
Private session you can just forget the last hour or 24 hours or whatever five minutes of your browsing sessions kind of neat

305
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,400
They're also launching project Polaris a privacy initiative and to kick that off

306
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,480
They're starting with a massive boost to the Tor relay network to give Tor more capacity

307
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,120
And they're pledging to make security management simpler and more straightforward in

308
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,280
Firefox so a pretty cool 10th anniversary

309
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
for Firefox

310
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,080
So last week well, I don't remember exactly even how it went down on the pre-show

311
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:11,440
We were like it somehow it came up that I run Chrome at chromium. I should say I don't actually run Chrome

312
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,960
Because it's just a little bit more of a pain in the ass to get on ours

313
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,760
So I run chromium and I'm I I like it a lot as far as a browser goes it has issues

314
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,560
I think it's too resource intensive

315
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:28,800
And I'm also not a huge fan of some of the some of the ways that Google seems to use it to push an agenda

316
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,200
This is super nitpicky, but like today on all my computers

317
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,960
I fired up Chrome for the first time in a week, and it's kind of like a welcome back

318
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,160
It's like all my computers are spamming me to donate to ebola now

319
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,280
It's a good cause

320
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:48,200
But like my browser should not be used as a platform for Google to deliver me messages like that right and I'm not super comfortable

321
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,520
With that kind of thing and that's happening in chromium

322
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,600
And the other thing about it is I don't like the ie

323
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Factor that Chrome is starting to enjoy

324
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,600
You know you're seeing new services that launch that require Chrome

325
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,120
I think we probably at least all of us have seen that at least once Google's own inbox product that they just launched only works

326
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
in Chrome

327
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,960
So these these are some of the reasons. I also am a big fan of the Mozilla foundation

328
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,720
I like that they push forward an open web platform

329
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,680
And I think that they're you know and as far as their interest are more in line with end users interest than Google's probably are

330
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,160
So I'm a fan of Firefox all around. I mean I have used Firefox

331
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:33,120
Literally since the day the project was born right? I mean I I remember before there was a Firefox

332
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,520
I remember after Firefox. I mean I'm really a big fan of Firefox

333
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,520
I don't think you gave it enough never a chance

334
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:46,080
So I mean I literally I mean I remember I remember when 1.0 shipped. I clearly remember the day

335
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,520
And it was a really big deal because it took a very long time

336
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,520
It felt like to get there at least back then it was a huge it was a huge huge deal. Yeah

337
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,800
Yeah, yeah, and this is really it was a big deal

338
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,480
and this was really before people talked online like in like social in like a social way like there was message forms and and

339
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,560
BBS's and there was like there was discussion forums

340
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,560
But there wasn't like we don't have like this instant buzz about things like we have

341
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,880
Today where like the Gnome Foundation can raise like a ton of money in like 24 hours like we don't have that level of connectivity

342
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:27,240
But even back then we were all buzzing about Firefox 1.0. Oh, yeah, and it was like a horribly ugly

343
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,560
GTK application back then to super ugly really bad, but you know what rocked it loved it

344
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:39,720
It was the best browser ever it really was it was so much better in the Internet Explorer for a long time

345
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,580
Yeah, I know but at some point I I switched over to Chrome

346
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:51,540
You know just to try it out, I guess and I found myself pretty happy and I found extensions that work really well for me

347
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,020
On the pre show though people like Chris. Why are you using Chrome?

348
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,140
You should switch over to Firefox and everybody ganged up on me

349
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,180
And I finally caved right as the show started and said alright

350
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:05,220
I'll try Firefox out for a week and a few other folks joined me on the challenge

351
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,820
And we'd have some of them on the show here today and in fact

352
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,480
We also heard from just people in the audience that were taking the challenge now whom in the chat room Matt

353
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,240
Managed to go out and collect the moments

354
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
That throughout the whole week

355
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,320
I've been using Firefox and throughout the whole week different moments on air

356
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,680
My browser has crashed on me and left me stranded in the middle of the show

357
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,640
Whom was polite enough to go out and collect some of those for us

358
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,480
So I'll start with probably the one that was the most egregious. We're paying the bills

359
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,520
We're about to watch Kyra's app pick and Firefox crashes on us

360
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,400
Here's the clip that I get from the ladies who just want to hear my voice. Oh, yeah, let's find out here we go

361
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,640
No, you cannot speak to Kira Longfield

362
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
No, I don't need duck cleaning

363
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
I'm Kyra in this thing's app of the week

364
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,720
The app was so so awesome

365
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,920
It's not Kyra's fault. It's totally Firefox crashing on me. Hold on let's play it again. Go Kyra go!

366
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,840
Right so that okay. Alright, so there was a there was crash number one

367
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:12,600
Here it was crash number two in the same episode and he launched a user-friendly system based on arch

368
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,720
And I want to play a little bit of his Kickstarter video from that effort so that way for some of you who might

369
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
Oh, Firefox is killing me!

370
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Seriously?

371
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,080
Theoretically, oh man, so the Firefox crashes right there as I'm trying to seek in the video again

372
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,680
You might notice a theme here. It was another flash video now. I actually haven't seen the rest of these clips yet

373
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,320
I don't remember these but here was another example of Firefox crashing on air

374
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Hey Firefox!

375
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
How do you people use Firefox?

376
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Look at how it's rendering my Google Plus page!

377
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
It's great as long as you're not doing anything with Google

378
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:50,520
Look at oh, yeah, that's right. That was when it totally that's when it totally mis-rendered the Google Plus page when I was trying to

379
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:56,920
Talk about system 76. Alright, so then finally somebody catches me. I show my extension. I have a lot of extensions

380
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,440
Oh my god

381
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,880
Dude, how is your browser even run?

382
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,880
Fucking far, far, far. But here's the thing!

383
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Alright, so I did have a lot of extensions. Just a couple, just a couple.

384
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,880
But yeah, so there, so they could crash, they could also crash during Tech Talk today on me a couple of times

385
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,880
So it's been a pretty rough week. Not only did it, not only was stability an issue

386
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,880
But also just the same extension selection wasn't really available. Now, does that mean Firefox is horrible?

387
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:34,880
I don't think so, but I don't know like a lot of people said oh Chris, it's your extensions or Chris is this or that

388
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,880
And I was you know going through I just thought to myself well doesn't at the end of the day really matter how the browser

389
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Handles a catastrophe? Like if even if an extension craps the bed, well bad on that extension

390
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,880
But even worse on the browser for totally dumping out, right? Because that's not what Chrome does, right?

391
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:58,880
So I don't know. So I don't want to get too far into it. First, I want to ask Popey. Popey, I know you've been working with it for a week

392
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,880
You're still in the Firefox challenge mode right now. How are you doing? Are you going to stick with it for another week?

393
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:13,880
So to be fair, it's worth noting that we've been shipping Firefox since Ubuntu 4.10 which was 10 years ago

394
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:22,880
And we shipped Firefox 0.99 in our first release of Ubuntu and it's been the default browser for every single release of Ubuntu since then

395
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Okay. However, I have flipped between various browsers for years and I think we came to a mutual decision last week to

396
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:45,880
Both try a week of Firefox because we've both been using Chromium or Chrome mostly. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I have everything installed even Midori

397
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:54,880
From time to time I use that for like a Gmail login or something. Right. And so and I've always had Firefox since I've never uninstalled

398
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,880
I'm not one of those people who are zealous and will like remove any apps that I don't use by default

399
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:06,880
But so I've been using Chromium and there's a couple of things that I liked about Chromium and Chrome that I've been using

400
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,880
So I switched to Firefox a week ago and actually whilst I've been bitching and moaning

401
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:22,880
Two things that have annoyed me most was the fact that it slowed down dramatically and ate all my CPUs and all my RAM

402
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:33,880
And I'm on a laptop with an i7 CPU and 16 gig of RAM and it ate it all up with and I wasn't I only have two extensions installed

403
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,880
And at the time when it ate all my RAM I had like half a dozen tabs open

404
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:48,880
So I'm not normally in Chrome or Chromium I will have 50 60 maybe 100 tabs open and if it starts eating my CPU

405
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,880
I'll be like, OK, I'm being a bit of a dick with my browser now and I'll close some of the tabs

406
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:04,880
But or Chromium will do that for me and it will start killing off tabs. Yeah. When it has a bad day. Did you have any crashing? Fair enough

407
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Did you have any crashing? Firefox? Yeah. Nothing like you had. I had a couple of occasions this week where my entire laptop rebooted

408
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:21,880
And I've not had that for some time, but I can't pin that on Firefox. I think it's actually Intel video driver problem

409
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:30,880
And I have filed that and that's an upstream bug. Right. But the problems I've had is more slowness and eating all my resources

410
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,880
However, I think it's mostly down to the fact that I tend to leave my laptop running

411
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:44,880
I rarely restart the browser. I just shut the lid, suspend it, wake it up and carry on. And I think on my system

412
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:52,880
Firefox doesn't like being left running for a very long period of time, like days. All right. So Wimpy, what was I know you kind of had a similar path

413
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,880
What did you do exactly? Did you were you a Chromium user that tried Firefox for a while or vice versa?

414
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:08,880
The other way around. So actually, I adopted Chrome really early on. So very early on in sort of the alpha beta stage in around 2008

415
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:17,880
And that was because it had a really nifty JavaScript JIT compiler at the time, which we needed to test some prototype code on for work

416
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:25,880
So for work, I worked with aircraft and aircraft data and we wanted to plot thousands of samples of aircraft data in a browser

417
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,880
And you simply couldn't do that back then and suddenly Chrome turned up and it changed the game

418
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:37,880
So ever since then, I've been using Chrome because I started using it and I went through the growing pains and I sort of stuck with it

419
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,880
But about a year ago, I noticed Chrome rendering popular websites in strange ways

420
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:51,880
So I started using Firefox and then I just switched back to Firefox. So I've been using Firefox exclusively for about 12 months

421
00:34:51,880 --> 00:35:00,880
And to be honest with you, other than the rendering problems that I'd had with Chrome previously, I couldn't really tell anything between the two browsers

422
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,880
But I thought I'd take a closer look as you were doing this this week and I've had a chat with Popey in the week

423
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:14,880
And running Firefox and Chrome side by side, what I definitely noticed is Chrome is significantly faster than Firefox

424
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,880
And I didn't believe Popey when he was telling me the subjective metrics about how much faster it was

425
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,880
So I went off and I did it properly. I know, right? I'm a big fat liar

426
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,880
Well, I just I'm just skeptical by nature, I suppose. But I went away and did some tests

427
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,880
And whilst you do these browser benchmarks that kind of mean something, if you actually run the two browsers side by side

428
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:46,880
You can see the difference. And it was when I could see the difference in the rendering time and the smoothness and the transition

429
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,880
And it was quicker and I just felt like I was in better control of the browser

430
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Right. And I also feel like the UI responds faster, like tabs open and close faster

431
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,880
Like it's not struggling to to open that tab up if there's something else going on in the browser

432
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,880
Sometimes it's like Firefox is struggling with that and like there's only one or two worker threads

433
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:15,880
Yeah. Yeah. So well, you know, Chrome and Chromium have some tricks that they play that make it look faster than it really is

434
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:22,880
I think so, yeah. That's fine. I don't I don't care if they're tricks. They're tricks that fool my eyes

435
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,880
It's not just what you see when I ran the various browser benchmarks

436
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,880
Chrome, you know, on my system was was beating Firefox two times over every time

437
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Really? Was that from a startup or after you had a bunch of stuff?

438
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:45,880
Sorry, there's a yes. So from startup go to the same benchmark site, run the benchmark and post the results

439
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,880
So the conditions were the same. OK, gotcha.

440
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,880
So here's a couple other things, just anecdotal, just my experiences

441
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,880
So day one didn't go super great. Firefox sync for some reason, just go figure, right?

442
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:07,880
Didn't actually sync on the I had a new install, set up the browser, logged into Firefox sync on the browser the night before

443
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,880
Went about, did some web reading, probably used the browser for about an hour, closed it

444
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:18,880
Came back, moved my laptop, brought my bonobo to the studio, opened it up, launched Firefox like around 8.30, then went on air around 9

445
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,880
So and then I go to start the show and realize that none of my bookmarks had synced, none of my extensions had synced

446
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,880
Yeah, and that was a little like, oh, man, day one I got burned by sync

447
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:33,880
But I was able to if I but then so to fix it, I had to delete my profile and then create a new profile and set up sync again

448
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:42,880
Same account, then sync just worked. Not a huge deal, but what I walked away from is when I would run into issues

449
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,880
So a couple of things would happen. People would, well actually, I guess I have a clip of it here

450
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,880
I might, I'm gonna play this clip from last, it might be a little ranty, but I'm gonna play it from the heat of the moment

451
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,880
And I'll see if this covers what I was just about to say

452
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,880
Oh, you need to be able to copy that as HTML? Just install

453
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,880
So how the conversation literally started was, Chris, just install an extension to have it have the same features as Chrome

454
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,880
You need that thing that Chrome can do? Just install

455
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,880
So the conversation starts, is Chris, just install an extension

456
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,880
And now, now the conversation is Chris, you got too many extensions, what do you expect to happen?

457
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,880
So I can't use the browser because I don't have an extension

458
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,880
And then once I have too many extensions, now the problem is I got too many extensions

459
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,880
And it's literally gone from Tuesday to Chris, install an extension

460
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:34,880
Literally, people are so determined that I install extensions that they literally, between Tuesday and today, developed extensions for me

461
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,880
Created extensions, I've installed those extensions, they're great, they make, they add

462
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,880
But now it's Chris, you got too many extensions

463
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,880
Now on the other side of that, Chrome is a big bloated turd biscuit

464
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,880
I mean, it's like, it literally, it just starts processes to piss me off

465
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,880
I hate Chrome, I hate it with a passion, I want to light it on fire and burn it

466
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,880
That's one of the things, I don't like Chrome, I don't like it

467
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,880
I literally, I use a little bit of Midori, I use some other browsers

468
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,880
But generally for just casual, I'm doing random stuff on the internet

469
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
I use Firefox because it's great for me

470
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,880
Alright, so I got to install GST

471
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,880
So what I found was, I found people were super willing to constantly volunteer things I should do

472
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,880
Like a lot of going to your about config and change this

473
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,880
Enable hardware acceleration, disable hardware acceleration, install this extension

474
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,880
Oh yeah, that extension that you needed, well that only goes in the status bar

475
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
Well the status bar doesn't actually exist anymore

476
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
So now you have to install an extension that brings back the status bar

477
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,880
And then once you bring back the status bar, you can customize the status bar

478
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,880
And take the button out of the status bar and move it up to the menu bar

479
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
And then uninstall that extension

480
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,880
And then go install this extension so that way, it's like it was ongoing

481
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,880
And then when I started having stability issues

482
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,880
Which were clearly related to the Adobe Flash plugin

483
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,880
Not related to the other extensions, clearly related to the Adobe Flash plugin

484
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,880
But immediately it's, well you have too many extensions, you need to do this

485
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,880
You're doing this wrong, and it sort of immediately went hostile

486
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,880
And what I started thinking about was, people that are switching to Linux

487
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,880
They have these problems in a much broader context

488
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,880
With all kinds of little pain points when they switch over to Linux

489
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,880
And I also see the same kind of, well what do you mean it's not working for you?

490
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,880
Well then you're doing it wrong

491
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,880
And I got emails where people critiqued my technical literacy

492
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,880
Because it's not that Firefox was having issues

493
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,880
It's not that it wasn't properly handling when the Flash plugin crashed or whatever was happening

494
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,880
What the problem was, is I wasn't technically literate to use the browser

495
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,880
And I didn't care enough about open source

496
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,880
I probably got nearly a hundred comments to that regard

497
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,880
And it's ridiculous

498
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:38,880
And not only is it ridiculous, it's antithetical to everything that I used to know about Fox

499
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,880
Anyways, I want people to just consider it

500
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,880
I think what we have to get better at, and I know this is maybe a soapbox of mine

501
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,880
But I think what we have to get better at is acknowledging that everything has strengths and attributes to it

502
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,880
Like I started this segment talking about what I like about Firefox

503
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,880
The history I have with it, and why the Mozilla Foundation is great

504
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,880
I also use Firefox on every computer I have

505
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,880
But my primary get work done browser has to remain, in my opinion, Chrome

506
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,880
And I think the bigger problem here is

507
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,880
Is that what we are really beginning to see

508
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,880
Is the division that Mozilla is actually up against

509
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,880
Which is not Firefox versus Internet Explorer

510
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Or Firefox versus Chrome

511
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,880
It is Firefox versus every single other WebKit browser on the market

512
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,880
Because application developers are writing WebKit first

513
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,880
They're not necessarily even writing Chrome first

514
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,880
They're writing WebKit first

515
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,880
Then they might, specifically, maybe write Chrome first

516
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,880
And that's what Firefox's real challenge is

517
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
At their ten year mark going forward now

518
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,880
Is their lunch is getting eaten by WebKit

519
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,880
WebKit is the winning team right now

520
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,880
And Firefox needs to have an answer to that

521
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,880
And I understand Electrolysis is a thing that's coming

522
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,880
That's going to make Firefox super more amazing

523
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,880
And it's not going to crash as much

524
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,880
But honestly, to me, it feels too late

525
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,880
And it makes me sad a little bit

526
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,880
It doesn't mean it's going away

527
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,880
It doesn't mean it's a bad browser

528
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,880
It doesn't mean it's not going to get way more awesome

529
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,880
It doesn't mean that the Mozilla Foundation isn't incredible

530
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,880
It doesn't mean you're a bad person for wanting to use Firefox

531
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,880
And I'm a bad person for wanting to use Chromium though

532
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,880
To be fair, at Google they're actually removing the WebKit-centric stuff

533
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,880
Because they don't want people to do that

534
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,880
So that's why Blink has removed all of the WebKit CSS commands and stuff

535
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,880
That are specific to WebKit

536
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Because people were doing that and breaking stuff in Opera and Firefox at the time

537
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,880
And Google didn't want to create breakage

538
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,880
They wanted standardization

539
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,880
So Blink has that stuff gone

540
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,880
Very good

541
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,880
By the way, I looked into

542
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
Actually, Rekai hooked me up with the info

543
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,880
But I read through the info on Chromium versus Chrome

544
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,880
And it seems like Wikipedia maybe has one of the best breakdowns

545
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,880
There's several

546
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,880
Google even has their own Wiki page on it

547
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,880
But Wikipedia

548
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,880
So here's a couple of things

549
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,880
By the way, I'm a Chromium user

550
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,880
Chromium is an open source project

551
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,880
It's BSD licensed

552
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,880
There's other components that have different licensing

553
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,880
It's got a lot of little asterisks at the end of that

554
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,880
So that was the other thing

555
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,880
People were kind of jumping on me for using another open source project

556
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,880
Either way

557
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,880
There is a couple of things that Chromium does not have

558
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,880
That I think people should consider if they were going to try

559
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,880
The print subsystem apparently is different in the final Chrome version

560
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,880
In Chromium, it'll hand it off to your operating system

561
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,880
But in Chrome, they're using the entire Google print subsystem

562
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,880
Which ties in with the Google Cloud Print and all of that

563
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,880
Of course, no ACC built-ins

564
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,880
It's going to have to rely on your operating system codecs

565
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,880
The tracking is opt-in in Chromium versus opt-on, I guess, in regular Chrome

566
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,880
I might have that wrong, but it's definitely opt-in in Chromium

567
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,880
And no auto-update features

568
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,880
So you're going to have to rely on your package manager

569
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,880
Which I prefer to have my package manager do that anyway

570
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,880
So that's fine with me

571
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,880
And of course, the integrated flash

572
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,880
Sorry, what's got no auto-update?

573
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,880
Chromium doesn't use the Google updater

574
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,880
It uses your operating system's package manager

575
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
Like it should

576
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,880
Okay

577
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,880
And no built-in flash

578
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,880
No AAC, no built-in flash, no Google updater, and no Google Cloud Print

579
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,880
So from the Ubuntu point of view, those are both the same

580
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,880
They both come as Debian packages from an archive

581
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,880
Yeah, yeah

582
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,880
One comes from the Ubuntu archive, one comes from a Debian Google archive somewhere

583
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,880
It doesn't have the multimedia extension either

584
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,880
Oh, that's a good point

585
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,880
Yes, that's a good one

586
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,880
And also, it's being pointed out that no remote desktop either

587
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,880
Which is a great point there, Dublin

588
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,880
Yeah, go ahead

589
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,880
Chris, the reason you're getting hate for using Chromium is because you keep accidentally calling it Chrome

590
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,880
Well, I kind of use both

591
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,880
So I kind of interchange them depending

592
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,880
I mean, I primarily use Chromium on the majority

593
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,880
Because it's a little bit quicker to install on an Archbox

594
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,880
Yeah, and people tend to get a little bit funny about

595
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,880
Whenever I've said I'm using Chromium

596
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,880
The question that always follows is, do you mean Chrome?

597
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,880
Or if I say I'm using Chrome, they ask, do you mean Chromium?

598
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,880
It's like, no, I'm 42, I've managed to differentiate between Chrome and Chromium

599
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,880
If I'm talking about Chrome, I'll say Chrome

600
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,880
If I'm talking about Chromium, I'll say Chromium

601
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,880
But sometimes, you want to talk about both together

602
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,880
Because collectively, Chrome and Chromium are very similar code bases

603
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,880
I find it, yeah, to be pretty similar

604
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,880
But to me, what this was really revealing to

605
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,880
Was just how freaking important the web browsers become in my workflow

606
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,880
Not only do I use it to show most of the visuals in all of our shows

607
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,880
But the research and the pipeline of a lot of our media management

608
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,880
And all of it is just browser based now

609
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,880
Thankfully, I felt like at the end of this

610
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,880
If Chrome or Chromium went away tomorrow, I would be okay

611
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,880
I would make do, especially since the community was pretty awesome

612
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,880
And there was a couple of user extensions that were

613
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,880
You know, use Greasemonkey and then add a user script to that

614
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,880
And they wrote a couple of those for me to do markdown stuff

615
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,880
So I mean, there would be ways around it

616
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,880
So the thing I've learned about this

617
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,880
Is that there are people who are exceedingly passionate about Firefox

618
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,880
And they want me to have a good experience on Firefox

619
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,880
So rather than dismiss this whole experiment

620
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,880
And go back to using Chromium as I did

621
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,880
I'm going to stick with Firefox, I've removed Flash from my system

622
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,880
So I'm doing everything I can to avoid Flash based websites

623
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,880
Or Flash streaming video, which means your website actually, Chris

624
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,880
You need to provide an easy way for me to be able to watch the live stream

625
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,880
Without Flash, right? That's on you, okay?

626
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:37,880
Well, why don't you just grab the RTSP

627
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,880
Okay, I'll do that

628
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,880
Yeah, because there's not really an embeddable open source live stream solution

629
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,880
No, no, I don't mind not having an embeddable thing

630
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,880
I'd like a URL somewhere that I could paste into

631
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,880
I actually used a nice tool that one of the other guys in the mumble mentioned earlier

632
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,880
Called Livestreamer

633
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,880
But that didn't find any embeddable streams to watch from your page

634
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,880
Grab the RTMP link, or RTSP, I don't remember which one it is

635
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,880
Okay, I'll try that

636
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,880
And then if you have MPV or a VLC, but MPV is really great

637
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,880
You just do MPV and then the URL and it'll fire up

638
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,880
You know what we should do is like a short, like we have jblive.fm for the audio stream

639
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,880
I should do something like that for the

640
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,880
That would be a great idea, because then you can just tell people to go to it

641
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,880
I'll think about it, yeah, that's a good idea

642
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,880
Yeah, because that is a problem, and we get that comment all the time

643
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,880
And of course the whole website is all HTML5 video except for the live stream

644
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,880
And it's really, you can thank HLS and H264 for that

645
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:41,880
It's kind of like, sickingly enough, Flash is one of the best assemblers of HLS video on the market

646
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,880
As disgusting as that is

647
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,880
And you can throw it on a new iPhone 6 or a Nexus 5

648
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,880
And they will struggle to do as well of a job as Flash can do for whatever reason

649
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,880
Alan could talk to you all day about it

650
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,880
But it really comes down to the fact that the standards we use for video streaming right now super suck

651
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,880
But we've just kind of moved ahead with it

652
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,880
There's also a Jupyter Broadcasting XBMC add-on that you could use

653
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:09,880
Yeah, and if you watch on a Roku, there's a Jupyter Broadcasting app and the live stream is on that

654
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,880
And I could watch on my tablet or something else like that

655
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,880
That's not a problem, so I'm going to try and stick with Firefox

656
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,880
And I'm going to take advice from various people in the Mumble channel

657
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,880
Who've suggested ways in which I can debug the issues and make sure that I follow up stream

658
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,880
And ensure the experience is better for everyone else as well

659
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:34,880
So my thoughts would be I would go the no flash route for sure

660
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,880
But I can't because of some of the media management I have for JB

661
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,880
But I was thinking, I've tried running in Terminal and stuff like that to get some output

662
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,880
But I didn't really get anything very beneficial

663
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,880
But my thought was to experiment around a little bit more

664
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,880
Because I know exactly what conditions caused it to crash because I could repeat it over and over again

665
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,880
See if I can get it to do it and then maybe as a 10th birthday present to Firefox

666
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,880
I'll send off a few bug reports over the weekend

667
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,880
You're such a nice man

668
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,880
Hey, happy birthday guys, here's some bugs

669
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,880
Alright, so we've got to talk about, boy, oh my gosh

670
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,880
We've really got to get going because we have some really exciting stuff to talk about

671
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,880
Wimpy's going to share something awesome

672
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,880
And we've also, you know what, I don't think the Gnome Groupon thing will take too long

673
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,880
But we've got to talk about it just real quick

674
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,880
But before we do that, I want to thank Ting

675
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,880
Go over to linux.ting.com right now everybody

676
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,880
linux.ting.com, that'll take $25 off your first Ting device

677
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,880
Or if you have a Ting compatible device, they'll give you $25 credit

678
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,880
linux.ting.com, you don't know what Ting is?

679
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,880
What is the matter with you?

680
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,880
Ting is mobile that makes sense, no contracts, no determination fees

681
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,880
You only pay for what you use, it's a flat $6 for your line

682
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,880
And then whatever your usage is, that's what you pay

683
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,880
You want another phone? It's $6

684
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,880
You want another phone? You could be a baller like me

685
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,880
I've got three phones and I'm up here and I'm paying like $45

686
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,880
But then when I go out and I show the ladies all my phones

687
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,880
They're like, that's so impressive with all your phones

688
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,880
Why do you have so many phones?

689
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,880
And I tell them I have Ting

690
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,880
linux.ting.com, go check them out

691
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,880
No old customer service? Yeah, that's another perk

692
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,880
You don't have to wait for a human

693
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,880
You just call them up and they answer

694
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,880
You don't have a phone tree, you don't have to leave a voicemail

695
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,880
You don't have to know some sort of secret zero-smashing sequence to get to an operator

696
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,880
They just answer the phone

697
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,880
If you call them between 8am or 8pm on the east coast

698
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,880
It's great, and then they match it all up with a fantastic dashboard

699
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,880
And an awesome online community

700
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,880
But this week, I wanted to do something a little different

701
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,880
You know in LAS, we'll often do an app pick video

702
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,880
But you know, app picks shmat picks

703
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,880
This is Linux Unplugged, let's go deep into the development world

704
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,880
They have a video up of talking with Kerry

705
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,880
The behind the scenes interview with their lead web developer

706
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,880
And I want to play a little bit of it

707
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,880
Because I'm playing it in Chromium

708
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,880
My name is Kerry and I am the interface developer at Ting

709
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,880
My role at Ting is to develop and maintain any customer-facing side of our website

710
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,880
Including WordPress and Facebook

711
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,880
Usually we'll start with a discussion

712
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,880
Product management will come over or ask us if what they want is feasible

713
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,880
Or how much time it'll take

714
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,880
And I will give them an answer, it'll take 10 minutes or it'll take 6 years

715
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,880
Sometimes it will take 6 years

716
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,880
And they go off on their own and come up with the designs

717
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,880
And then they finally, when they give them to me

718
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,880
I set to work on making them a reality

719
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,880
Earlier this year we went responsive with our design

720
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,880
What this means is that when users browse our website

721
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,880
On a smaller screen like a phone or an iPod

722
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,880
They're going to see a different design than if they see it on a big screen like a desktop

723
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,880
We're making sure that users get the best possible experience on all device sizes

724
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:50,880
It feels really good to be able to be part of something that even our senior citizens can browse comfortably

725
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,880
Because I mean, a lot of senior citizens aren't that comfortable with the internet

726
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,880
And then we get comments from them saying, thanks for making it so easy

727
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,880
And that is a really rewarding part of this job

728
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,880
Linux.ting.com, go over there and start saving right now

729
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,880
They also have a savings calculator

730
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,880
I've been, not quite yet, but I am nearing the 2 year mark

731
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,880
It is approaching and the final savings will be over $2000 for me

732
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,880
So why not get started right now?

733
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,880
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged Show

734
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,880
Okay guys, let's talk, let's do a brief update

735
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,880
Because maybe the real story might actually develop by the time the Linux Action Show comes around

736
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,880
But you probably saw the headline today

737
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,880
The Gnome Foundation is attempting to raise some funds

738
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,880
To help defend Gnome's trademark against Groupon

739
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,880
Yeah, Groupon, the coupon company

740
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:50,880
They have raised $68,000 as of, well, pretty much this morning

741
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,880
68? 68,000 bucks?

742
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,880
Groupon has also, yeah, yeah, yeah

743
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:01,880
And Groupon's already responded saying, hey dawg, look, we're sorry, we don't want to use anybody's name

744
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,880
And after additional conversations with the open source community and the Gnome Foundation

745
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,880
We've decided to abandon our pending trademark application for Gnome

746
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,880
We've chosen a new name for our product going forward

747
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,880
So Gnome was this retail box thing that they were going to, so you could go buy coupons

748
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,880
Kind of a neat idea for Groupon

749
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,880
But Pope, you and I were talking about this on the Tech Talk pre-show today

750
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,880
Or actually during the show

751
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,880
Am I missing any details at this point or is that kind of the summary of where we're at?

752
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,880
That seems to be it, it's all over, let's start bashing System D again

753
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,880
Yeah, we're back to, yeah, exactly, yeah, okay

754
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,880
War's over, but it was fascinating to see the troops mobilized last night

755
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,880
So before I went to bed or something, I saw a tweet

756
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,880
And then by the time I got up, the Google Pluses and the tweets and the subreddit

757
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,880
Every subreddit had it in there, like it was full on fire this morning

758
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:55,880
When you say troops, you know, on a day like today where we're remembering real sacrifice

759
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,880
The real people have done

760
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,880
You are taking my own point I made earlier and using it against me

761
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,880
You are a jerk, sir, you are a jerk

762
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,880
I would not call those troops

763
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,880
Yes, I know, and that's kind of my point

764
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,880
Again, we were just, we were ready to go to war

765
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,880
We were ready to go to war, and they raised a ton of money

766
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,880
I even, I threw in 55 bucks, I was like, well alright, I like Nome

767
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,880
I'm really surprised it's as low as that

768
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,880
I really thought they'd have double that

769
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,880
So what happens with the money now?

770
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,880
It goes to making Nome better

771
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,880
Yeah, they already said that it's going to go to Nome

772
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,880
Anything that's left over, and since all of it's left over, all of it goes to Nome

773
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,880
I think that's worthy

774
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,880
Well that's great because I know they've had some financial troubles, right?

775
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,880
Isn't that a thing?

776
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,880
Oh yeah, they ended last year in the red

777
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,880
Well, I guess they just got a little revenue boost then

778
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,880
But I'm glad, I mean, I think it's

779
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:59,880
I think it's also, what it really demonstrates, legitimately, is the serious brand loyalty

780
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,880
I don't know if that's the right term to call it

781
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,880
But the, I mean, people came to Nome's defense in mass

782
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,880
And people, I think things have turned around for Nome

783
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,880
I think the public opinion is turning on Nome

784
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,880
Because people really, really seem to come out in defense of it

785
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,880
And we're ready to fight Groupon and calling them names

786
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,880
And Groupon really responded

787
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,880
So not only did they have their official blog post

788
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,880
But their senior lead engineer, I think that's actually his title, senior lead engineer

789
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,880
Went to his blog trying to explain that it was a misunderstanding

790
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,880
That they had been in communication with the Nome Foundation

791
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,880
And that they're willing to be flexible

792
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,880
They really scrambled

793
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,880
I'm not really familiar with

794
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,880
I've seen comments from the Nome side saying

795
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,880
We've been in conversation with them for months and it's only today

796
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:51,880
Kind of justifying the whole public hatred of Groupon and people deleting their Groupon accounts

797
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,880
I'm not convinced

798
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,880
I'm not convinced that it was entirely down to the Reddit army

799
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,880
And the various armies leaving comments everywhere that got this done

800
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,880
But I'm sure it was a contributing factor

801
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,880
Yeah

802
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,880
I'd like to think that Groupon got a telephone call from Karen Sandler

803
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,880
Where she implied she was going to put the smack down on them

804
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,880
In no uncertain terms

805
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,880
That's what I was thinking too

806
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,880
And they realized what they were up against

807
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,880
Or maybe the people at Groupon grew a pair

808
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,880
And realized that actually they were being dicks

809
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,880
And what they really needed to do was just not do the thing that they were doing

810
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,880
Didn't someone who works at Groupon used to be someone who worked at GNOME?

811
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,880
Oh, now this is a good rumor

812
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,880
Ryan Cameron

813
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,880
Or even more interesting maybe

814
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,880
Using this as a way to show that they now have a new product

815
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,880
Marketing

816
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,880
And everyone kind of knows that they have a point of sale system

817
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,880
You think that

818
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,880
All the truthers are out there

819
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,880
Yeah, I would say that's a pretty obscure marketing strategy

820
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,880
Yeah

821
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,880
It will work though

822
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,880
Everyone now knows what they have

823
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,880
And might actually check it out

824
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,880
Yeah, and I'm actually thinking it's kind of a good idea

825
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,880
Because I don't want to go sign up at Groupon

826
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,880
But if they had a kiosk where I could just do a one-time transaction

827
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,880
Well, maybe I might do that

828
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,880
I mean, I'm a cheapskate after all

829
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,880
They might even look at

830
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,880
People might even look at the GNOME desktop environment now as well

831
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,880
Holy smokes

832
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,880
Maybe they were in on it from the first time

833
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,880
It's a false flag trademark dispute

834
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,880
Operation promotion

835
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,880
I know, right

836
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,880
We've got to

837
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,880
Boy, if we're not careful

838
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,880
We're going to have to bust out the conspiracy bacon on this edition

839
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,880
Yeah, that's funny because that's exactly what Blue Phoenix was saying in the chat room a little bit ago

840
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:38,880
That there was

841
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,880
It did smell a little bacon-y to him

842
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,880
And I don't think so

843
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,880
I don't think they'd be that dishonest

844
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,880
No, I don't think so either

845
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,880
No, it's a

846
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,880
If they're not though

847
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,880
Kind of you need to question

848
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,880
If they're in conversation in months

849
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,880
Why do you add applications?

850
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,880
Doesn't make sense

851
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,880
Because lawyers do stuff without being told

852
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,880
Yeah, I could see that

853
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:03,880
Or maybe the negotiations weren't necessarily going the GNOME Projects direction

854
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,880
So they went public to show their serious commitment

855
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,880
I mean there could be all kinds of scenarios

856
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,880
Who knows

857
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,880
Okay

858
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,880
You guys are lovely

859
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,880
And just in huge good faith

860
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,880
Yeah, I suppose

861
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,880
All right

862
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,880
I can't hold it any longer

863
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,880
We've got to talk about something super exciting

864
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:20,880
Really, really happy

865
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,880
But really quickly we're going to thank Linux Academy

866
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,880
I've got a note from Anthony who is one of the guys that runs Linux Academy

867
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,880
And he said that they've gotten a ton of new signups from the Linux Unplugged audience

868
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,880
And the feedback's been unanimously awesome

869
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,880
And when I went to Ohio Linux Fest

870
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,880
Shook a lot of hands from folks that are taking courses at Linux Academy

871
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,880
And they've been really impressed

872
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,880
And they say one of the things that's kind of hard to understand about Linux Academy

873
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,880
Is you really grok how great it is

874
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,880
And how it really is a solution tailored for Linux users

875
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,880
By Linux users

876
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,880
And that is so key because there's a lot of online learning resources

877
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:02,880
And you really see the difference if you're trying to go for something in this space

878
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,880
Something about Linux or AWS or OpenStack and DevOps and Android development

879
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,880
They've really nailed this

880
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,880
Because that's what these guys do

881
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,880
That's their area

882
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,880
And they can really get it right

883
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,880
They are these users

884
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,880
They're sysadmins

885
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,880
Linux users

886
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,880
And educators that came together to create Linux Academy

887
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,880
You can go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

888
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,880
And get our special 33% discount on your quarter

889
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:27,880
It's a great service

890
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,880
And once you sign up you get access to all of the courseware

891
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,880
You get the downloadable comprehensive study guides

892
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,880
You get to take those online or offline

893
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,880
You can do the learning plans

894
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,880
You can say I have just this amount of time available

895
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,880
Plug it in there

896
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,880
They'll generate you a learning courseware on that

897
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,880
With reminders about quizzes, checkups

898
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,880
When you log in you choose your course

899
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,880
And it lays it all out for you

900
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,880
It maps it all out and it's super easy to manage

901
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,880
They have a good active community that can keep you going when you're having a low moment

902
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,880
And they have live streams where you can ask questions to the educators

903
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,880
Their labs spin up on demand when the courseware requires it

904
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,880
And they're adding new courses every single week

905
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,880
They've got a whole bunch more they just put out

906
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,880
And that's why you want to just keep going there all the time

907
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,880
Because you can keep going back and learn something new

908
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,880
See what scratches that itch

909
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,880
Bring yourself a little bit further in something you've been working on

910
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,880
I use it honestly

911
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,880
Just to see if some of the same old technologies that used to be a problem for me

912
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,880
Still are a problem

913
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,880
To see if I have maybe a new interest

914
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,880
Something I want to build for JB

915
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,880
There's all kinds of things

916
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:25,880
They also have group plans

917
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,880
So we can have folks in the Jupiter Broadcasting community

918
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,880
That work here that have to do something

919
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,880
Maybe we have them go over there

920
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,880
They can log in under the group course

921
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,880
It's all part of one set under one organization

922
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,880
It's really neat

923
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,880
They're adding stuff too

924
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,880
You've got to go check it out

925
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,880
Because I can't say what it is

926
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,880
But I've been given a little hint

927
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,880
And it really underscores that this is a product that's made by Linux users

928
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:46,880
For Linux users

929
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,880
And when you're trying to learn some of these things

930
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,880
That is the differential that really closes the gap

931
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,880
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

932
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:55,880
Go check them out

933
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,880
PHP

934
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:57,880
Android development

935
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,880
Ruby, Python, Linux, DevOps

936
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,880
AWS with scenario based training

937
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,880
They've got it all

938
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,880
R-Sync even

939
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,880
You need to go learn how to do your backups with R-Sync

940
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,880
They've got a course on that

941
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,880
I'm telling you

942
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,880
It's worth checking them out

943
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,880
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

944
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,880
So I was noticing on Google Plus

945
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,880
That Wimpy, you posted that you guys are getting a little attention over in Germany

946
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,880
In one of their newspapers

947
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,880
Or I'm sorry, it's a magazine, isn't it?

948
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,880
That's right

949
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:24,880
Yeah

950
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:25,880
Congratulations

951
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,880
Yeah, thank you for that

952
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,880
So there's a quarterly Linux publication in Germany

953
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:32,880
Called Linux Velt

954
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,880
I think that's how it's pronounced

955
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,880
It's got a circulation of about 50 to 60,000

956
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,880
And they're including DVDs

957
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,880
Yeah, and they have DVD cover disks

958
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:45,880
And for the 2015.01 edition

959
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,880
Which I think is out next week

960
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,880
Ubuntu Mate is the feature story

961
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,880
And the cover disk

962
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,880
That is so cool

963
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,880
And so that's not just the announcement though

964
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,880
You've been working on a little something

965
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,880
We talked about it kind of recently

966
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,880
And so I know you're getting near

967
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:06,880
I'm teasing it off a lot, Wimpy

968
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,880
What process are we about to go through right now?

969
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:10,880
Right, okay

970
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,880
So everyone probably knows that's listening to this

971
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,880
That Ubuntu Mate 14.10 was released a couple of weeks ago

972
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,880
And we've been preparing an Ubuntu Mate 14.04 release

973
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,880
And I'm actually ready to go through the keystrokes

974
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,880
To release it live now

975
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,880
So we're going to release the latest version

976
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,880
Which is based on 14.04

977
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,880
Right here on air

978
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,880
That's right

979
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:32,880
Let's do it

980
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,880
Right here on air

981
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:34,880
This is fun

982
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,880
So I've got my Terminator sessions open

983
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,880
And I've logged into my two Digital Ocean build servers

984
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,880
This is where I prepare the ISO images

985
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,880
I've already prepared the images

986
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,880
And I'm going to run the release scripts

987
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,880
And the release scripts build the WebC torrents

988
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,880
Actually make the ISOs from the SquashFS

989
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,880
Add the assets from the official Ubuntu CD releases

990
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,880
And then R-Sync them to my distribution servers

991
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,880
And we'll do that now

992
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,880
So off we go

993
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,880
Right, so that's the power of Digital Ocean

994
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,880
That's just shunted six gigabytes of data

995
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,880
Really?

996
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:17,880
Wow

997
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:23,880
We'll now just edit the release flag on the article

998
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,880
Now we'll run the deploy script

999
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,880
This is so exciting

1000
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,880
I know, right?

1001
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:31,880
I know

1002
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,880
This is actually the geekiest thing I think we've ever done on the show

1003
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:34,880
And I love it

1004
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,880
So the deploy script basically takes all the markdown

1005
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,880
That the site is generated from and turns it into HTML

1006
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,880
So that's done

1007
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,880
So now I go to my CDN

1008
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,880
And I prefetch all of those images into the CDN

1009
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,880
And that's done

1010
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,880
And now I purge the blocks

1011
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:00,880
And now I purge the blog index from my Cloudflare

1012
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,880
And that just makes sure that the updates go through

1013
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,880
And I think we're done

1014
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,880
So you just witnessed an operating system being released live

1015
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,880
So you pushed the whole website and everything in that

1016
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,880
Yeah, there you go

1017
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,880
So if you go to UbuntuMate.org slash blog

1018
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,880
The article that you'll see now is the release notes from the article

1019
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,880
UbuntuMate.org slash download

1020
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,880
Yes, that should redirect I think

1021
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,880
Because there's two bits in there

1022
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,880
You know what, Wimpy?

1023
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:34,880
You just earned yourself

1024
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:38,880
Very nice, sir

1025
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,880
Very nice

1026
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:40,880
Thank you very much

1027
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,880
Thank you very much

1028
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,880
Awesome

1029
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,880
Wow

1030
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,880
So I would just like to rattle off this

1031
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,880
There's a few people I'd like to say thank you to

1032
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,880
Some bloke called Alan Pope

1033
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,880
Santa Sweers, who's one of the Mate developers who worked really hard on fixing the accessibility stuff

1034
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,880
Mike Gabriel, who's a Debian developer

1035
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,880
He helped an awful lot in this release

1036
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,880
Gerard Alders, who provided one of the new backdrop images

1037
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,880
Some bloke called Michael Tunnel

1038
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,880
I don't know how you pronounce your name, but Rotten Corpse

1039
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,880
He's one of the guys here

1040
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,880
He did the new icon theme

1041
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:15,880
Luke Velvich, Kendall Clark, Kyle Bruard and Rob White

1042
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:22,880
Who represent various distributions that are focused towards the blind off partially sighted

1043
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,880
Who helped fix all of the screen reading stuff

1044
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,880
Wow, great you guys

1045
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,880
And one of the things that's interesting is you were mentioning before

1046
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,880
It's based on Ubuntu 14.04

1047
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:37,880
But yet it actually has some maybe what you might call improvements or feature enhancements

1048
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,880
Over the one based on 14.10, right?

1049
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,880
Indeed

1050
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,880
So Rotten Corpse has tweaked the theme for us

1051
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,880
Which looks nicer

1052
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,880
We've got a new wallpaper

1053
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,880
We've fixed the multicast DNS

1054
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,880
We've fixed policy kit privileges

1055
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,880
The big feature items are we've added indicator support

1056
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,880
So now you can add indicators into the Mate desktop

1057
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:03,880
And they sit side by side with traditional tray applets as well

1058
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,880
Wow, that's a win

1059
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:08,880
You like that, do you?

1060
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,880
I like that a lot actually

1061
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,880
I'm just interested in how fast that blog post went out

1062
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:21,880
Now what you need to be impressed with is how fast we just pushed 18 gigabytes of data around the internet

1063
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,880
Yeah, as well

1064
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,880
And that's all down to DigitalOcean

1065
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,880
You said it would take about five minutes

1066
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,880
It took about two minutes

1067
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,880
Yeah, I was hedging it on me

1068
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,880
But bungling it enough into redo bits

1069
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,880
A couple of other bits we've added is

1070
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,880
The Mint menu I've forked as the Mate menu which is available in this release

1071
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,880
Because lots of people are after that

1072
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,880
And I've actually done that for the X2GO guys

1073
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:53,880
Because they want a menu where they can disable logout and suspend features

1074
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,880
Because of remote workstations that doesn't make sense

1075
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,880
I've also forked the Mint desktop utility as Mate tweak or Mate tweak

1076
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,880
To just access some of the behind the scenes bits and pieces

1077
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,880
And then what else have we done?

1078
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,880
Accessibility, that's where we've spent a lot of time, fixing up accessibility

1079
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,880
Oh yeah, this is a good one

1080
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:17,880
We've ditched Totem as the default media player and placed it with VLC

1081
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,880
Nice, very nice

1082
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:23,880
We ran a community poll for that and that was unanimously voted for

1083
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,880
So we've made that change

1084
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,880
So I think Eric, you've got probably a popular question

1085
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:33,880
Yeah, since it's based on 14.04 is this going to be basically an LTS as far as you can do it?

1086
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,880
Yes, so we obviously don't have to maintain the base OS

1087
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,880
Pope can probably tell you more about what goes on with that

1088
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,880
But in terms of the PPA, because this is an unofficial release

1089
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,880
This is built outside of Canonical's infrastructure

1090
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,880
So there's no official support there

1091
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,880
But in terms of the Mate desktop

1092
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:58,880
I'll be supporting that through the PPA that's embedded into this build

1093
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,880
And how long?

1094
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,880
For the duration of the LTS

1095
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,880
So all 5 years, right?

1096
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,880
Yeah, and for anyone that's running 14.10 already

1097
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:15,880
They will have seen some of these features automatically turning up in the updates of their Ubuntu 14.10 releases

1098
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:18,880
Oh man, that is smooth

1099
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,880
I've got to give you a major tip of the hat

1100
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,880
What's the long term goal here?

1101
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,880
This is obviously going to start developing a pretty passionate following I'd think

1102
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:32,880
I'm already thinking this is the distro of choice for the studio production machines

1103
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,880
That'd be good

1104
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,880
To me it just seems like a slam dunk

1105
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,880
I'm going to give this a download and try it out

1106
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:41,880
But what's the long term?

1107
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,880
Because this could become a pretty big job

1108
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,880
It could become a big job

1109
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,880
So the short term is for 15.04 now we want to get it as an official flavor

1110
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,880
So all of that drama of me releasing just then I don't have to do

1111
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:02,880
Somewhere there are monkeys in canonicals infrastructure doing it automatically

1112
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:03,880
That's handy

1113
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,880
So that's the plan

1114
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,880
I've met with some of the Debian developers a couple of weeks ago

1115
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:15,880
And they've agreed to work to the same time frame that Ubuntu is working to for 15.04

1116
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:20,880
So we're not going to introduce Mate 1.10 in 15.04

1117
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,880
We're going to do the Mate 1.10 development work in Debian experimental

1118
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,880
And then bring that through in the subsequent release later in the year

1119
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,880
Interesting

1120
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,880
But initially let's get official

1121
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:38,880
Following on from that we've got some serious interest from some large organizations

1122
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:46,880
Who want to use Ubuntu Mate with the X2Go remote terminal services platform

1123
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:53,880
So the desire to get this into Ubuntu and have it as an official flavor

1124
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:59,880
Is a request from some third parties who want to see this happen

1125
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:07,880
Well I think you've got the basis here for a distribution that's going to get a lot of loyal followers

1126
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,880
And the timing is pretty good I think too

1127
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,880
It's obviously serving a niche

1128
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:18,880
It's so funny too for some reason basing this on 14.04 feels really right

1129
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,880
Like a really smart long term play

1130
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,880
And so from end to end it just seems like it's firing on all cylinders

1131
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,880
So congratulations you guys and to everybody who's worked super hard on it

1132
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:29,880
Thanks very much

1133
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,880
And it's been well being tested by my mum and my wife as well

1134
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,880
So you can be rest assured it works

1135
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:35,880
Okay good

1136
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,880
That's so awesome

1137
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,880
Now see there's some QA for you I've got to say

1138
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,880
Alright well very good

1139
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:42,880
I just want a couple of notes

1140
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,880
We're still looking for your runs Linux

1141
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,880
You guys send them in throughout the week and I appreciate that

1142
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,880
If you have a runs Linux it's even more awesome

1143
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,880
It's either your own thing it could be

1144
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:51,880
Or something you find

1145
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,880
It's total perks if it's got video or a picture

1146
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,880
I'd love that

1147
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,880
That usually puts it towards the top of the list

1148
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,880
Because those are always fun to look at

1149
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,880
Send those over to linuxactionshow at jupyterbroadcasting.com

1150
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:06,880
Or like all content that you think might be great for either Linux Unplugged or Linux Action Show

1151
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,880
Submit them to our subreddit at linuxactionshow.reddit.com

1152
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,880
And don't forget you can join us live jblive.tv

1153
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,880
We do this here on 2pm on a Tuesday

1154
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,880
Go to jupyterbroadcasting.com.calendar to get that converted to your local timezone

1155
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,880
And I'll have links to the Matei stuff in the show notes

1156
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,880
So go grab that

1157
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,880
Also links to the Gnome vs Groupon stuff in the show notes

1158
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:33,880
And a full break out of the differences between Chrome and Chromium

1159
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,880
So if you were a little confused by our conversation about that

1160
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,880
Because I know some of you are kind of coming into this and saying

1161
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,880
Wait, there's a difference? Yes, there is a difference

1162
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,880
And instead of just sitting here and rattling through all of them

1163
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,880
I broke it all out in the show notes for you

1164
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:46,880
So you can check that out

1165
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,880
And I would be interested to know if anybody has decided to take a Chromium challenge

1166
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,880
I heard from like two people

1167
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,880
Besides also Wimpy now

1168
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,880
So Wimpy you're the third person that took a Chromium challenge

1169
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,880
And you are the third person that's sticking with Chromium

1170
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,880
So I wonder if anybody else tried it and if it didn't go well for you

1171
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:03,880
And what problems you ran into

1172
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:07,880
Send us an email and maybe we'll do a follow up on that next week

1173
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:08,880
Could be kind of interesting maybe

1174
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,880
You know what, I admit, maybe I just am a wild man with the browser

1175
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,880
Alright Matt, well that's going to wrap us up

1176
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:20,880
Now I'll tell you off air my super secret plans for the Linux Action Show on Sunday

1177
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,880
Oh wait Matt, it's big, it's real big

1178
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,880
So we'll talk about that in a little bit

1179
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,880
So tune in on JBLive.tv Sunday

1180
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,880

You can show up live for that if you'd like

1184

Alright everybody, thank you so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux Unplugged

1190
01:12:50,880 --> 01:13:07,880
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday

1191
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:39,880
Alright everybody, JBtitles.com

1192
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,880
Let's pick our title and get out of here

1193
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:46,880
So Popey, are you doing anything for the Ubuntu Summit that starts in a couple of days?

1194
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,880
Oh my god, I am solidly busy

1195
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:50,880
Shave?

1196
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,880
For the next three days

1197
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:52,880
So we won't be hearing you for a little while?

1198
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,880
I need to have a shave

1199
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,880
Popey's going to be AFK

1200
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,880
Might have a shower as well

1201
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:07,880
Actually, interestingly, the lunch break, in inverted commas, is at 5 o'clock my time

1202
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,880
Which is the time when you do Tech Talk today

1203
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,880
Oh, no kidding

1204
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,880
So you're not, I mean really, don't tease, don't tease

1205
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:16,880
No I'm not

1206
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:17,880
That's pretty good

1207
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,880
And what's crazy is you don't have to go anywhere

1208
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:20,880
I'll be busy making burritos

1209
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,880
Yeah, you're going to have to stay

1210
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,880
You know what, if you wanted to stop by and you had a little burrito in your mouth, I would take it

1211
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:28,880
Popey with burrito in the mouth is better than no Popey

1212
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,880
Wow

1213
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,880
Wimpy, we need to get together and have a beer at some point to celebrate this

1214
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,880
Yeah, congratulations you guys

1215
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,880
All those beers we drank at OddCat just clearly weren't enough

1216
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,880
Well that was the investment

1217
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,880
Oh god

1218
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,880
Wow though, that's pretty neat

1219
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,880
Yeah, I've just about dried out, so yeah, I think we should

1220
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:47,880
Yeah, you know
