1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
You know about Amazon Echo, and you got Alexa, you got Google Now, you got Cortana, you got Siri.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,920
How about Mycroft?

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,480
You ready for this? Mycroft, an open-source artificial intelligence for everyone.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,040
31 backers, they're trying to get $99,000. They currently have about $4,000.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,320
29 days to go on this Kickstarter, you know we got to play this video. This is like an open-source,

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,240
open-source, here it says it uses a natural language, like this is a natural language, you speak to it,

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,520
Internet of Things device built on a Raspberry Pi.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,760
It can play media, controls lights, and more.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,480
They have all these nice little logos here. Now I'm gonna play the video for you, and then we'll talk more about it.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,240
So it's supposed to be powered by all open-source technology and all this good stuff, so let's take a look.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:55,440
Go. Go. Go. Sarah, it's time to wake up.

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:02,760
The weather in Lawrence is 73 and sunny. It will be warm today with a 10% chance of rain.

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,700
Mycroft, start some coffee, will you?

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,000
Mycroft, connect to Alice's room.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,720
Alice? Sweetie, it's time to wake up.

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,480
Mycroft, play the best of the 80s on Pandora.

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,640
All right. All right. Okay, go. Okay.

18
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,760
Heading up in here. I like her tuck shirt, too.

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Mycroft, play Avengers Assembly.

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,840
So it starts a Netflix video. As she eats her breakfast of something.

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,040
Is that a cookie? What's that she eating for breakfast? Toast, baby.

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,040
Mycroft, what's on the schedule for today?

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,200
Sarah has a meeting with Tim at 10 a.m. Alice has soccer at 4 30 p.m.

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,240
Tucks in the window.

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,240
He didn't arrive at the airport at 7 p.m.

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,360
Mycroft, lock up for the day.

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,240
Turns off the coffee pot, sets the temp and locks the doors.

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,720
That's Mycroft. An open-source home personal assistant.

29
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,240
Introducing Mycroft, the first open-source artificial intelligenceâ€¦

30
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,640
I just said that. I just said that.

31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
I just said that.

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,600
The first open-source artificial intelligence in the world.

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
I just said that. I just said that. Come on.

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:54,080
That's key, right? You can tell he's got to have that.

35
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:16,480
Look at that. How slick is that? That's neat.

36
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:35,360
All right. You can watch the rest.

37
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,600
About another minute left in the video here. I'll just jump ahead and see if there's anything

38
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,200
outrageously cool about it, but it does look like actually there's some fun left in the

39
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,320
video if you guys want to go check it out. So they talk a little bit more in the video

40
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,080
too about the Mycroft AI. They're also open sourcing the artificial intelligence software

41
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,800
that powers this thing. So it's not just the cool hardware. And they have different levels.

42
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,680
It looks like if you want to get any hardware, you're going to get it at $99. And they have

43
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,000
just a few left. Oh, no, they have a lot left. 488 out of 500. And that includes a Mycroft

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,120
unit, the enclosure with the LED display, a Raspberry Pi 2, a Wi-Fi module, standard

45
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Mycroft backplate, ethernet port. Oh, interesting. It also has ethernet and a DC 5-volt barrel

46
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:28,400
plug. And then they have a $120 or $130 one, which includes a lot more stuff. Wow, look

47
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,160
at this. They have one that includes HDMI out too. Yeah, it looks like next summer.

48
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,880
Yeah. So what do you think, Wes? You know, it might be worth it just if all that AI software,

49
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,600
you know, just getting that kind of stuff out with open licenses is pretty interesting.

50
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,520
Geez, yeah. In fact, one of the things I've thought about when the Amazon Echo came out

51
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,840
is, man, I really wish open source had a solid answer here. And, you know, listeners Scooby

52
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,240
Sprite and Seth, he was in the chat room or in the mumble room a week or two ago telling

53
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,320
us about his radio controller project. He loves his Echo. And he says it's really, really

54
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,200
slick. And it kind of makes me want one a little bit every now and then because I kind

55
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,000
of like the, you know, the Tony Stark kind of Jarvis type future. We really do need a

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,480
competitor in the free software world that can modular supports people who want to customize

57
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,080
and add their own features. All right. So what do you think, Jarem? What do you think?

58
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,400
You guys, any doubters? I think I found the setup for the new horror story that I'm going

59
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:34,040
to be writing. All right. Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. I just want to say that actually

60
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:42,640
the name Microsoft was used before for a plugin list for Firefox. Oh, interesting. Yeah. So

61
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,000
they go through they go through also it includes Roku integration, Chromecast integration,

62
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,720
smartphone app integration and a lot of different home automation systems are really kind of

63
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,200
slick, I think. I would just love to see I'm really enthusiastic because I'd love to see

64
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,480
something like this that's open source that I could be proud to have and not be a little

65
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,760
creeped out by. And it'd be really interesting to see if it does get funded, if how quickly

66
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,640
if they get enough community support to make it continue to be relevant, because that might

67
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,920
be where it's, you know, where it can actually last rather than the smart TV syndrome. This

68
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:31,440
is Linux Unplugged, episode 105 for August 11th, 2015. Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your

69
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,960
weekly Linux talk show that's ready for the Vulcan revolution. Live long and prosper.

70
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,760
My name is Chris. And this is Wes. Hey there, Wes. I'll let you do it yourself this week.

71
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,000
I figured we change it up a little bit. So Wes, I'm really glad to have you here. I guess

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,760
last week you were off getting married or something. I sure was. Lots of fun. You made

73
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,180
it back for a great show this week, Wes. Episode 105. We're going to talk about something pretty

74
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,960
cool right off the top. Artificial intelligence that's open source in just a moment. And then

75
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,640
after that, we're going to revisit the topic of file synchronization under Linux. It's

76
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,840
really heated up. And Wes here has a pretty cool solution with sync thing and another

77
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,600
open source tool that sort of stitches all of his machines together, regardless if it's

78
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,000
on the LAN or a digital ocean droplet or his Android phone. And then he can use sync thing

79
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,060
across all of them. We're going to talk about that in the show. It's really neat. Plus there's

80
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,400
a new version of Spider Oak out that has some specific improvements for Linux. And also

81
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,160
the Ubuntu one sync source code went open source this week. Then later in the show,

82
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,280
it has just announced support for Vulkan, the graphics API. This is huge, huge news

83
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,680
for Linux gaming, for desktop Linux gaming. We'll talk about why. And then at the end

84
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,440
of the show, our friends over at Firefox have been listening to the unplugged program and

85
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,960
they have a new update out specifically to address some of the issues we've complained

86
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,420
about under Linux in Firefox. So if you are a Firefox user under Linux or consider trying

87
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,680
out Firefox again under Linux, you might want to stay tuned because it's a pretty slick

88
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,160
update for Linux users. Just don't mention it to Chris. I mean literally slick user.

89
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,200
Yeah, don't tell me. Don't tell me. Cause I like slick features. I'm a slick operator.

90
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,480
I'm a slick operator. Yeah. All right. So in the pre show we were talking about this

91
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,320
really cool Kickstarter called the Mycroft and in between literally in between a few

92
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,820
moments ago and now since we started the show, we've had somebody from the Kickstarter join

93
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,840
us in the mumble room. I believe he's their chief technology officer. So I want to bring

94
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,000
him onto the show right now. Ryan, welcome to Linux Unplugged. Welcome back, I should

95
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
say. Yeah, it's good to be back. I love this show so much. Okay. So Ryan, in your own words,

96
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
what is the Mycroft device and what's your involvement with the project? So in my own

97
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,520
words, have you ever wanted to walk into your house and have it be like you're on the Starship

98
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,320
Enterprise? Yes, every day. Well, this project allows you to do that. It's an artificial

99
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,960
intelligence for controlling your entire home from entertainment to your appliances to your

100
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:11,440
lights to your music. Everything can run through Mycroft because it's powered by Linux. And

101
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,480
how much of an infrastructure is there to to just like if I'm a consumer, if I had something

102
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,160
like this is set up, put it on my table, am I am I ready to start using it or is it like

103
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:26,560
I have to write the apps for it? Absolutely. You you do not have to write anything if you

104
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,760
don't want to. That's actually a lot of questions I've gotten is, okay, it's open source. Drop

105
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,000
the code on us right now. And we're like, no, we want to, but we are putting in place

106
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,980
ways to easily manage it and contribute to the project. And and and we before we ever

107
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,560
started on this, we actually this came out of a self selfish endeavor. We wanted we had

108
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,520
this place. It's a maker space here in Lawrence, Kansas, and we wanted to power the whole place

109
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,600
using an artificial intelligence. And so we went through all these different open source

110
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,400
projects that were already out there, you know, this personal assistance type things.

111
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,120
And none of them did what we wanted. We wanted to control the lights. We wanted to be able

112
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:15,280
to add new modules and essentially make it power the entire space. And everything was

113
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,100
limited or really hard to install or really hard to configure. And we were like, this

114
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,720
is not a good shape for this to be in. I mean, we've already got things like Google Now and

115
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:32,180
Siri and Echo coming out, and they're all super tied into their own ecosystems and proprietary.

116
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,600
And we were like, this is something open source can actually do better. Well, you know, and

117
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,360
so the big differentiator here and maybe also the biggest question mark is it's running

118
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,320
a local A.I. local A.I. that seems to be powering a lot of the recognition and and all of that.

119
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,160
Is that is that all done locally? Is there no cloud component to this? There is a cloud

120
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,440
component. And we've received a lot of questions about that. We use pocket Sphinx for the keyword

121
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,160
recognition. Pocket Sphinx is a local library that analyzes, you know, it doesn't go anywhere.

122
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,740
It's just listening for its keyword. Until then, you can say anything and it's not going

123
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,220
anywhere. And that's good because you don't want everything you say in your house to be

124
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:20,400
streamed up to a server. Right. So the voice processing for the trigger words is done locally.

125
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,680
Yeah. But at that point, we actually send it off to a few different places and essentially

126
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,700
whichever comes back first, we analyze it for quality. Like, how how accurate do we

127
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,660
think this is? And then, you know, depending on how accurate that first speech to text

128
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,760
thing is and we have our own ways of kind of figuring that out, we either accept it

129
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,200
or we wait for the next one to come in. And we're hoping that people will be able to make

130
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,520
decisions for themselves, at least our technical users, for which which services they want

131
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:59,480
to use for analyzing, you know, the queries and then go from there. The machine itself

132
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,940
actually decides what to do with the query when it gets it back. So when it analyzes

133
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,520
what you say and this is really complicated and I'm sorry, there's not really a great

134
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:14,740
way to to encapsulate this into it's actually so the the the decision, the action taken

135
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,680
isn't made up in the cloud service. It's the answer is provided to the local box. And that's

136
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,500
where the decision is made on what to do. That's correct. That's correct. That's nice.

137
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,880
It comes back with a confidence. It says this is what we think it said. And then the local

138
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,860
machine goes through its modules very, very quickly to decide which one applies to that.

139
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,620
So if Chris Fisher says, I want you to play the Deadpool trailer on my TV in the living

140
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,020
room, it's going to come back. It's going to look at the media module. The media module

141
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,520
is going to say, I'm pretty sure he wants YouTube. Then the YouTube module is going

142
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,120
to be activated, which is going to cast that to the to the Chromecast in your living room

143
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:56,940
TV. Sure. Huh? That that's pretty slick. And I guess the nice thing here is if this really,

144
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,060
really reaches its goal, regardless of how well the device does, there could be a significant

145
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,140
contribution by having this open source A.I. project. So can you tell me more about that?

146
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:09,660
Like, is it a server client thing? Is it all open? Is there is there a proprietary aspect

147
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,720
to it? What's going on with this A.I. and what's it called exactly? So the A.I. itself

148
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,620
is called Mycroft. It's named after Mycroft Holmes, which is Sherlock Holmes brother.

149
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,640
It's also there's this book called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which has an artificial

150
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:32,100
intelligence in it named Mycroft. And Mycroft is important because Mycroft being Sherlock's

151
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,200
home brother was supposed to be super intelligent. He was supposed to be able to just you know,

152
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,060
he had an excellent memory, was able to just pull information out of his head at a moment's

153
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,020
notice. And so that's where the inspiration came from for the name. The actual device

154
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:52,380
itself is is completely open, open hardware, open software and the entire unit and everything

155
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:59,220
related to it is going to be open. The only thing I can imagine maybe having some parts

156
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:06,380
being held back would be some of our back end infrastructure for, you know, like we

157
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:12,100
we want everything that comes through our servers to be encrypted and anonymized. Right.

158
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,700
And so I don't know how much of our back end we're going to open source right away. I being

159
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:23,740
that I've your show actually was something that I grew with as I grew in my Linux abilities.

160
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:30,540
I started listening to it. Oh, God, like I don't want to guess how many years ago. But

161
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:36,260
and so my goal is as a result of being kind of raised in this culture and having like

162
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:43,980
a lot of my my tech knowledge grow with the open source community and my involvement in

163
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:52,460
it, I would eventually like to get everything that we that we create open source. But there's

164
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,980
also we have to find the best way to do that. We have to do it at the right time or else

165
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,380
people will be like, this software is crap. And so the the way it interfaces with home

166
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,660
automation devices, is that through like the APIs that those vendors provide? Like so SmartThings

167
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,940
Hub or Philips Hughes, that's essentially it's just interfacing with those APIs that

168
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,460
exist out there already. Yes, that's exactly right. Anything your Linux box can do, my

169
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:21,980
craft can do. Because it's built on top of Raspberry Pi. And so anything you can you

170
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:28,700
can run on a Linux box. The way that the modules are created is it can just send off a command

171
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:36,420
through, you know, through the Raspberry Pi to a device. How is that? So how is that then

172
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,680
how is that done from the user? How is that set up from a user perspective in a device?

173
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,460
It's all done with voice commands. Is there some sort of web interface? Or how do you

174
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,000
I know it's getting down to the details. I'm just curious, how does an end user do interface

175
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,640
with something like this? So there there are two ways I see it. There's the for grandma,

176
00:15:52,640 --> 00:16:00,380
you know, and then there's for someone like Chris Fisher. And grandma will use an application

177
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:05,420
to install modules that others have created. Okay. And then when they're installed, like

178
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,940
if she installs Pandora, it'll say on her on her phone or on her computer, it will say,

179
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:16,420
you know, log in, okay, we've imported your stations, you know, and then and it'll say,

180
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,500
would you like to create custom names for these stations, you know, beyond their normal

181
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:26,880
name. So if you say, play my jam, it will go directly to the station you've designated

182
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,020
as my jam. But for Chris Fisher, you might want to actually create a module that does

183
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:40,800
something related to your studio over there. And the and the way that that works is, is

184
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,620
you can create a module and install locally on your machine just by logging into your

185
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,800
machine. And then if you want to contribute it back to the community, you can and we'll

186
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,500
have a community repo where people can contribute their own modules back. We at the makerspace,

187
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,500
we have a whole bunch of drones, and we fly them. And we've also got them so we can design

188
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,460
flight paths for them. And so right now we're working on a module where we say Mycroft launched

189
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:13,500
the drone to do a perimeter check, and he goes on a predefined flight path. And so,

190
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,340
so that's the point, though, is I was getting very upset that I could get an echo or, you

191
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,780
know, one of these other devices in my house, but I would have no control over what services

192
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,360
I could use with it. Yeah, it'd be whatever Amazon told me I could use. And that's where

193
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,380
I think the big difference is people are like, I don't understand what's different. And it's

194
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,760
like, well, if you get an Amazon echo, Amazon is going to control every single thing that

195
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,340
can interface with there's that there's that, you know, they're going to because they're

196
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,260
proprietary because they're this ecosystem that's going to put their own products and

197
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,360
services ahead of others. You know, that's that's something you don't run into with Mycroft

198
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,580
because Mycroft is open and we're not going to prioritize anybody because frankly, we

199
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,840
can't, you know, there's people will be able to install whatever modules they want when

200
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,460
we don't want to limit what they can install on their own device.

201
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,100
$99,000. Is that enough to build an open source artificial intelligence and manufacture and

202
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,140
ship units like this out to customers?

203
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:18,380
So that's a really good question. The $99,000. So we've already bankrolled this a lot. We

204
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,500
come from a background of most of the people on the team. This isn't their first rodeo.

205
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:30,660
This isn't their first company. And our CEO, Joshua Montgomery, has been featured in Arstechnica

206
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,260
and a few other, you know, big online publications for his work on the Wicked Fiber Initiative

207
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:42,100
in Lawrence, Kansas to get one gigabit, you know, internet service to everybody in the

208
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:48,140
in the town. And so we've had we've had experience and we all come from different backgrounds

209
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,700
and maybe in different companies that we've played a role in, in starting and everything.

210
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,780
What this says $99,000, yes, will allow us to ship our first units, you know, that would

211
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:07,960
be great. But it will also allow us to be able to have that reassurance that we're doing

212
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,420
something that people want. And we're ready to invest more in it. Because of that, you

213
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:20,860
know, we we think that first off, we have a little bit of, you know, funds that we're

214
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:27,700
willing to pour into the project, if we know that there's some actual desire for a product

215
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:36,100
like this. And secondly, if we actually do fund that allows us to go to investors and

216
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,340
say, hey, you know, we want to take this to the next level. And here's the here's the

217
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,860
interest, you know, and everything. But I would love to see us get I'd love to see us

218
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:51,380
beat our Kickstarter goal and have enough have enough resources to actually completely

219
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,980
fund this from our fans, you know, and not have to go to investors if we don't have to.

220
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,540
But I'm but you know, we we've already planned for the next step in the event that we fund

221
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:08,500
and everybody will be able to get their unit and will be very in pretty decent shape for

222
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:14,540
a good long time. So I would say if something like this interests you, head over there and

223
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,020
back it. Yeah. And if you have any questions, you know, hit us up. You can message us on

224
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:24,580
Kickstarter. I'm in the chat, you know, occasionally. But you can also find me on Google Plus and

225
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,860
Twitter at Ryan Lee Sipes and just ask me a question. Ryan, more than happy to answer

226
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,540
them. I don't know if you're going to be around for the whole show, but if you are, I was

227
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,140
thinking maybe we could do like some Q&A with the Mumble Room in the in the post show and

228
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,260
see if maybe people have some questions and answer them, give people time to check over

229
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,100
the page and maybe come up with some questions because it looks really cool. I mean, I'm

230
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,620
really excited about an open source artificial. Yeah, we both are. Yeah, I think that could

231
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,620
be big. And so even nothing else right there. I'd love to see that. I'd love to have a little

232
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,920
unit like that in the studio, too. You know, just seems fun. Have it work, you know, come

233
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:00,240
in here in the morning and be like, MyCraft, MyCraft, activate studio and like it turns

234
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,260
on the Hughes lights and it turns on the studio, like all that kind of stuff. That's actually

235
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:10,420
something called a scene. And I'm glad that you said that because you can set things that

236
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:16,900
are called scenes, which are multiple presets. So you can say something like, you know, activate

237
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,020
studio and it turns on the lights, starts up, you know, certain machines, gets your

238
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:27,100
coffee going, plays like an awesome music in the background. Exactly. And so and that's

239
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,940
something that's that's really interesting that we've had a lot of fun working on. And

240
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,860
so really, I know you're going to maybe be doing a road trip at some point. That's about

241
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,420
that. If you work your way through Kansas, we'd love to take you around our space and

242
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:47,480
show you all the different things. And maybe even send you with a unit of your own once

243
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,900
you leave. All right. We'll have to talk more and we'll have to talk more. And I want to

244
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,560
come in and be like, MyCraft, activate Star Trek mode. And it like it makes like I have

245
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,440
all my doors in my house have to make like the Star Trek sound effect and like the bridge

246
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,820
sounds are in the background. Red Alerts. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, that'd be great.

247
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,260
If you Chris, if you back the Kickstarter, I'll make you a Star Trek. I'll personally

248
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,420
make you a Star Trek. I love it. I love it. All right. Thank you. Thank you. All right.

249
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:17,060
So if you want to stick around, we'll we'll do some follow up questions in the post show.

250
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:22,360
But I first before we go any further, I have to throw something down right now right here

251
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,860
on the show. You guys, the Gnome Foundation is very excited in their own words. They are

252
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:33,100
excited to announce publicly the search for an executive director of the foundation. And

253
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:38,380
I say search no further. Ladies and gentlemen, right here I have your director, Chris Fisher.

254
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,180
He is happy to step up and fill the role of the Gnome director. I second that nomination.

255
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,780
Thank you. Thank you. The executive director. Now let's see, what do I have to do here?

256
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,620
The executive director is critical for the foundation. That sounds like a good role for

257
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:53,020
me. This is the public face of Gnome. I could do that. You love Gnome. And I have a face

258
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,820
and I have a camera. So I can be a public face. I'm a liaison to the Gnome advisory

259
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,060
board. Well, as long as they're okay with a little bit of an ass kick. And I think I

260
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:05,300
could do that. Yeah, I could do that. All right. The primary fundraiser for the foundation.

261
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,040
Well friends, let me tell you about Ting.com. See, I can do that, right? Maybe I could get

262
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,620
Ting to sponsor the Gnome Foundation. That'd be super cool. All right. Yeah, I'm in for

263
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,640
that. All right. Yeah, I can do all of these things. So no, hold on a second. What's this

264
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,560
say? Uh oh. The executive director will execute the daily business of the foundation and work

265
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,880
with the directors of the Gnome Foundation on a regular basis. That sounds like a lot

266
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,740
of work. That sounds like a lot of work. Wes, you want this job? I don't think so. All right.

267
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,840
Well, anyways, if you want that gig, the Gnome Foundation is officially looking for a director.

268
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,420
And I don't know, it's always kind of weird when you have to publicly announce these kinds

269
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,980
of things. Yeah, it makes you think like, have they been looking and not finding? Yeah,

270
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,980
exactly. You're like, yeah, they haven't got anybody yet. I do have a Gnome face. Thanks.

271
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,060
Jordan says, I have a face for Gnome. Yeah. Could I manage that token ring, says Anne

272
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,700
podcasting. Well, maybe I could just do podcasts about Gnome. Yeah. There you go. Solves that

273
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,540
problem. And I'll just every now and then. Yeah. Widget Cyber says, but you have to cyber

274
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,380
everything and we need more hack toasters. Oh, okay. I could put Gnome on a toaster.

275
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:11,780
Yeah, definitely. All right. Well, before we get into, actually, Wes' super cool sync

276
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,060
solution. Oh, and Wimpy showed up too. So maybe Wimpy will be happy to talk to us about

277
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:20,780
sync thing. And I see Poppy's here. Maybe Poppy can rub it in her face that Ubuntu 1

278
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,500
sync has been open source. So that'll be good. All right. Should be a good segment coming

279
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:28,020
up. I think that'll be really nice. And actually, Wes was teasing me on the pre-show, I think

280
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,980
before we turned on the microphones, right? So I don't even think the pre-show folks tuned

281
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:38,600
in know your secret to how you make sync thing rock so hard. Oh, secret, secret. I'm really

282
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,940
looking forward to this. After you told me this, I'm like, I'm totally doing this. I

283
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,980
might even do a segment on just this one piece of it. It's so exciting. So stay tuned because

284
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,740
sync thing just got really super cool in my book. And plus, like I said, there's been

285
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,580
some other updates in the space, like syncing solutions just went from ho-hum in the last

286
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:59,700
six months to pretty badass. It's pretty interesting. I think they're badass. I think even the commercial

287
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,620
solutions, but I'm, hold on. I'm getting ahead of myself first. We got to talk about Digital

288
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,940
Ocean. DigitalOcean.com. Use the promo code DOUNPLUG to get a $10 credit. DOUNPLUG over

289
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,540
at DigitalOcean.com. That supports the show, keeps us going. It lets Digital Ocean know

290
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:17,860
you heard about it here. So why Digital Ocean? What is it? It's Linux infrastructure on demand.

291
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,620
If you need to deploy a server, if you need to deploy an application, don't really worry

292
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,220
about the details there. Digital Ocean has a VPS infrastructure, and they call those

293
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,300
VPS as droplets. And the reason why they do that is because they're a little more, well,

294
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,180
they're a lot more flexible than a regular VPS. You can scale them up as you need. The

295
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,940
pricing is very straightforward. If you go to Digital Ocean site, they have it broken

296
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,820
out. It starts at $5, then you go to $10, you go to $20, $40. And each along those steps,

297
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,820
you get an increase in your CPU, your hard drive, your total transfer, all of that. And

298
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,740
they also even offer hourly pricing that start at below a penny an hour. I mean, that's kind

299
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,580
of crazy. So that's a great way to do testing or if you just need to scale up on demand.

300
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,480
So that's a really nice thing about Digital Ocean is it's Linux infrastructure in a really

301
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,960
well built out cloud, all backed by Linux KVM. And it's super reliable. They have data

302
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,860
centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, and Germany. They're really

303
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,300
great connections. Like the one in Germany has 40 gigabit connections to each hypervisor.

304
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:17,380
Yeah, that's something. And with the connections on these machines are nuts. So we're going

305
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,260
to talk about syncing here in a minute. And I've used it a lot for own cloud file sync.

306
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,700
And one of the really nice things, I've had to resync like an entire huge directory in

307
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,340
own cloud a few times. And being able to pull that down from my Digital Ocean droplet as

308
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:33,820
fast as my ISP connection can take it is nice. It's just very, it feels like you're getting

309
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:39,080
a high class, well put together system. I really like that. And so they also have one

310
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,020
of the best interfaces to manage this out of anyone in the business. Their control panel

311
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,280
is super intuitive and they have an API to take all the functionality of that control

312
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,900
panel and really push it into something bigger.

313
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
Oh, you got to love that API.

314
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,380
Yeah, because you got great apps built around that. You can snap into your management infrastructure.

315
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,260
And the thing is like, okay, so I've told you all of this and you're like, well, this

316
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:00,660
sounds like a really great expensive solution. And the nuts part is it starts at $5 a month.

317
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,780
$5 a month, you get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, because they're all SSDs,

318
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:12,460
one CPU and a terabyte of transfer. And if you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, DOUNPLUGGED,

using the promo code, DOUNPLUGGED, digitalocean.com.

322
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,660
All right, let's start with the really good news, the open source news. The thing that

323
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:34,100
I think is really, I think a lot of people are happy to see, Canonical announced that

324
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,420
they are open sourcing the file sync code for Ubuntu One. They say, today we're happy

325
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,700
to be open sourcing the biggest piece of Ubuntu One's file syncing service. The code we're

326
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,140
releasing is the server side of the desktop clients connected when syncing local or remote

327
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,620
changes. This is so nice. The client side code is really, really, really, I think, a

328
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,700
weak area where my own cloud setup failed me. The code is where most of the innovation

329
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,940
and hard work went throughout the years, where we faced most of the scaling challenges and

330
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,940
on the basis of whether other components were built upon. They've released it under the

331
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,340
AGPL version three, hoping it'll be useful for developers to read through fork on their

332
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,620
own projects. That is so cool.

333
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,900
Popey, do you have any inside dope or comments or just opinions to share on this particular

334
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,380
story? I think this is...

335
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,340
Only, you know, we kept getting nagged about this for a long time because, you know, it

336
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,060
was actually quite a long time ago. We said we would do this and even our CEO posted,

337
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,460
you know, a blog post that said we would do it. And, you know, we got a little bit of

338
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,980
a stick for shutting down the service and not making the code available immediately

339
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,100
so people could spin up their own, you know. But it talks a little bit in the blog post

340
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,100
about how they had to do a bit of code cleanup and stuff and they just didn't have the resources

341
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:41,100
to do it because they're all busy doing other stuff. But they did in the end and it's available

342
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,020
and it's on Launchpad and if you want, it's on GitHub as well.

343
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,940
I heard some people say, oh, maybe your own cloud will use this. It's probably not likely

344
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,140
because I think they use a CSYNC or something under the hood. I can't remember.

345
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,260
I don't know. I mean, yeah, they may get some inspiration from it. They may be able to learn

346
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,220
something from it even if they don't actually fork the code or use it in any way. You know,

347
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,980
the code's out there. Someone may. And that's good. That's what it's there for.

348
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:08,820
Yeah, that's really neat. It's great to see that happen. And so I don't really talk about

349
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,740
my use of Spideroak much. I talk more about my use of BitTorrent Sync and Dropbox on the

350
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,620
show. But Spideroak actually is when I'm using anything that is a peer-to-peer sync solution

351
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:23,460
like BitTorrent Sync or SyncThing, I use Spideroak to sort of have my quote unquote offsite backup

352
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,580
history. I have one copy on a DigitalOcean droplet, but that's a production copy that

353
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,620
I sync to. And so I want to have something that has offsite revision changes, and I want

354
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,580
something I can trust because I have pictures of my kids and stuff in there.

355
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,700
Spideroak. And the only downside to Spideroak has been its atrocious, horrible, awful, real

356
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:46,700
bad slow UI. And it's so bad, in fact, that I just opted not to use it on any of my computers

357
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,380
except for my one main, most powerful workstation because I felt like it could handle the luggage

358
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:57,660
hug. But yesterday, they announced a new modernized look and feel, which includes a new UI under

359
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:02,780
Linux. They're calling it Spideroak 1. And Spideroak, they're also going to provide a

360
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,300
Spideroak 1 backup and sync product for groups and other enterprises. I'll be looking out

361
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,300
for that.

362
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,380
Here's a new feature for Linux users that's actually kind of nice for those of us who

363
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:15,540
have multiple machines or like those of us under maybe like Linux terminal services,

364
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,300
or anybody who has a shared Linux box. They fixed an issue with Linux users that would

365
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,020
sometime prevent multiple users of a local machine from using Spideroak concurrently.

366
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,340
So that's been resolved. Like if you sit down on somebody's machine and they already logged

367
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,980
in on one X session and you log on another X session and you both start Spideroak, there

368
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,300
would be some issues.

369
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,060
Something else that's kind of nice is they've updated, upgraded the tool chain with updates

370
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:39,940
to Qt, Python Qt, Python and OpenSSL. On Linux system, the symlink is placed in the previous

371
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,380
location where path used to be. So they've moved locations, but they thought ahead and

372
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,260
symlinked to old locations, including cron jobs and stuff will continue to operate. So

373
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,740
if you've cron Spideroak stuff in scripts, it's not going to break with this update even

374
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,940
though they're moving file locations. So it's nice to see them thinking of Linux users pretty

375
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,940
thoroughly it seems.

376
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,460
Yeah, definitely first class support or almost.

377
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,420
Yeah, it's not open source, all of it, but components of it are. It's a pretty good product.

378
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,540
So it's nice to see them releasing Linux support. And then last but not least, I was kind of

379
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:11,100
hoping Wimpy would share a little bit about his more recent successes with SyncThing and

380
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,700
just kind of an update if it's still, if he's still recommended because I know we've kind

381
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:21,540
of, you and I have sort of shared our woes over BitTorrent and their changes to a paid

382
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:26,780
model and then I sort of fell back to Dropbox and you kind of moved forward to SyncThing

383
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,700
Wimpy and have been pretty happy with the result. And so I kind of wanted to check back

384
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,940
in with you and find out how you use it and what kind of challenges you had to overcome

385
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,620
if you want to share them with us.

386
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:47,700
Yeah, sure. So, well, I'm using SyncThing on some Debian servers, some Ubuntu servers,

387
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:56,260
some Ubuntu desktops and Arch Linux workstation as well. So across those different platforms,

388
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:04,260
it all works just fine. On the desktops, I'm also using SyncThing GTK, which is a front

389
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:10,300
end to SyncThing, which makes it much more familiar, you know, if you've used Dropbox

390
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,820
or anything like that and the UI and how to add shares.

391
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,620
So this is an alternative to the web UI, so you don't have to use the web UI.

392
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:26,180
Yeah. So what it does is it sits in front of SyncThing, it uses the SyncThing API locally.

393
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:31,140
You can still open the web interface and all of the same facilities are exposed through

394
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,660
that user interface, but they're just wrapped in a, you know, desktop GUI. So everything

395
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:45,000
you see works. And one of the nice things is they've added all of the integration for

396
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:53,220
the different file managers. So they've got plugins in the file managers for Kaja and

397
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,220
Nemo and Nautilus.

398
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,820
So you get like sync status icons in the folders and whatnot?

399
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,300
Yeah, you get, you know, those right click content menus, you know, add this to sync

400
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:07,960
and all the rest of it. So it all works very well. And what has improved is you've now

401
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:14,540
got this concept of one of the SyncThing nodes being an introducer. So when you say this

402
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:22,100
is an introducer, when you add a client to it, it then tells all of the other nodes,

403
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:29,340
this new box has been added to the cluster. Do you want to have it added as well? Which

404
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:37,340
alleviates some of the key exchange, but it's still not, you know, it's still...

405
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,620
It requires I approve it, but I wouldn't, it makes it much more seamless. I just basically

406
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,420
have to click hitting yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Right.

407
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:48,320
But if you've got, if you've got five machines, for example, you've got to go to all of those

408
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,420
machines and at some point you've got to go and approve it. Yeah.

409
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,420
That's a bit of a bummer.

410
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,420
Yeah.

411
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,580
Because I'm talking hundreds of people.

412
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:03,140
Yeah. It's not, it's not a suitable replacement for what, how you were using BitTorrent sync.

413
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,980
You know, you can't use it to syndicate content in that, in that fashion.

414
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,660
Okay. Okay. But speed wise and like moving large and small files around, everything's

415
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
worked good there?

416
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:19,740
Yeah. I've not, it's not eaten any data. It synchronizes the files just fine. There's

417
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:25,780
a number of different versioning schemes you can use. So you can have no versionings. If

418
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:30,340
you delete stuff, you know, there's no history of that. Or if you modify files, there'll

419
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:35,420
be no history. And then there are different versions of how it retains history and how

420
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:42,960
many versions it will retain history for. And you can configure that on a per node basis.

421
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,900
So that's quite nice. So if you know that one of your nodes, you really don't need the

422
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:51,780
history, you can turn it off there. You can also designate one of the nodes, the master

423
00:34:51,780 --> 00:35:00,420
copy. So it will syndicate the content everywhere, but you can't delete or alter the content

424
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:07,820
on the, the cluster nodes that aren't the master copy. So the master copy is the read

425
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,940
write copy and everything else is a read only copy. So that's quite useful because

426
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:21,300
if I want to use it, for example, to backup the family photographs off site, I know that

427
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:27,580
my master copy is authoritative. And I know that if anything untoward should happen on

428
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,820
one of the nodes and accidentally delete a load of stuff, I haven't just deleted the

429
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,820
master.

430
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:39,820
Oh, yeah, it's very handy. Yeah. So Wes, Wes here is also using SyncThing quite a bit.

431
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,220
And so I'm curious, is your experience kind of reflecting Wimpy's so far? Oh, yeah, definitely.

432
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:48,100
I think Wimpy covered most of the key features. The introducer especially has been very helpful.

433
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,340
One thing I'm actively looking at is it's mostly just configured with an XML file under

434
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:56,860
.config slash SyncThing. So I'm working on trying to get that into Ansible. I think it

435
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,940
should be possible to be able to replicate those files so that you could set up nodes

436
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,980
and have them added, you know, without... And then deploy with Ansible. Right. So you

437
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,500
can configure all the ones you wanted, which ones you wanted those added to, and then hit

438
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,180
deploy and have them all spread out without... That might make it a little easier. I think

439
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,580
that's the one limiting factor. Wimpy, what are you doing for your setup when you're going

440
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,580
across multiple machines? What's your solution for that? Are you just doing it by hand each

441
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:23,980
time? On the desktop machines, I eventually visit those at some point and I'll just click

442
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,620
a button. You know, it doesn't matter that there's a node waiting to introduce itself.

443
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:35,140
When that machine gets turned on and used, just accept. On the servers, I'm using SSH

444
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:44,140
Tunnels to create a connection to the web UI on SyncThing on the remote server instances.

445
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:54,900
So I actually connect to the web UI in order to accept the new nodes and to change the,

446
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,980
you know, which computers are in the sync network for that particular folder. Because

447
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:05,220
on each node you can say who's, you know, participating in this synchronization. So

448
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,620
you don't have to have all of them synchronizing all of the folders. You can be discreet about

449
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:14,180
that. Yeah, I back up my phone's pictures this way and so I don't want my gigs of pictures

450
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,620
going to every one of my nodes. You can just easily choose. I want it to go to my home

451
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,860
machine, I want it to go to my bigger droplet, etc. And the apps on the phone are pretty

452
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,100
good for that too? Honestly, I've just been using the web interface on the phone as well.

453
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,540
I use the web interface for pretty much all of my devices. Oh really? Yeah. The app on

454
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:33,300
the phone is pretty good. I'm still kind of playing with the always on. I've had some

455
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,460
issues but that might be the status of the phone. So let's use this moment to jump in.

456
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,480
You do something kind of cool you were telling me about in the pre-show is you are looping

457
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:47,100
in something called Tink, T-I-N-C. And Tink is a virtual private network daemon that uses

458
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,140
tunneling encryption to create an open source secure private network between hosts. It's

459
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,140
kind of like, I don't know if mesh VPN is the right phrase or what you want to call

460
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,100
it, it's almost like a peer-to-peer VPN because you can have a bunch of different desperate

461
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,540
machines that will interconnect over this sort of ad hoc VPN. So imagine a machine on

462
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,780
your LAN, a digital ocean droplet, and an Android device, right? Exactly. And can you

463
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,460
explain a little bit about how you use Tink and how different ways to use Tink? Because

464
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,900
you were saying there's a couple different ways you could use it and how you're using

465
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:18,060
it. Yeah, you can use it kind of like a traditional site-to-site VPN or like a layer two bridge.

466
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:22,060
So you can have it, you can use it to play StarCraft with your friends over broadcast.

467
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,900
For LAN gaming. For LAN gaming. You can use it to bridge two sites so that you can access

468
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,900
all of your home stuff from your office or et cetera. Right now, I'm using it just as

469
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:35,580
a layer three VPN. So I have an entirely separate subnet set up so that one of the nice things

470
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:40,020
about Tink is that it runs entirely as a, as long as you have, you know, tune tap support,

471
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,980
then it runs entirely as a user space application. So you don't need lots of crazy setup. You

472
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,740
don't have to compile a kernel module. Right. You know, it also has support for a lot of,

473
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,860
you know, let's see here. It says Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OSX, Solaris even, Windows

474
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,500
2000, XP, Vista and more. Yeah. So you can pretty much run it. It also has a very good

475
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,820
Android app. So mine set up that all of my devices have a statically assigned P on their

476
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:07,220
Tink, IP on their Tink interface. And so I just have all those IPs. And so you can set

477
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,240
it up. It has a system D service. So when you install it, it creates a virtual interface

478
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,580
and this virtual interface has like, it gets a 192 address or whatever the heck. And each

479
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,300
machine that gets your, each machine you install Tink on sets up a virtual interface and you

480
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,180
set the 192 IP on. So they're all on the 192 subnet. Exactly. Okay. And then they can all

481
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:30,060
instantly see each other. And the way it's set up is that it uses certificates, which

482
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,260
can be a pain to manage. But if you've got a configuration management solution already,

483
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,560
it's not too much of a big deal. Not all of us do, Wes. Not all of us do. I'm still working

484
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:42,980
on that myself in all fairness here. But you, you only need the certificates for hosts that

485
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,140
you want to directly connect to. Okay. So I have one droplet, actually I have two droplets

486
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,500
that serve kind of an, you know, an HA system where all of my nodes try to connect to both

487
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,700
of those. So if one goes down, it still works. But once you have a certificate and you've

488
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,420
connected to one node, it can connect through that node to any other one. And once it's

489
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:03,340
established that connection, it negotiates how to directly connect those two peers. Oh,

490
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,940
so Exciter just takes care of that for you. Yeah, exactly. And so that's the mesh aspect

491
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,620
of it. I gotcha. So that once you, as long as you have enough nodes that each node knows

492
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,980
about and as long as there's some route between all of them, they can actually work it out.

493
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,020
They can work it out and talk to each other. That's like, and so are you throwing a couple

494
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,380
of droplets in there? That probably helps quite a bit. Yep. I've got another server

495
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,740
of over in the Netherlands that the bigger hard drive that just sits there so I can mirror

496
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,540
stuff. So when you're looking here at your SyncThing set up, is that a, are you looking

497
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,720
at a droplet you're doing? Are you on your Tink network when you're doing that? Cause

498
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,740
when you were pulling up here at, what is that? What is that? Yeah. So here I've just

499
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,460
SSHed into my home connection from one of the machines. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then just

500
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,020
did a tunnel there or what? Yeah. And so the way I've set it up is that SyncThing is running,

501
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,460
I've configured it so that everything, SyncThing only connects over the Tink VPN. Right. And

502
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:50,380
so each one I've just set in, when I've added a peer to the SyncThing, it just has the local,

503
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,300
you know, the private address on the Tink network. Yeah. And they all just instantly

504
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,340
find each other. Yeah. And that way I can go to any, you know, I know like. You're syncing

505
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,140
over the internet, but over a VPN over the internet. Right. And so it doesn't matter

506
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,500
if I change or if I bring my laptop here, you know, once I've turned on Tink, which

507
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,740
it does at boot, then it has the same address. Everything else can instantly find it. It's

508
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,660
worked really well. Hmm. That's pretty slick. That's a nice way. And so you also have Tink

509
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:15,260
on your Android device? And honestly, it's been, I've been very impressed with the Tink

510
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:20,060
Daemon. I'm not sure if it requires root, but it's very aggressive. Do you have root?

511
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,340
I do have root. Oh, okay. I know that's the funny thing. Like once you root your device,

512
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,360
you kind of lose track of what requires root. Yeah, definitely. But it's very aggressive

513
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,700
when you change connections, you know, from, from wifi to LTE. Yeah. You can even run it

514
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:35,500
over OpenVPN if you have like really choice on that. I've had some problems with that.

515
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,820
And so it's, it's good about you're changing network conditions. You're, you know, moving

516
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,420
between wireless and LTE and it's not sucking down your battery like crazy? No, hardly at

517
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,260
all. So your phone has an interface that's on your Tink network. Yeah, so wherever my

518
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,980
phone is, I can just ping it. I know the IP. I have a static host file set up so I can

519
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,660
just ping Nexus 5 and it will automatically route over the Tink network. If it can't,

520
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,940
if there's like some really crazy firewall and it can't, you know, initiate a connection

521
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,020
directly, it'll go through the droplet if it needs to. It kind of just... And do you

522
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,740
have any problems like when you bring the device back home and you put it on your local

523
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,860
LAN, stuff doesn't try to talk it over the Tink interface, it starts talking over the

524
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:14,220
LAN interface or? Not generally. I have most things I've configured at this point to just

525
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:18,420
do it. So like on the Tink thing, I've set it up to only talk over Tink. Yeah. And so

526
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,060
you can do that too. So you can set up like, you know, if you want, if you only want SSH

527
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:25,180
to listen, you can just have it listen on that port. I like, the chat room's impressed

528
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:29,340
that it has Celera support. I know, it's kind of crazy. You know, and I would be interested

529
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,260
in listening, you know, the Mumble Room if there's other mesh VPNs. I know I've looked

530
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:38,180
at Freelan, there's peer VPN, and a lot of them looked maybe easier. The one thing that

531
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,420
Tink has going for it is it's kind of like, it's already 10 years old, it has a long established,

532
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:45,180
it has an active development. It also has the Android app, which a lot of the other

533
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,180
solutions might not have. That's nice. And it sounds like it's an actual functional

534
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,900
Android app too, which is nice. Yeah, it definitely works really well. Yeah, I don't know, does

535
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:55,060
anybody in the Mumble Room know of any other sort of mesh VPN kind of solutions like this?

536
00:42:55,060 --> 00:43:00,740
I don't know if I do. I remember that there used to be like a... Amagi. Yeah, Amagi, the

537
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,580
Amagi from LogMeIn folks used to have that, but that's not around anymore, is it? I thought

538
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:15,260
they shut that down. It still is, but it's hard to get. Okay, all right. And then there

539
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,740
was kind of a long end-to-end as being mentioned by API. I think that's been no longer developed,

540
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:24,220
right? Yeah, and then like you mentioned, Freelan is also available, peer VPN, the open

541
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,740
source peer-to-peer VPN, and ServoMesh. So, okay, there's another topic, there's another

542
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,260
kind of sync that we don't really talk about when we talk about taking control of sync

543
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,420
in your own files, and that is the browser sync. And that's, you know, my favorite feature

544
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,140
about Chrome, honestly, is I think it's got the best browser sync. The tab sync is real

545
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:47,380
quick, but the Mozilla Firefox sync has gotten really good in the last couple of years, and

546
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:52,500
it's got a huge leg up over the Chrome stuff. And this came in from a link in our subreddit,

547
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:57,340
and I think it was also linked in the Linux subreddit. You can run your own Firefox account

548
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:02,340
server on your LAN, if you want, and sync your Firefox browser to your own sync server.

549
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:06,660
And so I have linked here, it's a guide, it's kind of early, it's, they say, the author

550
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:11,540
says it's quote-unquote vastly incomplete, but you can ask questions if you want to drop

551
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:16,100
by their IRC. They have some devs available, I think, for Ubuntu machines and things like

552
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:20,960
that, but this walks you through setting up a local Firefox sync server, and then how

553
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,980
you configure Firefox to use that local sync server. So, you know, you could put this on

554
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,420
a droplet, you could put this on a LAN server, this is another component to sync that we

555
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,980
don't talk a lot about, but I think this browser sync stuff is getting super important. The

556
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,980
browser for me is like one of my number one applications now.

557
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,380
And you kind of expect, you know, you expect it to come up with your history and your bookmarks

558
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,380
wherever you are.

559
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,380
Oh yeah, and my extensions.

560
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,380
Right, oh yeah, definitely.

561
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,540
You know, like now when I install Privacy Badger, I expect it, boom, Privacy Badger's

562
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,020
on every browser. Even though that has its downsides too, it's just kind of what I've

563
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,020
come to expect.

564
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,940
Exactly, and it doesn't feel like it's your setup if it's not there.

565
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:57,300
All right, MumbleRoom, any thoughts on the sync topic before we move on to our Vulkan

566
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,300
topic?

567
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,740
Put it out there. Go on once. No? Go on twice.

568
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,580
All right, now, you know, we've been using, we kind of fell back to Dropbox a little bit

569
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,380
because I needed a hell of a lot of space, I didn't want to manage anymore, I needed

570
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:14,140
like five terabytes of space. And Dropbox worked for that, it's working pretty well

571
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:17,860
for us, but geez, Louise, it's expensive. It's like $800 for five people to use the

572
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:18,860
enterprise version.

573
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:19,860
Oh, wow.

574
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,860
Yeah.

575
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,860
That is expensive.

576
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,860
Yeah.

577
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:28,980
So I don't know, yeah. But it gives you nice functionality, like I can revoke files, so

578
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,540
I can, if we got rid of somebody, I can pull all the files off their machine and things

579
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,020
like that. So those kinds of things are nice.

580
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,020
Yeah, definitely.

581
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,020
Creepy, but nice.

582
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,340
And they have seemed to make Linux support, you know, they definitely support Linux pretty

583
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,340
well, which is really nice.

584
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,020
Yeah, they do. All the Linux clients have worked well. Yeah, what was that?

585
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:47,700
Did you see that there's a small business slash enterprise version of Spideroak that

586
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,620
has unlimited data?

587
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:53,460
I saw that there's a couple of different, like they have, and they have like a enterprise

588
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,020
edition, they have a backup only edition. I didn't see it was unlimited storage though.

589
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,020
Holy crap.

590
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:04,580
Yeah, it's like $50 per person, I think, but you get, it sounds like if you're paying $500,

591
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,020
you know, for five people, then that might be something to look into.

592
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,820
Yeah, I'm not sure.

593
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:15,300
I use the, I use the one terabyte subscription and I love it.

594
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,460
I think I got it like, I got it like on a, like they had like a crazy deal for the one

595
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:25,420
terabyte, like a one day deal. And so I bought in on that one day deal for like $9 for the

596
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:29,140
year I get a terabyte or something. I can't remember. It was really super great. And so

597
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:35,140
I jumped in on that and I love it. And Spideroak for me has been really good except for the

598
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,820
UI. So I was really super happy to see them update the UI.

599
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,820
Same here.

600
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:42,820
I have not updated my machine yet, but I'm hoping it comes down soon. All right. Well,

601
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:48,260
let me take a moment and let's thank our friends over at Ting. You know, if you go to linux.ting.com,

602
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:53,460
you can support the unplug program, but also you'll get a discount on your first Ting device.

603
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,580
Or if you have a Ting service or if you have something that's compatible with Ting service,

604
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:02,140
I mean, you can get a $25 service credit. So Ting is, it's a wireless network that is

605
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:06,180
able to offer certain advantages that the sort of established duopolies can't. Because

606
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:11,260
the big guys that are duopolies have this massive, massive amount of money that is just

607
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:16,300
totally sunk into those towers. Those antennas they put up, and it's not just the antennas

608
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:21,420
and all of the negotiation to get those. I had a client that they did the architect for

609
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,660
cell towers. They were the architects for cell towers. And you think, oh, that sounds

610
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:29,180
like an interesting gig. It was a super boring place because 90% of their office was for

611
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,680
all of the legal stuff they had to do to get the towers approved and all the different

612
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,380
places they want to put cell towers. And the process and work is a multi-year process for

613
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,500
a single tower. And then you have to trench and install all the fiber and connect all

614
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:46,620
of that and get all those negotiations and secure the line. It is an unbelievable cost.

615
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,900
And you can kind of understand why these duopolies have to turn into such jerks after all of

616
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:54,160
that. I mean, I guess I'd kind of be a jerk if I had done all that too. Ting rolls in

617
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,480
and they say, you know, we're going to do mobile differently. Now that this has all

618
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,360
been laid in, it's been commoditized, we're going to come in here and what we're going

619
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,920
to do is we're going to buy off the top of your wireless infrastructure. And so we'll

620
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:08,020
take what has now been commoditized. And that way, Ting can spread across GSM and CDMA networks.

621
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,880
They can bridge the two different types of networks, and then you can take advantage

622
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,640
of it as a consumer for whichever one fits you better. That's really slick. Then they're

623
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,400
also able to focus on things like customer service, no whole customer service, or a super

624
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,940
awesome web app that lets you manage your account in just every single way you could

625
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:26,320
possibly want. And they're able to focus on things like crazy good deals. Here's what

626
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:32,600
it is, $6 a line. That's it, plus any taxes that your local state's going to apply. It's

627
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,920
$6 a line, and then it's just your usage on top of that. Ting takes your minutes, your

628
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,420
messages, and your megabytes to add them together. And they're able to offer a crazy competitive

629
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:44,040
deal that nobody else can offer because they didn't have to spend all the billions on putting

630
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,320
all of those things in the ground. They're able to come around later on and say, okay,

631
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,760
thank you very much for all that hard work. Here, now we'll just take some of that for

632
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,080
you. We'll borrow some of that. We'll give you this here, and we'll sign on the dotted

633
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:58,040
line. And boom, then Ting became an MVNO of these networks, and it allows them to be competitive

634
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:03,640
in a way that nobody else can. No contracts, no early termination fees. They even have

635
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,300
early termination relief programs, so if you're stuck in a contract right now, they're going

636
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:11,560
to help you get out of it. How slick is that? And they have some really, really, really

637
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,960
great devices, GSM and CDMA, basically the best of the bunch. They have really great

638
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,960
value devices. They have all the high-end phones. Like the S6 is super slick. They got

639
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,280
the iPhone 6. Anything that basically works on that huge GSM network, and they have a

640
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,440
coverage checker, it's probably going to work on Ting, including just they have $9 SIMs

641
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,920
that you can just go grab, throw on your device, and boom, Bob's your uncle. You got cell service.

642
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,400
Bob is indeed your uncle. Just ask Robert. Go to linux.ting.com. You get $25 off your

643
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,040
first device. If you already have a Ting-compatible device, and you might, because let's be honest,

644
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,800
cell phones have been around for a while now, and there's a lot of GSM and CDMA devices

645
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,800
out there.

646
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,800
They support so many devices. It's incredible.

647
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,080
Yeah. So you could probably get a $25 credit, and if you do, well, that'll pay for more

648
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,160
than your first month if your usage is around mine, especially if you're Wi-Fi savvy. It's

649
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,920
really awesome. It's really awesome. And there's a lot of cool ways to interact with

650
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,360
Ting as well. They have the no-hold customer service. They have their forms. They also

651
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:07,520
have the Ting subreddit. You can go to reddit.ting.com. They have the Ting social pages like their

652
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,480
Google+, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and their YouTube channel where they're posting

653
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:18,480
stuff all the time. Go check them out. Linux.ting.com. Linux.ting.com. Support the show. Put Linux

654
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,920
in your browser bar. Get it in your history after all. Just go check them out. Try the

655
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,160
savings calculator. Visiting them and just exploring Ting and learning more is also a

656
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:32,240
way to show your support for this show. Linux.ting.com. Mobile that really does make sense.

657
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:37,960
Okay. Maybe somebody can talk me down, but I don't often have extremely, extremely good

658
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,760
things to say about Google, but holy moly am I really, really, really excited about

659
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:49,360
them announcing support for Vulkan on Android. This to me is a ginormously huge deal. And

660
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,960
so in a very wordy post, they essentially say, in order to address some of the sources

661
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,420
of CPU overhead and provide developers with more explicit control over rendering, we've

662
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:03,360
been working to bring the new 3D rendering API Vulkan to Android. Like OpenGL ES, Vulkan

663
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:08,400
is an open standard for 3D graphics and rendering maintained by the Khronos Group. Vulkan is

664
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,920
being designed from the ground up to minimize CPU overhead in the driver and allow for your

665
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,340
application to control GPU operation more directly. Vulkan also enables better parallelization

666
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:23,600
by allowing multiple threads to perform work such as command buffer construction at once.

667
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:29,960
And Vulkan is sort of being touted as the successor to OpenGL. Apple introduced Metal.

668
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,960
Are you familiar with Metal?

669
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,960
I am.

670
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,920
Can you describe Metal for me, Wes, while I take a sip of my soda? Go for it. You got

671
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:35,920
it? You want to take a crack at that?

672
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,040
Well, it was their version of a new low-level API on the iOS platform.

673
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,740
Yeah, and didn't they just reintroduce it for Mac OS? Didn't they just introduce it

674
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,740
for Mac OS?

675
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,800
I believe they did, which I believe you predicted.

676
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,840
I think I did. Now, here's the thing. That is a little precarious for OpenGL.

677
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,840
Definitely.

678
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,160
Because one of the things that put more momentum recently behind OpenGL was the fact that mobile

679
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,800
developers to target iOS...

680
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,000
Which is one of the biggest platforms for games and other graphics.

681
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,480
Were writing to OpenGL. And same with Android.

682
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,480
Definitely.

683
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,320
And so if Android came along and said, all right, we're going to introduce Liquid, the

684
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:14,760
new low-level API for graphics on Android, I almost feel like that would be a death nail

685
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,380
for OpenGL in a way. I mean, not in a huge way, but it definitely slowed down momentum.

686
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,640
So I guess death nail isn't the right word, but it feels like it would slow down momentum

687
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,640
in a big way.

688
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,240
And as Linux users, OpenGL is kind of the one thing we have.

689
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,880
Yeah, and so Vulkan is... They're already working on getting Linux support. In fact,

690
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,280
I think this video here might be being done under Linux right here. I'm not sure, but

691
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:41,040
I have a video I'm playing. It's gnomes per second, and on the right is OpenGL, and on

692
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,280
the left is Vulkan. And as I zoom out here, you'll really see the difference between OpenGL

693
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,280
and Vulkan.

694
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,400
And you'll see there's a CPU reader there, and OpenGL is just punishing the CPU, and

695
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,280
it's still dropping frames like crazy. And then as Vulkan continues to go up, Vulkan

696
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,160
does hit the CPU when things get really crazy, but way, way, way, way less than OpenGL is.

697
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,720
So look at these gnomes per second differences between OpenGL and Vulkan.

698
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,960
Pretty big... The Vulkan is much smoother, much less CPU overhead, especially when you

699
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:15,760
start applying real-time coloring effects. Then OpenGL really starts beating the CPU.

700
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,880
And not only that, but you see how much better Vulkan is. It's a little hard to see there,

701
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,200
but Vulkan's much better at parallelization across CPUs, too. So once it does start punishing

702
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,360
the CPU, OpenGL hits like two threads, where Vulkan's hitting all four threads.

703
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,840
Yeah, it's designed from the ground up to be easily to parallelize like that.

704
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,960
Yeah, and these are on PowerVR graphics chips, so these would be like on Nexus devices or

705
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,420
something like that. That's where this is being done on this demo.

706
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:44,000
And so Vulkan's supposed to be the big hotness. Ryan, are you familiar with Vulkan? And what

707
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,920
do you think about this?

708
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:53,800
Well, specifically in regards to Android getting support for Vulkan, I just think that this

709
00:53:53,800 --> 00:54:00,420
is another instance where there's so many things that we're doing now with our mobile

710
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:07,640
devices that it's almost like a foregone conclusion. Like, we need to have the best on this platform

711
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:14,820
to manage these 3D games and applications that we're inevitably getting more and more

712
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:22,280
of every day. And I just think that I've been watching some younger relatives on their mobile

713
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:28,560
devices and they go to it for everything, for like games, entertainment. And it's so

714
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:33,720
funny because it's like this is the same type of thing we used to do back with our desktop

715
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:38,720
rigs that we made and everything. And they're talking about the differences between their

716
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,960
devices and these are just their phones that they have around with them and what games

717
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,120
are playing on them and everything.

718
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:51,480
And so while some people, like I know a couple of people who are my friends who can't see

719
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:58,520
how it's a gaming platform and how it needs these different, like for instance, Vulkan

720
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:02,880
to make that experience all the more better when you're playing 3D games or interacting

721
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,640
with 3D applications on the platform. They don't see the need necessarily, but there's

722
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:15,080
a bunch of people who they do everything, you know, including gaming on these devices.

723
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:21,460
And so it makes sense that they would try to, you know, A, close that gap between them

724
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:29,040
and the iPhone with metal, but also B, just improve their platform and add this so that

725
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:35,860
more people will consider creating 3D applications on the platform and will feel comfortable

726
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:36,860
taking advantage of this.

727
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:41,280
This is not my strong suit and I hope to learn more about Vulkan as it becomes more relevant.

728
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:47,280
But my understanding is that Vulkan is pretty capable of when it starts up Vulkan can start

729
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,280
up and sort of assess the graphics capability of the system and developers just sort of

730
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,280
write to Vulkan.

731
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,580
And instead of like having to wonder if there's going to be a certain OpenGL extension available

732
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:01,000
on this system and just maybe assuming it's not there so just not being able to do that

733
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,400
thing, they'll write to Vulkan and Vulkan will just sort of expose what's available

734
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,360
sort of on demand based on the hardware and it's going to range from PowerVR chips all

735
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,640
the way up to NVIDIA's big rigs.

736
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,560
In fact, NVIDIA has just announced they're going to be showing off a couple of different

737
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:21,560
demos at an upcoming conference using Vulkan under Linux. So obviously these demos we just

738
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,000
watched here on the show are on PowerVR chips, but NVIDIA in a couple of weeks will be showing

739
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,240
it on Linux desktop rigs. So Vulkan's going to scale across the entire spectrum there.

740
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:34,320
So Google throwing in behind this is a huge deal because through Coder Radio I've gotten

741
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:40,680
emails from developers who tell me we moved our game over to Linux because we learned

742
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,560
more about Linux than we expected when we started developing our game for Android.

743
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,560
That's awesome.

744
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,560
Yeah.

745
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,560
And so, yeah.

746
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,560
Finally Android's paying off.

747
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,800
And I was like, really? And they're like, yeah, well when you really, you know, when

748
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,680
you make a game you're not making a Java app. When you're making a serious game for Android

749
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,680
it's a native app.

750
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,680
Right.

751
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,880
And when you start playing with that stuff you start monkeying around with the Linux

752
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,320
level a little bit. And you start, you know, learning a little bit about this stuff. And

753
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,200
it's not a one to one, but it gave us a starting point. And this isn't one or two times I've

754
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,200
heard this either. It's a couple of times, but I mean, it's been a little while, but

755
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:15,320
I've probably heard it, you know, half a dozen times over the history of Coder Radio. And

756
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,360
so I've got to imagine Vulkan's only going to play into that even more. So that's why

757
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,760
I think it's a bigger deal than we can even realize right now that they're doing this.

758
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,440
It's like the biggest favor that Google could do for desktop Linux gaming. And just seeing

759
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,480
all these people actually supporting it even at this early stage is heartening.

760
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:34,320
Yeah. Yeah, that too. Yeah, that too. That very much is. So, and I know, yeah.

761
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:38,680
Oh, I was just going to say, and Chris, this is just something that your show has been

762
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:45,640
tracking for a while now, but as, as SteamOS, you know, gets out there, it's going to, I

763
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:51,420
feel like it's going to be the Android of, you know, gaming PCs because it's, everybody's

764
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:57,600
going to just license it and throw it on a machine. And there's going to be this, I think

765
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:02,800
that the, all these different platforms are being built on Linux now that developers are

766
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,280
getting introduced to it and they're saying like, oh, it's not that it's not as big of

767
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,800
a problem as I thought it was to go ahead and write, you know, this application for

768
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:17,920
this platform. And, and so I'm really excited to see maybe as more people get introduced

769
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:24,080
to like Vulkan, for instance, through Android, like you said, that they see, okay, well,

770
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:30,160
maybe it won't take that much more time to port this over to the desktop. And frankly,

771
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,800
there's really not a downside because it's just potentially more customers because I've

772
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,480
already done a bulk, you know, a lot of the work.

773
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,740
That's the hope. North Ranger, you wanted to make a comment about how Vulkan is sort

774
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:45,840
of hopefully going to avoid the extensions hell that OpenGL found itself in after years.

775
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:51,160
Yeah, definitely. I think, you know, Kronos has a leg up here. And one thing that they

776
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:59,000
did lessons learned from OpenGL versioning and all of the proprietary extensions and

777
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,800
the vendor specific extensions that these engines and these games had to test for is,

778
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:09,240
you know, grouping up all the individual extensions into feature sets. So instead of having a

779
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:15,480
separate OpenGL ES and an OpenGL 4, you know, your engine just tests for the feature set

780
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:22,680
and the real key, I think, you know, improvement in the process is that Kronos will be able

781
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:28,600
to define those feature sets if the platform owner doesn't step in. So Google will take

782
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:35,440
care of it for Android. Valve might take care of it for Steam OS. But if Microsoft doesn't

783
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,360
define a feature set for Windows Vulkan, then they'll just step in and go ahead and work

784
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,960
with the driver vendors directly.

785
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:46,960
That's actually really great. So we could still have a first class implementation on

786
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,560
Windows. That could be nice. Actually might even be better if you take Microsoft out of

787
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,560
the picture.

788
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:57,520
Hey-oh. All right, cool. That's really, boy, that's, I think, some of the best Google news

789
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,240
that I've seen in a long time. I mean, I think it was really, that was a really good guy

790
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,920
Google, and that was actually an example of them being a good open source citizen too

791
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,920
there.

792
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:06,920
Definitely.

793
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,120
All right. Let's talk about somebody else who's a good open source citizen and that's

794
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:13,840
Linux Academy. In fact, they have a $5,000 grant program where their stakeholders can

795
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:17,320
help them decide where they're going to contribute that money out to open source projects. And

796
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:21,200
the reason is because they're a bunch of open source and Linux nuts. Enthusiasts, just like

797
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,760
we are. They have a great platform for you to go over there and learn about Linux and

798
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:29,080
all of the technology around it associated with it. OpenStack and the Red Hat technology

799
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:33,240
stuff for the certified courses. And of course, all of the things like Android development

800
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,680
and Ruby on Rails that kind of run on top of Linux, but the core fundamentals of Linux

801
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:41,200
itself too. They've got almost 1,700 videos to give you the experience you need. And they

802
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:46,320
have a really nice system that allows you to choose from seven plus distros. And then

803
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,800
it automatically will adjust the courseware to match the distro you've chosen. And then

804
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:55,080
when the courseware has a virtual machine, it matches the virtual machine. All of that

805
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:59,060
all syncs up. But I think what I really like about it is how they all sort of map it out

806
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:03,300
in their management dashboard. You go in there, you see all the stuff you're currently taking,

807
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,360
what percentage you're at, how long it's going to take you, how long you've spent, any notes,

808
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:10,000
any comprehensive study guides you want to download. And I think something else they've

809
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
done that really helped me sort of actualize what I was reading and learning is the scenario

810
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,860
based labs. So you get lab servers and then you go in there and you get put in the middle

811
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:24,380
of a common task in an everyday environment. And you work in these advanced lab environments

812
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,840
and complete these scenarios from beginning to end. And you walk away feeling, gosh, I've

813
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,040
actually done this now. And if you ever get stuck, they have instructor help available.

814
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:36,320
They have live stream sessions that are really great and they often will post them online

815
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,760
later for the community. And speaking of the community, it's stacked full of Jupyter broadcasting

816
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,580
members which is kind of fun. And these nuggets are a great source if you just want to do

817
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:47,200
a deep dive into something that lasts two to 60 minutes. They're constantly adding new

818
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:54,200
material. Go over to Linux Academy. Check them out. See what they've got. Like, you

819
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:58,980
know, I think one of the things that really helped me click with the Linux Academy was

820
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:02,320
when I decided, well, what would it take to learn Python? What would it take to learn

821
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:07,220
Ruby? And how would you answer that question? How do you answer the question, what would

822
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:12,200
it take to go learn a new language? Well, the answer is pretty obvious. I log into Linux

823
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,320
Academy. Oh, it's going to take me six hours. Well, it's going to take me five hours, whatever.

824
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,280
You know, it depends. I think like one was an hour longer than the other. I can't remember

825
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,960
which one was longer. That's ridiculous. You're telling me I could learn how to do Python

826
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:28,240
development in five hours? What? That's amazing, right? And it's pretty inspiring. And you

Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program.

831
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:50,120
Okay, so there's this really great update from Mozilla about Firefox. And I sometimes

832
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:58,000
give Firefox a hard time. But version 40. That's a big ass version number. Holy crap.

833
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:05,120
I remember, I remember when Firefox was announced. So version 40. Support for Windows 10. There

834
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:12,040
you go. There you go. I bet you like it about that. They're blocking unsigned extensions.

835
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,400
That's a big one. But here's the one for Linux users that I'm pretty, I'm pretty, I think

836
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,960
each one of these could have been a bullet point, and they just put it all in one bullet

837
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:24,240
point. Improved scrolling, improved graphics and video playback performance, and off the

838
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:31,040
main thread compositing. Under Linux only. Linux exclusive feature buddy. Finally catching

839
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:38,440
up to Chrome here. Off the main thread compositing. Improved scrolling, graphics and video playback.

840
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:42,580
Linux exclusive features. Come on. Well, at least in this update. Maybe they already had

841
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:46,080
them for Windows. Off the main thread compositor seems like a really big deal to me though.

842
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:50,300
Definitely. I think that's one of the main Firefox's pain points in the past is its main

843
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:55,960
thread heavy. Yes, yes. So they have also smoother animation and scrolling on Windows via hardware

844
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:59,520
v-sync. So the Windows got a little something too. You know, those guys over in Windows.

845
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:03,800
A bunch of other new changes as well, but I just thought it was particularly cool. So

846
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:07,640
there you go, Poppy. You can relaunch your Firefox challenge now. Wait, are you still

847
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:11,840
on? Not happening. Oh, you went back to Chrome. You did go back to Chrome. Yeah, I'm back

848
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:15,920
on Chrome now. You gave me such a hard time for going back to Chrome too, and then you

849
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:21,280
just never said anything to me. Because that's not how I remember it at all. Okay, okay,

850
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,520
all right. So, okay, why did you go back? Can I ask? I mean, I don't want to get into

851
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:28,440
the whole war again. I'm just kind of curious because I never heard. Because Firefox was

852
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:33,080
a crashy, horrible mess. No matter what I did. And everyone kept telling me, oh, it's

853
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:37,380
your extensions. That's what it is. It's the distro version of Firefox. They would give

854
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:41,120
me all the different reasons and I just gave up and switched right to Chrome. I heard those

855
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:45,720
reasons too. I totally understand as someone who's using the Ubuntu version of Firefox

856
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:52,080
right now. It's fine. It doesn't crash. That's always what we hear. That's always what we

857
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:56,600
hear. Yep. And you know what? It must be true. It must be true because it's still, and now

858
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:00,860
Rodden, have you, do you know anything about this off the thread compositing, off the main

859
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:06,240
thread compositing, all these Linux updates? Yeah, it's one of the stepping stones to electrolysis.

860
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:10,880
I thought so. Excellent. Okay, good, good. That will be just right around the corner

861
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,800
any day now, I'm sure then. That's good stuff. I think whatever we think about it, it's just

862
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:19,560
nice to see them keeping pace, right? Absolutely. Firefox, I think we need as a member of the

863
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:23,480
open source ecosystem. And to be honest with you, I have Firefox still installed in all

864
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,320
my machines. Me too, definitely. And totally going to get the update, totally going to

865
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:32,400
try it out. But yeah, I keep going back to Chrome, but you know what? I'm very, very

866
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,040
happy. Like you said, they're not leaving us Linux users out. That's a way to put it

867
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:40,440
on a positive note there, Wes. I like that. That's my job, I guess. So next week is some

868
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:44,760
crazy shenanigans going on. We're going to be hopefully live at LinuxCon for Linux Unplugged.

869
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,680
I have no idea how we're going to do that. I have no idea how we're going to do the mumble

870
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:54,120
room from down there. And Wes is going to be out of town on his honeymoon. So Wes won't

871
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:59,360
be here, but I think that probably, Noah will probably be in your seat. And if all goes

872
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:04,200
as planned, everybody should be able to show up at jblive.tv around our regular live time.

873
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:07,920
I'll try to be there from Hawaii. Really? Dude, no, come on. You should be humping

874
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,920
or something. You should hump and listen to the show. A man can do two things at once.

875
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,320
That's a good point. You know what? If you want to just send me a telegram, I'll just

876
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:19,080
start talking like this. I'll keep it low. So I don't know exactly how next week's show

877
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:22,440
is going to shake out, but please do try to show up because it would be so cool to have

878
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:27,160
like a nice showing at LinuxCon. I don't know exactly what we're going to do, but we want

879
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,720
to do something. And then we might also be live later in the evening next Tuesday for

880
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:35,280
the open source t-shirt contest that Angela is going to be judging for.

881
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:40,440
That's very exciting. So next week is going to be a little crazy,

882
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:45,440
and hopefully it'll all work out just fine. And one more bit of crazy shenanigans that

883
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:53,480
I wish I could kill with fire, but it's unavoidable. We're moving last from Friday back to Sunday

884
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:59,920
for one more week. Noah is going to be traveling Friday morning here to Seattle for LinuxCon,

885
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:05,320
and my dad's getting married Friday evening, which makes doing last on Friday totally impossible.

886
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:09,160
So we just moved it to Fridays, and then all of this stuff happened. So we're going to

887
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:15,240
go back to Sunday at our regular live time one more time. We'll probably go back to Friday

888
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,840
after that for a little while, for at least a little while, maybe through the summer or

889
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,680
something. But I know it's super confusing. Remember all this stuff, jupyterbroadcasting.com

890
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,480
slash calendar, and hopefully those of you who are still listening can get the heads

891
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,600
up and show up because we love to have a good live audience. And when you move it around,

892
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,800
it makes it super confusing, and it's only because of LinuxCon. But we're going to get

893
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,720
down there. We're going to hopefully get some great interviews. We've already got some stuff

894
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:37,320
planned. We're totally going to prank Linus. No, I'm kidding. Linus, if you're listening,

895
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:40,800
I'm kidding. I love you. It's amazing to have it so close. I mean, this is a serious conference.

896
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,640
Yeah, yeah. Having it in Seattle is great. It's great not to have to fly somewhere for

897
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,880
this. Well, Noah has to fly. Yeah, he's fine all the time. But he has to fly here, and

898
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,800
I don't feel like super guilty about it. Sometimes he flies out to the West Coast. I'm like, I'm

899
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,240
sorry, dude. But hey, I can't help it if the Linux Foundation decided to have LinuxCon

900
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:58,540
in Seattle, man. Out of your hands. Seattle's legit. That's what's up. That's what's up.

901
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:02,560
So we'll be giving out swag at LinuxCon. We'll be shaking hands. We'll be doing recordings

902
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,840
and all that stuff, maybe even getting interviews and clips from you, the people. So come say

903
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,840
hi to us. We'll probably have a meetup at some point, too. Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

904
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,120
to finalize that. Of course, you can just come say hi to us at LinuxCon. So we might

905
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:17,800
not need it. I want to do something. I want to do something. So stay tuned to meetup.com

906
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:22,080
slash Jupiter Broadcasting for that. And I'd love to see you guys there. Popi's going to

907
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:27,120
be out there at LinuxCon, so that'll be good. What? What? What? Oh, man, Popi, I wish you

908
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,900
would come out to the West Coast. It's so nice out here. I'd take you around and show

909
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:33,760
you how great Washington is. I would love to. I'm sure someone will put you up. One

910
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:37,280
day, one day, you'll have to have an excuse to come out here. Maybe, maybe like so. I'll

911
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,280
see if I can orchestrate something. There you go. I'm telling you, we'll make it worth

912
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:44,360
your time. It's delicious, delicious. It's actually a little paper beer the whole time

913
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:49,160
you're here. Yeah, Popi, you'll be, you'll be drowning in Washington beer. So, and curry

914
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:54,400
if you want it, I guess. Do they do barbecue up there? Oh, don't get me started on the

915
01:08:54,400 --> 01:09:00,360
barbecue. Don't do that to me. Oh, man. And you know, it gets worse. Oh, geez. Noah, Noah

916
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:05,520
scours Facebook and if anybody in my family or a social group calls anything barbecue

917
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:10,040
or grilling, he jumps on him in Facebook and he like, he starts like defining barbecue

918
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:17,640
and grilling in the comments. It's, it's horrible. When does he work? All right. I don't know.

919
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:21,200
Well, that's the, that's the amazing thing is he actually just doesn't sleep, I think.

920
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,360
That's actually how he does it. It's pretty impressive if you think about it. All right,

921
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:28,260
so we'll be live next week at some point. At least I think we will have an episode live

922
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:32,240
from LinuxCon. We should be on the air. Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar.

923
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:36,520
I'd love to get your feedback for this episode. Linuxactionshow.reddit.com also a great place

924
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:41,600
for topics, suggestions. We'll have a feedback thread for episode 105. All of the shenanigans

925
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:47,080
happens live over jblive.tv. Normally, if we're here and all that, it's Tuesdays at

926
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:51,440
2 p.m. Pacific, but you know, go to the calendar and get it converted to your local time. So,

927
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,000
all right, Wes. Well, thanks for joining me in studio. Thank you for having me. Pleasure

928
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,760
mumble room. Yes, thank you mumble room. And don't forget to follow the network at Jupiter

929
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:02,360
Signal for updates from LinuxCon and Jupiter Broadcasting on Instagram for pictures. See

930
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:28,840
you next week!

931
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:43,720
Man, that was a fun show. And I gotta say, if anybody in the mumble room has any questions

932
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:46,720
for Ryan. Ryan, you're still here, right? Yeah, Ryan's still here. Yeah, I'm still here.

933
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:50,080
If anybody has any questions about Mycroft, I'll open the room up to that or any post

934
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:56,040
show topics. What would you need to, what would someone who wants to code something

935
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:04,240
for Mycroft need to know to code? To code for Mycroft? It's in Python. All the modules

936
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:11,920
are in Python. We have templates already set up. And so we've tried to make it as easy

937
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:19,840
to just pull out, just plug your own stuff into the template. And then frankly, if you

938
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:25,560
understand the API you're working with, or the application that you're working with,

939
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,960
Mycroft shouldn't be, like, coding the Mycroft side of it shouldn't really be a problem.

940
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:35,540
If you're familiar with Linux, like, it takes no time to get up and going with whatever

941
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:40,000
module you're trying to create. Some funny titles over JB Titles. Mycroft, start the

942
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,540
show. That's kind of funny. Vulcan, the metal slayer. Mycroft, Holmes' smarter brother.

943
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:49,920
Sync everything. So we had some good topics today. Definitely. Yeah. Thanks both to Wimpy

944
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,880
and Wes for their sync thing stuff. Guys are making me really, especially with Tink, it's

945
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:57,440
really making me want to try that. We just don't want to have to hear about your horrible

946
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:04,800
syncing troubles anymore. Nose derail, data loss. It was bad. Boy, I guess we wrapped,

947
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,680
can you hear the lawnmower in the background? We wrapped up just in time. JBtitles.com,

948
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:14,320
JBtitles.com. That was a jam-packed show, too. About Mycroft, though, is it going to

949
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:20,280
have, like, I assume that could be done, stuff would be done with, like, with cron2, so you

950
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:25,440
don't have to do the voice automation, you could just use it as an automation tool. Yeah,

951
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:31,200
I mean, there's no, well, that's the thing. I get a ton of questions like, well, what

952
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,760
if I don't want, what if I don't want to use Mycroft in the intended way? Well, that's

953
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:39,880
the greatest thing is because it's open hardware and open software, you can adjust it and have

954
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:45,340
it do whatever the heck you want, however you want. There's no, we don't have anything

955
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:51,160
in place that would prevent you from, you know, just having these things. I mean, honestly,

956
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:56,240
if you look at the Mycroft extended version, it's got the HDMI port, so you can just literally

957
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:04,680
plug in and use it as a computer if you want to. That's cool. All right, we got to get

958
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,800
more titles, vote at JBtitles.com. Oh my gosh, I hate to be a title driver, but geez. We

959
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,040
need to break these ties up. Yeah, we got to, we got to, the votes are way too spread

960
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:19,320
out. We got to hunker in behind some titles. It's getting gross, getting real gross.

961
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:26,280
So Chris, can you explain a bit more about how you're using Spyderoak? I've not used

962
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:31,320
it for ages. I've just installed the new version six client.

963
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:36,960
Oh, nice. I'm not doing anything all that really sophisticated. I have, so I have like

964
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,000
my main workstation here at the studio has both my BitTorrent sync folders on it and

965
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,040
my syncing folders on it when I had it active, which are just now kind of dead, and my Dropbox

966
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:49,400
folder on it and my own cloud folder on it. So all of my different sync things, all my

967
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:54,360
different syncing are on this one machine, and then I point Spyderoak's backup folders

968
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:59,120
to those different individual folders and then let Spyderoak do the revisioning and

969
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,320
the offset backup, quote unquote, and that's how I kind of use Spyderoak. I don't use any

970
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:07,940
of the, what do they call it? They have like a mesh network that they have for syncing

971
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:11,280
files across the machines. I don't use that. I forget what they call that, but not using

972
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,280
that feature.

973
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:15,320
So they've got, they've got backup and sync and the Hive.

974
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,560
Now Hive, that's what I'm, I don't think I'm using.

975
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,560
Spyderoak.

976
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,560
I don't.

977
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:29,480
Okay. So when you, when you do a backup, that's sending new content to them as a backup.

978
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:30,480
Right.

979
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:38,040
It doesn't necessarily then mean that that data is restored stroke synced elsewhere.

980
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:42,880
Right. I mean, if I, if I do a restore, restores it back to one of the folders that's synced.

981
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,760
So then they would then sync that file back to all the other machines cause I have syncing

982
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,720
both ways on that, on that machine.

983
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,720
Hmm.

984
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:49,720
Yeah.

985
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:54,800
So they're, so they've got the Hive, which is like a default sync folder, but can you

986
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,840
add other folders that synchronize?

987
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:58,840
Yes.

988
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,400
That's one of the big selling points, right, is that you can pick folders from the whole

989
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,400
root directly down.

990
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,400
Yeah.

991
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,400
Yes.

992
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,920
Cause I'm confused about how you do that because it.

993
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,160
I'm not sure with Hive cause I don't use Hive.

994
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,160
Oh yeah.

995
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,160
That's precisely my point.

996
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:15,520
I don't want to use it cause it's in a place I don't want to have data stored.

997
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:16,520
Right.

998
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:19,000
With Hive, I don't know if you can, but with their other, with their other backup system,

999
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,840
you can just choose the folders that get backed up and it's kind of just, you go through it.

1000
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,600
It has a tree of your file system and you just check the folders you want it to grab.

1001
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:27,600
Well this is in the old UI.

1002
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,560
I actually haven't tried it in their new UI yet.

1003
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,560
Oh okay.

1004
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:35,680
So actually you have to back something up before it appears in the sync options.

1005
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:41,200
So the only things you can sync are things that you're actually backing up.

1006
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,200
Okay.

1007
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,200
Yeah.

1008
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:48,800
And if I recall correctly, that essentially, like if I recall correctly, that essentially

1009
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,400
seemed to me like the same thing that Hive was only from any folder.

1010
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,480
I couldn't remember, I couldn't really grasp why I wanted Hive at all.

1011
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,480
That's why I never used it.

1012
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,120
Sync is like local folder syncing.

1013
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,800
It's very confusing, I have to say.

1014
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:03,600
I mean the UI is much improved, but it's still baffling.

1015
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,600
It's still confusing.

1016
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,600
Yes, I agree.

1017
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,600
Yeah.

1018
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,600
I think we're going to go with Vulkan the Metal Slayer.

1019
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,440
It has the most votes and I think Vulkan is going to be a big deal and I think the audience

1020
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:12,440
has some interest in it.

1021
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,440
So I think it'll drive clicks.

1022
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,360
I think that's a good tool, good tool.

1023
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,300
So maybe we get the word out by Minecraft and I'd love to see some open source artificial

1024
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:21,920
intelligence.

1025
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,820
I'm going to try the update Wimpy.

1026
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:27,840
So I'll try the update and maybe I'll just do a little five minutes on it as a follow

1027
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,840
up on what I end up doing.

1028
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,440
Yeah, I think I see how this works now.

1029
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,280
So you have to have multiple devices.

1030
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,000
So I've just got one device using this.

1031
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,120
So when you choose sync, you choose the device and folder path that you want to sync.

1032
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:48,720
I recall I have an Archbox on my home network and I have my Archbox here on this network.

1033
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:52,880
And so it's also how I back up my home file server too.

1034
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:53,880
Yeah.

1035
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:54,880
Okay.

1036
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,880
I think we're good.

1037
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:56,880
I think that was everything.

1038
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,560
I think 105 is in the can.

1039
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,560
Thanks you guys.

1040
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:26,480
You guys are great.
