00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
It's gonna be a special episode, but it's almost too perfect that it was on August 25th, 1991,

00:06.880 --> 00:14.800
that Linus Torvalds at the age of 21 announced the Linux project on Usenet and we'll have a

00:14.800 --> 00:19.040
link to the original email in the show notes. I think everybody's probably seen this one before

00:19.040 --> 00:25.280
where he talks about it being a no big deal OS. Only a 386 OS won't ever take advantage of things

00:25.280 --> 00:30.160
like SCSI. It's just, it's sort of a perfect moment on August 25th. Let's hope it never gets

00:30.160 --> 00:45.920
big and professional. Just a few years later, right? Hello friends and welcome to 368 of your

00:45.920 --> 00:51.440
weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello Wes, good to be connected with you.

00:51.440 --> 00:57.680
Huge show today. Nice to have you in our recording space for a very special episode.

00:57.680 --> 01:01.760
I see you spruced up in here. Yeah, thank you. Thank you for noticing. You know, I put a lot

01:01.760 --> 01:05.520
of work into that. You sure did. Also, I like that you wore a hat. I don't know if a birthday hat is

01:05.520 --> 01:12.560
the right style, but I like the intention there. We have a huge show today. I also want to start

01:12.560 --> 01:20.080
by saying thank you to a Cloud Guru for sponsoring this episode of Linux Unplugged. Cloud Guru is the

01:20.080 --> 01:24.800
leader in learning for cloud, Linux, and other modern tech skills. Hundreds of courses and

01:24.800 --> 01:31.040
thousands of hands-on labs. Get certified, get hired, and get learning. Go to acloudguru.com

01:31.040 --> 01:35.120
and thanks to them for sponsoring the Unplugged program. Now we have some big news to get into.

01:35.120 --> 01:40.400
We have a fun initiative we're launching. Some follow-up stuff, but maybe even more special.

01:40.400 --> 01:46.080
I should sit down for this one. We have a huge showing in the mumble room. Time,

01:46.080 --> 01:55.360
appropriate, greetings, virtual lug. Hello! Hello! Hello! Mumble overload. That really was. I got to

01:55.360 --> 02:00.640
bring that down just a little bit there. That was a lot. We have the return of a bunch of friends.

02:01.200 --> 02:05.040
Popey, Wimpy, it is great to see you gentlemen. Hello guys. It's been far too long. Great to have

02:05.040 --> 02:11.040
you back. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello to everybody in the mumble room. We'll get there in a moment,

02:11.040 --> 02:18.240
but I also want to say a special hello to Drew, Alex, and Mr. Joe Resington. Hello.

02:18.240 --> 02:24.160
Hello. Good afternoon. I'm back. Hello everybody. So we have so much to get into,

02:24.160 --> 02:29.280
but we had one more special guest that snuck in just before we got started. So I also have to say

02:29.280 --> 02:37.120
a big special hello to Mr. Michael Dominic. Hello Mike. Hello hippies. Hello. Hello. Hello. So good

02:37.120 --> 02:42.240
to have you here too. We have some things to cover you and me as well. How you doing, Wes?

02:42.240 --> 02:46.560
Oh boy, I'm excited. You know, you and I were talking before the show and we thought this is

02:46.560 --> 02:53.120
a special day and it's not often we make the news about ourselves. So that way it's not just about

02:53.120 --> 02:57.680
our big news. We have a couple of things in the second half of the show that I think you guys are

02:57.680 --> 03:02.320
really going to be interested in. But like the Arch users we are, before we do any of that, Wes,

03:02.320 --> 03:08.480
it's time to see if we can update the Jupiter Broadcasting file server. It's been since the last

03:08.480 --> 03:15.600
time we did it on the show, I think, right? That's a yes. It's been a little too long.

03:16.880 --> 03:22.560
So our commitment to you right here on the show is to try to do a live update. Wes Payne,

03:22.560 --> 03:27.120
are you ready to update one of the most important servers for Jupiter Broadcasting live on the air?

03:27.120 --> 03:33.680
Let's do it. We can't have downtime. We can't, no. Wes, don't do it. The last time I was on this

03:33.680 --> 03:38.320
podcast, you were doing this and that was blooming months ago. It's like last year.

03:39.920 --> 03:44.800
I know. It's pretty great. It is pretty great. Are you ready to start? Yeah, let's do it.

03:44.800 --> 03:49.360
Is it a big one? Oh, decent size. Oh, hey, we're upgrading Docker. We don't use that for anything.

03:49.920 --> 03:55.680
What about your ZFS there? What about your... Oh, let's see. Oh, yep, we got a new kernel.

03:55.680 --> 03:59.360
So we'll have that coming down too. All right. So this is going to be one of those download and

03:59.360 --> 04:03.360
build. So we'll let that go in the background and then we'll continue on with the rest of our show.

04:03.360 --> 04:08.560
Check in later. I have a good feeling about it. I think it'll be just fine. I really do. Oh, yeah,

04:08.560 --> 04:13.840
of course. Spikiness can do it. But that's probably all the stalling I can do. I have some really big

04:13.840 --> 04:18.720
news to share with everyone. You know, I've been podcasting. This is unbelievable. And I thought

04:18.720 --> 04:25.440
it can't actually be true. But I checked. I've been podcasting for 15 years. I've been podcasting

04:25.440 --> 04:32.640
for 15 years, nonstop. That's amazing. What I'm about to share with you is probably the biggest

04:32.640 --> 04:39.280
project I've ever worked on in that 15 years. It's one of those projects that I hope sets the

04:39.280 --> 04:47.200
foundation for myself personally, for Jupiter Broadcasting and these podcasts for the rest of

04:47.200 --> 04:52.640
my life. The Cloud Guru and Jupiter Broadcasting have made the mutual decision to separate and

04:52.640 --> 04:58.240
create Jupiter Broadcasting's independent media status. The demerger will allow for Jupiter

04:58.240 --> 05:02.880
Broadcasting and the Cloud Guru to dedicate their resources and specialize in the content they do

05:02.880 --> 05:07.200
best. Jupiter Broadcasting and creating Linux and open source podcast content cater to

05:07.200 --> 05:11.680
enthusiasts and industry professionals and a Cloud Guru in creating comprehensive and hands-on

05:11.680 --> 05:18.240
multi-cloud computing, Linux and DevOps training for businesses and individuals. A Cloud Guru and

05:18.240 --> 05:22.560
Jupiter Broadcasting share many commonalities such as the passion we have for our respective

05:22.560 --> 05:27.760
missions and the investment we make in creating accessible, accurate and engaging content that

05:27.760 --> 05:32.800
makes a difference to our audience. We also share a belief in the importance of giving back to the

05:32.800 --> 05:38.960
open source community. As such, a Cloud Guru will continue its support of Jupiter Broadcasting with

05:38.960 --> 05:44.880
a sponsorship arrangement and we will continue to explore future content collaboration opportunities.

05:44.880 --> 05:52.240
There you have it. It's official. I'm looking forward to the future. A new era. We'll be working

05:52.240 --> 05:58.480
together in a new era. Jupiter Broadcasting and the productions are independent on their own

05:58.480 --> 06:02.560
company again. We have a little Vic Fontaine to celebrate.

06:05.040 --> 06:09.440
You came along and everything started to hum.

06:09.440 --> 06:14.000
Still, it's a real good bet. The best is yet to come.

06:16.320 --> 06:20.320
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?

06:23.280 --> 06:27.600
You think Westpain is going to pour us a couple of drinks to celebrate. So we may be under the

06:27.600 --> 06:39.680
influence. A little more than that, Wes. So I'm very excited. A Cloud Guru has a lot in the pipeline

06:39.680 --> 06:45.600
and Jupiter Broadcasting has a whole bunch in the pipeline. There's things that are in the background

06:45.600 --> 06:51.120
that are getting worked on, but there's a couple of things that are happening pretty much right

06:51.120 --> 06:55.520
now. Let's start with the first thing. We're going to be doing a little bit of a little bit of

06:55.520 --> 07:01.120
a little bit of everything that's happening in just a few minutes as we're recording this.

07:01.680 --> 07:06.400
Coder Radio returns to the air with its first episode landing. And Mike, I don't think you and

07:06.400 --> 07:11.280
I could be more excited. We are like so full pumped about doing this. It's you and myself again with

07:11.280 --> 07:17.520
dragging Wes in as much as we can. And the show's back. It's back. It's a party Jar Jar style.

07:18.800 --> 07:23.440
It's full Jar Jar style. And we're going to do it live, I think. We decided we want to go ahead and

07:23.440 --> 07:27.840
do it live, which, you know, should be fun. We don't have as many live shows anymore, but I think

07:27.840 --> 07:33.120
that should be fun. And it's just back where it always was. Coder dot show. And you can subscribe

07:33.120 --> 07:37.600
and the new one will be out in about 15 minutes as I record this. Same feed and everything,

07:37.600 --> 07:42.880
I think. Right. Yep. Same feeds. So if you never unsubscribe, it'll be right there for you.

07:42.880 --> 07:47.920
So that's pretty exciting. And I don't know. We have much more to say than that, Mike. Like people

07:47.920 --> 07:55.600
know Coder. It's been around forever. So same classic flavor. New label. Yeah, we have actually

07:55.600 --> 07:59.920
the labels the same. We kept the logo. That's right. I see it's gluten free now. Yeah, that's

07:59.920 --> 08:04.640
what we did. We made it gluten free. So that's great. Mike's also going to be joining us on

08:04.640 --> 08:09.520
self hosted this week. So keep an eye out for that. And then the other thing that I'm very

08:09.520 --> 08:16.480
excited to announce right now is that Linux action news will return in September. And Joe and I are

08:16.480 --> 08:21.920
already starting to work on that. And Joe, you're not thrilled at all about it. No, because you're

08:21.920 --> 08:26.240
making me work on Sunday again. It's like, what, five months or whatever with no working on my

08:26.240 --> 08:34.480
Sundays? Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know. But we looked at it and we felt like LAN is the show that does

08:34.480 --> 08:40.480
the due diligence. It does the work. So it kind of has a special place in Linux media. We didn't

08:40.480 --> 08:48.240
really have a voice in that sort of area. Headlines served us super, super well. And so drew

08:48.240 --> 08:53.200
hats off to you for just banging headlines out. You really own that and took it. Thank you. Thank

08:53.200 --> 08:57.920
you. So headlines is remaining with a cloud guru. And I don't know if they're continuing production

08:57.920 --> 09:02.960
or not. That's going to be their decision. Now that we kind of will have that hole in our lineup,

09:02.960 --> 09:07.520
it makes a lot of sense to restart Linux action news. Oh, yeah. And of course, for me,

09:07.520 --> 09:16.000
it has a special place because it is born from Linux action show. And so to me, it's a sentimental

09:16.000 --> 09:20.880
show for the continuation. Yeah. And so I'm really happy that I'll be back. We're currently aiming,

09:20.880 --> 09:27.120
should we say September 7th for the first episode back? Yeah, I think that's the first. Yeah, we'll

09:27.120 --> 09:31.600
sort of six seventh, depending on where you are, if you're in the UK or in America. But yeah,

09:31.600 --> 09:36.320
that's Sunday slash Monday. Oh, I'm excited. How's your update going over there, Wes? Well,

09:36.320 --> 09:40.800
it's going well. Is it? We're rebuilding the unit RAMFS right now. Now we're not done. We got to do

09:40.800 --> 09:48.960
the AUR updates next. Do we? I think we should. So I just want to take a moment with our friends here

09:48.960 --> 09:54.400
and say thank you to everyone for your support over the last couple of years and for being there

09:54.400 --> 10:00.720
now, helping make this possible. You guys have really made the difference and just a big huge

10:00.720 --> 10:08.400
amount of appreciation for everyone. And I'm excited about where JB goes from here. It does

10:08.400 --> 10:14.640
mean this has becomes a business again and the business has to survive. I've learned a lot of

10:14.640 --> 10:18.480
lessons in this process and I've learned how important that is for the product. The product

10:18.480 --> 10:23.200
is very important. And if that's what sustains the business, you put everything into the product.

10:23.840 --> 10:28.960
With that in mind, we're launching something called the unplugged core contributors. It's

10:28.960 --> 10:34.320
a membership for the Linux unplugged program and I'm launching it today. You can get it at

10:34.320 --> 10:40.240
unplugged core dot com. If you use the promo code founder, you'll get two dollars off the monthly

10:40.240 --> 10:45.920
cost indefinitely. It's only available for the first 100 subscribers. There will also be a link

10:45.920 --> 10:50.800
at the top of the show notes, but you can go to unplugged core dot com. Now, why? Why a membership

10:50.800 --> 10:56.880
for Linux unplugged? Well, let me just say I have I have learned a lot and my intention with this

10:56.880 --> 11:03.840
membership is primarily two things. Number one, keep Linux unplugged as independent as long as I

11:03.840 --> 11:09.920
draw breath. Number two, help reduce adload needed to make the show profitable so we can keep

11:09.920 --> 11:15.520
producing. So membership will offset adload. There will be ads, but it will help offset how many ads

11:15.520 --> 11:21.120
are required. Now, as a perk of being a member, when you become a core contributor, you also get

11:21.120 --> 11:28.240
access to two RSS feeds. The first is an ad free version of the show. Same full production, just

11:28.240 --> 11:33.520
there will be no ads. Wonder where you got that idea from? Who could have thought of that? And if

11:33.520 --> 11:40.480
that's your preference, you know, as Joe offers that for late night Linux and he has as a Patreon

11:40.480 --> 11:45.840
perk and it's for some people, they don't want any ads and it's a great option. You still get

11:45.840 --> 11:50.320
the full high quality produced episode. It just doesn't have any ads. Or if you're like me, you're

11:50.320 --> 11:54.160
just too lazy and forget to listen to the ad free version, but it's a great way to support too.

11:54.160 --> 11:58.400
That's true. Now there's a second feed option. When you become a core contributor, you can get

11:58.400 --> 12:04.000
the full live stream. All of our screw ups, the stuff that never makes it into the show,

12:04.000 --> 12:08.720
the full pre and post shows, which are much, much, much longer than we'll make into the show.

12:08.720 --> 12:13.520
It's basically the extra show that never gets released. So you have two options, ad free or

12:13.520 --> 12:19.120
the full bootleg, which has everything in it, including our pre and post show chatter that

12:19.120 --> 12:23.440
is, you know, maybe sometimes we'll cut a selection of that and put it on the end or the beginning,

12:23.440 --> 12:29.680
the end of unplug. This is everything. So promo code founder for the first 100 subscribers.

12:29.680 --> 12:33.920
It's eight dollars a month. You use that promo code founder. It'll kick it down to six dollars

12:33.920 --> 12:38.880
a month indefinitely. Unplugged core dot com. Help keep us independent and help reduce the

12:38.880 --> 12:43.920
adload needed. I may consider rolling this out for other shows as well. I think you guys have

12:43.920 --> 12:48.960
heard me get on my soapbox before and talk about how important I think it is for a creator

12:48.960 --> 12:53.600
to be funded by the audience. It changes the way you think about the content that you're making.

12:53.600 --> 12:58.640
It's a it's a game changing way to think about it. You don't think about it from grabs and clicks

12:58.640 --> 13:02.880
and emotions and getting the biggest number for advertisers. You think about it from a standpoint

13:02.880 --> 13:10.160
of what would make that handful of members happy. And it is a much more genuine way to produce

13:10.160 --> 13:15.120
content. And in my 15 years of production, I can tell you, I have learned to walk the line

13:15.120 --> 13:19.840
with ad supported media, with company supported media and with member supported media. But if

13:19.840 --> 13:24.800
you were to ask me to pick one model, it would be 100 percent member funded. It's not possible,

13:24.800 --> 13:28.000
especially in today's climate, especially because I'm trying to make this a full time,

13:28.000 --> 13:34.320
sustainable job. But member support does go a long way and it does help reduce the amount of ads.

13:34.320 --> 13:37.840
It's a great way to be invested in the content here. Yeah. I mean, that's why we're doing it,

13:37.840 --> 13:41.760
right? We have a track record here. So it's an investment I think you can count on. You know

13:41.760 --> 13:47.920
that that money is going to go towards producing a show that can go through something like a merger

13:47.920 --> 13:52.400
and a demerger and stay genuine and true to itself and answering to its audience. That's

13:52.400 --> 13:58.160
what you're investing in. Plus my 15 years of nonstop podcasting track record. We'll have links

13:58.160 --> 14:04.160
in the show notes or you can go to unplugged core dot com and use the promo code founder for the

14:04.160 --> 14:10.000
first 100 subs after 100. It will be full price again, but I appreciate either way. And don't

14:10.000 --> 14:14.720
forget after you subscribe, you get to feed choices and you can subscribe to that in your

14:14.720 --> 14:19.040
podcatcher of choice. And then it just shows up in your podcast catcher like every single week.

14:19.680 --> 14:24.960
One thing is nice about the full live stream. It's definitely not as well produced. It's way longer,

14:24.960 --> 14:29.520
but we're really going to shoot to try to get it out as quick as reasonably possible. So it's if

14:29.520 --> 14:34.400
you like the show right away or maybe if you're often a live stream member, but you didn't make

14:34.400 --> 14:39.200
it and you can get that feed and you'll get it as quick as we can turn it around. The next best

14:39.200 --> 14:46.000
thing to be in here. So I'm very excited. I hope we get some support here because obviously it's

14:46.000 --> 14:51.520
early days and I have to make decisions about advertisers and how many to take on. And I hope

14:51.520 --> 14:55.280
I hope that this resonates with you as the audience, especially maybe some of those have

14:55.280 --> 14:59.680
you been listening for a while and you know what this show does. You know what we're made of

14:59.680 --> 15:04.480
unplugged core dot com. How are you doing over there, Mr. West? Are you ready for an update?

15:04.480 --> 15:10.400
Well, I've just rebooted. Let's see if it comes back up. Updates are done. No issues. All right.

15:11.760 --> 15:15.600
Are you pinging it right now? I'm just about to. I'm going to have my first celebratory drink.

15:15.600 --> 15:19.360
I didn't I didn't think that would actually work, but it's already pinging. That's a good sign.

15:19.360 --> 15:24.480
I maintain I think one of the smart things we did here and they were just talking about this

15:24.480 --> 15:29.520
in two and a half admins in the latest episode. Jim and Alan were talking about some reasons

15:29.520 --> 15:35.440
maybe not to use ZFS on route under Linux. And I agree completely with their take on it.

15:35.440 --> 15:39.280
And I think this is sort of proving that out to like, even if something goes wrong,

15:39.280 --> 15:43.760
worst cases, our pool just doesn't mount. But our OS will boot. Right. And that is nice.

15:43.760 --> 15:52.000
Oh, what is it? This isn't up yet. You're teasing me. You're teasing me. Come on, West.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.800
We might have to go check on it. We're going to have to do a console run during the show.

15:56.800 --> 16:02.960
I think so. Are we going to do that? We don't have a wireless mic. But we should, though.

16:02.960 --> 16:08.080
Westpain will take a really long XLR cord out to the garage. I do have mumble on my phone.

16:08.080 --> 16:15.600
Crap. I didn't want to say I told you so. Damn it, Wimpy. No, Wimpy. No, no, it's going to be

16:15.600 --> 16:19.680
fine. Don't you worry about it. Don't you? It's going to be fine. I have faith in Wes. I'm sure

16:19.680 --> 16:24.720
he can recover the firestorm that is happening right now. I do, too. He does look a little

16:24.720 --> 16:29.680
nervous. Oh, no, it'll be fine. Oh, that's never a good look for us. I know. I know. Like,

16:29.680 --> 16:34.240
it doesn't happen. Not much makes him nervous. Oh, oh, oh, some progress. Okay. It might just

16:34.240 --> 16:39.200
be being slow. We'll see. It didn't immediately reject me trying to SSH, so. Okay, so now you're

16:39.200 --> 16:43.760
just getting like the delay thing. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that does. All right, we'll come back after

16:45.440 --> 16:48.640
this housekeeping break. How about that? You ready? Should we do a little housekeeping and

16:48.640 --> 16:55.760
we'll see how it does? Now, I have a special housekeeping this week. If anyone out there is

16:55.760 --> 17:03.600
looking for a very talented full time audio editor, mixer or master, or a very savvy sysadmin

17:03.600 --> 17:09.840
with 20 years of experience, let Drew know. Drew is looking for work as part of this transition.

17:09.840 --> 17:16.480
His role is no longer available at a Cloud Guru, and he'll be looking, starting right now, for

17:16.480 --> 17:21.520
work. He's still working with us. He's still here. But Drew, this is sort of, you didn't ask me to

17:21.520 --> 17:25.600
do this, but I wanted to get this out there for you. Where could people get ahold of if they're

17:25.600 --> 17:31.040
looking for a killer sysadmin or an amazing audio guy? Yeah, I appreciate it. I am, of course,

17:31.040 --> 17:35.840
on Twitter at Drew of Doom. I'll make sure that there's a link to my LinkedIn in the show notes.

17:36.480 --> 17:42.400
Also, I've got an episode coming out. I was on the podcast engineering show a few weeks back,

17:42.400 --> 17:47.360
and that episode comes out on the 27th. So when that's live, I'll get that in the show notes too.

17:47.360 --> 17:50.080
There you go. Oh, I'm looking forward to that. LinkedIn profile in the show notes,

17:50.080 --> 17:55.200
like he mentioned, at linuxunplug.com slash 368. I can vouch for this guy,

17:55.200 --> 18:01.040
either doing your sysadmin work or making you sound amazing. Drew is the guy for the job.

18:01.040 --> 18:04.400
No kidding. Yeah. But the most important thing is he's not going to make me stay up

18:04.400 --> 18:07.920
till four o'clock in the morning on Tuesday nights because he's going to keep editing this show.

18:07.920 --> 18:14.640
That's true. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. I'm not going anywhere as far as this community is

18:14.640 --> 18:18.800
concerned. We're so lucky to have you. We heart you, Drew. We heart you. I heart you too.

18:21.200 --> 18:27.600
That is our housekeeping there. Was that enough time for you, Wes, to get into the...

18:27.600 --> 18:34.240
Were you able to get a shell? No. Oh, no. And it's not pinging anymore. It is proper screwed.

18:34.240 --> 18:39.760
This hasn't happened yet. Now, I will say I was a little cavalier. I didn't do a whole lot of

18:39.760 --> 18:45.440
checks. I thought, you know, let's try this as the casual admin. You just run your updates.

18:45.440 --> 18:54.560
The updates went well. You reboot. That's why we did this, right? Oh, God. I got so much to do.

18:55.920 --> 19:00.960
All right. Well, I mean, do you want to make a cart crash run while I... I mean,

19:00.960 --> 19:04.320
because we got to get it back up, right? That's what's going to happen now is we got to get it

19:04.320 --> 19:10.480
back up. I wanted to get some take from the mumble room on an idea that I'm percolating on

19:10.480 --> 19:14.800
that I'd like to get the audience's help with. I've been trying to think of ways that we could

19:14.800 --> 19:19.360
improve the quality of life for Linux users, make a difference in projects, maybe help catch bugs

19:19.360 --> 19:25.600
before major releases. And I was toying with this idea of a bugathon, something that would be

19:25.600 --> 19:31.440
scheduled ahead of time. We'd give plenty of heads up to the audience and we'd essentially pull

19:31.440 --> 19:37.760
together a live stream event where we're helping coordinate the group testing of, say, a distro

19:37.760 --> 19:42.640
before its next release or a project before their next release. Try to line it up with their own

19:42.640 --> 19:47.360
internal project testing windows and release windows. So that way we're contributing at the

19:47.360 --> 19:52.640
right time for the project. Try to mentor and work with people that are attending the live stream to

19:52.640 --> 19:57.840
properly do bug reports, format them, give them enough information, go through that process with

19:57.840 --> 20:02.880
people, maybe put it up on the screen and show them a bug report and try to take like a

20:02.880 --> 20:10.320
concentrated couple of hours on the JB live stream with the audience and focus all of our attention

20:10.320 --> 20:17.280
at one thing. And as I was experimenting with this idea in my noggin, I thought, wouldn't it be

20:17.280 --> 20:23.440
interesting to try this with Fedora 33? Because not only are they cramming a bunch of new stuff

20:23.440 --> 20:29.520
into Fedora 33, but as we've talked about a lot on this show, it will also be the first Fedora that

20:29.520 --> 20:34.400
switches to ButterFS as its default file system. Just a small change. A lot of eyes are going to

20:34.400 --> 20:40.080
be on that change, Wes. Yeah. And maybe we could do our part to help test it before it gets released

20:40.080 --> 20:44.640
to the public. Maybe we could catch something as a group, something that's organized. And I've

20:44.640 --> 20:50.640
created a Bugathon room on the new Jupyter broadcasting matrix so we could start coordinating

20:50.640 --> 20:55.360
there. And I'm hoping maybe the Luplug could help me with some of the details as well. But what I'm

20:55.360 --> 21:01.200
trying to get to is something in the end that is useful for projects and maybe distro maintainers.

21:01.200 --> 21:05.040
Because, and Wimpy, this is one thing I was going to kind of pick your brain is maybe I'm too

21:05.920 --> 21:12.000
cynical, but I think a lot of times what ends up happening is we just overburden developers that

21:12.000 --> 21:16.960
already have too much on their plate with a whole bunch of bug reports or problems that aren't

21:16.960 --> 21:20.800
really in the right channel or don't really provide enough context or information for them

21:20.800 --> 21:25.440
to do anything. It's almost like we make the problem worse for them. There's two sides to

21:25.440 --> 21:33.920
that, right? There is the bug report that says insert name of application doesn't work for me,

21:33.920 --> 21:40.560
it crashes, which is of no use to anybody. And then there's the bug report that comes from somebody

21:40.560 --> 21:46.400
who is trying to help solve the problem and does the initial steps of triage.

21:47.440 --> 21:53.040
Now, this is all complicated stuff because you have to, as you say, have to file the bug in the

21:53.040 --> 22:00.320
right place to draw attention to the right people. But I tell you what, I know Frank is in here

22:00.320 --> 22:06.000
listening to this as well. This is manner from heaven, right? If you're prepared to try and

22:06.000 --> 22:16.880
corral the JB community around these release critical periods to do some well-focused testing

22:16.880 --> 22:26.000
and bug reporting, bring it on. That's just fabulous. Because for all of those bug reports

22:26.000 --> 22:31.840
that are of quality and we can action, yes, there will be some that we can't do much with.

22:31.840 --> 22:37.280
But high quality bug reporting, can't get enough of that stuff. That's great.

22:37.280 --> 22:41.680
I'm liking your take on it. I was worried, you know, I don't want to create a bigger problem.

22:41.680 --> 22:46.080
And I think sometimes our good intentions do that. And I also want to do something that's

22:47.040 --> 22:50.720
substantive. Do you know what I mean? Like something that actually could help.

22:50.720 --> 22:55.360
One of the places where it may help before, I mean, I know you're going to talk to Neil

22:55.360 --> 22:59.760
about this stuff and his take on the Fedora community may be different from mine, right?

22:59.760 --> 23:05.120
But one of the places where you can start to help right now before we even get into, you know,

23:05.120 --> 23:10.800
it's nearly the release and we need to report things is improving the documentation around

23:10.800 --> 23:14.800
how you report things, right? You know, how do you actually file a quality bug?

23:15.360 --> 23:22.720
Checking that all of that information is ready for that group of people to come into that process

23:22.720 --> 23:27.120
and actually make a meaningful impact in the QA process.

23:27.120 --> 23:31.520
Yeah. Right. Lower the barriers to entry. Just make it as smooth as it can be.

23:31.520 --> 23:36.480
Right. Brent, I think there's an opportunity here too to just encourage people to learn how

23:36.480 --> 23:39.360
this process works and maybe they do it on their own afterwards.

23:39.360 --> 23:42.720
You know, some of us have been lucky enough to know some of the people that work on the software

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
that we use. So we've been able to just, I don't know, send bugs over telegram. I do that every

23:48.000 --> 23:54.080
once in a while. But one thing I've always wanted to know is how to write a really great bug report

23:54.080 --> 23:59.920
from the developer's perspective. And so I think if we're able to share that knowledge and create

23:59.920 --> 24:05.280
a bit of a bug squashing army, that's a legacy that'll just continue. You'll have a lot of people,

24:05.280 --> 24:09.040
you know, five, 10 years from now that are creating helpful bug reports that

24:09.760 --> 24:13.840
might be super helpful in lots of communities. Wouldn't that be a great knock on effect? So Neil,

24:13.840 --> 24:18.320
I'm curious to know what your take is and specifically how we could help the Fedora

24:18.320 --> 24:27.360
community. Before you jump in, I noted that Fedora 33 has a test week and one of the last

24:27.360 --> 24:32.880
days of the test week lands on a lup day. And I was thinking we would sort of target this for that

24:32.880 --> 24:38.800
test week for Fedora 33. That sounds great. I mean, as Wimpy said earlier about making

24:38.800 --> 24:46.400
quality bug reports, I completely agree that that is definitely an aspect that could be improved

24:46.400 --> 24:53.360
here. And in the Fedora context, we have tools like our tools that are for bug reporting in general

24:53.360 --> 24:59.120
when crashes happen and stuff like that already tries to guide people to tell us the right things

24:59.120 --> 25:05.200
for being able to reproduce a bug or do something with it. And we've got automation on the backend

25:05.200 --> 25:10.480
to replay the crash and do stuff like that. That's all well and good. What we don't really

25:10.480 --> 25:17.440
have, and this is probably something where if we just solicit some feedback from developer types

25:17.440 --> 25:21.440
who actually work on the software, what kind of information would be useful just in general

25:22.080 --> 25:28.160
for non-crash type bug reports? Because there's a whole variety of bug types. There's the,

25:28.160 --> 25:32.720
well, it just broke. And then there's the, well, this did something slightly unexpected,

25:33.280 --> 25:40.400
but didn't fail. And the latter case is actually the much harder one. I have tons of those bug

25:40.400 --> 25:47.120
reports in my own queue for the projects that I'm one of the developers for. And it's really hard

25:47.120 --> 25:53.520
because people don't give enough information for me to do anything with it. And in a lot of cases,

25:53.520 --> 25:59.040
by the time I can get around to ask for the information, they either have kind of moved past

25:59.040 --> 26:04.880
it and forgotten about it, or just don't think that giving more information is useful or necessary.

26:04.880 --> 26:10.480
And sometimes even worst cases, they're rude about it. So I think setting a better set of base

26:10.480 --> 26:18.000
expectations of what makes a useful bug report helps. And I think also having the ability for

26:18.000 --> 26:27.440
people to realize that there's like things that need to be evaluated and tested and kind of beaten

26:27.440 --> 26:33.760
in to make sure that it works well. As a distro release is being developed like Ubuntu 2010,

26:33.760 --> 26:42.400
which is coming up, Fedora 33, and so on. As those are coming, all these distros that do

26:43.200 --> 26:49.920
scheduled releases often have periods in which you can help and they have documentation for how you

26:49.920 --> 26:56.240
can help make it a better release by testing and reporting and even here and there working with

26:56.240 --> 27:02.000
developers and stuff like that. It just sort of depends. Neil makes a good point there,

27:02.000 --> 27:10.560
which is that the urgency with which people are reporting issues doesn't necessarily align

27:11.280 --> 27:15.760
with the priorities of the developers that are receiving those bug reports.

27:15.760 --> 27:22.000
That doesn't mean we don't care. It just means that we're busy and we have a priority order

27:22.000 --> 27:29.680
in which we can address things. So it's a bit like being in an IRC channel. If you're the kind

27:29.680 --> 27:34.880
of person that joins a free node channel and then immediately demands assistance and then

27:34.880 --> 27:41.280
immediately after asking for assistance loses interest and then leaves, that's not helpful

27:41.280 --> 27:47.200
conversation in an IRC. In the same way that if you file a bug report, make it a bug report that

27:47.200 --> 27:52.640
you actually care about and you're not just being frustrated on that day. Because it might be that

27:52.640 --> 27:57.920
weeks or months later those developers are coming around to a collection of issues that circulate

27:57.920 --> 28:04.320
around a thing that you've identified and other people have as well and they're trying to collate

28:04.320 --> 28:10.240
information around the issue that you've reported. Do expect that sometimes you may get a response

28:10.240 --> 28:14.880
within minutes or hours and sometimes it may be weeks or months later that somebody comes back to

28:14.880 --> 28:21.200
you asking for more information or wanting to follow up on what you've reported.

28:21.200 --> 28:26.560
Fedora 33 caught my attention because of the high profile nature of all the changes.

28:26.560 --> 28:32.000
They're all pretty big. One of the things that's coming down the pipe for Fedora 33 is they're

28:32.000 --> 28:38.400
doing now an IOT edition, which not shocking there that not really a surprise to see that

28:38.400 --> 28:42.480
this is coming. In fact, I kind of wondered if this was maybe one of those things that they resisted,

28:42.480 --> 28:49.040
but maybe customers asking for it kind of made the start. As one might expect, it's meant to

28:49.040 --> 28:53.600
be deployed on devices that are used in the Internet of Things from small, silly devices

28:53.600 --> 28:57.920
to production equipment. You got to put quotes around that's the Internet of Things. Yes, right.

28:57.920 --> 29:01.520
They have a product requirement document and in there it states that Fedora is the default

29:01.520 --> 29:06.960
platform in the IOT space. Anyone starting an IOT project from cute embedded hacks all the way up to

29:06.960 --> 29:12.320
multi-million device deployments will start with Fedora. It's going to be available on x86 and ARM

29:12.320 --> 29:18.480
64 architectures. It's pretty small. I mean, maybe not tiny, but it requires like three gigs of disk

29:18.480 --> 29:25.520
space and runs within one gig of RAM, at least if you're not doing anything anyway. You want to

29:25.520 --> 29:31.840
adjust to a new way of managing packages, though one does not just run dnf install on the Fedora

29:31.840 --> 29:38.880
IOT system. No, no. This distribution instead is using RPM OS tree. Oh, yes, you know RPM OS tree.

29:38.880 --> 29:44.720
It's built around the concept of an immutable base image, perhaps augmented by one or more

29:44.720 --> 29:49.360
overlay images. The running system is never modified by the package management operations

29:49.360 --> 29:55.440
like installations or system upgrades. Instead, RPM OS tree maintains a set of parallel system images,

29:56.320 --> 30:00.480
two of them by default. The running image is immutable and any package management operation

30:00.480 --> 30:06.160
will instead apply to the next image in the series. So, for example, if you were administrator

30:06.160 --> 30:11.520
on one of these boxes and you want to install, say, nano, that package will go into the alternative

30:11.520 --> 30:18.240
image and the action will not actually yield a usable nano command at first. Got to have nano.

30:18.240 --> 30:23.760
Oh, gosh. Of course, you're installing nano. It's got a new release out, Wes. New version.

30:23.760 --> 30:28.320
Now, of course, the idea behind this mechanism is to make system updates safer, which especially

30:28.320 --> 30:32.720
you want if you've got an Internet of Things device that's deployed somewhere out in the field

30:32.720 --> 30:37.680
and it's hard to get to. Since the update is applied to the idle image, it can't break the

30:37.680 --> 30:42.960
running system even if it's interrupted at an especially inopportune time, which, Chris, as you

30:42.960 --> 30:47.840
know, seems to happen a lot with updates. We could have used that today. It's also nice for an IoT

30:47.840 --> 30:52.240
device is it's really easy to implement a factory reset operation with this type of file system

30:52.240 --> 30:56.720
approach. You know, hold down a button and it goes back to the original image. Roll back. And it

30:56.720 --> 31:03.840
reboots. There's other takes at an IoT device image. The thing that made this stand out to me

31:03.840 --> 31:09.920
is interesting for those of you who like Fedora is apparently they are opting out of the normal

31:09.920 --> 31:14.480
release cycle for the IoT edition. Instead, the project has committed to producing a rolling

31:14.480 --> 31:20.240
release with monthly updates with RPM OSG configured to pull down updates automatically.

31:20.240 --> 31:25.920
Hopefully, IoT systems can be kept up to date with minimal effort. And if it goes bad, well,

31:25.920 --> 31:29.840
roll back. This reminds me when we started seeing Ubuntu core and people wanted to build

31:29.840 --> 31:34.240
desktops. You know, as soon as I see that, I'm like, well, now I want to make it a desktop.

31:34.800 --> 31:39.120
Such an idiot. That's my first thought. And yet soon it'll be running in the studio.

31:39.120 --> 31:43.600
I guess they just they wanted to put everything in the end of this 33 release. So it just seemed

31:43.600 --> 31:48.720
like a good one to test. It seemed like this is something that we could apply to other projects

31:48.720 --> 31:53.040
as well. And Minimac, you could see how the virtual could kind of get in on some of this,

31:53.040 --> 31:57.120
do virtual install sessions and stuff like that. I would love to see that. You know,

31:57.120 --> 32:02.960
we have really a good crowd now every Sunday. And wouldn't it be cool to have like an install and

32:02.960 --> 32:07.440
testing party? We could even have a separate room and we could even record that session

32:07.440 --> 32:12.560
and just have a mumble recording. Wow. Or you could use Discord, you know,

32:12.560 --> 32:18.640
upgrade to the 21st century. Oh, jeez. But the matrix is fine too. You know, come on.

32:18.640 --> 32:23.120
Oh my God, it's too much already. Let's build a bridge to everything. So here's what I'm thinking

32:23.120 --> 32:29.920
specifically for Fedora 33 is September 8th for Linux Unplugged. After that week's Linux Unplugged,

32:29.920 --> 32:35.840
let's all just whoever wants to join us stay here. So come for Linux Unplugged and stay and we will

32:35.840 --> 32:42.000
do the bug smashing bugathon session and we'll try to get some guidance on best practices to pass

32:42.000 --> 32:46.560
forward for bug submitting and stuff like that. Maybe bring a computer you want to install Fedora

32:46.560 --> 32:51.440
on. Yeah, bring a computer you can wipe and we'd love to get some testing on the PotterFest stuff.

32:51.440 --> 32:55.840
And we'll just sit here as a group and we'll just try to bang this out. And if it is successful,

32:55.840 --> 32:59.520
if it produces something of use, I think we'll keep working at that model and see if we can't

32:59.520 --> 33:04.080
apply it to other stuff. So September 8th will be the date. It'll be after Linux Unplugged.

33:04.080 --> 33:08.320
It'll be the Bugathon Live and we're coordinating in a room on Matrix called Bugathon

33:08.880 --> 33:14.560
on the Jupiter Broadcasting Matrix server. So this will be good because the beta for Fedora

33:15.120 --> 33:20.080
comes around September 15th and then like they have a backup date to like the 22nd because

33:20.080 --> 33:25.280
maybe they might not make the 15th. There's a lot going on. It gives us a chance to find and get

33:25.280 --> 33:30.960
this stuff in before the beta lands and then, you know, do another round of testing. So that'll be

33:30.960 --> 33:34.640
the plan. I'll remind you about it in the future, but that'll be kind of cool. This should be fun.

33:34.640 --> 33:40.640
I'm excited. And I'm just excited for Fedora 33 because Fedora's great. Yeah, come check out

33:40.640 --> 33:46.080
the virtual log too. We do that every Sunday at noon Pacific time and you can just join the

33:46.080 --> 33:51.200
mumble lobby and hang out in there. And of course there's a Matrix room too. That's right. You know,

33:51.200 --> 33:56.160
Wimby, I do have a special Discord pick for you because I knew you'd be here this week.

33:56.160 --> 34:01.680
Okay, lay it on me. I'm all about the Discord these days. So listener Dylan wrote in and he

34:01.680 --> 34:05.440
said, I'm a big fan of the show. I've been a dedicated listener since I found Linux seven

34:05.440 --> 34:09.920
months ago. He likes to listen on the road. Oh, and he loves a good old fashioned Arch update.

34:09.920 --> 34:13.840
So I'll have to come back to that for him in a moment. But he says, I'm contacting you today

34:13.840 --> 34:17.520
in hopes of having a cool piece of software my friends made highlighted on the show.

34:17.520 --> 34:26.000
It's called FetchChord. Its main purpose is to display your OS in a rich presence way on Discord.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.480
So it gives you like a rich display for your Discord based on your OS. It's kind of like Neo

34:30.480 --> 34:33.600
Fetch for Discord. So it's called FetchChord. Oh, that's fun. Right. So like how it can,

34:33.600 --> 34:36.800
you know, it'll show information about what you're running, what your system is.

34:38.240 --> 34:43.760
Isn't that neat? So we'll have a link to that. It's FetchChord on Mr. Potato Box's, or Bob

34:43.760 --> 34:49.200
Mr. Potato Bob Box. Yeah. Okay. That's awesome. Yeah. Isn't that great? So that's for you.

34:49.200 --> 34:54.880
That's that's for you. Thank you for catering to the current generation. And maybe in a few weeks

34:54.880 --> 34:59.920
from now, you'll realize the errors of your way and you'll bring your community over to, you know,

34:59.920 --> 35:06.320
a modern communication platform as well. I'm actually laughing out loud. I feel attacked.

35:06.320 --> 35:12.160
I feel attacked right now. I'd just like to point out at this point that self-hosted has a Discord.

35:12.160 --> 35:20.160
There you go. That's true. Right. Also, Neil, back in your box, you and I both played Fall Guys

35:20.160 --> 35:25.280
on Linux, you on Fedora, me on Ubuntu. And how did we communicate that evening?

35:25.280 --> 35:29.280
Yes, through Discord. It was actually a lot of fun. Right, there we go. End of conversation.

35:30.480 --> 35:35.120
Hey, I only just felt that. I only just said that because I've been needling Chris for like almost

35:35.120 --> 35:40.080
two years now to set up a matrix server. Yeah, but that was, you started that conversation two

35:40.080 --> 35:45.440
years ago. Two years has elapsed. The world has moved on. Matrix is a science project. It's

35:45.440 --> 35:51.040
wonderful, but, you know, it's not for everyday people and we need to be inviting everyday people

35:51.040 --> 35:55.600
into our world. Ditto, give us give us the awkward fact that's hanging in the room here.

35:55.600 --> 36:00.160
Well, JB does have its own Discord server set up. It's just there's no one in there.

36:01.360 --> 36:07.760
Hey, I'm in there. Yeah, I am too. I think. I just check it from time to time. I, you know,

36:07.760 --> 36:11.440
you might be right, Wimpy. That's why it hurts because you might be a little right, but we'll see.

36:11.440 --> 36:13.840
Wimpy, you are the voice of reason once again.

36:13.840 --> 36:17.120
Wimpy, this is this is why the good developers invented bridges,

36:17.120 --> 36:19.600
my friends. I'll just bridge that Discord. It'll be fine.

36:19.600 --> 36:23.120
No, but that's the worst thing ever because then that's the worst of both worlds, right?

36:23.120 --> 36:27.280
You need the one thing or the other. You're not backing one platform or the other.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.880
Or a disgusting hybrid.

36:28.880 --> 36:37.200
Pick something, but if you pick matrix, don't expect audience expansion. Pick Discord,

36:37.200 --> 36:42.480
the fastest growing messaging platform in the world. Expect audience expansion.

36:42.480 --> 36:46.400
I agree just because I have an unfiltered Discord as well. So we have a self-hosted

36:46.400 --> 36:49.200
Discord and unfiltered Discord, and they're both very successful.

36:49.200 --> 36:52.160
I guess all it means I have to figure out why it keeps crashing on my Linux.

36:53.440 --> 36:58.080
I mean, the thing is, maybe matrix is sort of like the back end,

36:58.080 --> 37:02.720
and then you can have these front ends that are telegram and Discord and IRC and

37:02.720 --> 37:05.520
people can use whatever they want. I don't know. Maybe not. Maybe it won't work out,

37:05.520 --> 37:07.120
but I'm launching on the grand experiment.

37:07.120 --> 37:10.960
Hopefully Google will just make another type of chat and then we'll just use that one.

37:10.960 --> 37:11.440
Oh my goodness.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.880
Oh geez, not again.

37:14.880 --> 37:18.560
All right, Westpane. Let's see how that server's doing.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.800
Actually, it's doing great.

37:20.800 --> 37:21.520
What?

37:21.520 --> 37:26.400
Yeah, totally. So it stopped pinging, and then it started pinging again,

37:26.400 --> 37:28.880
and it's running fine. All our containers are up.

37:28.880 --> 37:36.240
Well done. Well done.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.400
So why do you think it took so long to come back online?

37:38.400 --> 37:40.000
Was it checking some disk or something?

37:40.000 --> 37:41.920
We will have to investigate.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.920
Yeah, that'll be something for after the show.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.600
Now we are on kernel, what was it?

37:47.120 --> 37:48.000
5.8.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.760
5.8, okay. It's fine. I mean, 5.9 is almost out, so we better update soon.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.640
Obviously, can't have an old kernel on our server.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.360
Well, before we go any further, West, good job.

37:57.360 --> 37:58.880
I feel like you get an applause for that.

37:58.880 --> 38:01.600
Hey, I didn't do anything.

38:01.600 --> 38:05.680
It was our minimalist design, ButterFS on the root vial system,

38:05.680 --> 38:10.560
keeping ZFS for the big data pool, and turns out Arch sometimes works.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.120
Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes it works.

38:14.960 --> 38:19.440
Now, we have a cool pick that Alex found for us today because we all love to eat.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.160
If you've listened to the bootleg stream, you know how much we love to eat.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.240
So tell us about Chowdown.

38:24.240 --> 38:28.000
Chowdown, indeed. It's a self-hosted recipe manager.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.080
Stores your recipes in plain text using the schema.

38:32.080 --> 38:36.720
So I don't know if you knew this, but there is a recipe schema over at schema.org.

38:36.720 --> 38:40.000
And this Chowdown application actually stores your recipes

38:40.640 --> 38:43.680
in plain text and you can run it out of a container

38:43.680 --> 38:46.640
and has a nice little web interface with some search.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.320
So when you want to bring it up on the iPad,

38:48.320 --> 38:54.400
whilst you're frying up some steaks or something, it works really, really nicely.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.400
It looks pretty, too. I like it.

38:57.040 --> 38:59.040
I'm liking this display system where they...

38:59.040 --> 39:00.960
I mean, you got to take pictures of your stuff.

39:00.960 --> 39:03.280
Sounds like, Alex, you've actually been using it, too.

39:03.280 --> 39:05.760
I have indeed, yeah, for probably about three or four months,

39:05.760 --> 39:10.560
ever since Chris convinced me to buy one of those barbecue ceramic egg things.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.640
I wanted a way to kind of record what worked

39:14.640 --> 39:16.800
and what didn't on particular cooks and stuff.

39:16.800 --> 39:20.080
So what I use it for is I have a brisket recipe

39:20.080 --> 39:22.480
and then I put some notes underneath the brisket rub

39:22.480 --> 39:24.400
or whatever I did that particular time and said,

39:24.400 --> 39:27.440
I like this about it and I did it at these timings

39:27.440 --> 39:29.520
and it came out a little bit too dry.

39:29.520 --> 39:32.800
And then I have these things in plain text forever.

39:32.800 --> 39:36.160
So the next time I'm planning to do a big cook or something,

39:36.160 --> 39:39.120
I've got that all there alongside the recipe as well.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.760
Yeah. And I like that you can check stuff off,

39:41.760 --> 39:44.480
like individual ingredients and steps of the directions, too.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.160
The display is really clean.

39:46.160 --> 39:49.520
Yeah. Now, one thing worth looking at is in the GitHub,

39:49.520 --> 39:52.720
the author, Clark Lab, I think his name is,

39:52.720 --> 39:56.560
he's actually proposing a complete redesign of the web interface of the UI.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.560
So currently it's this blue thing with pictures

39:58.560 --> 40:00.080
and I quite like it, to be honest.

40:00.800 --> 40:04.160
But the web interface is going to be rethemed as red

40:04.160 --> 40:06.880
and he's rewriting some of the backend and stuff.

40:06.880 --> 40:09.440
So if you want to be part of that process,

40:09.440 --> 40:11.840
he's actively looking for feedback at the moment

40:11.840 --> 40:14.960
on the new proposed UI. So head over to GitHub

40:14.960 --> 40:16.160
and let him know what you think.

40:16.160 --> 40:18.400
Very cool. We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

40:18.400 --> 40:19.200
Thank you, Alex.

40:19.200 --> 40:20.560
Thank you for your perfect pick.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.960
Right on theme for the co-host of Self-Hosted.

40:22.960 --> 40:26.080
Check out selfhosted.show for more of that.

40:26.080 --> 40:29.120
My mom has a quick question about how she fires up a container

40:29.120 --> 40:30.240
with her recipes in it.

40:30.240 --> 40:34.320
Okay. It's Tupperware.

40:34.320 --> 40:37.360
Who said Tupperware? That was blue ingenious.

40:37.360 --> 40:39.840
All right. Fair point.

40:39.840 --> 40:42.640
Yeah. Put it in the microwave, crack the lid, and then you're done.

40:42.640 --> 40:44.160
Don't forget to burp the container.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.640
Maybe sprinkle a little water on there.

40:46.640 --> 40:51.040
Yeah. What does constitute burping a container in modern parlance?

40:51.040 --> 40:53.920
Is that when you like bring it down and restart it?

40:53.920 --> 40:54.880
That's burping it?

40:54.880 --> 40:56.800
You got to rebuild it to get the B in there, right?

40:58.240 --> 41:01.360
Well, let's go around the horn and see what folks are working on.

41:01.360 --> 41:04.960
Mr. Dominic, I know predominantly nothing more important in your life

41:04.960 --> 41:08.400
at all than Coderadio, of course, but what else is going on?

41:08.400 --> 41:10.480
But what else is going on for you?

41:10.480 --> 41:13.360
I'm ashamed to say I'm a full-time Linux user now.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.120
Welcome. Wow.

41:15.120 --> 41:15.920
Took long enough.

41:18.560 --> 41:22.240
I still haven't exactly decided Snap or Flatpak.

41:22.240 --> 41:25.120
And so I would like to put that to you guys.

41:25.120 --> 41:26.160
Why not both?

41:26.160 --> 41:28.640
Hey, Neil speaks the truth, right? Why not both?

41:28.640 --> 41:31.040
I mean, you're more of an app image guy. That's just what I think.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.440
We have standards around here, right?

41:34.480 --> 41:37.680
We do get into this a little bit in the most recent Coderadio.

41:37.680 --> 41:40.960
I'm on board with this change. I support this.

41:40.960 --> 41:43.600
I think you've been flirting with it for a long time.

41:44.320 --> 41:48.400
How much do you think it was distro versus you just settling into something?

41:48.400 --> 41:51.840
I think I'm lazy, as people would know.

41:51.840 --> 41:57.120
And the ability just to buy a Thalia or whatever the name of the laptop is,

41:57.120 --> 42:00.320
pre-installed, driver's work, I don't have to really care about anything,

42:01.040 --> 42:01.840
was the solution.

42:01.840 --> 42:04.720
Also, Apple's OS is getting crazier, right?

42:04.720 --> 42:09.680
I had a lot of issues with Catalina and Big Sur, not trying to diss anybody, but-

42:09.680 --> 42:11.520
You and the rest of the internet.

42:11.520 --> 42:13.520
Right. It kind of looks like Fisher Price.

42:13.520 --> 42:16.720
I'm really interested in this. Is it aesthetics or is there something

42:17.280 --> 42:20.960
fundamental from a developer's perspective that you're unhappy with?

42:20.960 --> 42:24.160
Yeah. So I think the biggest change was I'm not doing a ton of iOS work.

42:24.160 --> 42:28.480
I'm doing a ton of embedded Linux work and mostly Python on the server now.

42:28.480 --> 42:34.960
So I ended up running a bunch of Ubuntu VMs anyway on a Mac computer, which was kind of silly.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.640
Also, you and the rest of the internet.

42:36.640 --> 42:40.960
Right. So at some point, it's like, why not just run it natively on the hardware?

42:40.960 --> 42:41.760
Thank you.

42:41.760 --> 42:49.440
That's what I wonder if that does seem like, even with WSL and virtualization on Mac Arm,

42:49.440 --> 42:54.400
at a certain point, it is just a little bit simpler. There's less things in the middle.

42:54.400 --> 42:57.280
Right. If it works for you, if it meets your needs for development,

42:57.280 --> 42:59.920
whatever you need, yeah, why not?

42:59.920 --> 43:05.200
The disadvantage that Apple has that makes it easier for these kinds of transitions of like,

43:05.200 --> 43:09.920
you're running a whole bunch of Linux VMs and then you're like, well, why do I have Mac OS?

43:09.920 --> 43:15.200
Is that if you decide to make that change, you wind up actually saving money, right?

43:15.200 --> 43:21.440
Because you can make that calculation and see that there is an actual

43:21.440 --> 43:23.680
tangible benefit across the board.

43:23.680 --> 43:29.520
You don't necessarily get that same calculation when you go from saying Windows with WSL to

43:29.520 --> 43:34.320
Linux on the computer, unless you get a computer with Linux pre-installed.

43:34.320 --> 43:40.320
And I think this is what's just been said about how Linux being pre-installed was just the thing

43:40.320 --> 43:42.240
was like, this is it all works.

43:42.240 --> 43:42.960
Everything's fine.

43:42.960 --> 43:44.400
I'm just going to kind of roll with it.

43:45.200 --> 43:48.640
That is the thing we've been missing for nearly 20 years.

43:49.200 --> 43:52.720
And now that we're starting to have that for real in a big way,

43:52.720 --> 43:59.120
like with System76 and Tuxedo and now Lenovo and Dell and so on,

43:59.120 --> 44:02.960
like having these things there makes a huge difference.

44:02.960 --> 44:05.520
It does, but they've been around for a decade.

44:05.520 --> 44:08.720
Maybe I should nail my colors to the mast here.

44:08.720 --> 44:17.120
Obviously I'm responsible for Ubuntu's interests in WSL, right?

44:17.120 --> 44:25.120
But that in itself is very interesting because we're finding an interesting trend, which is

44:25.680 --> 44:30.800
there are people that are already running Windows that now are in a world where they

44:30.800 --> 44:33.120
need to target Linux as a platform.

44:33.920 --> 44:41.440
And they're able to do that from their point of view, the comfort of their Windows environment.

44:41.440 --> 44:50.320
And WSL is an enabler for them to be able to rapidly do the business that they need

44:50.320 --> 44:56.560
to do, which is to build their products on Linux and to target Linux without actually

44:56.560 --> 44:58.720
having to dip into a Linux world.

44:58.720 --> 45:04.160
And this is kind of an uncomfortable place for me because on the one hand,

45:04.160 --> 45:06.160
I represent the Ubuntu desktop.

45:06.160 --> 45:10.720
And on the other hand, I represent Ubuntu's aspirations for WSL.

45:10.720 --> 45:13.520
And they don't necessarily compete with one another.

45:13.520 --> 45:16.720
They do complement one another, but they do overlap.

45:16.720 --> 45:21.440
That set, they are not distinct sets of users, right?

45:21.440 --> 45:23.520
They do intersect.

45:23.520 --> 45:24.720
I like that little microcosm.

45:24.720 --> 45:29.600
I think of the cognitive dissonance we've all had around WSL and figuring out where

45:29.600 --> 45:31.200
does it fit in this ecosystem?

45:31.200 --> 45:32.000
Right.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.960
It's a very similar logic that arrives you at Discord versus Matrix, right?

45:36.960 --> 45:42.720
It's that pragmatic approach to use the thing that gets the job done versus the purest

45:42.720 --> 45:43.680
approach sometimes.

45:44.320 --> 45:44.560
Yeah.

45:44.560 --> 45:49.440
And you have to figure that the Windows 10 user base has got to be at least one or even

45:49.440 --> 45:52.800
two orders of magnitude bigger than the Ubuntu desktop.

45:52.800 --> 45:53.360
Good point.

45:53.360 --> 45:54.080
And sure.

45:54.080 --> 45:56.160
And I don't discount any of those things.

45:56.800 --> 45:59.040
And to some extent, I'm pragmatic too.

45:59.040 --> 46:05.360
I have a MacBook, as both Wimpy and others know, and I also have a Windows PC that I

46:05.360 --> 46:07.600
work from as well, because I do some game development.

46:07.600 --> 46:08.720
I need to be able to do this.

46:09.680 --> 46:19.200
And the thing is, I just I don't see WSL as a driver for getting people interested

46:19.200 --> 46:20.320
in the Linux platform.

46:21.040 --> 46:22.960
I just don't think it will work that way.

46:23.680 --> 46:25.040
I'm not so sure about that.

46:25.040 --> 46:30.640
So you just said to me that you have a Windows computer for game development.

46:30.640 --> 46:41.200
The trend that we are seeing almost exclusively ahead of everything else is game studios that

46:41.200 --> 46:45.520
need to target Linux and are using WSL as the vehicle to do that.

46:45.520 --> 46:51.120
Now, I can't reveal names and I can't say what's going on behind the scenes, but that

46:51.120 --> 46:53.200
is definitely a trend that we're seeing.

46:53.920 --> 46:55.040
Well, that's good to know.

46:55.040 --> 46:58.560
I think it's also the perspective that Jay Tucky in the chat room points out that's worth

46:58.560 --> 46:59.040
considering.

46:59.040 --> 47:03.600
He says, I can confirm that I love WSL and many of my colleagues use it at work on Windows

47:03.600 --> 47:04.560
machines.

47:04.560 --> 47:08.000
If WSL didn't exist, they wouldn't be using Linux.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.240
They just wouldn't be using Linux tools.

47:10.240 --> 47:11.520
So there's that too.

47:11.520 --> 47:17.760
There's like the use of more open source tools, even if it's running on a proprietary platform

47:17.760 --> 47:19.520
is in somewhat a net benefit as well.

47:19.520 --> 47:19.760
Right.

47:19.760 --> 47:22.640
And we're already sort of comfortable with the, oh, yeah, you use whatever.

47:22.640 --> 47:25.760
Maybe it's a Mac or Windows and then SSH to all your Linux servers.

47:25.760 --> 47:28.000
It's sort of just bringing that a little closer to home.

47:28.000 --> 47:33.440
You say proprietary platform, the proprietary platform being the desktop operating system

47:33.440 --> 47:35.040
in this case, which is Windows.

47:35.040 --> 47:42.160
But WSL 2 is empowered by the Linux kernel, which is the Linux kernel.

47:42.800 --> 47:49.920
And in the majority of cases, the Ubuntu user space, which is the open source Ubuntu user

47:49.920 --> 47:50.720
space.

47:50.720 --> 47:53.120
And is the new Windows terminal open source?

47:53.120 --> 47:53.920
Yeah.

47:53.920 --> 47:54.720
I believe it is.

47:54.720 --> 47:55.120
Yes.

47:55.120 --> 47:55.440
Yeah.

47:55.440 --> 47:56.160
That's funny.

47:56.160 --> 48:00.320
So that stack is fairly open source except for the virtualizer it's running on.

48:00.320 --> 48:01.840
It's pretty open.

48:01.840 --> 48:06.800
You know, it's way, way more open than, you know, you would, you know, think in your mind

48:06.800 --> 48:11.680
when you're thinking about, you know, a Microsoft ecosystem, because it isn't a Microsoft ecosystem.

48:11.680 --> 48:18.880
This is Microsoft basically opening up to what the rest of the industry have defined

48:18.880 --> 48:21.600
as the de facto development platform standards.

48:21.600 --> 48:26.080
And guys like Mike, I guess, building applications that he's building.

48:26.080 --> 48:31.680
It just made sense to him to just switch to the platform itself, and which we dig into

48:31.680 --> 48:32.800
in Coder a little bit.

48:32.800 --> 48:34.000
So that's a good tease.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.520
And I think Mike, right?

48:35.520 --> 48:39.760
So a lot of people talk about, you know, oh, WSL is the way that Microsoft is going to

48:39.760 --> 48:40.640
snuff out Linux.

48:40.640 --> 48:42.480
Well, what if it's not that?

48:42.480 --> 48:48.000
What if Mike is actually the example of where we're headed?

48:48.000 --> 48:53.520
You know, that more people come to Linux platform natively because they've been introduced

48:53.520 --> 48:55.120
to it via another means.

48:55.120 --> 48:58.560
Yeah, you get more comfortable with it, you know, eventually a couple of years down the

48:58.560 --> 48:59.280
road.

48:59.280 --> 48:59.760
All right.

48:59.760 --> 49:01.280
I could see living in this day to day.

49:01.280 --> 49:04.320
I wonder if there is brand association power as well.

49:04.320 --> 49:08.800
If you are a Windows user and you trust Microsoft and you trust the Windows platform, and now

49:08.800 --> 49:13.680
they're saying this is a tool that is legitimate, it's sort of a brand association thing.

49:13.680 --> 49:18.320
I wonder if it gives it a more legitimate endorsement.

49:18.320 --> 49:19.680
And that's the word I'm looking for.

49:19.680 --> 49:20.240
Yeah.

49:20.240 --> 49:25.040
And, you know, the thing is, as all of these people have said about the idea of WSL potentially

49:25.040 --> 49:29.760
being an avenue in which people start thinking about using Linux natively, like my own story

49:29.760 --> 49:35.280
in getting in switching to Linux parallels that like WSL didn't exist back then.

49:35.280 --> 49:40.800
I started with DJGPP and using it in DOS and then with Windows using Cygwin and eventually

49:40.800 --> 49:45.520
switching to Linux full time because I liked that platform, that ethos, and that's certainly

49:45.520 --> 49:49.760
something that I think is important and is a good way to go.

49:49.760 --> 49:56.880
The difference between then and now is that we have a lot more strongly de-emphasized

49:56.880 --> 50:02.400
the community and the open source principles at the forefront of how people get access

50:02.400 --> 50:04.480
to open source software and tools.

50:04.480 --> 50:12.400
And so I don't know if people actually get exposed to that open source culture quite

50:12.400 --> 50:17.440
as much now than they would have, you know, like when I started doing this like 15, 20

50:17.440 --> 50:17.920
years ago.

50:18.640 --> 50:19.200
Interesting.

50:19.200 --> 50:28.160
So I would argue that more people are exposed to that because it is the lingua franca of

50:29.120 --> 50:31.520
contemporary software development.

50:31.520 --> 50:36.160
You can't go into an organization and they explain to you that they want to create a

50:36.160 --> 50:42.240
way to distribute some information to the world without them leveraging open source

50:42.240 --> 50:47.120
technologies in order to base the foundation of their product on that, right?

50:47.120 --> 50:52.400
You know, it's your thoughts, your thinking that are unique and distinctive.

50:52.400 --> 50:54.960
It's not the technology that you use anymore.

50:54.960 --> 50:55.440
True.

50:55.440 --> 51:05.520
And also looking at my daughter's generation who are just emerging into this world, they're

51:05.520 --> 51:11.120
brought up on scratch and the micro, or at least in this country, they're brought up

51:11.120 --> 51:12.800
on scratch and the micro bit.

51:13.440 --> 51:22.160
And the whole process is not called open sourcing, but the idea that you share your code and

51:22.160 --> 51:29.360
then you remix it is the very expression of that collaborative open source environment

51:29.360 --> 51:31.600
that I find most compelling.

51:32.240 --> 51:37.440
So, you know, my daughter talks about magpying things, you know, finding something that

51:37.440 --> 51:42.240
somebody else has done that you value and building upon it.

51:42.240 --> 51:48.400
And this is the term that the kids use in this, you know, in my area, they magpie somebody

51:48.400 --> 51:49.200
else's stuff.

51:49.200 --> 51:54.320
I'm just, I'm just smirk, I'm just smiling because that's a wonderful thought.

51:54.880 --> 51:55.920
Adorable.

51:55.920 --> 51:56.960
Well, so there you go.

51:56.960 --> 51:58.000
That's what Mike's been up to.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.360
That's how we got down that rabbit hole.

52:01.360 --> 52:02.640
That's what's sorry about that.

52:02.640 --> 52:03.360
No, no, it's great.

52:03.360 --> 52:05.200
That's like, that's one of my favorite things about this show.

52:05.840 --> 52:06.320
Check it out.

52:06.320 --> 52:07.360
Coder dot show.

52:07.360 --> 52:07.760
It's back.

52:07.760 --> 52:08.400
It should be up now.

52:08.400 --> 52:08.880
Go check.

52:08.880 --> 52:09.440
Is it up now?

52:09.440 --> 52:10.800
It's not yet, but it will be soon.

52:10.800 --> 52:11.120
All right.

52:11.120 --> 52:15.040
It's in the tubes, as it were, doing the encoding.

52:15.040 --> 52:16.320
I'm pretty excited about that.

52:16.320 --> 52:16.640
Mr.

52:16.640 --> 52:19.280
Rastitun, it's been a while since, so we've got an update from you.

52:19.280 --> 52:20.640
I know you got some new shows.

52:20.640 --> 52:21.840
Tell us what you got going on.

52:21.840 --> 52:22.080
Yeah.

52:22.080 --> 52:28.320
Well, since I disappeared, shall we say, I have started a new show called The New Show

52:28.320 --> 52:29.520
with Popey and Dan.

52:29.520 --> 52:31.040
And it's a completely new show.

52:31.040 --> 52:32.160
It's nothing like the old show.

52:32.160 --> 52:35.040
It's the new show and it's at the new dot show.

52:35.040 --> 52:36.160
So check that one out.

52:36.880 --> 52:42.400
And also Jim Salter and Alan Jude of Text App Fame.

52:42.400 --> 52:46.800
I managed to get those two together for a show called Two and a Half Admins, which is

52:46.800 --> 52:48.480
at two dot five admins dot com.

52:48.480 --> 52:49.360
You see what we did there.

52:49.360 --> 52:50.240
Clever domain hack.

52:51.440 --> 52:53.920
And that's basically me just learning stuff from them.

52:53.920 --> 52:58.000
I just kind of introduce it, ask them questions and go, all right, yeah, OK.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.160
And then kind of say, should I do it like this?

53:00.160 --> 53:02.480
And they say, no, you're not doing it that way.

53:02.480 --> 53:04.000
You should do it this way, that way.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.360
You're doing it completely wrong, Joe.

53:05.360 --> 53:06.800
You're a half admin.

53:06.800 --> 53:10.720
And Popey calls that show Two Dot Zero Five Admins to try and insult me.

53:10.720 --> 53:12.880
That sounds about fair.

53:12.880 --> 53:14.720
And Joe, have you learned anything yet?

53:14.720 --> 53:16.320
I've learned tons from them.

53:16.320 --> 53:19.040
Have you implemented anything you've learned yet?

53:19.040 --> 53:21.440
No, I'm still I'm still at the planning stage of implementing.

53:24.560 --> 53:25.520
Next time he rebuilds.

53:26.160 --> 53:27.600
Popey had to drop out early.

53:27.600 --> 53:32.640
So for Popey's benefit, I'm going to plug the Ubuntu podcast, which is humming right

53:32.640 --> 53:33.140
along.

53:33.680 --> 53:34.000
Mr.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.920
Wimperis, I've noticed on my YouTube recently that there seems to be some

53:37.920 --> 53:41.600
Ubuntu Mate hacking going on live on YouTube.

53:41.600 --> 53:48.960
Yeah, so some people during lockdown have decided to get fit and lose weight or, you

53:48.960 --> 53:52.160
know, increase their mental aptitude by reading books.

53:52.960 --> 53:59.440
I decided I'd learn how to flex OBS Studio and learn a little bit about cameras and

53:59.440 --> 54:00.160
videography.

54:00.160 --> 54:02.080
So I've been doing a bit of live streaming.

54:02.080 --> 54:10.240
So not just Ubuntu Mate, but generally stuff around the Ubuntu community or grassroots

54:10.240 --> 54:17.360
projects to try and involve people in, you know, projects, just trying to put stuff out

54:17.360 --> 54:18.560
there to invite people in.

54:18.560 --> 54:20.080
And we've had some success.

54:20.080 --> 54:21.840
So, yeah, I've got a YouTube channel.

54:21.840 --> 54:23.440
It's Wimpy's World.

54:23.440 --> 54:25.600
So YouTube.com Wimpy's World.

54:25.600 --> 54:30.240
Come along, join the next live stream and dip into our Discord server.

54:30.240 --> 54:36.560
We've got a broad, broad spectrum of people involved there from enthusiasts through to

54:36.560 --> 54:41.840
hardcore developers who are interested in making and creating stuff.

54:41.840 --> 54:43.120
And what's the name of that Discord?

54:43.120 --> 54:44.160
It's in the YouTube chat.

54:44.160 --> 54:47.680
So if you go to YouTube.com Wimpy's World, there's linked from there.

54:47.680 --> 54:48.160
Yeah, yeah.

54:48.160 --> 54:49.360
Or Wimpy's World.com.

54:49.360 --> 54:50.720
There's all the links there.

54:50.720 --> 54:51.600
I like your setup.

54:52.800 --> 54:56.320
You've got like a good setup over there with the music going.

54:56.320 --> 55:02.000
And you must have one of, do you have one of those Elgato Stream Deck controls or something?

55:02.000 --> 55:04.960
Because I noticed you're hitting a button and then stuff sliding around and it looks

55:04.960 --> 55:05.760
really good.

55:05.760 --> 55:07.200
So I have lots of things.

55:07.200 --> 55:11.520
It's a bit embarrassing to be honest with you, like how much stuff I've got now.

55:12.080 --> 55:15.840
So I have three mirrorless cameras now.

55:15.840 --> 55:21.920
And I do have two Elgato Stream Decks, although I only use one.

55:21.920 --> 55:28.080
The thing I use for switching the transitions is actually a fairly modest Android tablet.

55:28.080 --> 55:36.000
And go to YouTube.com slash Wimpy's World because I'll be revealing how I've put all

55:36.000 --> 55:39.360
of this stuff together and the tricks I've learned along the way.

55:39.360 --> 55:46.880
And I've been learning how to do this stuff by following like pro level game streamers

55:46.880 --> 55:54.160
and how they're using OBS and then adapting how they're using OBS to delivering like

55:54.160 --> 55:57.280
let's code Linux material.

55:57.280 --> 56:02.000
So I'm going to be going through all of that and how I'm using OBS and all of the plugins

56:02.000 --> 56:04.880
that are available and all of the ancillary bits and pieces.

56:04.880 --> 56:06.560
So come along and join.

56:06.560 --> 56:08.160
We'll go through that journey together.

56:08.160 --> 56:10.160
Oh, wow.

56:10.160 --> 56:12.640
Wimpy, you forgot to mention the snap, the OBS snap.

56:12.640 --> 56:15.120
That's what makes it all possible, right?

56:15.120 --> 56:15.920
That'll be part of it.

56:15.920 --> 56:22.000
Yeah, the OBS snap, it's like, I'll tell you what, it's like a Linux distribution.

56:22.000 --> 56:31.920
So the OBS snap is OBS plus about 20 plugins and filters built in to the snap.

56:31.920 --> 56:38.480
So it's a fully loaded battery included version of OBS and that's what I use.

56:38.480 --> 56:43.760
And everything that's built into the snap of OBS, it includes all of the hardware acceleration

56:43.760 --> 56:52.720
for NVIDIA and AMD and Intel GPUs and APUs and a whole bunch of plugins to do sexy transitions

56:52.720 --> 56:54.320
and interesting effects.

56:54.320 --> 56:59.120
It's all in there and I've learned it all by watching game streamers on Twitch.

56:59.120 --> 57:00.240
Well, you've really nailed it.

57:00.240 --> 57:06.000
I've watched several of them and I think you've put a lot of good thought into just how things

57:06.000 --> 57:08.960
flow when you're making a transition too, which looks really good.

57:08.960 --> 57:10.480
But just the overall look is good.

57:10.480 --> 57:11.760
The green screen is working really well.

57:11.760 --> 57:15.280
The chat integration works great, the music isn't too loud so you can still hear what

57:15.280 --> 57:18.720
you're doing and I can see what you're working on, which checks all the boxes for me.

57:18.720 --> 57:22.000
Taken a lot of fails to get there, but thank you for the kind words.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.840
Definitely needs more star wipes though.

57:23.840 --> 57:24.800
Star wipes?

57:24.800 --> 57:27.200
Yeah man, to make it really professional.

57:27.200 --> 57:28.400
Definitely.

57:28.400 --> 57:28.880
Agreed.

57:28.880 --> 57:29.920
Good Lord.

57:30.800 --> 57:34.320
One day I will hope to be half as good as Wimpy at live streaming.

57:34.320 --> 57:40.640
Hey, look Neil, Neil, the very fact that you are now streaming on Twitch moderately in

57:40.640 --> 57:47.360
influenced by my jamboree that I do is the whole reason I'm doing it right is I think

57:47.360 --> 57:54.480
as a Linux community, we need to get away from matrix mailing lists and IRC channels

57:54.480 --> 58:01.520
and emerge into this whole video production era in order to capture a new audience.

58:01.520 --> 58:08.160
So Neil, it doesn't matter if you're learning as I was a year ago, you're doing it right.

58:08.160 --> 58:10.800
You're capturing a new audience.

58:10.800 --> 58:17.680
Something I haven't shared with you, but I've been doing podcast consulting at chrislast.com

58:17.680 --> 58:24.320
slash consulting and I had a consultation with a developer of a popular open source

58:24.320 --> 58:29.760
project that everyone listening who's used the Linux desktop for a while has definitely

58:29.760 --> 58:37.200
used this app and they've noticed that developers streaming is becoming more and more of a thing

58:37.200 --> 58:40.640
and it was you Wimpy that they pointed to specifically that really impressed them with

58:40.640 --> 58:44.320
the way you're doing it and sort of inspiring them to get their setup going.

58:44.320 --> 58:49.280
I don't know if it's going to be a great idea or not, but I think, you know, it is for them

58:49.280 --> 58:54.400
connecting them with a newer generation of developers who are just beginning their journey

58:54.400 --> 58:56.800
and it's been worth it so far.

58:56.800 --> 58:58.560
So I think you're onto something in that regard.

58:58.560 --> 59:06.000
So I'm blushing a little bit, but the thing is this right video is the medium by which

59:06.000 --> 59:11.920
most information is communicated via the internet these days, particularly since, you know,

59:11.920 --> 59:16.080
the whole, you know, galactic meltdown started a few months ago.

59:17.280 --> 59:20.880
Our community needs to capitalize on that movement.

59:20.880 --> 59:23.920
I don't claim to be doing it right.

59:23.920 --> 59:35.280
I think I've just caught a wave of other people that are also investing in video

59:35.280 --> 59:41.760
as a means to communicate because it's no like accident that I started doing this when

59:41.760 --> 59:45.840
I found myself stuck within the four walls that I'm sat within right now.

59:45.840 --> 59:46.080
Right.

59:46.080 --> 59:51.920
You know, it's kind of a happenstance of, you know, of the world we find ourselves in.

59:51.920 --> 59:52.560
Right.

59:52.560 --> 59:54.320
I think video plays a part in this.

59:54.320 --> 59:55.440
I think it's every medium.

59:55.440 --> 01:00:00.400
I think it's audio, text and video and there's a reach into each of them.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:06.320
But I have as well really kind of started putting live streams up more on my screen as I'm working.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.760
I have a monitor that I just sort of perfect to just toss a stream on and it's either a

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.960
news stream or sometimes it's a community stream.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:17.360
And it's like, it's like listening to a podcast while I'm at my desk, only instead it's a live

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.000
stream.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.760
And so it works for me.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.680
And I think there's probably a lot of people that do that.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.680
I think there's something to that right now.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:29.040
Maybe that is very much of the now, but you know, my live streams are not short.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.760
And they are an hour, like minimum.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:38.160
The last one I did was an hour and 45 minutes, kind of staggered that 2000 people have watched

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:43.600
that, you know, in the time since I did that last, this time last night.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.960
What's your retention like though?

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.720
Retention is pretty decent, actually.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.680
You'd be surprised.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:57.280
I mean, yeah, it's like 30, 35 minutes on my channel and most of it is like long form

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:03.840
content and I used to criticize people making long form content, basically streaming hours

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:10.080
long things, but there is an audience for that kind of technical information from our

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.040
community.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.200
So we'll have links to that in the show notes.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.000
That's pretty great.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.680
This has been a fun episode.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:16.640
It's really felt like a party.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.480
Thank you everybody for being here.

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.560
So go check out Wimpy's channel.

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.280
I have a link to that.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.600
Check out Alex on the self-hosted podcast.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.080
Check out Joe on the return of Linux action news.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:30.720
And his podcast, two and a half admin, the new show and of course, late night Linux.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.480
Mike's also got the Mike Dominic show and Coder radio.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.200
You can find those.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.960
We'll have links in the show notes.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.400
It's a lot of plugs there.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.480
There's probably more that I'm probably in my forgetting one.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.440
Probably.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:41.920
Probably.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.040
I mean, there's a lot to it.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.000
Give me a job.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:44.480
Yeah.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:44.880
Yeah.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.760
Give Drew a job.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:50.400
If you were seriously, if you're looking for somebody who's a great admin or a fantastic

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.360
audio master and just a great coworker.

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:53.840
Yeah.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:59.680
I really, I think Drew, if you had time and you know, could like, you know, just get like

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.080
some massive VC funding, you could launch a serious podcast editing shop.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.280
Like it could, you know, Drew's podcast editing, but the realities of the world are that the

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.000
man needs a job.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.080
So if you need assist admin or a great editor and sound master, give them a look.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.920
We'll have a link in the show notes to that.

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.760
A thank you to a cloud guru for sponsoring this episode and a thank you to our members

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.880
unplugged core.com as we sign off West, I'm going to hit the old refresh.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.880
We have 24 active core contributors now.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:29.440
Amazing.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.960
We haven't even finished the show.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:36.720
Which means there's still some of those discounted founder slots available for the download audience.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:41.520
Use the promo code founder, or if you just click the link at the top of the show notes,

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.160
it will take you to the deal right there.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.280
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of the unplugged program.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.600
I can't wait for next week's episode and all the episodes after that.

01:02:51.600 --> 01:03:21.360
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:38.960
The brave souls over at WSL Conf are doing it again on September 9th and the 10th.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:42.000
WSL Conf on September 9th and the 10th.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.920
Oh, hey, that was a great time last time.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.880
Yeah, maybe we should see if we can get in there again.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:48.640
I'd be curious.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.520
Diddle, are you going?

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.400
I'm presenting.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:51.840
Oh, fantastic.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:53.680
Well, I guess you should probably go then.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.960
I guess you should probably go.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.520
Otherwise, it's going to be really awkward.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.440
You know, you know what?

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.520
You know what, Diddle Dan, we should fly you out there.

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.880
Oh, hang on a minute.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.840
Oh, yeah.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.280
No, none of that.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.360
It's all virtual.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:10.960
I am actually legitimately missing community events.

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.440
I know.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:12.960
I am now.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.800
I mean, it's getting bloody tiresome, right?

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.840
You mean barbecue events?

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.640
Yes, I do.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:19.440
Yes.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.480
I really do.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:26.720
I'll tell you what, if Linux Fest Northwest is going again by next year, if you come out,

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:30.320
I'll take a group of you out to the best burgers in the Northwest.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.240
The best burgers in the Northwest, if you come out.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:33.920
That's my commitment to you.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.240
And then the best pizza afterwards at Mod Pizza.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.000
No, Joe, that is not the best pizza.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.600
Stop dissing the Mod Pizza.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.960
Look for us heathens that live, you know, in the colonies.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.560
Mod Pizza is the height of pizza sophistication.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.160
I have to disagree.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.560
No, no, you can't disagree because you don't live in the colonies.

01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:15.360
Can I just take you to good pizza just so you can, can we just do that, please?
