WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
Look at them reaching out saying, hey, look at this cool box.

00:04.240 --> 00:06.320
What are they running, Linux?

00:06.320 --> 00:06.840
Yeah.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.040
What though?

00:09.040 --> 00:10.880
Ubuntu.

00:10.880 --> 00:15.200
Look at that, 100% open source.

00:15.200 --> 00:19.800
So it's got an Odroid 1.7 gigahertz U3 quad core processor

00:19.800 --> 00:21.320
powered by Ubuntu full specs.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.600
Let's go check that out.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.320
So it's imp.computer.

00:25.320 --> 00:29.200
Two gigs of RAM, eight gigabytes of storage on board,

00:29.200 --> 00:35.120
Ubuntu 14.04, and Cinnamon, Chrome, and Firefox.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.480
Interesting, they say Office.

00:36.480 --> 00:39.040
They say, oh, look at this.

00:39.040 --> 00:43.840
Office, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, online, Google Docs, Apple,

00:43.840 --> 00:45.160
and iCloud.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.080
Screenshot.

00:46.080 --> 00:50.680
I think it's like Chromebook style Chromebox kind of thing.

00:50.680 --> 00:54.280
But it also talks about being a media hub.

00:54.280 --> 00:55.320
It's pretty interesting.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.600
So they're doing a fundraiser?

00:57.600 --> 00:58.880
Yeah, they're going to do one.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.440
I haven't said when.

01:00.440 --> 01:02.640
Continuity, imp supports full continuity.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.720
Now you can pick up any task you were doing

01:04.720 --> 01:07.360
or move what you're watching on your mobile

01:07.360 --> 01:10.680
and then continue it on your desktop.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.360
It looks about the size of a NUC,

01:12.360 --> 01:15.040
only even maybe a bit smaller, I bet.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.280
Yeah, well, if you look at the size of an Odroid,

01:17.280 --> 01:19.640
they're quite tiny.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.120
That makes sense, huh?

01:21.120 --> 01:24.320
And it looks like they're going to tie in with some sort of app

01:24.320 --> 01:28.000
that you can use on Android, iOS, or Windows.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.400
Interesting.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.560
Good find, Poppy.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.160
I wonder if maybe somebody in this room

01:33.160 --> 01:37.160
has heard of this new TrueCrypt remake that's

01:37.160 --> 01:40.600
called, it's better than TrueCrypt, it's called Vericrypt.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.680
It's like an alternative.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.880
They say that they've gone in and cleaned a few things up,

01:44.880 --> 01:46.360
fixed a few problems.

01:46.360 --> 01:46.960
Anybody heard of it?

01:46.960 --> 01:48.000
Anybody trust it?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.040
Anybody found a good TrueCrypt?

01:49.040 --> 01:49.760
I've heard of it.

01:49.760 --> 01:52.120
I ran across the story yesterday,

01:52.120 --> 01:55.840
and I don't know what to think about it.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.560
Yeah, I don't know if I can trust it yet.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.120
What does it take to trust something?

01:59.120 --> 02:01.160
What did it take to get me to trust TrueCrypt?

02:01.160 --> 02:02.760
It's just been around a while, I guess.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.080
Edward Snowden.

02:04.080 --> 02:07.400
Do you know if the audit that was being done on TrueCrypt

02:07.400 --> 02:09.720
is going to publish their findings at some point?

02:09.720 --> 02:11.480
Well, they've published the first phase.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.320
And now they're like, I thought we were

02:13.320 --> 02:14.960
supposed to see the second phase binding.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.600
Well, this is what I'm referring to, is the follow up, yeah.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.200
Yeah, I don't think we've seen that.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.040
And nobody's really talked about it

02:21.040 --> 02:22.600
since the project shut down.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.560
No, and I think until we see that,

02:24.560 --> 02:27.240
we can't say for any certainty whether we trust anything

02:27.240 --> 02:28.640
that's derived from it.

02:28.640 --> 02:29.360
That must be it.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.720
Because what if there's a fundamental flaw in there?

02:31.720 --> 02:35.920
Now that they gave up like this, that whole thing's

02:35.920 --> 02:37.120
still very unsettling.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.080
I don't really understand what happened there.

02:40.080 --> 02:40.920
I don't know.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.880
And now, looking back, it's so weird,

02:42.880 --> 02:45.600
all the things that have happened since TrueCrypt

02:45.600 --> 02:47.920
threw in the hat.

02:47.920 --> 02:48.960
That was pre-Harpley.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.080
That was pre-Shellshock.

02:50.080 --> 02:53.240
And all these essential open source utilities

02:53.240 --> 02:55.920
have had these vulnerabilities in them now.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.280
Makes you wonder what the state of TrueCrypt really is.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.160
And so if there's anything based off it.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.480
You know, that's the other thing.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.440
Remember, the developers said, don't base your future stuff

03:03.440 --> 03:03.960
off ours.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.760
Just start from new code.

03:05.760 --> 03:06.360
Quite.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.880
Yeah, that's another risk.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.720
That's weird when the developer says, yeah,

03:09.720 --> 03:11.320
you don't want to use what I know.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.400
So I realize why they said it.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.400
They said it because when you start going and, well,

03:17.400 --> 03:18.440
that one thing.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.760
But to go in to take something and then try and slap things

03:21.760 --> 03:24.840
on top of it, as soon as you start slapping things on top,

03:24.840 --> 03:26.800
that's just another point where you can poke at.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.760
Yeah, you end up with a Windows release.

03:28.760 --> 03:29.360
Exactly.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.600
Yeah.

03:30.600 --> 03:31.400
Nobody wants that.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.560
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

03:40.560 --> 03:44.160
that's powered by a cup of coffee and two energy drinks.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.720
My name is Chris.

03:45.720 --> 03:46.480
My name is Matt.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.840
I might have a heart attack during today's show, Matt.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.160
So if you hear something that sounds like my face smacking

03:51.160 --> 03:53.600
into the microphone, just spring into action.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.520
Make sure you close out the show and remind people

03:56.520 --> 03:58.600
about all the stuff I always remind people about.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.100
And then we'll just clean up the mess later, OK?

04:01.100 --> 04:03.320
Because there doesn't even have to be a video

04:03.320 --> 04:04.700
show in here until Thursday.

04:04.700 --> 04:07.160
So if you think about it, if I'm dead, you got time.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.120
Don't even rush down.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.480
You can just get down here and clean me up

04:09.480 --> 04:10.800
when you get a chance, OK?

04:10.800 --> 04:11.280
There you go.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.840
I think if we can get past the bloat

04:12.840 --> 04:15.880
and not get a hand truck in there, I think we're OK.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.760
Yeah, and actually, it'd be a good time, too,

04:17.760 --> 04:20.160
because I just got the new Borderlands prequel just

04:20.160 --> 04:21.920
came out for Linux this morning installed.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.800
So I'll have that up on my machine.

04:23.800 --> 04:24.960
So you could just play that when you get here.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.880
So it's worth the trip, too.

04:25.880 --> 04:26.320
There you go.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.000
So you're welcome.

04:27.000 --> 04:27.280
Nice.

04:27.280 --> 04:27.920
Yeah.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.800
All right, well, coming up on today's episode,

04:29.800 --> 04:31.200
we got a couple of topics that I want

04:31.200 --> 04:33.720
to throw in everybody's faces to get some discussion going.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.560
Not only did we get some great emails,

04:35.560 --> 04:37.920
which I think will get us going on a few things,

04:37.920 --> 04:39.120
I'm really looking forward to that.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.640
I want to talk about some of the next generation

04:40.640 --> 04:43.780
apps coming to Ubuntu that we got a sneak peek at today.

04:43.780 --> 04:46.020
And then we've heard a lot of times

04:46.020 --> 04:48.240
it's hard to develop applications for Linux.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.160
It's too fragmented.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.280
It's changing too much.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.360
How do you write for an operating system that's

04:52.360 --> 04:54.440
constantly changing underneath you?

04:54.440 --> 04:56.560
Well, we actually have a real world example

04:56.560 --> 04:59.600
of how that affected something that I think you've probably

04:59.600 --> 05:00.960
heard of before.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.220
It didn't all end badly, but it does give us

05:03.220 --> 05:05.560
a little perspective on some of the challenges writing

05:05.560 --> 05:09.560
a major enterprise-grade application for Linux can face.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.720
So it should be a good show.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.400
Why don't we bring in the Mumble Room with us

05:12.400 --> 05:13.200
so we start off the email?

05:13.200 --> 05:14.160
Hey there, Mumble Room.

05:14.160 --> 05:15.520
Time appropriate greetings.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.480
Time appropriate greetings.

05:16.480 --> 05:16.980
Evening.

05:16.980 --> 05:18.520
Hello.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.160
What?

05:20.160 --> 05:22.400
I like that somebody always gets a little singing in there.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.120
That's good.

05:23.120 --> 05:23.720
All right.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.880
So PM wrote in and wanted to pick up

05:25.880 --> 05:28.200
on our discussion regarding Netflix

05:28.200 --> 05:31.320
and how Linux users are all in on DRM now that Netflix is

05:31.320 --> 05:31.940
here.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.760
He says, hello, Chris Matt, Mumble Room chat room.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.720
I just wanted to offer my opinion on the Netflix

05:35.720 --> 05:38.600
equals Linux users are fine with DRM thing.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.280
I personally don't like DRM.

05:40.280 --> 05:43.360
And I'm certainly not all in on it, but let's be honest.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.720
The fact that Netflix now works on the desktop for Linux

05:45.720 --> 05:48.720
is a coincidence, not an intention.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.680
Netflix, Google, et cetera, pushed DRM into HTML5

05:51.680 --> 05:55.240
because they want to offer content on Roku, Android

05:55.240 --> 05:56.680
devices, et cetera.

05:56.680 --> 05:59.160
Because this DRM scheme is now part of HTML5,

05:59.160 --> 06:01.400
Linux users can enjoy it as well.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.080
But it wasn't put there because of us.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.160
That's for sure.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.680
Now we can do two things.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.560
We can be angry at Netflix, not watch it,

06:07.560 --> 06:09.560
and they're going to continue business as usual

06:09.560 --> 06:12.320
because, quite frankly, they don't care much about us.

06:12.320 --> 06:15.060
The DRM will still happily remain baked into HTML5

06:15.060 --> 06:16.720
because it wasn't put there because of us

06:16.720 --> 06:17.880
in the first place.

06:17.880 --> 06:21.000
It was put there for smart TVs and set-top boxes

06:21.000 --> 06:23.400
that they'll continue to sell regardless.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.280
We as Linux users can cry all we want, but DRM is now in.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.280
And it's up to us whether we at least use it

06:29.280 --> 06:31.880
for some benefit to us, like Netflix on the desktop,

06:31.880 --> 06:34.640
or cry about it and have none of the benefit with no one

06:34.640 --> 06:37.720
listening to our cries about DRM anyways.

06:37.720 --> 06:38.880
So nailed it.

06:38.880 --> 06:39.680
So nailed it.

06:39.680 --> 06:40.160
Oh, man.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.280
Wow.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.320
Wow, that is.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.040
I almost stood up and applauded.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.680
It kind of is a bit of a reality check.

06:47.680 --> 06:51.720
Eric, do you think Netflix maybe has a little responsibility

06:51.720 --> 06:53.240
to bear here?

06:53.240 --> 06:54.820
I think they have some responsibility,

06:54.820 --> 06:57.240
but I don't think they are the main reason.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.240
They've come out and said if they could skip the DRM,

07:00.240 --> 07:02.360
they would because it's a headache on them.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.440
It's something they don't want to have to deal with.

07:04.440 --> 07:08.760
It's the MPAA, the Motion Picture Association of America,

07:08.760 --> 07:11.120
that is forcing this on them.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.400
So it's all of the copyright holders

07:13.400 --> 07:16.120
that are forcing this on them because they don't want

07:16.120 --> 07:17.920
any chance of piracy.

07:17.920 --> 07:18.720
They say that.

07:18.720 --> 07:19.600
They say that.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.840
But the thing is, it's going to happen regardless.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.440
But how come House of Cards and Orange

07:23.440 --> 07:26.160
is the New Black also are still wrapped up in DRM?

07:26.160 --> 07:27.480
Netflix made those whole cloth.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.960
They own them.

07:28.960 --> 07:29.640
Yes, they did.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.560
Because they already had it developed.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.560
Yeah, I suppose.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.120
I mean, I just, whatever.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.760
I mean, I think PM nails it.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.400
It's like it's not even for us.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.280
Our protests matter nothing.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.960
Like, we're just shouting into the wind

07:40.960 --> 07:44.160
because it really is more about Chromebooks and tablets

07:44.160 --> 07:48.400
and Android devices and Rokus than it is Linux users.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.280
Aren't all these examples Linux-based anyway?

07:50.280 --> 07:53.840
So inherently, they are looking at it.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.480
They might not care as much.

07:55.480 --> 07:56.760
Right.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.960
It's not like we just happen to luckily get it.

07:58.960 --> 08:02.440
I mean, they're focusing on devices that support Linux.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.900
Yeah, is that what you think, Wizard?

08:03.900 --> 08:05.560
You think it's like they are focusing on Linux,

08:05.560 --> 08:07.020
but it's not the desktop Linux user?

08:07.020 --> 08:08.160
Absolutely.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.960
They do care about Linux as a platform.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.120
They don't care about the Linux users.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.440
As far as they're concerned, they said,

08:14.440 --> 08:16.680
we need a platform that we're going to put out there.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.480
But we don't care about those users.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.680
We want the users that are going to be using our Roku,

08:20.680 --> 08:22.640
our solution on top of it.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.200
Yeah, yeah.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.040
Good point.

08:25.040 --> 08:25.860
Yeah, and you know what?

08:25.860 --> 08:27.780
This is just sort of the benefit of Linux

08:27.780 --> 08:30.520
becoming one of the general technology platforms,

08:30.520 --> 08:32.640
is we get to go along for the ride sometimes.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.760
And I think that's totally fine.

08:34.760 --> 08:35.840
Yeah, it's a good thing.

08:35.840 --> 08:39.280
My point is we need to be pointing the finger,

08:39.280 --> 08:41.640
blaming the people who deserve the blame.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.240
I think Netflix is an easy scapegoat.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.880
You're saying, Eric, show me the money.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.440
Show me the money!

08:47.440 --> 08:49.520
Follow the money back to the content creators,

08:49.520 --> 08:51.240
and they're the ones pulling the strings.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.080
Yeah.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.080
Mm-hmm.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.920
All right, Nathan writes in.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.600
Get ready for this one, Popeye and Wimpy.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.320
He has questions about a software store.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.000
He's got some ideas and some concerns.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.820
Hello, Chris Matt, chat room, mumble room, et cetera.

09:02.820 --> 09:05.720
I was thinking long and hard today about Linux users

09:05.720 --> 09:06.880
and purchasing software.

09:07.780 --> 09:10.000
I know about the struggles large companies have

09:10.000 --> 09:11.800
when thinking about moving over to Linux

09:11.800 --> 09:13.600
and how there is not really a good way

09:13.600 --> 09:16.160
to get their software purchased on end users' computers.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.760
The one package for all thought comes to mind,

09:18.760 --> 09:21.200
though it isn't exactly easy to get distros on board,

09:21.200 --> 09:23.340
especially when you don't have a track record

09:23.340 --> 09:26.280
of anything like this really working that well at all.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.240
So I was thinking about these software stores.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.840
Something could almost be like the way the AUR works,

09:30.840 --> 09:32.780
where the front end knows how to build the program

09:32.780 --> 09:34.160
for that specific distribution,

09:34.160 --> 09:36.960
and you as the user just have to click download and install,

09:36.960 --> 09:39.780
and the app store in the background does the building.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.720
From there, all you have to do is get the payment system

09:41.720 --> 09:43.000
working and you're off to the races.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.840
Since compiling applications between distros

09:44.840 --> 09:46.140
is more or less the same,

09:46.140 --> 09:48.180
everyone could just follow tar.gz instructions,

09:48.180 --> 09:50.000
a software store could just do all of the work

09:50.000 --> 09:51.680
on the back end for you.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.320
So this leads me to my question.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.140
If you were to make a software store,

09:55.140 --> 09:57.360
what would you do to help this process go smoothly?

09:57.360 --> 09:58.920
This type of store will only gain traction

09:58.920 --> 10:01.200
and help the Linux desktop if it worked across distros,

10:01.200 --> 10:03.520
so let's keep that in mind when discussing this.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.080
Also, I'm a Mac guy.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.920
I love Linux, but I only know so much,

10:06.920 --> 10:08.720
so maybe I'm completely off on this concept,

10:08.720 --> 10:11.220
but as a Mac user, he seems like this is something we need.

10:11.220 --> 10:13.960
So I wanted to start with Popey and Wim

10:13.960 --> 10:15.960
because you guys were sort of kicking around some ideas

10:15.960 --> 10:17.480
of what could work for an app store,

10:17.480 --> 10:19.540
and I know you guys definitely weren't thinking

10:19.540 --> 10:20.940
something that builds software,

10:20.940 --> 10:22.040
and I don't even think you were thinking

10:22.040 --> 10:24.020
something across distro.

10:24.020 --> 10:26.000
Well, in fact, it's quite interesting

10:26.000 --> 10:29.680
that the way he describes how a store should work,

10:29.680 --> 10:32.120
that the back end builds the software

10:32.120 --> 10:34.360
and then you just click a button and download a binary,

10:34.360 --> 10:36.960
that is exactly what the Ubuntu Software Center does.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.680
It builds it in a PPA, they're private PPAs,

10:39.680 --> 10:41.360
and when you buy a piece of software,

10:41.360 --> 10:43.280
you are allowed access to a private PPA

10:43.280 --> 10:44.460
where that software was built

10:44.460 --> 10:45.560
and it downloads to your machine.

10:45.560 --> 10:46.400
So-

10:46.400 --> 10:47.240
I think he's talking about compiling them, right?

10:47.240 --> 10:49.560
It's only for one, yeah, and it does that.

10:49.560 --> 10:50.400
Oh, okay. It does that.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.780
Okay. So that bit, yeah,

10:51.780 --> 10:53.080
he's got that completely nailed,

10:53.080 --> 10:54.560
but what he's talking about is building

10:54.560 --> 10:56.880
for multiple platforms, so you have one store

10:56.880 --> 10:58.360
where you click a button and it figures out

10:58.360 --> 11:01.120
that you're on Fedora, so it builds and gives you an RPM.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.440
That would all be magical,

11:02.440 --> 11:05.160
getting buy-in from everyone, tricky.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.840
That's harder.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.240
You think?

11:09.240 --> 11:14.240
So it seems to me that it would almost be, in a sense,

11:14.280 --> 11:16.520
the burden would be on the software center

11:16.520 --> 11:20.240
or whatever you want to call it, to figure out that magic,

11:20.240 --> 11:22.560
but for these developers-

11:22.560 --> 11:25.560
It depends whether you're talking about free software,

11:25.560 --> 11:28.520
open source software, or proprietary software,

11:28.520 --> 11:31.600
because some developers want to put their free

11:31.600 --> 11:34.880
and open software and, okay, they build it in the cloud

11:34.880 --> 11:37.520
and download, works for that,

11:37.520 --> 11:38.680
but what about those developers

11:38.680 --> 11:40.840
who are running proprietary software?

11:40.840 --> 11:44.800
So the individual developers or the app developers

11:44.800 --> 11:46.560
who are creating applications,

11:46.560 --> 11:48.720
they will build it locally on their machine

11:48.720 --> 11:50.100
and then upload a binary.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.640
So it doesn't work for every use case.

11:53.640 --> 11:54.640
Well, I'm also now thinking

11:54.640 --> 11:56.260
of the OpenSUSE build service, right?

11:56.260 --> 11:57.760
Where it builds- Yeah.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.240
Go ahead. Go ahead, Wimpy.

11:59.240 --> 12:02.840
Well, yeah, I was just gonna say the build from source idea

12:02.840 --> 12:05.040
is fine, but you would need somebody

12:05.040 --> 12:07.440
to actually put the effort in to create the packaging

12:07.440 --> 12:09.920
for the different end distributions.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.000
So I have some experience in packaging

12:12.000 --> 12:15.280
on Arch Linux, Debian, and Ubuntu,

12:15.280 --> 12:19.080
and I can't directly take my packaging from Arch

12:19.080 --> 12:21.160
and apply it in dev files

12:21.160 --> 12:23.940
because the concepts are totally different from one another.

12:23.940 --> 12:27.000
So you have to do whole cloth implementations

12:27.000 --> 12:29.360
and the packaging for each distribution separately,

12:29.360 --> 12:33.560
and also spec files from RPMs are different to devs

12:33.560 --> 12:36.560
and different to Arch PKG builds.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.840
So you could build it from source,

12:38.840 --> 12:41.040
but somebody would have to be the package maintainer

12:41.040 --> 12:42.880
for all of the things.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.840
This is why I think the way that we've done it

12:44.840 --> 12:48.160
with the phone, which is the developer builds it

12:48.160 --> 12:51.160
and they upload a binary, is the better way forward.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.160
Because then you make, as you as a developer,

12:53.160 --> 12:55.240
make sure that your thing works,

12:55.240 --> 12:57.040
and if it works and you can build it locally

12:57.040 --> 12:58.320
and you can test it in an emulator

12:58.320 --> 13:00.720
or test it on your device or desktop or whatever,

13:00.720 --> 13:03.600
and then once you've built a compiled version,

13:03.600 --> 13:05.120
you upload that into the store

13:05.120 --> 13:06.640
and make that available to people.

13:06.640 --> 13:10.080
So iogogo, you mentioned the magic Docker word

13:10.080 --> 13:12.160
that seems to be the buzz phrase

13:12.160 --> 13:14.000
that everybody uses to solve problems like this.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.480
What were you thinking in terms of how Docker

13:16.480 --> 13:17.520
could solve this?

13:17.520 --> 13:20.800
Well, from what I've read in places,

13:20.800 --> 13:23.520
I've heard that Docker basically emulates

13:23.520 --> 13:28.520
distros on top of an existing software or kernel.

13:31.480 --> 13:35.560
But you could use, companies could use that to,

13:35.560 --> 13:37.840
I can't talk with this echo.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.160
So you're thinking that companies

13:40.160 --> 13:42.320
could deliver their applications.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.520
Close your mic, I'll summarize.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.040
You're thinking people could deliver their applications

13:47.040 --> 13:48.560
through Docker, and they are kind of starting to do that.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.840
Like I deployed Smokeping on my Arch setup over that,

13:51.840 --> 13:54.680
and I found it to be really simple and straightforward.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.040
And of course, it means I'm kind of running

13:56.040 --> 13:57.560
an Ubuntu machine in a container.

13:57.560 --> 14:00.280
And that, that makes me go back to that.

14:00.280 --> 14:01.560
Do you make that sound bad?

14:01.560 --> 14:02.400
Well, no.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.240
You're like, oh God, I'm running an Ubuntu in a container.

14:05.240 --> 14:09.120
No, it seems like a lot of extra overhead

14:09.120 --> 14:10.360
to run a single application.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.680
Like a lot of extra stuff has to be updated

14:11.680 --> 14:13.920
and maintained now, but in the long run,

14:13.920 --> 14:16.360
I'm not convinced it's not, it might be better.

14:16.360 --> 14:21.080
I mean like, build it in a Docker container,

14:21.080 --> 14:23.400
and then you give out the binary from the Docker container,

14:23.400 --> 14:24.640
and like you have different registers

14:24.640 --> 14:26.560
in the Docker containers.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.120
With all the thousands of gigabytes of storage

14:29.120 --> 14:31.800
that you need to be on the server side for these companies

14:31.800 --> 14:35.360
in order to get all the combination of phones fixed

14:35.360 --> 14:38.240
and figured out and relatively bug free,

14:38.240 --> 14:41.800
either they can do it and host 50 different binaries

14:41.800 --> 14:43.400
for 50 different things that they know

14:43.400 --> 14:45.440
should cover most phones.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.040
It's very hard to go and just give the software store

14:48.040 --> 14:49.080
the source.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.960
Then you can use your phone to chug through it

14:50.960 --> 14:52.400
and compile it straight up on your phone

14:52.400 --> 14:54.760
because you're gonna need some serious power cord usage

14:54.760 --> 14:55.680
after that.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.320
Otherwise, like they need to make sure

14:57.320 --> 15:01.420
that all these programs, apps are compiled

15:01.420 --> 15:05.840
for their target operating system in a runtime environment.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.460
And in order to get all that,

15:07.460 --> 15:10.480
it's a lot of space used up on their servers.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.440
Rotten, I wanna hear your grand vision

15:12.440 --> 15:14.000
of one app store to solve all,

15:14.000 --> 15:15.920
because this is exactly what Nathan's going after.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.240
What do you think?

15:17.240 --> 15:20.400
Yeah, a universal app store for Linux

15:20.400 --> 15:21.680
would be the perfect option

15:21.680 --> 15:25.120
because it would be a structure more in the sense

15:25.120 --> 15:28.240
that every single app, every single distro

15:28.240 --> 15:29.880
can keep doing whatever they wanna do.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.000
They can use RPM, they can use Deb or whatever.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.120
And this software center or store or whatever

15:35.120 --> 15:37.760
just gives you the packages that are for your distro.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.600
And based on which it's installed to,

15:39.600 --> 15:40.640
it can tell what distro it has.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.480
So it knows what packages to give you.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.840
So it'll give you an RPM if you need RPM,

15:44.840 --> 15:47.020
Deb if you're on Debian, stuff like that.

15:47.020 --> 15:47.860
I don't know.

15:47.860 --> 15:50.800
I feel like this problem is already solved

15:51.960 --> 15:53.680
by our friends over at Valve.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.780
I mean, we all have different distributions.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.140
All of us have Steam installed.

15:57.140 --> 15:58.920
We're all downloading and installing applications.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.620
They don't have to only deliver desktop games.

16:01.620 --> 16:04.560
They could also deliver desktop productivity applications.

16:04.560 --> 16:05.400
They already have some in their store.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.240
Well, they do.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.060
Right.

16:07.060 --> 16:08.120
And they do what I suggested,

16:08.120 --> 16:10.160
which is the developer uploads a binary.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.680
They don't build it in Steam.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.520
Right.

16:12.520 --> 16:13.720
The developer builds the binaries

16:13.720 --> 16:16.280
and uploads a Windows binary, a Mac binary,

16:16.280 --> 16:19.960
a Linux 32-bit binary, and that works.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.480
So we have, I see in front of us,

16:22.480 --> 16:24.700
we have Lenart and the Known Team's version

16:24.700 --> 16:29.200
of distributing software through like a ButterFS,

16:29.200 --> 16:31.320
you know, a Delta.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.960
You have delivering applications through Docker.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.800
You have delivering applications through an App Store,

16:35.800 --> 16:38.900
Steam, the openSUSE build service.

16:38.900 --> 16:40.740
Obviously, I think it's pretty clear

16:40.740 --> 16:42.440
that even though this is,

16:42.440 --> 16:43.640
we're working towards something,

16:43.640 --> 16:44.480
and we just haven't,

16:44.480 --> 16:46.000
we still haven't figured out what it is.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.280
It's kind of crazy.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.560
It kind of is over the top.

16:50.560 --> 16:51.720
But I feel like we're getting somewhere,

16:51.720 --> 16:54.000
and I kind of feel like containerization

16:54.000 --> 16:56.920
and all this stuff is almost going to maybe

16:56.920 --> 16:58.500
start nullifying all these differences.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.120
And we might look back at a time

17:00.120 --> 17:02.920
where developers and package maintainers

17:02.920 --> 17:05.000
know what all of these little things are,

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
but it's been pretty well abstracted away from the end user.

17:08.000 --> 17:08.840
So that's my vision.

17:08.840 --> 17:10.640
Steam plus OBS would be awesome.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.720
My long-term vision is distros will keep

17:12.720 --> 17:14.800
their distro-specific tools that they use

17:14.800 --> 17:16.680
to manage their software and build their distribution.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.080
But long-term, it's almost abstracted away

17:19.080 --> 17:20.000
from the user in all cases.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.800
I mean, you see it today

17:21.800 --> 17:24.160
where now the GNOME Software Center,

17:24.160 --> 17:28.440
it's the same way to install Transmit on Fedora

17:28.440 --> 17:29.840
as it is on Arch now.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.400
And they are hugely different under the hood

17:32.400 --> 17:33.760
in terms of installing packages.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.520
But that's ginormous, right?

17:35.520 --> 17:37.160
And that's one instance of it.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.480
And that's maybe just a little glimpse into the future.

17:39.480 --> 17:40.680
I don't know.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.100
I just really, really think it's going to change eventually.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.480
It has to change eventually, I think.

17:45.480 --> 17:46.320
Because it's something that does keep coming up.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.800
If you don't move forward, you're moving backward.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.600
Well, and it's something that never goes away,

17:51.600 --> 17:53.280
especially when people switch to Linux.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.120
So it's always an email that's coming in our inbox

17:55.120 --> 17:56.240
because people are switching over to Linux.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.860
And they're like, what a mess!

17:58.860 --> 18:01.100
You know, because on Windows and Mac,

18:01.100 --> 18:02.480
when you want to download something,

18:02.480 --> 18:05.640
even though it's a little more archaic than how we do it,

18:05.640 --> 18:07.280
to the end users, it makes a lot of sense.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.320
You Google the name of the thing, Skype.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.240
You click on the Skype download Google results,

18:12.240 --> 18:15.040
like the second or third result, right, every time.

18:15.040 --> 18:18.360
You download it to your desktop and you double click it.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.120
And that's how they think software is supposed to work.

18:20.120 --> 18:24.280
And so the idea to them that you download something

18:24.280 --> 18:26.440
for Linux and it could work on one Linux

18:26.440 --> 18:29.120
and not work on another Linux, that's broken to them.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.040
That is fundamentally flawed.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.280
That's a flaw to them.

18:32.280 --> 18:33.560
And I can see it that way.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.440
So I think eventually it's going to have to be abstracted out.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.080
Something smarter is going to have to happen.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.380
Well, and you say that it's archaic,

18:39.380 --> 18:42.680
but I mean, the reality is if all the software existed

18:42.680 --> 18:46.000
in every software repository, I would agree with you.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.080
But since it doesn't, depending on which distro I'm using,

18:49.080 --> 18:50.280
drastically varies.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.800
Yeah, it can still happen.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.360
Yeah, I mean, it drastically depends

18:53.360 --> 18:55.080
on what software is available to me, right?

18:55.080 --> 18:58.560
But what I mean, they get all their software that way, right?

18:58.560 --> 19:00.720
For Linux users, we have in repos, we can download it.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.140
But for them, they go hunt and peck

19:03.140 --> 19:03.980
and download from the web.

19:03.980 --> 19:05.860
And that's why sometimes they download the wrong thing

19:05.860 --> 19:08.080
and they get malware, like it's not a safe,

19:08.080 --> 19:11.720
like trying to get printer drivers for something that,

19:11.720 --> 19:15.520
yeah, it's very different than how you do it under Linux.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.640
And to them, it's totally, it doesn't make any sense

19:17.640 --> 19:20.200
how you do it under Linux, how you install software.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.840
I specifically, I know I've mentioned this a lot,

19:21.840 --> 19:25.360
but watching Chase try to install a few applications

19:25.360 --> 19:27.680
for the first time on Ubuntu,

19:27.680 --> 19:29.840
and other people I've had try it too.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.440
Every time I tell them, okay,

19:31.440 --> 19:32.640
now let's install some software,

19:32.640 --> 19:35.060
even though I intentionally kind of introduced them

19:35.060 --> 19:37.040
to the software center and then close it

19:37.040 --> 19:38.120
and make sure we move on and say,

19:38.120 --> 19:39.660
okay, now let's install some software.

19:39.660 --> 19:42.100
I swear, every time they open up the browser

19:42.100 --> 19:45.240
and they go to Google, they don't even think about it.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.480
They don't even think about packages.

19:47.480 --> 19:48.320
No, they don't.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.200
I think you're also combating muscle memory.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.040
People have it wired into their,

19:53.040 --> 19:55.040
it's like, people that are analytical,

19:55.040 --> 19:56.520
they're dealt with a certain situation,

19:56.520 --> 19:59.140
they instantly go into solving mode,

19:59.140 --> 20:00.800
whereas someone else just goes into freak out mode.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.160
I think it's the same sort of thing.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.640
These people have been wired to find software

20:04.640 --> 20:06.640
in this fashion, and you're having to unlearn that.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.480
Yeah, exactly.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.300
And then it may take some time.

20:08.300 --> 20:09.140
It's all training.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.640
Yeah, yep, yep, it doesn't, yeah, exactly.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.120
You can teach, trust me, you can teach an old dog new tricks.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.280
Hey, speaking of new tricks,

20:14.280 --> 20:15.480
let me tell you about DigitalOcean.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.360
They got a few new tricks I'd like to tell you about.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.320
Oh, you're not familiar with DigitalOcean, my friends?

20:19.320 --> 20:21.640
Now's the time to go to DigitalOcean.com,

20:21.640 --> 20:24.480
because we've got a promo code for the month of October.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.920
They'll get you a $10 credit.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.880
Hey-oh, unplugged October, all one word lowercase,

20:28.880 --> 20:29.720
$10 credit.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.700
So what is DigitalOcean?

20:32.920 --> 20:34.560
It's like a warm cloud blanket.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.640
You just want to wrap up it,

20:35.640 --> 20:37.120
and you set up all kinds of droplets,

20:37.120 --> 20:38.400
because it's a simple cloud hosting provider

20:38.400 --> 20:39.760
dedicated to offering the most intuitive

20:39.760 --> 20:41.460
and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

20:41.460 --> 20:44.080
Users can get started in less than 55 seconds, trust me.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.880
And pricing plans start at only $5 a month

20:46.880 --> 20:48.480
for 512 megabytes of RAM.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.920
A 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU,

20:51.920 --> 20:53.760
and a terabyte of transfer for $5.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.100
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York,

20:56.100 --> 20:59.480
San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and up in London.

20:59.480 --> 21:01.080
Why not get some global diversity?

21:01.080 --> 21:02.840
That's what I always say.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.740
In fact, I've been doing that.

21:05.740 --> 21:09.280
I actually have done it just for performance purposes,

21:09.280 --> 21:11.000
because we have a lot of folks that are syncing

21:11.000 --> 21:14.760
to some of our resources from other parts of the world.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.420
So I thought, okay, let's have a server in their area.

21:16.420 --> 21:17.260
That just makes sense.

21:17.260 --> 21:18.920
But then I later realized,

21:18.920 --> 21:21.520
hey, I just distributed my data across the world,

21:21.520 --> 21:23.240
and now I have regional backups.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.060
That's great.

21:24.060 --> 21:25.720
So that's also great from that standpoint as well.

21:25.720 --> 21:28.320
So you can do it for performance or for data purposes.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.960
And I think the other thing that's really awesome

21:29.960 --> 21:31.160
about DigitalOcean is,

21:31.160 --> 21:33.060
I know that because their interface is so great,

21:33.060 --> 21:34.800
I can really get up and get something running

21:34.800 --> 21:35.840
in pretty much no time.

21:35.840 --> 21:38.360
So getting the server part ready, spun up, backed up,

21:38.360 --> 21:40.320
whatever I need to do before a project,

21:40.320 --> 21:42.160
DigitalOcean makes that crazy easy.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.900
So that's never the barrier to getting started,

21:43.900 --> 21:44.880
which I really appreciate,

21:44.880 --> 21:47.280
because their interface is super simple and intuitive,

21:47.280 --> 21:48.840
and you can replicate the functionality

21:48.840 --> 21:50.960
on a larger scale with their API.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.200
But something new DigitalOcean's doing.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.640
Now it's your chance to make a little cash on the side.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.200
If you're an expert in something,

21:57.200 --> 21:58.920
you want to deploy, if you've deployed something

21:58.920 --> 22:00.560
and you want to write a tutorial for it,

22:00.560 --> 22:03.040
DigitalOcean can pay up to $200 for your tutorial,

22:03.040 --> 22:05.000
and they have editors that will work with you,

22:05.000 --> 22:07.120
so don't worry, the burden's not all on your shoulders.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.960
They just need somebody that really knows their stuff,

22:08.960 --> 22:11.400
because DigitalOcean wants to get their community tutorials

22:11.400 --> 22:14.000
beyond anything else that anybody else has,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.960
and that's why they're willing to pay the good 200 bucks.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.200
That's some good money for writing.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.500
Yeah, that's actually, in most circles,

22:22.500 --> 22:24.640
for just a standard article,

22:24.640 --> 22:25.840
it's outlining how to do something.

22:25.840 --> 22:26.760
That's the going rate.

22:26.760 --> 22:27.600
That's not bad, right?

22:27.600 --> 22:29.820
I mean, especially if it's something you already know.

22:29.820 --> 22:31.600
If it's something you already know,

22:31.600 --> 22:32.720
and you know what I would have done, Matt,

22:32.720 --> 22:36.720
is I think like, even if I already had,

22:36.720 --> 22:38.460
if I just wanted a little play money,

22:38.460 --> 22:42.120
I mean, I could take those credits or something,

22:42.120 --> 22:43.520
put them on my DigitalOcean account,

22:43.520 --> 22:45.720
and have my droplet pay for for a long time,

22:45.720 --> 22:47.560
because they're talking it's $5 a month.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.880
But even if I, I kind of kick myself,

22:49.880 --> 22:52.220
because I think I probably could have taken advantage

22:52.220 --> 22:54.200
of this when I first deployed OwnCloud 7.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.560
I had that up and running the night it came out,

22:56.560 --> 22:58.480
and then I had a whole bunch of people asking me

22:58.480 --> 22:59.720
how I got OwnCloud 7 running,

22:59.720 --> 23:01.480
and I thought, you know what?

23:01.480 --> 23:02.400
I could have written that up,

23:02.400 --> 23:03.840
worked with one of the DigitalOcean editors,

23:03.840 --> 23:05.280
and potentially made $200.

23:05.280 --> 23:06.480
So I'll have a link in the show notes

23:06.480 --> 23:08.280
if you want to find out more information about that.

23:08.280 --> 23:11.240
It's an initiative that DigitalOcean's really excited about,

23:11.240 --> 23:13.160
because they're trying to get that just better than anybody.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.280
They've already got amazing tutorials, a great community,

23:15.280 --> 23:16.720
now they're trying to make it better than ever.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.480
DigitalOcean.com, check them out.

23:18.480 --> 23:22.240
Unplugged, October, we'll get you that $10 credit.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.060
Find out why Matt and I have got like droplets

23:24.060 --> 23:26.160
coming out of our ears these days.

23:26.160 --> 23:27.700
Well, and just to touch on that whole writing thing

23:27.700 --> 23:29.280
one more time, what I'm saying is that

23:29.280 --> 23:32.360
most places that you go to seek out freelance work for,

23:32.360 --> 23:34.040
you're not getting paid anywhere near that.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.000
This is unusual.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.520
This is more closer to pro-level pay.

23:36.520 --> 23:37.560
It's a good opportunity.

23:37.560 --> 23:38.880
I know. It's a great opportunity.

23:38.880 --> 23:39.760
I know, right? It's good money.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.280
And especially, I know people in our audience,

23:41.280 --> 23:43.040
there's stuff out there they know a lot about.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.520
Definitely. They can make a little extra money on.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.780
All right, so we've got a couple more emails

23:46.780 --> 23:48.120
that I think are really gonna get us going

23:48.120 --> 23:49.440
on a couple of topics.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.640
So let me jump back into the emails here.

23:51.640 --> 23:54.440
First email that we're gonna talk about is Peter's,

23:54.440 --> 23:56.480
and he wants to know, this is a question I get all the time.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.120
He says, hey Chris, the other day I was watching

23:58.120 --> 23:59.720
one of the episodes of LASS,

23:59.720 --> 24:01.180
and you jumped into a terminal

24:01.180 --> 24:02.700
when you were installing an app.

24:02.700 --> 24:03.840
While you were using the terminal,

24:03.840 --> 24:06.080
I noticed a kind of auto-completed helper tool

24:06.080 --> 24:08.200
that would suggest your next command.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.160
I tried searching for bash in the search input field

24:10.160 --> 24:11.640
on your site, but it returned a bunch of shows

24:11.640 --> 24:13.960
where I could not easily find any mention of the tool.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.840
And if you're watching on the video version here,

24:16.840 --> 24:20.400
I'll bring up my terminal on, here's a big fonts.

24:20.400 --> 24:24.920
And if you'll notice, if I start typing packer or ping,

24:24.920 --> 24:27.920
you see how it's starting to automatically suggest

24:27.920 --> 24:28.760
commands for me.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.400
And I could hit over error and it'll complete the command

24:30.400 --> 24:31.600
and then it'll run a search.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.120
That is Fish Shell.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.040
That's the Fish Shell.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.380
And I like it a lot.

24:35.380 --> 24:39.320
It's just in the Arch, it's in probably every distro package.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.080
It's in the Arch packages too.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.000
And I installed Fish a while ago because I'm a lazy person.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.720
And I mostly run the same, I run about the same 10, 15,

24:47.720 --> 24:49.820
20 commands on the command line over and over again.

24:49.820 --> 24:54.320
Systemctl, restartplex, pacman-syu, you know,

24:54.320 --> 24:56.360
those kinds of things over and over again.

24:56.360 --> 24:59.880
And so the nice thing about Fish is it not only

24:59.880 --> 25:02.240
is really smart about figuring out what directory

25:02.240 --> 25:03.080
you're trying to get to.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.360
Like here, I'll show you another one back on my screen here.

25:06.360 --> 25:09.800
In the mornings, I'm constantly, right before I go on live,

25:09.800 --> 25:12.440
I'm downloading like an old retro tech commercial

25:12.440 --> 25:13.960
for Tech Talk Today.

25:13.960 --> 25:16.280
So a lot of times if I just type in CD,

25:16.280 --> 25:18.800
now it's automatically suggesting the path

25:18.800 --> 25:19.800
that I might wanna go to.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.320
In this case, it's Dropbox slash Jupiter remote host

25:22.320 --> 25:23.160
slash today.

25:23.160 --> 25:25.360
It's a fairly lengthy path.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.680
And instead of me having to type in there,

25:26.680 --> 25:27.680
Fish Shell's saying, well, you know,

25:27.680 --> 25:28.880
you type this one a lot.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.560
Because I pretty much type that every single morning.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.560
So if I hit the over arrow,

25:31.560 --> 25:33.240
it just completes that whole path for me.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.560
And then I hit enter.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.760
And I also like the way it displays my current,

25:36.760 --> 25:39.120
my present location, all that kind of stuff.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.000
So I know Fish Shell isn't the best.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.840
Any Shells in the Mamba Room anybody wants to call out

25:42.840 --> 25:43.940
that you love besides Bash?

25:43.940 --> 25:45.600
Any Bash alternatives?

25:45.600 --> 25:49.000
I'm just saying, Chris, I saw that one on that show

25:49.000 --> 25:51.240
and I changed my default to Fish having seen it.

25:51.240 --> 25:53.680
Just for the few seconds I saw it on your screen.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.080
It's handy, right?

25:55.080 --> 25:55.960
Yeah, it's awesome.

25:55.960 --> 25:56.960
Yeah.

25:56.960 --> 26:00.840
I know a lot of people like ZSH, but I like Fish better.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.920
Yeah, ZSH, I think, is I also see recommended the most.

26:03.920 --> 26:07.880
And I think Fish and, oh, Heaven, so Heaven,

26:07.880 --> 26:11.840
do you know ZSH, so Fish and ZSH are related?

26:11.840 --> 26:16.040
I'm pretty sure that Fish was created from ZSH.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.600
ZSH, uh-huh, that makes sense.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.960
Because, you know, Shells aren't exactly the most easiest

26:19.960 --> 26:22.480
thing in the world to, you know, come up out of thin air.

26:22.480 --> 26:26.760
So all of the Fish beauty is built on top of ZSH's awesome

26:26.760 --> 26:27.520
built-in stuff.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.720
And Fish just knew how to use ZSH.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.840
Blaster, you have a Shell you like.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.880
Yeah, I've come to like TCSH, actually,

26:35.880 --> 26:38.960
after working on some of the BSD servers that I have access to.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.320
Very nice, very nice.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.160
So there you go.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.480
There are some Shells you can check out besides boring old

26:43.480 --> 26:44.640
Shell Shocked Bash.

26:44.640 --> 26:45.320
I kid.

26:45.320 --> 26:46.640
All right, Mike writes in.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.120
And guess what Mike wants to stir the pot on?

26:49.120 --> 26:51.360
System D. But I thought it was actually a good email.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.560
So we'll go into this.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.720
Not to get the whole System D discussion going again,

26:54.720 --> 26:56.320
but he says, I finally identified

26:56.320 --> 26:59.160
why I've disliked System D for so long.

26:59.160 --> 27:03.360
And now that I identified that, I'm actually OK with System D.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.160
I have a feeling that my situation also

27:05.160 --> 27:08.520
applies to many other who have disliked System D.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.760
What frustrated me the most about System D

27:10.760 --> 27:13.520
is that it had an awful product positioning,

27:13.520 --> 27:15.320
for lack of a better term.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.960
When it first came out, it billed itself

27:16.960 --> 27:19.960
as a simple init replacement, plus a syslog replacement,

27:19.960 --> 27:22.160
plus a cron replacement, which in my mind

27:22.160 --> 27:24.640
makes it about as much sense as putting alcohol, tobacco,

27:24.640 --> 27:27.000
and firearms under a single agency.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.880
But at least I could get my head around it,

27:28.880 --> 27:29.840
and I was fine with it.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.160
But then it started taking control of login

27:32.160 --> 27:34.360
and managing my temp mount, among other things.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.440
I became confused and frustrated.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.000
This wasn't part of the agreement.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.960
What kind of cancer is this System D?

27:39.960 --> 27:42.320
I've since realized that even though System D still describes

27:42.320 --> 27:44.340
itself as just being an init replacement,

27:44.340 --> 27:47.000
it's actually designed to become an entire operating system

27:47.000 --> 27:47.800
layer.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.080
It wants to be in charge of everything

27:49.080 --> 27:51.560
that happens between the kernel and X11.

27:51.560 --> 27:58.480
Udev, Dbus, login, DHCP client, WPA supplicant, et cetera.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.600
If there's a job that runs before the display manager

28:00.600 --> 28:03.340
starts, System D wants to provide it.

28:03.340 --> 28:06.680
Now that I know what System D's true purpose is,

28:06.680 --> 28:08.640
it no longer confuses and frustrates me.

28:08.640 --> 28:11.360
In fact, I'm kind of OK with it.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.320
I could even go ahead and replace mount NFS

28:13.320 --> 28:14.800
tab for all I care.

28:14.800 --> 28:17.440
I mean, that's what it's designed to do, right?

28:17.440 --> 28:18.120
Is he right, guys?

28:18.120 --> 28:19.920
Is System D designed to just manage

28:19.920 --> 28:23.040
all of the things between the kernel and X?

28:23.040 --> 28:23.800
Yeah.

28:23.800 --> 28:24.960
Yeah, I think it kind of is, Tim.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.360
I think it's providing that kind of abstraction.

28:26.360 --> 28:27.360
That's my impression.

28:27.360 --> 28:27.860
Yeah.

28:27.860 --> 28:29.200
All right, Otter, you have something to say.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.040
Go ahead.

28:31.040 --> 28:36.040
Yeah, I was just going to say this idea has occurred

28:36.040 --> 28:38.480
to other people as well.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.520
Upstart was also going to replace

28:40.520 --> 28:45.760
cron and auto mounting and things like that.

28:45.760 --> 28:49.520
The difference is Upstart had a limited budget,

28:49.520 --> 28:53.800
whereas System D had Red Hat behind it.

28:53.800 --> 28:54.920
Well, OK, yes.

28:54.920 --> 28:59.120
I want to go back up.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.080
So System D, Michael Dominic on Quota Radio,

29:02.080 --> 29:04.280
if you haven't listened to this week's Quota Radio,

29:04.280 --> 29:06.920
he goes after me the entire episode.

29:06.920 --> 29:09.800
And he got on me about System D and was really

29:09.800 --> 29:11.180
trying to get to the root of it.

29:11.180 --> 29:12.840
And one of the things that he sort of stressed

29:12.840 --> 29:13.840
was like, wait a minute.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.320
When you describe it, it sounds almost like some

29:15.320 --> 29:16.560
of these things are necessary.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.560
And I'll give you an example of one of the things

29:18.560 --> 29:22.880
that System D does for me on my servers that, to me,

29:22.880 --> 29:25.360
feels like something that has to be in Linux for it

29:25.360 --> 29:26.400
to stay competitive.

29:26.400 --> 29:29.960
And that is that System D manages my NFS mounts.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.880
And the reason why I find that to be important

29:31.880 --> 29:33.920
is because I've had networking issues here at the studio

29:33.920 --> 29:34.680
because of Comcast.

29:34.680 --> 29:37.000
And we reboot things like our router and even the switch

29:37.000 --> 29:38.440
just to be safe sometimes.

29:38.440 --> 29:41.000
And my network connections go up and down.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.440
And System D recognizes that and is intelligent enough

29:44.440 --> 29:47.240
to re-establish my NFS mount after the network connection

29:47.240 --> 29:50.520
is live again, which makes all of the server software that

29:50.520 --> 29:52.760
runs over that NFS mount continue to function

29:52.760 --> 29:54.560
without me having to do anything.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.560
Now, that's handy just here having a server that

29:57.560 --> 29:59.400
never leaves the studio.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.660
But on a laptop or a phone or a tablet

30:01.660 --> 30:03.680
where you're moving between cellular and Wi-Fi

30:03.680 --> 30:05.680
and different Wi-Fi networks, that's

30:05.680 --> 30:07.620
a must-have critical feature.

30:07.620 --> 30:09.360
And that's just one thing that System D now

30:09.360 --> 30:13.920
manages that is extremely I just I don't even

30:13.920 --> 30:15.200
think it's a nice-to-have feature.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.200
I think it's like we've got to have that now.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.920
The operating system has to be more cohesive.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.560
It has to be more intelligent.

30:21.560 --> 30:25.200
It has to be communicating with each other to stay competitive.

30:25.200 --> 30:28.560
And I mean competitive in a way where people actually continue

30:28.560 --> 30:30.600
to use it because if it doesn't do these things,

30:30.600 --> 30:33.000
it'll start to look old and not appropriate

30:33.000 --> 30:34.840
for modern-day tasks.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.760
And I recognize that we're kind of betting a lot on System D,

30:37.760 --> 30:39.600
but I don't see anybody else really.

30:39.600 --> 30:41.180
I guess that's part of it is I don't really

30:41.180 --> 30:44.280
see any other alternatives really kind of stepping up

30:44.280 --> 30:45.960
to do the whole thing.

30:45.960 --> 30:49.160
Well, that's the key is that nobody else is doing it.

30:49.160 --> 30:51.960
And it seems to be a great solution.

30:51.960 --> 30:52.800
It's worked for me.

30:52.800 --> 30:55.040
It's worked for a lot of people.

30:55.040 --> 30:58.120
PC Wiz, you think it's more it's not what System D does.

30:58.120 --> 30:58.840
It's how it does it.

30:58.840 --> 30:59.680
What do you mean?

30:59.680 --> 31:03.720
I think just the way they're not using standard Unix pipes

31:03.720 --> 31:06.480
and things to communicate between the different utils

31:06.480 --> 31:09.000
is what's upsetting most people.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.160
Because if they just set it out like standard Unix utilities

31:13.160 --> 31:15.840
and used pipes to communicate between them,

31:15.840 --> 31:18.600
then I don't think people would have such a problem with it.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.480
But because it's doing its own custom thing

31:21.480 --> 31:23.760
and outputting the binary files, that's

31:23.760 --> 31:25.520
the problem people have with it.

31:25.520 --> 31:29.120
Not particularly that all this stuff shouldn't be there

31:29.120 --> 31:32.680
and shouldn't be unified under one set of things,

31:32.680 --> 31:34.320
but it should be in different bits

31:34.320 --> 31:37.240
that talk in a standard Unix way.

31:37.240 --> 31:37.920
All right.

31:37.920 --> 31:38.400
All right.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.400
Very good.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.760
Now we're going to open up something special.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.680
We're all done with the System D debate.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.960
We've got to talk about Ubuntu and the future

31:47.960 --> 31:50.080
and some really flashy stuff that I saw today.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.080
And I'm glad that Popeye is here,

31:52.080 --> 31:54.880
because maybe I think we'll get this straight with Popeye.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.760
We won't make it awful.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.640
Popeye will save us, I'm told.

31:59.640 --> 32:00.320
I'm told.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.360
Hopefully.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.060
Hopefully.

32:02.060 --> 32:04.280
Because I want to discuss, we've got some great visuals

32:04.280 --> 32:06.780
of the next generation apps that we'll probably

32:06.780 --> 32:08.480
be able to get our hands on in Ubuntu 14.10

32:08.480 --> 32:09.800
just to play around with.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.520
And I want to see what you guys think

32:11.520 --> 32:15.160
and kind of get your take on if you

32:15.160 --> 32:19.320
think they're going to get the job done for you

32:19.320 --> 32:20.640
and if you're excited about them.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.920
I actually watched a video, I don't know who posted it.

32:22.920 --> 32:26.440
I'll have to get that before we go on, this morning.

32:26.440 --> 32:29.680
And some of those apps are looking pretty damn good,

32:29.680 --> 32:32.940
especially the movies and videos app look really good.

32:32.940 --> 32:34.640
So before we get to that, I want to tell you

32:34.640 --> 32:36.600
about our next sponsor, and that's Linux Academy.

32:36.600 --> 32:40.960
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug to get the 33% discount

32:40.960 --> 32:43.040
and to check out the brand new website.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.600
Man, Linux Academy just really spruced it up.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.100
Go over there just to check that out.

32:47.100 --> 32:50.560
These guys, I got to talk to them.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.400
I got to talk to them to redesign the Jupyter

32:52.400 --> 32:55.320
Broadcasting website because I tell you, this is how you do it.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.120
I could see this look working for us.

32:57.120 --> 32:57.880
I could see that.

32:57.880 --> 32:58.860
So what is Linux Academy?

32:58.860 --> 33:00.000
It's probably where you should go right now

33:00.000 --> 33:01.700
if you're ready to take your Linux skills up

33:01.700 --> 33:04.120
to the next level, make yourself a little more competitive,

33:04.120 --> 33:06.360
maybe get that checkbox on the next review

33:06.360 --> 33:08.120
or just sort of test yourself, find out

33:08.120 --> 33:09.400
what you're interested in.

33:09.400 --> 33:12.120
Linux Academy has a whole range of courses,

33:12.120 --> 33:14.160
and your subscription gets you access to all of it

33:14.160 --> 33:15.960
and all of the new stuff they're adding.

33:15.960 --> 33:19.320
DevOps stuff, AWS classes, basic Linux classes

33:19.320 --> 33:22.840
to expert level Linux classes, OpenStack.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.420
And they have seven plus distributions

33:24.420 --> 33:25.360
you get to choose from when you're

33:25.360 --> 33:26.600
taking any of these courses.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.280
The courseware will modify itself

33:28.280 --> 33:29.760
to match that distribution.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.960
They have downloadable comprehensive study guides.

33:31.960 --> 33:33.600
You can take those offline.

33:33.600 --> 33:37.080
That includes media like audio and video files as well.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.520
I've heard from many listeners who now use those downloads

33:39.520 --> 33:41.740
as sort of like supplemental podcasts.

33:41.740 --> 33:43.240
So when they're out listening to the shows,

33:43.240 --> 33:44.680
they get a lecture learning in.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.360
And Linux Academy also has the ability

33:46.360 --> 33:49.120
to generate a learning course, a learning plan,

33:49.120 --> 33:50.600
just based on your availability.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.440
You go in there and plug in the information you've got.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.840
They'll build a plan that fits your schedule.

33:54.840 --> 33:56.320
When you open up the dashboard, you

33:56.320 --> 33:58.560
get an immediate snapshot of right where you're at,

33:58.560 --> 34:00.560
what you have, how long each section is going to take.

34:00.560 --> 34:01.360
You can do recaps.

34:01.360 --> 34:02.440
You can test yourself.

34:02.440 --> 34:04.400
You can re-watch video introductions.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.840
And if you get to a spot, you can also seek instructor help.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.820
They also have an active community and live streams

34:08.820 --> 34:10.780
of events where you can talk right to the educators.

34:10.780 --> 34:12.400
They're constantly adding new stuff.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.440
A lot of these are scenario-based training courses.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.640
That way you go end to end with the technology.

34:16.640 --> 34:18.960
For example, if it's an AWS course,

34:18.960 --> 34:21.440
you'll implement things on EC2 and S3.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.040
They'll spin up the instances for you

34:23.040 --> 34:24.640
as the courseware requires it.

34:24.640 --> 34:26.040
That's really awesome.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.840
And now these servers have public addresses

34:27.840 --> 34:29.260
so that way other people can log in

34:29.260 --> 34:30.480
and you can work in a group.

34:30.480 --> 34:31.640
It's pretty awesome stuff.

34:31.640 --> 34:34.080
And they're adding new things all the time.

34:34.080 --> 34:36.840
So head over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.520
You'll get a 33% discount.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.480
And this is a school put together

34:40.480 --> 34:42.640
by Linux enthusiasts and educators who

34:42.640 --> 34:44.840
had the know-how to do something like this, who

34:44.840 --> 34:47.700
wanted to give Linux users a spot to go and actually learn

34:47.700 --> 34:49.640
something, and not this stuff that you

34:49.640 --> 34:52.040
go to that's sort of like cookie cutter Linux

34:52.040 --> 34:54.760
material that's been put together by some industry.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.040
This is from stuff from folks who work in the industry.

34:57.040 --> 35:00.280
They really know their stuff and they're experienced educators.

35:00.280 --> 35:04.080
It's an experience that's custom crafted for Linux users.

35:04.080 --> 35:07.560
And you can find it linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

35:07.560 --> 35:09.760
Check out all of their awesome stuff.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.480
It's another great way to go if you just

35:11.480 --> 35:12.940
want to spruce up your skills.

35:12.940 --> 35:15.200
I've mentioned before they've got courseware on rsync

35:15.200 --> 35:17.720
and backup scripts, bash scripting, things like that,

35:17.720 --> 35:22.280
Android development, PHP, the entire LAMP stack, all of that.

35:22.280 --> 35:24.280
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

35:24.280 --> 35:26.360
And a big thank you to Linux Academy

35:26.360 --> 35:29.200
for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.520
OK, so I'm not going to play a lot of this video

35:31.520 --> 35:32.840
because a lot of people listen to the show

35:32.840 --> 35:33.720
in the audio version.

35:33.720 --> 35:35.960
But Popeye, I assume you've seen this video that

35:35.960 --> 35:38.600
was posted online, the Ubuntu next gen apps for 14.10.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.760
Have you seen this?

35:39.760 --> 35:41.080
No.

35:41.080 --> 35:41.760
No, I have.

35:41.760 --> 35:42.240
OK.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.400
I've only briefly, I haven't actually watched the whole thing.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.960
So I've never seen the movies app.

35:45.960 --> 35:47.520
This is the first time I've, I think

35:47.520 --> 35:48.920
maybe I've seen screenshots of it,

35:48.920 --> 35:51.520
but it's like the first time I've ever seen the UI resizing.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.160
Is that Flashback?

35:53.160 --> 35:53.880
I don't know.

35:53.880 --> 35:55.120
It just says movies in the title bar.

35:55.120 --> 35:55.760
Yeah, Flashback.

35:55.760 --> 35:56.080
Right.

35:56.080 --> 35:56.800
Is that the name of it?

35:56.800 --> 35:57.360
Flashback?

35:57.360 --> 35:57.960
Yeah.

35:57.960 --> 35:58.680
Cool.

35:58.680 --> 36:01.480
So this is the one that gets shown.

36:01.480 --> 36:03.200
Then also music gets shown quite a bit.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.960
What we're seeing is it's obviously,

36:04.960 --> 36:06.680
like for those of you listening, I mean,

36:06.680 --> 36:09.080
this is clearly a touch UI.

36:09.080 --> 36:11.040
And that makes sense at this stage, too.

36:11.040 --> 36:13.440
But it's fully usable on the desktop.

36:13.440 --> 36:17.160
And the rescaling has surprising functionality on the desktop.

36:17.160 --> 36:19.680
Like there's actually like, I always

36:19.680 --> 36:22.600
pictured that dynamic rescaling really just for like going

36:22.600 --> 36:23.520
from phone to desktop.

36:23.520 --> 36:26.480
But it actually works really well on the desktop,

36:26.480 --> 36:28.600
too, just depending on where you position the window.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.440
It all looks pretty slick.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.400
Most of the apps actually in that video

36:32.400 --> 36:34.280
haven't been optimized for desktop.

36:34.280 --> 36:35.200
I could imagine that.

36:35.200 --> 36:38.680
Most of them are actually tuned for phone and tablet.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.640
And we're not even begun to work on them for the desktop.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.840
We've done the absolute minimum to get them working

36:43.840 --> 36:44.200
on the desktop.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.000
And some of them actually look really good.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.280
So I mean, kind of what like I'm going

36:48.280 --> 36:49.800
to take an optimistic road here.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.560
And I'm going to go like way down the road,

36:52.560 --> 36:56.040
like even maybe past 1604.

36:56.040 --> 36:59.360
But we're going way down the road here.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.680
Is really what we would have is at that point,

37:01.680 --> 37:04.520
the Ubuntu desktop is almost entirely an ecosystem

37:04.520 --> 37:06.040
of its own in terms of apps, right?

37:06.040 --> 37:09.960
So it's got presumably Unity 8 by that point.

37:09.960 --> 37:13.400
It's got its own terminal app, its own file manager,

37:13.400 --> 37:14.280
all these things.

37:14.280 --> 37:15.120
So that's a lot.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.280
In one sense, it's a big burden for Canonical

37:17.280 --> 37:18.080
to maintain all that stuff.

37:18.080 --> 37:20.120
But in the other sense, it's nothing not different

37:20.120 --> 37:21.880
than what the GNOME project itself is doing,

37:21.880 --> 37:24.760
or elementary OS is doing, with potentially a lot less

37:24.760 --> 37:26.040
resources.

37:26.040 --> 37:29.000
And it seems to be maybe this is kind of becoming the trend,

37:29.000 --> 37:33.960
is just to create your entire own ecosystem under Linux?

37:33.960 --> 37:34.480
Not really.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.440
We didn't create everything from scratch.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.320
I mean, worth noting that most of the apps that

37:38.320 --> 37:42.240
are in that video were created by people in the community.

37:42.240 --> 37:45.320
They weren't actually created by Canonical.

37:45.320 --> 37:47.080
The projects were started by Canonical.

37:47.080 --> 37:49.600
Pretty much 80%, 90% of the code,

37:49.600 --> 37:51.240
if not more, in some of those projects

37:51.240 --> 37:53.800
was written by community people, volunteers.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.680
And they're the people I work with every day.

37:56.680 --> 38:00.400
And they're not all written from scratch, either.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.560
So for example, you happen to mention

38:02.560 --> 38:06.720
the two apps which build upon existing frameworks.

38:06.720 --> 38:11.360
So for example, the terminal app builds on a console plugin,

38:11.360 --> 38:13.760
the KDE console plugin.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.680
And the file manager builds on some modules

38:16.680 --> 38:19.880
that give us the basic file manager functionality.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.080
And on top of that, we built a QML interface.

38:22.080 --> 38:24.520
So what you're kind of saying is a lot of this functionality

38:24.520 --> 38:25.520
kind of comes for free.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.400
And then you have to kind of build maybe something

38:27.400 --> 38:28.800
on top of it, in a sense.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.200
So it's not like it's a massive.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.800
Yeah, we have to build the QML UI on top, yeah.

38:32.800 --> 38:34.760
So there really is a potential for Ubuntu

38:34.760 --> 38:38.440
to have some pretty good first class grade applications that

38:38.440 --> 38:41.880
are kind of exclusive to the Ubuntu desktop touch platform.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.280
Well, they don't have to be exclusive.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.320
I don't mean intentionally exclusive.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.040
Right, I mean, they're all free software.

38:48.040 --> 38:50.160
So if you wanted to run them on your platform,

38:50.160 --> 38:52.520
as long as you've got the necessary dependencies, which

38:52.520 --> 38:56.280
for most of them is have you got Qt 5.3, which

38:56.280 --> 38:58.960
is in Debian and various other distros.

38:58.960 --> 39:01.560
I'm sure it's already in Arch.

39:01.560 --> 39:04.240
You could probably run most of this stuff.

39:04.240 --> 39:07.440
So it's not intentionally specific to Ubuntu.

39:07.440 --> 39:10.480
Yes, it uses the Ubuntu look and feel, uses our toolkit,

39:10.480 --> 39:12.440
uses our branding.

39:12.440 --> 39:17.360
And we target Ubuntu as the first platform.

39:17.360 --> 39:21.720
I'm picturing 17.04, 18.10 releases,

39:21.720 --> 39:26.240
like the amount of features, because at that point,

39:26.240 --> 39:27.960
there will be so many applications that

39:27.960 --> 39:31.120
get updated as part of an Ubuntu desktop update.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.720
Looking at where 14.10 is at today versus where something

39:33.720 --> 39:36.480
like 18.10 would be at, there is going

39:36.480 --> 39:38.520
to be a whole new suite of applications

39:38.520 --> 39:40.060
that are shipped in those updates that

39:40.060 --> 39:42.240
don't even exist today on the Ubuntu desktop.

39:42.240 --> 39:45.200
Right, and those don't have to be created by us.

39:45.200 --> 39:49.160
We've created this store where you can upload your own apps.

39:49.160 --> 39:50.740
I'll give you a good example, actually.

39:50.740 --> 39:55.200
This week, I saw someone tweet about a calculator app

39:55.200 --> 39:56.720
for Firefox OS.

39:56.720 --> 39:59.640
And I found it on GitHub, and I grabbed the code,

39:59.640 --> 40:00.680
and I packaged it up.

40:00.680 --> 40:04.840
It's an HTML5 app, and I stuck it in the Ubuntu click store.

40:04.840 --> 40:07.000
And now that's available for people on the phone.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.280
And in the future, that will be available on the desktop.

40:09.280 --> 40:12.320
And that took me minutes to take a piece of code that

40:12.320 --> 40:15.040
had already been written, turn it into a package.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.560
The package consisted of like three files,

40:17.560 --> 40:19.440
three plain text files that are easy to do.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.080
In fact, I copy and pasted them from another one

40:21.080 --> 40:21.840
on my projects.

40:21.840 --> 40:25.560
So it's like near zero effort to take a piece of code

40:25.560 --> 40:27.960
that you've created and make it available.

40:27.960 --> 40:30.040
And in the future, yeah, we'll have

40:30.040 --> 40:33.600
the store that will allow you to deploy those click

40:33.600 --> 40:36.040
packages to desktop, tablet, phone, Gmail.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.280
So what do you think about the fact

40:38.280 --> 40:42.320
that some Linux users will be coming to Ubuntu

40:42.320 --> 40:43.700
from a different distro, and it's

40:43.700 --> 40:45.200
going to be like an entirely, they're

40:45.200 --> 40:47.240
going to have, they'll have to learn an entirely

40:47.240 --> 40:49.760
different suite of applications.

40:49.760 --> 40:50.400
Right.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.160
And look how awesome they already are,

40:53.160 --> 40:55.640
and we're nowhere near ready for those people yet.

40:55.640 --> 40:56.120
Right.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.560
Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying it's going to be a bad thing,

40:57.560 --> 40:59.760
but it's going to be, for me, it's

40:59.760 --> 41:02.080
weird because like right now, if I

41:02.080 --> 41:05.360
learn how to use like a file manager, like say,

41:05.360 --> 41:07.160
Dolphin or whatever, it's the same Dolphin

41:07.160 --> 41:10.000
on all versions of Linux that I installed KDE on.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.600
It's just going to be a different thing.

41:11.600 --> 41:12.440
I'm not saying it's bad or good.

41:12.440 --> 41:13.880
It's just something that's new, I think.

41:13.880 --> 41:15.680
Yeah, but these are default applications.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.480
I mean, look what elementary are doing

41:17.480 --> 41:18.880
with their default applications.

41:18.880 --> 41:22.000
They're setting themselves aside and having their own brand,

41:22.000 --> 41:25.560
their own style, their own theme to set themselves aside.

41:25.560 --> 41:29.120
They're not necessarily forking Linux or anything like that.

41:29.120 --> 41:33.240
They're making a statement that this is what elementary OS is.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.580
And when you come to elementary, you

41:35.580 --> 41:37.160
get slightly different applications.

41:37.160 --> 41:38.800
OK, the file manager looks like a file manager,

41:38.800 --> 41:40.340
and just the same as our file manager

41:40.340 --> 41:41.760
looks like a file manager.

41:41.760 --> 41:44.800
The music app will have different features, maybe more,

41:44.800 --> 41:46.160
maybe less.

41:46.160 --> 41:48.760
So do you think the biggest challenge will be factoring

41:48.760 --> 41:51.400
these in a way where they seem a little more

41:51.400 --> 41:53.560
native to a desktop interface going forward?

41:53.560 --> 41:55.840
Do you think that's going to be the?

41:55.840 --> 41:58.920
I don't think that's the biggest issue.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.440
It's one of the issues.

42:00.440 --> 42:05.200
The design team haven't focused on the desktop.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.200
That's why Unity 8 isn't finished yet.

42:07.200 --> 42:10.880
Unity 8 is a preview remix CD you can get.

42:10.880 --> 42:13.560
It's not the default desktop.

42:13.560 --> 42:15.480
We're not going to make that mistake again.

42:15.480 --> 42:18.680
Yeah, I'm looking forward to at least trying

42:18.680 --> 42:20.480
to get to play around with them a little bit.

42:20.480 --> 42:21.280
I just think it's.

42:21.280 --> 42:22.400
Well, you already can.

42:22.400 --> 42:23.360
They're all available.

42:23.360 --> 42:24.440
They're all free software.

42:24.440 --> 42:26.360
You can grab them and play with them.

42:26.360 --> 42:30.120
Yeah, the code is all on Launchpad.

42:30.120 --> 42:31.320
We build devs.

42:31.320 --> 42:33.120
So yeah, you can install them, or you

42:33.120 --> 42:34.280
can play with them on a phone.

42:34.280 --> 42:37.000
It's impressive to see how far they've come already, really.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.160
I've seen people, I mean, people seem to really not

42:39.160 --> 42:41.280
get past the fact that like, oh, you know,

42:41.280 --> 42:42.760
I've seen a lot of people complain about the file

42:42.760 --> 42:45.400
manager has a huge header bar up top and things like that.

42:45.400 --> 42:47.600
They're obviously not accepting the fact

42:47.600 --> 42:49.960
that they really haven't focused on the desktop UI yet.

42:49.960 --> 42:50.840
Right.

42:50.840 --> 42:53.360
But even on the phone, it has that quite big header.

42:53.360 --> 42:55.280
And we're looking at improving that.

42:55.280 --> 42:57.160
So next week, as I've mentioned to you before,

42:57.160 --> 42:58.520
I'm going to be in Washington, DC.

42:58.520 --> 43:00.000
Yeah, I've heard that, DC, yeah.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.240
And a bunch of the people who wrote those apps that

43:04.240 --> 43:07.280
are in that video, a whole bunch of them are coming with us.

43:07.280 --> 43:10.680
And we're going to work on all kinds of things,

43:10.680 --> 43:15.680
whether it's design, or fixing bugs, performance, feedback

43:15.680 --> 43:16.800
from users.

43:16.800 --> 43:19.960
So we're going to look at comments on those videos,

43:19.960 --> 43:21.260
comments on Reddit threads, and see

43:21.260 --> 43:23.160
what people think of those apps, and see

43:23.160 --> 43:25.440
what we can do to improve them, and how people use them.

43:25.440 --> 43:28.240
So yeah, it's an open source project.

43:28.240 --> 43:32.000
So we take feedback and we improve them.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.280
And I will have the video that was posted,

43:34.280 --> 43:35.240
if you guys are curious.

43:35.240 --> 43:38.560
It's a great video, and we'll have it linked in the show

43:38.560 --> 43:39.240
notes.

43:39.240 --> 43:43.160
And you can just search YouTube for Ubuntu next gen apps

43:43.160 --> 43:45.880
on Ubuntu 14.10, as well, just search YouTube.

43:45.880 --> 43:48.600
And you get to see some of these apps in action here.

43:48.600 --> 43:50.920
Do you know what populates this TV and movies?

43:50.920 --> 43:52.600
What did you call it, Fire or something?

43:52.600 --> 43:55.400
Yeah, that one's called Flashback.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.220
It's written by a guy called Necklash, who's

43:57.220 --> 43:59.880
actually the same guy who wrote the clock app that's

43:59.880 --> 44:02.280
on our phone, that's also in that video.

44:02.280 --> 44:04.640
Is it doing a TVDB search here?

44:04.640 --> 44:07.160
It uses, I think it's called Tracked.

44:07.160 --> 44:08.360
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:08.360 --> 44:10.440
Oh yeah, an online service for tracking the TV program,

44:10.440 --> 44:11.240
if you like, yeah.

44:11.240 --> 44:12.680
And he's one of the first.

44:12.680 --> 44:14.560
I mean, he's blazing a trail.

44:14.560 --> 44:18.240
Because we haven't even written massively convergent apps.

44:18.240 --> 44:21.480
We talk about convergence as this ultimate goal by 1604.

44:21.480 --> 44:22.960
But he's blazing a trail.

44:22.960 --> 44:25.440
He's created a convergent app that works on the phone,

44:25.440 --> 44:27.640
works on a tablet, and works on a desktop,

44:27.640 --> 44:30.280
and adapts itself to the space that's available.

44:30.280 --> 44:31.920
And we're learning from him.

44:31.920 --> 44:35.760
And he gave so much feedback to the SDK developers

44:35.760 --> 44:38.920
at the last summit that we had in Malta.

44:38.920 --> 44:41.480
That's why we have these community people developing

44:41.480 --> 44:43.940
apps, because it helps to further the platform

44:43.940 --> 44:45.400
and give us feedback on what we're doing right

44:45.400 --> 44:46.120
and what we're doing wrong.

44:46.120 --> 44:48.360
Yeah, that's really cool to hear that they're

44:48.360 --> 44:49.560
having a direct impact like that.

44:49.560 --> 44:51.560
Because it's one thing to say community's involved,

44:51.560 --> 44:53.440
but that sounds like community's actually.

44:53.440 --> 44:56.520
Oh, directly, yeah, really directly involved.

44:56.520 --> 44:57.240
That's pretty neat.

44:57.240 --> 44:58.980
I'm looking forward to at least getting it.

44:58.980 --> 45:03.400
But if I install 1410, do I just add a PPA and I get those?

45:03.400 --> 45:05.640
Or how would I get those today if I wanted to play around

45:05.640 --> 45:07.520
with some of that stuff?

45:07.520 --> 45:11.200
So we have a core apps PPA that all the devs

45:11.200 --> 45:13.920
have built for 1410.

45:13.920 --> 45:18.880
So yeah, if you install 1410 and added the core apps PPA,

45:18.880 --> 45:21.720
just Google core apps PPA, you'll find it.

45:21.720 --> 45:24.680
And there are daily builds of all those apps.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.360
I think I'm going to play with that.

45:26.360 --> 45:27.400
Cool, all right.

45:27.400 --> 45:30.640
Yeah, and again, keep in mind, like Poppy said,

45:30.640 --> 45:33.320
they're not yet fully set up for the desktop.

45:33.320 --> 45:34.400
So don't get all judgy.

45:34.400 --> 45:35.560
It's just for playing.

45:35.560 --> 45:36.960
And you know.

45:36.960 --> 45:39.480
Yeah, we get a bit twitchy when we see videos.

45:39.480 --> 45:42.520
I mean, it's great to see people showing off

45:42.520 --> 45:44.760
what the community guys are doing with these apps.

45:44.760 --> 45:48.400
But equally, we get a little bit scared because we

45:48.400 --> 45:49.400
know they're not finished.

45:49.400 --> 45:52.520
And people need to be aware of that.

45:52.520 --> 45:55.680
Yeah, and if there's one you really like,

45:55.680 --> 45:57.920
buy that dev a beer, and maybe he'll implement a feature for you

45:57.920 --> 45:59.200
if you ask him very nicely.

45:59.200 --> 45:59.800
You never know.

45:59.800 --> 46:00.840
Or contribute code.

46:00.840 --> 46:02.440
Yeah, Patchy's welcome, as always.

46:02.440 --> 46:03.640
Always great, too.

46:03.640 --> 46:05.100
All right, well, so I wanted to, while we're

46:05.100 --> 46:06.560
talking about developing software,

46:06.560 --> 46:08.600
I wanted to talk about some speed bumps

46:08.600 --> 46:11.440
that the Lightworks developers ran into.

46:11.440 --> 46:14.180
You know the editor that Matt and I talked about quite a bit

46:14.180 --> 46:15.580
on last, Lightworks?

46:15.580 --> 46:18.040
They ran into a major issue caused

46:18.040 --> 46:21.000
by a Linux kernel update that just sort of blindsided them

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
and took them a while to sort of track it down.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.320
And it's just kind of a good snapshot of sometimes

46:25.320 --> 46:27.840
some of the problems developers face while writing

46:27.840 --> 46:29.760
a major application for Linux.

46:29.760 --> 46:31.800
And how it happened, it's all kind of interesting.

46:31.800 --> 46:32.880
So I'll tell you about that.

46:32.880 --> 46:34.500
But first, I want to tell you about Ting.

46:34.500 --> 46:35.600
Go to linux.ting.com.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.080
Won't you?

46:36.080 --> 46:38.680
linux.ting.com lets them know that you appreciate them

46:38.680 --> 46:40.080
supporting Linux Unplugged.

46:40.080 --> 46:43.120
And it's a good way to go check them out and get a $25 discount

46:43.120 --> 46:44.760
on your first device.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.200
And if you already have a device,

46:46.200 --> 46:48.260
you can get a $25 credit for Ting.

46:48.260 --> 46:48.880
So what is Ting?

46:48.880 --> 46:50.160
It's my mobile service provider.

46:50.160 --> 46:51.340
It's mobile that makes sense.

46:51.340 --> 46:52.960
It's mobile with no contract.

46:52.960 --> 46:55.400
It's mobile where you only pay for what you use.

46:55.400 --> 46:58.640
Ting doesn't have prepaid plans and packages like that.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.000
It's just your usage.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.320
Ting takes your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

47:02.320 --> 47:02.880
They add them up.

47:02.880 --> 47:05.080
Whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you pay.

47:05.080 --> 47:06.780
It's a flat $6 for your line.

47:06.780 --> 47:09.640
So you can have unlimited devices with no contract

47:09.640 --> 47:11.080
and no early termination fee.

47:11.080 --> 47:13.380
And Ting has a rocking dashboard where

47:13.380 --> 47:15.840
you can manage your account, get a snapshot of exactly where

47:15.840 --> 47:16.560
you at.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.880
And they also work on the Android or iOS devices

47:18.880 --> 47:19.560
with their app.

47:19.560 --> 47:21.360
Plus, they've got no hold customer service.

47:21.360 --> 47:23.440
You can call them at 1-855-TING-FTW

47:23.440 --> 47:26.240
any time between 8 AM and 8 PM business hours

47:26.240 --> 47:29.240
and an actual human being, a real one.

47:29.240 --> 47:31.440
Somebody said, please stop saying an actual Canadian.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.240
It makes us feel bad.

47:33.240 --> 47:35.000
I'm including everyone on the planet now.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.200
I don't know if everyone working at Ting is a Canadian or not.

47:38.200 --> 47:39.960
But I do have a pretty good suspicion

47:39.960 --> 47:42.720
that everyone answering the phone is a human being.

47:42.720 --> 47:45.040
I have not personally verified that.

47:45.040 --> 47:47.160
But based on the folks I've talked to,

47:47.160 --> 47:48.620
they seem quite human to me.

47:48.620 --> 47:49.920
So I'm going to vouch for them.

47:49.920 --> 47:52.880
And you can find out by calling them at 1-855-TING-FTW.

47:52.880 --> 47:53.800
Find out for yourself.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.920
They'll probably answer you and any other questions

47:55.920 --> 47:57.220
you have because they're empowered

47:57.220 --> 47:58.200
to solve your problems.

47:58.200 --> 47:59.920
And now is a great time to switch to Ting.

47:59.920 --> 48:03.760
Go to linux.ting.com to get the discount and give us credit.

48:03.760 --> 48:04.880
They have a warehouse sale.

48:04.880 --> 48:06.180
Ting is upgrading their warehouse.

48:06.180 --> 48:09.040
And they'd rather give you these devices for a crazy great price

48:09.040 --> 48:10.040
than have to move them.

48:10.040 --> 48:10.960
Can't say I don't blame them.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.480
That sounds like my style of moving.

48:12.480 --> 48:13.400
Take it.

48:13.400 --> 48:14.520
I don't want it.

48:14.520 --> 48:16.280
I don't want to have to move it.

48:16.280 --> 48:17.560
I hate moving stuff.

48:17.560 --> 48:19.000
Ting feels the same way.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.320
Right now, I can't imagine they're

48:21.320 --> 48:23.120
going to have many more of these in stock.

48:23.120 --> 48:25.600
But you can pick up the Sierra 4G Tri-Band LTE

48:25.600 --> 48:28.640
hotspot for $63 with Ting's warehouse sale.

48:28.640 --> 48:31.680
$63 plus a $20 Ting credit.

48:31.680 --> 48:33.600
And you're going to get our $25 Ting credit.

48:33.600 --> 48:36.120
Now, hold on and think about this.

48:36.120 --> 48:38.320
You only pay them for what you use with this bad boy.

48:38.320 --> 48:41.420
So that's a $6 hotspot because it's $6 for the line.

48:41.420 --> 48:43.680
And then that $20 credit is going to last you a while.

48:43.680 --> 48:47.380
So you can have a hotspot, Tri-Band LTE, like if I was Popey.

48:47.380 --> 48:49.320
And I was going to go to that fake Washington.

48:49.320 --> 48:51.200
I would pick up one of these just for while I was here.

48:51.200 --> 48:52.600
And I wouldn't be able to use the whole thing.

48:52.600 --> 48:54.760
And I'd have data with me the whole time.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.680
Every time I came to the States, I'd turn it on.

48:56.680 --> 48:58.800
And with Ting's dashboard, you can turn things on and off

48:58.800 --> 48:59.760
when you need them.

48:59.760 --> 49:01.440
So it's another great way to save money.

49:01.440 --> 49:02.620
They've got a bunch of great devices

49:02.620 --> 49:04.840
right now, including just straight up feature phones.

49:04.840 --> 49:06.800
Hey, maybe you just want to make a phone call.

49:06.800 --> 49:07.560
I know, right?

49:07.560 --> 49:08.720
You want to use your phone to make calls.

49:08.720 --> 49:09.920
And you just want a really great battery,

49:09.920 --> 49:11.360
like a three-day battery life.

49:11.360 --> 49:13.280
Well, you can pick up a feature phone

49:13.280 --> 49:15.400
right now for a ridiculously low price.

49:15.400 --> 49:20.360
$43 plus $20 in Ting credits with no contract and no early

49:20.360 --> 49:21.280
termination fee.

49:21.280 --> 49:22.800
And you're just paying for your usage

49:22.800 --> 49:23.960
for a feature phone that's going to get

49:23.960 --> 49:25.400
like three days of battery life.

49:25.400 --> 49:27.000
Plus, it still has a decent camera.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.320
So if you get in a car accident and you

49:28.320 --> 49:29.440
need something for the insurance,

49:29.440 --> 49:31.200
you can still at least take a picture of it.

49:31.200 --> 49:32.600
So you're not like a total caveman.

49:32.600 --> 49:34.240
But it's mostly going to be for making calls.

49:34.240 --> 49:35.720
And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

49:35.720 --> 49:37.760
If that's how you rock, that's how you rock.

49:37.760 --> 49:38.760
I respect that.

49:38.760 --> 49:41.360
linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com.

49:41.360 --> 49:45.000
And a big, big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux

49:45.000 --> 49:45.560
Unplugged.

49:45.560 --> 49:48.800
Go check them out.

49:48.800 --> 49:52.120
All right, so now this isn't going to be a pity party.

49:52.120 --> 49:53.280
But I wanted to cover this.

49:53.280 --> 49:55.040
I think it's legit that we talk about this.

49:55.040 --> 49:58.760
And this doesn't have anything to do with packaging.

49:58.760 --> 50:00.680
This doesn't have anything to do a system D

50:00.680 --> 50:02.680
or anything like that.

50:02.680 --> 50:05.480
But Lightworks developer on a Red Shark blog,

50:05.480 --> 50:08.000
that's the blog that tracks the Lightworks development,

50:08.000 --> 50:09.680
talked about the problems he ran into

50:09.680 --> 50:13.400
and the eventual positive side of it by developing for Linux.

50:13.400 --> 50:15.960
He says, in recent weeks, some of the Lightworks Linux users

50:15.960 --> 50:18.040
started to report reduced performance of both new

50:18.040 --> 50:19.760
and old versions of the software.

50:19.760 --> 50:21.960
It's like, hmm, multiple versions are affected.

50:21.960 --> 50:23.960
After some investigation, it appeared to slow down

50:23.960 --> 50:29.080
was only affecting systems with Linux kernels newer than 3.13.

50:29.080 --> 50:31.120
In tests, kernel performance in 3.14

50:31.120 --> 50:33.300
did seem to be slightly worse than earlier versions.

50:33.300 --> 50:34.880
But nothing could explain the symptoms

50:34.880 --> 50:38.760
that were being experienced by Lightworks users.

50:38.760 --> 50:42.680
So what could possibly explain the sudden change in behavior?

50:42.680 --> 50:44.880
Many of the media files that editors use,

50:44.880 --> 50:46.600
you have to understand this part of it.

50:46.600 --> 50:49.280
Many of the media files that editors use are compressed,

50:49.280 --> 50:52.040
like H.264 and stuff like that.

50:52.040 --> 50:57.680
Well, these compressed files have a massive downside.

50:57.680 --> 50:59.520
And it's something that we try to avoid here

50:59.520 --> 51:01.020
at the Jupiter Broadcasting Studios.

51:01.020 --> 51:04.200
We actually record in lossless, with the exception of BSD

51:04.200 --> 51:05.880
Now, because they're recording it

51:05.880 --> 51:07.520
on the east coast of Canada.

51:07.520 --> 51:12.200
So we have one show where we edit a compressed file.

51:12.200 --> 51:14.800
All our other shows are uncompressed.

51:14.800 --> 51:18.160
So media editors, when they're working with compressed files,

51:18.160 --> 51:20.960
have to deal with this thing where

51:20.960 --> 51:24.120
there's these gaps in the frames, where the editor is just

51:24.120 --> 51:27.680
supposed to figure out the frame numbers that go in between.

51:27.680 --> 51:29.680
And it's just sort of assumed you figure it out.

51:29.680 --> 51:31.880
And the problem with that is these editors

51:31.880 --> 51:35.560
have to open up every single frame in between these gaps

51:35.560 --> 51:36.600
to count them all.

51:36.600 --> 51:39.000
And that can take megabytes and megabytes and megabytes

51:39.000 --> 51:41.980
and megabytes of memory per clip.

51:41.980 --> 51:44.640
Because it has to open them all up in a memory to count them,

51:44.640 --> 51:46.300
to figure out the number of frames

51:46.300 --> 51:49.120
in between these gap markers.

51:49.120 --> 51:50.600
And that takes tons of RAM.

51:50.600 --> 51:52.880
That's why you need a lot of RAM in an editing system.

51:52.880 --> 51:55.280
And so what started happening is when

51:55.280 --> 51:58.200
you had tens of hundreds of files open at once,

51:58.200 --> 51:59.640
you start running into low memory.

51:59.640 --> 52:00.960
OK, not a problem.

52:00.960 --> 52:03.160
That's why we have great memory management.

52:03.160 --> 52:05.040
And in fact, Lightworks handles this

52:05.040 --> 52:07.560
by constantly monitoring the system's memory usage.

52:07.560 --> 52:11.020
And then it automatically limits and ultimately empties

52:11.020 --> 52:12.560
its various caches when it notices

52:12.560 --> 52:14.560
the amount of free memory is starting to get low

52:14.560 --> 52:15.800
and staying low.

52:15.800 --> 52:18.960
This technique relies on being able to ask the operating

52:18.960 --> 52:22.000
system, ask the Linux kernel, to report how much memory is

52:22.000 --> 52:24.520
available in total and how much has been used

52:24.520 --> 52:26.840
and how much is available right now to use.

52:26.840 --> 52:30.400
Starting with Linux kernel 3.14, free memory

52:30.400 --> 52:32.880
is being reported entirely differently,

52:32.880 --> 52:35.340
differently enough that it causes Lightworks software

52:35.340 --> 52:38.920
to start believing that there is no free memory left at all

52:38.920 --> 52:40.200
when in fact there was.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.720
As a result, the memory monitoring code

52:41.720 --> 52:44.000
responded as it was designed to by ensuring

52:44.000 --> 52:47.680
that all the frames and file caches were completely empty

52:47.680 --> 52:48.960
all the time.

52:48.960 --> 52:50.700
So as you might imagine, that had

52:50.700 --> 52:53.660
a major detrimental performance effect on the Lightworks

52:53.660 --> 52:54.400
editor.

52:54.400 --> 52:56.520
Every time a frame or file was added to the cache,

52:56.520 --> 52:58.840
it was then having to be immediately purged.

52:58.840 --> 53:02.880
Well, that could happen 30 times a second, right?

53:02.880 --> 53:06.320
Or 60 times a second, depending on what you're editing.

53:06.320 --> 53:09.340
So it was forcing this constant recompressing decompressing

53:09.340 --> 53:13.080
of the media file every time you access that area of the file.

53:13.080 --> 53:15.500
So they immediately didn't leap to the idea

53:15.500 --> 53:17.120
that it was the kernel though, right?

53:17.120 --> 53:20.140
So tracking down the problem became kind of an endeavor,

53:20.140 --> 53:22.760
because it kind of seemed like the culprit would be probably

53:22.760 --> 53:25.060
a piece of their code that wasn't running properly

53:25.060 --> 53:27.900
anymore, rather than a piece of code in the Linux kernel that

53:27.900 --> 53:28.840
was different.

53:28.840 --> 53:30.400
That wasn't what they expected.

53:30.400 --> 53:34.140
Thankfully, they say once they did track it down to the way

53:34.140 --> 53:36.880
3.14 was reporting its memory usage,

53:36.880 --> 53:39.800
rectifying the issue was not a majorly time-consuming process.

53:39.800 --> 53:41.600
And it actually afforded them an opportunity

53:41.600 --> 53:43.400
to rewrite the code in such a way

53:43.400 --> 53:46.120
that it made it immune to further possible kernel changes

53:46.120 --> 53:47.480
like this in the future.

53:47.480 --> 53:49.640
So it sounds like maybe they weren't doing something

53:49.640 --> 53:50.480
quite the right way.

53:50.480 --> 53:52.680
But at the same time, it sounds like a pretty key piece

53:52.680 --> 53:55.000
of the Linux kernel kind of just changed right out

53:55.000 --> 53:56.960
from underneath them.

53:56.960 --> 53:59.600
You wouldn't think it would happen so suddenly like that.

53:59.600 --> 54:02.600
But I've seen, and this is over the course of many years,

54:02.600 --> 54:03.760
that sort of thing happen.

54:03.760 --> 54:04.560
And it's rare.

54:04.560 --> 54:07.920
But when it does, usually it's like a real punch to the face.

54:07.920 --> 54:10.280
And usually I see this with wireless devices.

54:10.280 --> 54:12.280
Every three or four years, they just

54:12.280 --> 54:15.120
do something stupid with the one device that you depend on.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.800
I've learned to have multiple devices.

54:16.800 --> 54:19.880
And to see that in something like software in this space

54:19.880 --> 54:22.600
to where it's like somebody could, as a professional,

54:22.600 --> 54:24.600
be relying on this application.

54:24.600 --> 54:26.240
Oh, hey, by the way, screw you.

54:26.240 --> 54:28.280
You're out of luck.

54:28.280 --> 54:31.200
Through no fault of anyone's, it still sucks.

54:31.200 --> 54:35.120
Derek Devlin, is it Lightworks' responsibility

54:35.120 --> 54:37.400
that their developers have an open dialogue

54:37.400 --> 54:39.080
and relationship with the kernel team?

54:39.080 --> 54:40.400
What are your thoughts?

54:40.400 --> 54:41.440
Definitely.

54:41.440 --> 54:43.440
One of the things Linux is always talking about

54:43.440 --> 54:45.440
is that they won't break user space.

54:45.440 --> 54:47.360
So unless people are saying, look,

54:47.360 --> 54:50.600
this will break user space for me, they won't know.

54:50.600 --> 54:52.720
So they will have to break user space.

54:52.720 --> 54:54.440
And sometimes it's inevitable.

54:54.440 --> 54:56.760
So in the overall, your algorithm

54:56.760 --> 55:00.280
is really bad if it relies on always one functionality,

55:00.280 --> 55:02.160
has no fallback of that functionality.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.560
So if I was doing a predictive algorithm,

55:04.560 --> 55:07.880
I need to make sure that my prediction works.

55:07.880 --> 55:11.480
So I have to put some heuristics that say, OK,

55:11.480 --> 55:12.640
this is changing too fast.

55:12.640 --> 55:15.640
I'm going to start using constants.

55:15.640 --> 55:17.920
And just be a performance hit that it's guaranteed.

55:17.920 --> 55:21.280
Because otherwise, the software becomes unreliable.

55:21.280 --> 55:22.760
That's kind of design.

55:22.760 --> 55:24.160
You make decisions.

55:24.160 --> 55:25.720
They made one that was bad.

55:25.720 --> 55:26.280
I think so.

55:26.280 --> 55:29.120
But kernel Linux isn't this is, but this problem

55:29.120 --> 55:32.000
has sort of already been solved by the marketplace in a sense.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.480
If you're a media production shop

55:34.480 --> 55:37.200
and you're working on Hollywood's next blockbuster,

55:37.200 --> 55:39.120
chances are you're probably not running

55:39.120 --> 55:41.360
Debian, Unstable, or Fedora, right?

55:41.360 --> 55:41.880
Right.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.760
And we're in this boat.

55:43.760 --> 55:46.360
We use Lightworks professionally.

55:46.360 --> 55:49.080
And this is the first I'm hearing about the problem.

55:49.080 --> 55:51.660
And probably the reason is because the production machine

55:51.660 --> 55:52.680
is still on 1204.

55:52.680 --> 55:53.400
Right.

55:53.400 --> 55:54.900
Yeah, wouldn't that be your best bet?

55:54.900 --> 55:55.640
And why not?

55:55.640 --> 55:57.480
Because the primary purpose of the machine

55:57.480 --> 55:59.820
is nothing to do with what the operating system can do.

55:59.820 --> 56:01.760
It's all about running that application.

56:01.760 --> 56:02.560
Well, yeah, exactly.

56:02.560 --> 56:05.160
For us, the machine boots up and Lightworks takes over.

56:05.160 --> 56:07.200
And if you've used Lightworks, then you

56:07.200 --> 56:10.000
know that Lightworks essentially behaves almost

56:10.000 --> 56:11.640
like an independent operating system, right?

56:11.640 --> 56:12.640
That's a monster.

56:12.640 --> 56:15.800
It essentially captures the screen and everything.

56:15.800 --> 56:18.280
You have essentially a little desktop to work on.

56:18.280 --> 56:21.240
So the operating system kind of fades to the background.

56:21.240 --> 56:22.240
Yeah.

56:22.240 --> 56:26.240
And it's exactly why we have, you know, obviously,

56:26.240 --> 56:28.740
the guy that's always talking about Arch and rolling releases.

56:28.740 --> 56:33.320
This is exactly the use case for a long-term stable distro

56:33.320 --> 56:34.520
right here in a nutshell.

56:34.520 --> 56:37.400
Because it isolates you from these kinds of things.

56:37.400 --> 56:41.280
Now, that said, I still elect for my systems to go rolling.

56:41.280 --> 56:43.700
Now, I'll be the first person to tell you, though,

56:43.700 --> 56:46.800
if our editing was done under Linux, which I wish it were,

56:46.800 --> 56:50.160
if it was, I think absolutely we'd probably be LTS.

56:50.160 --> 56:51.700
We'd probably be Ubuntu, because I

56:51.700 --> 56:54.840
think that's probably what the Lightworks guys are targeting.

56:54.840 --> 56:56.800
And that would be the end of it.

56:56.800 --> 57:00.120
And I would not probably want to upgrade from 12.04

57:00.120 --> 57:02.140
until I had to.

57:02.140 --> 57:02.640
Makes sense.

57:02.640 --> 57:04.680
Unless there was some kernel feature I had to have

57:04.680 --> 57:06.240
or something like that.

57:06.240 --> 57:08.520
But when it comes to the systems that I'm

57:08.520 --> 57:11.880
browsing the web and gaming on and show research,

57:11.880 --> 57:13.000
yeah, I want rolling.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.640
I think, I think that's, I don't know.

57:15.640 --> 57:17.520
Daredevil not, oh, go ahead, Matt.

57:17.520 --> 57:19.960
No, I was going to say, I think there's inherent logic to that.

57:19.960 --> 57:22.480
I mean, it's like, of course, I'm not using Lightworks

57:22.480 --> 57:23.320
on a regular basis.

57:23.320 --> 57:25.120
I use other applications for video editing

57:25.120 --> 57:26.680
because I'm much lower level stuff.

57:26.680 --> 57:28.500
But if I was to experience that, I

57:28.500 --> 57:31.040
think it would definitely kind of jolt my chair a little bit.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.620
And it would probably make me re-evaluate

57:32.620 --> 57:34.420
the distro I'm using almost instantly based

57:34.420 --> 57:35.640
on what you described.

57:35.640 --> 57:36.760
Oh, man, you know what?

57:36.760 --> 57:39.280
Wizard just totally made me reconsider my whole position.

57:39.280 --> 57:40.240
Go ahead.

57:40.240 --> 57:43.160
Yeah, so I can totally understand, because I

57:43.160 --> 57:45.320
do deal with this fairly often.

57:45.320 --> 57:48.000
I still deal with my high school sometimes.

57:48.000 --> 57:52.400
And the one thing that always changes is I'm updating FFmpeg.

57:52.400 --> 57:55.480
And FFmpeg moves so fast.

57:55.480 --> 57:59.120
And something small, they could say, oh, well,

57:59.120 --> 58:01.720
we just found out we've been wasting CPU cycles here.

58:01.720 --> 58:03.840
And there's a 10% increase in speed.

58:03.840 --> 58:05.720
And when you're trying to get something

58:05.720 --> 58:08.720
a quick, like I'm sure you do, Chris, then you're going to go

58:08.720 --> 58:10.480
and you're going to say, oh, geez, 10%,

58:10.480 --> 58:13.120
that's like another five minutes off my time.

58:13.120 --> 58:15.440
And I understand.

58:15.440 --> 58:18.300
In fact, that's one of the areas where the Mac is kind of handy

58:18.300 --> 58:21.560
in terms of media production is the user space remains

58:21.560 --> 58:22.760
fairly consistent.

58:22.760 --> 58:25.360
They trickle out updates to Final Cut.

58:25.360 --> 58:28.280
But Rekai, I believe, and I'm not totally positive about this,

58:28.280 --> 58:30.800
because I'm not really involved with that aspect of it,

58:30.800 --> 58:33.900
but I believe Rekai uses something called Brew, which

58:33.900 --> 58:35.760
is kind of like app.get for the Mac.

58:35.760 --> 58:38.400
And Brew just keeps FFmpeg up to date.

58:38.400 --> 58:40.240
So he's always got a fresh FFmpeg,

58:40.240 --> 58:45.520
but his editing tools remain fairly stale,

58:45.520 --> 58:46.960
or however you want to put it.

58:46.960 --> 58:47.600
That's a nice combo.

58:47.600 --> 58:48.240
Homebrew, but yeah, you're close.

58:48.240 --> 58:48.760
Homebrew?

58:48.760 --> 58:50.120
Yeah, OK, yeah, yeah.

58:50.120 --> 58:51.000
So there you go.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.680
And that's a nice system.

58:52.680 --> 58:56.280
And so there's ways you can do it on any box.

58:56.280 --> 58:59.200
What I used to do when I had an old Ubuntu machine that

58:59.200 --> 59:02.440
was my primary driver is I'd custom build FFmpeg.

59:02.440 --> 59:04.880
And that worked, too, so there's always an option.

59:04.880 --> 59:05.760
Yes, sir, yes, sir.

59:05.760 --> 59:06.480
All right.

59:06.480 --> 59:09.160
Well, people have asked if there's any updates

59:09.160 --> 59:10.520
to Ohio Linux Fest.

59:10.520 --> 59:14.000
I'll just mention right before we wrap up, it's still on.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.040
When is that?

59:15.040 --> 59:16.680
It's at the end of October.

59:16.680 --> 59:20.440
And so far, I believe the crew from Jupiter Broadcasting

59:20.440 --> 59:22.920
includes Mr. Kernel Linux and Mr. Q5.

59:22.920 --> 59:25.400
And Kernel Linux, you're getting down there Thursday night.

59:25.400 --> 59:26.240
Is that right?

59:26.240 --> 59:29.560
Well, I might actually be there Tuesday or Wednesday.

59:29.560 --> 59:30.600
What?

59:30.600 --> 59:32.320
Yeah, it's a long story.

59:32.320 --> 59:35.360
OK, OK, I feel bad because I'm not getting there till Friday.

59:35.360 --> 59:38.120
Now I kind of wish I was getting there on Thursday.

59:38.120 --> 59:42.680
But you know, it's kind of, we know, kids.

59:42.680 --> 59:44.400
Did you just say he should feel bad?

59:44.400 --> 59:45.520
Yeah, he did, he did, yeah.

59:45.520 --> 59:46.000
OK.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.120
So if you're going to be in the area on October 24

59:49.120 --> 59:51.600
to the 26th, Jupiter Broadcasting will be rocking.

59:51.600 --> 59:52.600
Kernel Linux will be there.

59:52.600 --> 59:54.680
Q5 will be there.

59:54.680 --> 59:56.280
Angela and I will be there.

59:56.280 --> 59:57.160
Blaster, of course.

59:57.160 --> 59:59.760
Anybody else in the Mumba room going to be at Ohio?

59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.880
That's it, right?

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.600
That's just who is here.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.000
And Eric, you're going to be where and when

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.720
if people want to see you.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.280
I am going to be at Seagull, which

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:13.920
is the Seattle GNU Linux conference at Seattle Community

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.160
College.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.400
Right, and not Seagull like the bird, right?

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.520
How do you spell it?

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.760
S-E-A-G-L. You can find out more information

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.280
at Seagull, Seagull.org.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.320
OK, yeah, and that's going on at the same time

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.200
right there in Seattle, October 24 and 25.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.080
And so you could go down there if you're in the area

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.240
and say hi to Eric.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.160
And this is their second year?

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.480
Yes, this is their second year.

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.620
It's kind of interesting because they've

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.600
got some big names like Karen Sandler is

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.480
going to be doing the keynote.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.400
And there's quite a few people who will be there,

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.280
such as Valerie Zimmerman of Kabuntu,

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.760
as well as Albert Baca of KDE.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.160
So there's quite a few people.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:52.680
Also, Mark Terranova from the Fedora Project

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.680
is rumored to be there.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.280
So there's going to be quite a few people.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.960
Oh, man, so we're going to have double-covered conference

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.640
coverage at the same time.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.040
So while you're in Ohio, you're going to be in Seattle.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.200
And that's going to be, that's nuts.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.080
That's getting.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.600
My interview microphone just arrived in the mail,

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.200
and I just did a quick test on it while we were on the air.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.840
I haven't tested the sound, but it's working pretty good.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.040
Is that a euphemism for something?

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.320
I don't know what that is.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.160
Tested his mic?

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.720
Yeah, he's testing his mic while on air.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.000
I'm not sure what he means by that.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:23.480
All right.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.600
Oh, in a separate system.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.080
I kept myself muted here.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.560
Oh, Wizard, you know about somebody

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.160
who's visiting which one?

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:32.440
So there's actually going to be another big one at Seneca

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.320
College in Toronto.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.080
And anyway, it's going to be fairly big.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.440
There's going to be a Red Hat founder there,

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.640
as well as a couple other pretty important people.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.320
In fact, I believe Mad Dog's going to be there, too.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.720
Yeah, this is the 23rd, I believe.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.080
And where again?

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.960
This is at Seneca College in Toronto.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:51.600
Wow.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.100
Wow.

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:57.000
Talk about a crazy great weekend and open source going-ons.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.320
And what's nuts about that is a couple of days

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.560
after that MeetBSD down in California,

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.840
Alan and Chris Moore will be down there held

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.640
at the Western Digital headquarters put on by IX

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.040
Systems, and they'll be doing live streaming from that.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:14.240
So I guess this must be fest season,

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.160
and we're getting into it.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:16.840
Absolutely.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.880
I guess you got to get all out of the way

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.040
before the holidays and before it gets too crappy outside.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.080
Yeah, no kidding.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:22.600
All right.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.840
Just quickly getting there.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:24.960
I think we're all wrapped up.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.760
I think we got everything I wanted to cover.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.960
One last just little plea for Linux Action Show is I'm,

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.800
I got some in the queue right now,

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.720
but I need more of your runs Linux.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.840
It could be just like you with a selfie in front of your Linux

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:38.720
box, I guess.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:39.400
I don't know.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:40.560
It could be your own runs Linux.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.400
It could be something you find in the wild.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.080
Send it to linuxactionshow at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.640
Include a picture or a link to a YouTube video, if you would.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.920
And in the subject, put runs Linux.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.680
You can also use the contact form

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.160
over at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact,

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.800
and put runs Linux in that subject.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.960
And that's also where you'd go to give us any kind of feedback.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.160
We love reading your feedback.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.720
Every single episode of Linux Unplugged,

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.080
it's a big part of our lug.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.920
If you can't make it to the Mumble Room, which

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.920
is an open Mumble Room you can join for any episodes,

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.440
our virtual lug, we'd love to hear your thoughts in email.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.400
Also, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.700
You can go there and get more show throughout the week

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.500
and help us make the show a little bit better

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.560
by commenting on stuff.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.160
I often look to that subreddit to see

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:20.080
what you guys are talking about to see

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.320
what might get some good conversation going in Linux

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:22.820
Unplugged.

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.520
So even just sharing your insights and your votes

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.240
helps a lot.

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:29.000
And of course, submitting stories and things like that.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.560
Matt, this weekend, if all goes as planned,

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.960
if we get all of our ducks lined up,

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.080
it's the big Ubuntu review, and it's

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.840
going to be a blowout like nothing else,

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.040
including Eric and I are going to be

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.400
doing traveling and all kinds of things to make this happen.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.560
It's going to be a big one.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.280
So I'll see you on Sunday, OK?

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.200
All right, see you then.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:45.720
All right, everyone.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.960
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:48.960
Unplugged.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.960
Be sure to join us every single Tuesday.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:51.920
And if we don't see you on Tuesday,

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.620
hope to see you on Sunday for the big show.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:55.400
See you right back here next week.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:13.960
So until then, thanks for tuning in, and we'll see you next week.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:36.280
Just want to punch Comcast in the throat.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:36.780
That's all.

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.960
I just want to punch him in the throat a little bit.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.440
Yeah, so Matt, if you don't have an Ubuntu 14.

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:45.160
1 from me as well, if you don't have a 14.10 machine loaded up,

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:45.760
get her going.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:50.120
We'll share our thoughts on Sunday's show and kick the tires.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.880
I got a rig that I've got it running on right now,

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.880
and I'll tell everybody more about that on Sunday's show.

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.440
I've got it running on a rig, not only Ubuntu, but Kubuntu

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.440
and Ubuntu Mate.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.920
It's going to be a good one.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.360
So go ahead.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.720
JBtiles.com, that's all I was going to say, JBtiles.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.000
And I was thinking about putting Lubuntu with the LXQT

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:11.500
on there.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.480
What about Lube?

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.560
You pervert.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.240
What about Lube?

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.640
Lubuntu?

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.280
That sounds like the adult version.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.640
Lubuntu.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:20.600
Fish and chips.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:21.560
Exactly, Lubuntu.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.920
Yeah, I think that really exists.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.360
Unifying Linux software is not bad.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:25.880
That's good.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.480
I want to thank Dunder for Fish and Chips.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.600
He gave me the idea.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.840
Comcast Unplugged, no kidding.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.800
The master distribution.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.440
Systemd ain't so bad.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:36.400
JBtitles.com.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.560
Yes?

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:43.440
Thank you for spending a lot of time on those core apps, those

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.960
QML apps, because the guys worked really hard on that.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.920
And it's really nice for them to get a bit of exposure.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:48.680
I think it shows.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.880
Yeah, I thought it showed.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.080
And it's neat to see it.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:54.160
And I don't know how much we'll, since they're not really

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.840
necessarily production ready, I don't

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.680
think we'll spend too much time on them in the review.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.720
So it seemed like a good chance to give them an exposure

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.680
without working them in to review themselves.

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.960
Because I don't think they deserve being reviewed.

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.400
No, they're not ready yet.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.720
And following on from last week's discussion,

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.480
it was a nice bit of positivity.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.960
Yeah, that's true.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.800
Yeah, you bastards.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:13.680
Positive Ubuntu news.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.040
Yay.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.080
All right, are we going to get a title out of this?

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:18.800
Not just Ubuntu, but generally.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.720
Probably not.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:22.440
Well, we've got unifying Linux software at the top.

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.080
It's interesting.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.520
So it was a holiday here in the States Monday.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.440
And it's the Apple event on Thursdays.

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.000
And I think having a holiday at the beginning of the week

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.440
and an Apple event at the end of the week, the news cycle

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.520
just goes like a dead fish.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:38.000
Like it's just dead.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Because A, people weren't working

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.160
at the beginning of the week.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.240
And B, nobody wants anything they announced

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.240
to be completely clobbered up by whatever

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.680
Apple craps out on Thursday.

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:49.000
So nothing's going on this week.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.960
It's Android L as well on Thursday.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.480
Yeah, I actually thought it was tomorrow.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.720
And it's final release for Ubuntu 14.10 as well.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:01.680
Final release candidate.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.800
Yeah, which obviously eclipses anything

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.240
Apple or Google do.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:05.800
That's right.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.280
That's right.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.440
It's all anyone's going to be talking about.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.000
Yeah.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.200
Yeah, it's pretty speak.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:11.880
Yeah.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.800
Speaking of both Apple and Lightworks,

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.840
you know what you should do, Chris?

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.640
You should install Lightworks on your beloved Mac.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.440
And then you could start editing in Lightworks.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.600
And then maybe at some point down the future,

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.800
I could pry you privately.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.440
I love your underhanded, backhanded compliments.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.520
I have it right now.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:29.800
I have one of my bonobes right now, actually.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.160
Oh, yeah?

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.360
You haven't done anything on it yet?

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.880
I edited a couple of our OSCON.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.360
Actually, I edited those a while ago.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:40.880
But yeah, I edited a couple of our OSCON videos.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:41.320
Oh, really?

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:41.320
Yeah.

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:41.840
OK.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.480
Maybe I need to give you more credit.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.960
I think Noah forgot something.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.960
I think you should do is put Lightworks on Mac

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.960
and then play it at HTML5.

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:49.440
Nice.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.720
Well, OK.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:56.080
I just clearly like the way I convert people to Linux

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.440
is I get them using their software

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.240
that they're comfortable with on the platform

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.040
or the software on the platform.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:04.480
So I figure I can baby step Chris away from his Mac and trash.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:08.320
You should, Noah, you should listen to this week's Coda Radio

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.960
because Dominic was on me the whole time about that.

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:14.120
And here's the thing is I think one thing to kind of remember

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.720
is I don't edit anymore.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.240
So it's kind of a thing.

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.360
Yeah, so I mean, for me, that's why I can use Lightworks now

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.240
because the editing I do is much.

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.120
So you don't use a Mac anymore.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.480
You pay someone else to use a Mac for you.

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.360
Yes.

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:28.960
Yes.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:29.480
Yes.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.440
But you know what?

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.240
Here's the thing.

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.880
He bought the Mac and set it in front of him

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.400
and said, here's the editing rig you're going to use.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:36.200
Well, yeah.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:42.520
I mean, you know, we've had this conversation a few times.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:46.800
I will stand by the claim that the tools are not just like,

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:47.880
boy, it's just a lot easier.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.800
No, it's more like the tools are like.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.800
Yeah, Chris, you should stop using Skype as well.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:52.840
Years ahead.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.600
Here's the thing.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.280
I don't have a link to stand on when

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.440
it comes to live production.

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.600
As far as editing goes, I think if you

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.640
are willing to change your workflow a little bit,

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.180
you could get away with doing it.

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:31.840
Probably, probably.
