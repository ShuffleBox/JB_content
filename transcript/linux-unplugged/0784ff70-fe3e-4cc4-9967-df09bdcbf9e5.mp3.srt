1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
Now, Wes, before we start, I gotta let people know, next week, we're having a schedule change.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,440
Just for one week, because we're making room for OSCON.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,440
You know about OSCON?

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,440
That's a big deal.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
Yeah.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,440
We're going to be at OSCON on July 22nd, which is a Wednesday.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,760
You can go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting if you want to join us.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,680
We're going to meet up and we're going to be at OSCON itself.

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,240
If you're going to be on the floor, you're welcome to come up and say hi to Noah and

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,000
I or go out to dinner with us afterwards, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
To make room for that, we're going to have to leave on Tuesday, though, which means unplugged

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
on Monday next week.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Woo!

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,360
Yeah, same bat time, just a different bat day.

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,040
Does that make sense?

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,040
I think so.

17
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
Is that a thing people say?

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,040
Let's just pretend that it does.

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,040
And a bat channel, too.

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,040
Yeah, exactly.

21
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,360
Yeah, so we're going to do it Monday at 2 p.m. Pacific, but you go to JupiterBroadcasting.com

22
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,360
slash calendar.

23
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,360
And I want to put this right here at the top, because we love having you guys join us live

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,160
in our virtual lug.

25
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,960
So join us live next week, Monday at 2 p.m. Pacific, JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar,

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,600
and come say hi to us at OSCON.

27
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,800
And remember, you can also use the promo code LINUX to get a 20% discount off of your OSCON

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
pass if you'd like.

29
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,480
If you want to come down and say hi to us, I think the base pass is like 50 bucks, and

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,480
you get 20% off that.

31
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,480
It's not bad to come say hi.

32
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,480
What a deal.

33
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,840
And you get to say hi to all the vendors and all that kind of – it's a great pass.

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,440
The expo pass is a great one to go.

35
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,060
So that'll be next Monday at 2 p.m. Pacific, JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar.

36
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,060
Join us live at jblive.tv.

37
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,880
And I would be up for the VR debate, because I'm back on board.

38
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,880
I'm back on the VR train.

39
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
I'm back on!

40
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,880
I got off the hype train for a little bit, and I'm back on.

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,920
So we've just recorded two episodes of the Ubuntu podcast.

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
Yeah.

43
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,440
Apparently, Popey's on holiday, but we've just done a segment on Google Cardboard.

44
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
Yeah.

45
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
And?

46
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,440
And?

47
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
Yes.

48
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
I think I'm going to get one, just to try it out.

49
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,680
I think it's a low enough barrier to entry that it's interesting.

50
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
I think – you know what, Pope?

51
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
I wimpy.

52
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,680
I wimpy.

53
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,680
I think you should wimpy, because – and here's why.

55
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,800
I'm going to get – I'm going to get junk – people are going to call and tell me I'm

56
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
a – no.

57
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
No.

58
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Here's what I think you should do.

59
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:54,640
I think Cardboard is the best solution, because – so having tried the Oculus DK2, right?

60
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,340
And having tried that hooked up to the PC, I will say it is very, very clunky.

61
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,720
It is not production-ready.

62
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,600
But if you scale it down and you go with something like the Samsung VR Innovation Edition or

63
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,640
the Google Cardboard, it is not as dramatic of an experience, it is not as necessarily

64
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,760
as high-powered, but it is so simple and straightforward, and there's already a bunch of good stuff

65
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,320
in the Play Store.

66
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,920
And in the case of the Samsung VR Innovator Edition, there's an entire Oculus app store

67
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,800
filled full of stuff that you can try that is legit.

68
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,920
And in the case of the S6 Innovator Edition, because the screen on the S6 is like 544 ppi,

69
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,800
it actually has a higher resolution than the Oculus.

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,740
So you can actually get smartphones that have a higher resolution now than the Oculus and

71
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,200
Google Cardboard too.

72
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Yeah.

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Yeah.

74
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,180
And it's a low – like you say, it's low cost, so it's almost zero risk.

75
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,900
So Mark, who was discussing Google Cardboard, he bought, you know, the cheapest cardboard

76
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,800
version he could find for four quid, and he tried it out, and from that he's decided

77
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,520
actually it's quite good and it's good enough and there's enough content that he'll

78
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:09,280
probably buy a slightly better headset to, you know, use more frequently.

79
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,040
He's more into games than I am.

80
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
Well, you know –

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,240
Mark's case is a little bit more disturbing, but just as much fun, I think.

82
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
What is it?

83
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,720
Well, so, you know, if you get a new cat, you know, eventually you decide to buy them

84
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,280
catnip and you all sit in a circle and give the cat catnip and then, you know, all enjoy

85
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,560
the cat wigging out on catnip for the first time.

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
No, I've never done that.

87
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
No, no, of course.

88
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,360
I'm just wondering, you know, what would Google Cardboard do to four and five year

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
old girls?

90
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,400
I'm kind of interested to see what it does to children.

91
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:49,360
You know, I put Dylan in the DK2 and almost a year ago and about two weeks ago he brought

92
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,920
it up to me and he said, Dad, can I do that – can I wear that headset again and ride

93
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,520
that roller coaster again?

94
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,360
And I haven't talked to him about it in that entire time and now he's six and it left

95
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,480
enough of an impression on him that he brought it up on his own to me.

96
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,360
And so our conversation that Wimpy, you and I have had, and Popey has been involved in

97
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,280
too about VR in the pre-show here, and then Dylan's sort of, like it really made an impression

98
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,480
on him and it made an impression on me, I decided I wanted to revisit the VR topic and

99
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,040
not maybe – because after Oculus abandoned Linux I kind of was like, I'm done, screw

100
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,000
these guys, right?

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,760
But you know, I did end up with a Galaxy S6 and the thing is, is once you have the Galaxy

102
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,920
S6, you basically have the most expensive component to getting the Galaxy VR set up.

103
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,040
Because once you have the phone, it's basically, you just need the headset.

104
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,820
So yesterday I received the Galaxy VR Innovator Edition headset.

105
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,820
And it's pretty, guys.

106
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,200
Yeah, and Wes has had a chance to play with it too, and there's some things that are

107
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,040
awkward about it, like you have to have your phone on and unlocked before you put it in,

108
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,920
but once you do that, it has a USB port built into it, the mini USB port that the phone

109
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,960
clicks into and then it snaps in and now it's in virtual reality mode and it has a light

110
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,640
sensor in the headset so it detects when I have the headset on and right now I'm in

111
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:21,760
a Samsung Gear VR theater room where I have an Oculus library in front of me of different

112
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,120
games that are built on the Oculus platform that I can pull from.

113
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,800
I also have movies that I can watch and what's truly, truly, truly amazing and thrilling

114
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,800
is what I expected to be really fascinating about this was the gaming and the tourism

115
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
element of it.

116
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,840
They have amazing photos, like there's a tour of London and a tour of Paris and they have,

117
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,960
of course, they have space travel, which is virtual, but Wes, as you saw, it's very impressive.

118
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Oh yeah, definitely.

119
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,080
So I'd be interested to hear more from Wes, given that you're in the studio and you can

120
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,000
actually see this thing and you're an impartial observer.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You can play with it and it might be hard with the headphones, but yeah, so Wes, you

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,240
got to, let's see, you did the, and it does work a lot better if you have headphones,

123
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,720
so Wes is going to have to kind of compromise on that for this part of it, but what was

124
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
your impressions of it?

125
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,340
Actually, I was very impressed, you know, it's sturdily made, clearly they had at least

126
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,720
one industrial designer on this thing, it's like, you know, kind of the opposite of the

127
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,720
cardboard in that respect, lightweight and...

128
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,280
It does feel really well built, huh?

129
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
It does feel really well built.

130
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
Yeah.

131
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
You know, it's solid, it fits well.

132
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,320
It's interesting, it's got a touch pad built into the side of it, it's got an Android back

133
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,720
button and then on the other side, it's got a tiny little fan that you don't really hear.

134
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,880
No, I didn't hear it at all.

135
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,560
What did you think of the graphics?

136
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,160
You know, it was, there were a little blurry at times, but a little screen door effect

137
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
at times.

138
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,560
A little screen door effect, but otherwise, it was very smooth, it was very engaging,

139
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,640
you know, it fits really well on your head and so just being able to look around and,

140
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,920
you know, we were sitting in the restaurant having probably a million people gawk at us,

141
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
but...

142
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Yeah, yeah, we did it.

143
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
Yeah.

144
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
I really had no idea, you know, I could have been anywhere.

145
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,120
That's how geeky we are, you guys, is at the restaurant.

146
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,160
I was at the restaurant, I had Wes try it out.

147
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,880
Now, Wes, I want you to try something that you didn't get a chance to try out yet, and

148
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,440
this is truly one of the most incredible experiences I ever had for virtual reality.

149
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,360
This is going to put you on stage during a Coldplay conference, and I don't know if you're

150
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,480
a Coldplay fan, and this is going to be a little hard for you to see, but they have

151
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,920
a 360 degree camera, yeah, so now what do you think of that?

152
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
Oh, wow.

153
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:36,800
Now, you can look all around, and I want you to go until they launch the paper on the stage.

154
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Isn't that amazing?

155
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Look at him dancing there, and you see all the different bands playing.

156
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,480
Oh, yeah, you know, the resolution's really not bad.

157
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,400
Yeah, for real video, it's quite good.

158
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,160
Yeah, smooth, very little blur.

159
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:55,800
It's not surprising that the two largest install bases so far are Cardboard and Gear VR, experience

160
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
oriented.

161
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Yeah.

162
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,600
You can look around and see all the people dancing in the crowd, and yeah, isn't that

163
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
a...

164
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Sounds pretty cool, except for the Coldplay part.

165
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,560
Yeah, the Coldplay part's a bit rough, but it's a pretty neat experience to see these

166
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,000
guys and, you know, to see them dance right in front of you, you can even see his man

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
boobs jiggle.

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yeah, it's very much that.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh, wow, yeah, here comes the paper.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yeah, isn't that neat?

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, wow, yeah.

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's really something.

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It kind of surprises you, honestly.

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's awesome.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,920
Yeah, and so what's great about it is in theater mode, you get a full 3D experience.

177
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,780
It's better than any kind of movie theater experience, because it's truly, you know,

178
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,400
you're truly immersed in the whole thing.

179
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Here, let me...

180
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Honestly, I would rather watch things on a TV.

181
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Hold on, I'll turn your mic on.

182
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Sorry.

183
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
There you go.

184
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Say again, Wes?

185
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,960
I would probably rather watch some things on that than on a TV.

186
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
It's way more engaging.

187
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,860
I watched some movies last night on this, and it is, and you know, if you want to watch

188
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,960
something 3D, screw a 3D television.

189
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,200
This is where it's at.

190
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
And way less of an investment.

191
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,760
Well, if you have an S6.

192
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,560
It runs off the power of the phone, which is good and bad, because it does drain the

193
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,960
phone, but it means that all you have to do is take the phone and this, and if you're

194
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,800
going on an airplane for traveling or a train, this would be, yeah, it's a theater wherever

195
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
you go.

196
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
So what do you think, Wimpy?

197
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Are you impressed?

198
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Can you charge...

199
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
I'm interested.

200
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
I don't know if I'm impressed yet.

201
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,760
I've got some more questions for you.

202
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,560
Can you plug a, you know, an external charger into the phone whilst using it?

203
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Yes.

204
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,000
There's a little mini USB port on the bottom of the VR that you could plug in, and that

205
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,080
would supply power to the phone, too.

206
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,760
So if you were doing your train journey or your flight, you could power the thing as

207
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
your phone case.

208
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,320
Yeah, or maybe even just run it off like a portable battery.

209
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,800
And for those of us that have not seen these, is this the shutter effect 3D, or is it polarized

210
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,880
glass effect?

211
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,440
I don't know if it's either, to be honest.

212
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
I don't know.

213
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
That's a good question.

214
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Yeah, I don't know exactly how they do it.

215
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,640
It may be a shutter effect.

216
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,940
So you know, what's happening on a technical level is the galaxy screen goes into like

217
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:58,000
a stereo optical mode, and then there's lenses in the VR that tune those in.

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,880
And I don't know how it does it, but it is a very immersive 3D experience, you know.

219
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
It's full...

220
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,840
So is it half the screen for one eye and half the screen for the other eye, effectively,

221
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
that then the lens filters?

222
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't know.

223
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,800
I don't actually think that is the case.

224
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,160
I don't think so, but I don't know how it works well enough.

225
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,000
The fact that you don't know bodes well.

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,760
Yeah, and I think part of it is the screen resolution is so high to begin with, right,

227
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,320
that it's way higher than...

228
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
It's like a...

229
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,760
I forget what it is off the top of my head, but even if you had to bring it down, it would

230
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,280
still be probably higher than 1080p.

231
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,480
Both Cardboard and Gear VR do have a divider, so it must be splitting the screen in half.

232
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, every now and then when I pull the phone out, I've seen it like in sort of like stereo

233
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,360
optical mode, and it's kind of funny looking on screen and the screen snaps out of it.

234
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,960
And you know, if you run it for about 45 minutes to an hour, it'll start to say, oh, it's too

235
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,240
hot depending on what you've been doing.

236
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,840
Take the phone out for a while, and you gotta take the phone out.

237
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
So you need two.

238
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Yeah.

239
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,280
Swap them into two.

240
00:10:53,280 --> 00:11:09,760
This is Linux Unplugged episode 101 for July 14, 2015.

241
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,160
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that just finished a virtual tour

242
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
of the solar system.

243
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,220
And man, Jupiter was beautiful.

244
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,720
My name is Chris, and joining me in studio, Wes is back.

245
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Hey, Wes.

246
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Hey, guys.

247
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
Hey, how you doing, buddy?

248
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
How you having me?

249
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
Good.

250
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,720
Good.

251
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
You don't have food coma, right?

252
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Oh, no.

253
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
I'm good.

254
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
The beer's helping a lot.

255
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
Yeah, the beer helps, right?

256
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
It's like, it's the opposite of caffeine, but for some reason it wakes you up.

257
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
I don't know how that works.

258
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
We'll just keep telling ourselves that.

259
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Well, I don't know about that.

260
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,720
But coming up on today's episode of Linux Unplugged, I'll tell you what I do know about.

261
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,880
There is some big news happening in one of our most beloved things to hate.

262
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
That's Flash.

263
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,440
We're gonna talk about the big changes coming to Flash and how it's gonna affect Linux users.

264
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,240
Coming up in the show, a really, really, really well-done write-up about a KDE user who spent

265
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,560
a week in Gnome, and he was able to put his thoughts in a way that really resonated with

266
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,760
me and a lot of people in the audience.

267
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,720
I'm getting a lot of feedback on this write-up, and I want to talk about it today with our

268
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,940
virtual lug.

269
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,480
And then after that, OpenSUSE, so we've talked about it a little bit on the Linux Action

270
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,760
Show, we've talked about it a little bit on this show, OpenSUSE 42.

271
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,840
It's a big new proposal, big dreams, a lot of changes coming.

272
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,200
The success of Tumbleweed has made OpenSUSE re-evaluate the OpenSUSE project, and we covered

273
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
that on Sunday's show.

274
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,600
But I think maybe some people didn't like our opinion or have a different opinion.

275
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,480
We're gonna cover that feedback and discuss the nuances there, and I think it's gonna

276
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,600
be a really, really fascinating discussion.

277
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,760
But Wes, before we get to all of that, we actually have some really great emails we're

278
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,120
gonna read this week, since in 100 we didn't read any feedback.

279
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,240
So let's get into all of this.

280
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,800
Let's invite in the virtual lug.

281
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,080
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

282
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Hello.

283
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
Hello.

284
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
Hello.

285
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,080
Hello.

286
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
Good morning.

287
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
Good afternoon.

288
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
And it's the evening.

289
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,120
So, guys, we have so much to cover today, and maybe it's the beer, maybe it's because

290
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,520
we just started the show, but it's starting to get warm in here.

291
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Oh, yeah.

292
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Yeah.

293
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
Okay.

294
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Roasty toast.

295
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
You know I'm not making it up, either.

296
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
It is warm in here.

297
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,640
It's nice to have somebody who validates it like, yeah, Chris is not making it up.

298
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
All right.

299
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
Earl writes in, and I love this.

300
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,440
Do you guys remember the conversation we had around Linux Mint?

301
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,880
Last week we had the review, and the week before that we had a conversation, is it too

302
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,280
boring for us Linux users?

303
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,040
Is Mint going the direction that maybe long-term is going to kind of leave it behind?

304
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,960
Or is that exactly the sweet spot?

305
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,680
Well, Earl writes in, and he has a very interesting perspective.

306
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,000
He says, hi, Chris, in the Mumble Room.

307
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,960
He says, I'm a 70-year-old Linux Mint user.

308
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:37,080
He says, I started Linux in early 2003 by installing Debian on a Savage Spark 64.

309
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,200
What a chore and a lot of fun.

310
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,940
I installed Debian on a Savage dual processor P2 later on.

311
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,240
That was an awesome experience, but yet another challenging task.

312
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,520
Then I discovered Ubuntu 4.10.

313
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:52,280
By Ubuntu 5.10, I'd switched to Linux completely, and in 2007, I bought a Dell laptop with Linux

314
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,340
installed on there, and I used GNOME 2.

315
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,180
When Ubuntu moved to Unity, I moved to Linux Mint.

316
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,560
I've been running Linux Mint with Mate ever since.

317
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,040
Not a real tech geek, but I still feel I have some knowledge, and I wanted to comment.

318
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,960
Mint Mate Edition doesn't get in my way.

319
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,000
It just works.

320
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's not about the desktop.

321
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,880
It's about the programs and what I can do.

322
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,400
I like the desktop, and I like the fact it doesn't change every month or so, other than

323
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,200
maybe a few improvements when a new release comes out.

324
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,520
I like that it doesn't keep changing things underneath me.

325
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,920
It just keeps improving, and it works.

326
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,560
Maybe it's boring, but it works.

327
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,340
It also is about the community.

328
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,720
I love this point.

329
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,200
Clem keeps the users informed about what he and the team are doing and why they are doing

330
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
it.

331
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,640
He responds to user input.

332
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,880
He addresses user issues personally.

333
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,520
I've had some users on Linux Mint.

334
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,640
I've had some users on Linux Mint, I guess, as you pointed out.

335
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,440
He says, I'm a brand.

336
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,000
All the computers are Savage, no latest and greatest.

337
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,480
They all are just great desktops.

338
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,680
I keep experimenting with distros, but nothing's replaced Mint Mate for me for reliability and

339
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,240
ease of use.

340
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,760
So he says a lot of users in this respect need this, and I completely agree.

341
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,360
He says I watch all of the shows, and the Savage HP has a crappy video card, so he downloads

342
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,280
and then watches what he calls his Linux soaps later, or his friends called him that.

343
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,720
I love it.

344
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
That's great.

345
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,080
Clem writes in with his perspective on why Linux Mint for a 70-year-old is just the right

346
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
distro.

347
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
That makes sense, right?

348
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Totally makes sense.

349
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,040
And we kind of said that.

350
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
What distro do you use?

351
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
I use Arch.

352
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Oh, really?

353
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
Well, there you go.

354
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,200
I do have Mint deployed at work, though, and I will say I just need to use an application.

355
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
It's there.

356
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,540
It has very similar key bindings.

357
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,320
You can do a lot of things you can if you're coming from Windows or you're coming from

358
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,760
Linux.

359
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,880
So when you say you have Mint deployed, like Mint is your desktop at work?

360
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Yes, for one of my machines.

361
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
And then at home you're running Arch?

362
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Yes.

363
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
Oh, I got you.

364
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,760
And Rotten Corpse, you're running Mint right now?

365
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
Yeah.

366
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,160
I actually dropped Arch and went to Mint.

367
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
What?

368
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Tell me about this.

369
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Yeah.

370
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Well, okay.

371
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,760
So I've been using KDE for the past couple months, and I was trying to test it out because

372
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:59,200
I'm a huge GNOME fanboy, and I wanted to stop talking out of my butt about KDE.

373
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,720
So I started using it, like deep dive, full in, everything.

374
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,760
Oh, you're going to be perfect for today's episode, then.

375
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
I guess so.

376
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:14,520
And I've actually changed my opinion of KDE a lot, and I am now a huge fan of KDE.

377
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:19,920
There are certain things that I can't stand, but KWin, for example, is fantastic, but that's

378
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,920
not the point.

379
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Yeah.

380
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
We'll get to that, though.

381
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
Yeah.

382
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,180
The reason why is because when I was using Arch in February, Arch destroyed KDE, like

383
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,920
unusable breakage.

384
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,720
So I did some updates, I did some bug fixes, I sent some workarounds and things like that.

385
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,080
And after about 20 of those, I got sick of it and just left.

386
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:49,280
So I wanted to see, okay, maybe Debian, you know, Debian is the de facto standard of not

387
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
breaking anything.

388
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Right.

389
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Good, old, stable, steady, true Debian.

390
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
Yeah.

391
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
So I was on Debian.

392
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,760
I actually went to CID because I wanted to get the latest versions of things.

393
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,760
Naturally.

394
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:04,400
So, you know, technically, Debian has really good rolling compatibility, and it's actually

395
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,520
more stable because they take, even though their stuff is rolling, they take longer to

396
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,440
test things, even in the unstable branches.

397
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,840
So then when I get the update for KDE, I was like, let's see if Debian has messed anything

398
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
up.

399
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
I'm curious now.

400
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,080
So when I check it, I see if there's any bugs, no bug reported.

401
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:27,880
Then I pull in all of the KDE's new stuff, and it destroys pretty much everything.

402
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,440
Like to the point where system settings, the most important application, doesn't work.

403
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
Oh, geez.

404
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,560
Like, it doesn't even show you any of the settings.

405
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
All of them are gone.

406
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,300
And now, when I went back like a week later after I was laughing about it, because now

407
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:47,240
it's just hilarious that all of these transitional things are just breaking everywhere, I went

408
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:53,360
to look at the bug support, bug reports, and it said, completely unusable, on the report

409
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
of it.

410
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:00,720
So then I was like, okay, well, Kubuntu, you know, they don't update that much, you know.

411
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Yeah, it's also broken, because they went to 5.2, which is not ready, and they broke

412
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
it.

413
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Yeah.

414
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
So Kubuntu right now is just a mess.

415
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,560
So this is why you ended up on Mint?

416
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,840
Yeah, because Mint hasn't broken anything, because they haven't updated much of it in

417
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
a long time.

418
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Funny how that works.

419
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,360
Yeah, they haven't broken anything for the core.

420
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:26,180
So like, this transitional phase between 4 and 5 is like, just, it's just crazy to the

421
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:32,080
point where right now, it's not a reasonable solution until, unless you stay on 4 and you

422
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,800
don't update to framework 5, or you just go straight to 5 and deal with the bugs, trying

423
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,880
to do this weird combination thing, it does not work.

424
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:47,280
So I'm on Mint 17.1, because they don't have a KDE version for 17.2 right now, and I am

425
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,680
perfectly happy with stuff not breaking.

426
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,600
I think it echoes what Linus says a lot, you know, what his views on his kernel is, you

427
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,600
know, get out of the way, let people run the applications they want to run.

428
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Yeah.

429
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,080
Yeah, Mint is very much a distro like that.

430
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
And you know what?

431
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,200
I think my argument mostly wasn't around that there isn't a place for it, because I don't

432
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,800
argue that at all.

433
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,640
My argument was more, if I was going to cold recommend a distro to somebody, and I felt

434
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,760
like they were the type of user that wanted that environment, which would be a lot of

435
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:22,120
new users, Windows switchers, enterprise users, a lot of people, or like Earl, right?

436
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,280
I think I would recommend Ubuntu Mate.

437
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,280
I do not think I would necessarily recommend Mint necessarily.

438
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:34,000
Mostly because I would, if it was a perfect world, I would like to be able to just recommend

439
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,520
vanilla Ubuntu.

440
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,160
Just go download the Ubuntu ISO and use that.

441
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,180
However, I'm not convinced that Unity 7 is something I want to start switching people

442
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,140
to right now at this point in time.

443
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,440
And also the search scopes are still embarrassing.

444
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,020
Like we actually had a problem this week when we were trying to shoot a screen cap for Linux

445
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,840
action show, and the first time through, like bra and underwear came up in the search scope.

446
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
And it's like, really?

447
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
We don't really want to put bra and underwear?

448
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,560
I mean, it's kind of funny, but at the same time it's like, really?

449
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,640
We're trying to have a professional demonstration here and bra and underwear is coming up in

450
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
our search results.

451
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,640
And I just don't want to recommend that to somebody, but I want to stay as close to the

452
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,080
upstream distro, so an official flavor to me seems like a pretty logical choice.

453
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,280
And the Mate desktop environments, classic desktop environment, people are very familiar

454
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
with it.

455
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,360
You can get the LTS version.

456
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,680
When I stack that up against Mint, I'm not quite sure why I would recommend Mint over

457
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,180
the other, other than they do take care of some of the other niceties.

458
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,960
And like Earl said, Clems, like I really, if I was in Earl's position, I would like

459
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,080
to be able to have a community leader who was also very clear and very transparent,

460
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,720
and that would be something that would appeal to me too.

461
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
But yeah, mumble.

462
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,160
Any other thoughts on that before we move on to our next email, which is really kind

463
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
of one that made me think?

464
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Going once?

465
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,240
Yeah, I'd like to say I agree with the official flavor thing.

466
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,480
The only reason I'm not, I'm using Mint right now is because the Kubuntu thing's weird.

467
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,000
But if somebody wanted Mate, absolutely, Ubuntu Mate is the better option.

468
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,640
I think the only other reason for Mint right now would be if somebody wanted Cinnamon.

469
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,680
That's what I'm using.

470
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Yeah.

471
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Yeah.

472
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
Okay.

473
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,680
I mean, my work machine has a business card.

474
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
And how is that?

475
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
So, it handles it very well, actually.

476
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
Yeah.

477
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,360
Three display point monitors, hardly ever a glitch.

478
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,500
Yeah, and Cinnamon's a pretty good environment for like a, for sort of a parallel to, somewhere

479
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
between Gnome and KDE.

480
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Yeah.

481
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,240
A lot of people I work with kind of come from a Windows background as well.

482
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,560
And so, you know, you can split Windows up on the four sides.

483
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
You have some start bar.

484
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Yeah.

485
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,520
It has some graphical niceties that they're used to.

486
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
Yeah.

487
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
Yeah.

488
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
Mumble room?

489
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,520
Any more?

490
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,080
Chris, I was wondering, are we getting to a point where anybody that's just a casual

491
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,240
user or interested in getting work done should be on an LTS?

492
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,340
And the only people that we recommend rolling to are people that are looking for the latest

493
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,000
and greatest teacher or have a specific hardware support issue?

494
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That's a great question.

495
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,600
I think you should recommend rolling to anyone unless they want it, they ask you for it.

496
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,000
I think we should answer that question.

497
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,960
I think we should see if we can answer that question when we get to the OpenSUSE follow-up.

498
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,200
Because that's exactly the question OpenSUSE says, so you're going to have Tumbleweed,

499
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
which is a rolling release.

500
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,480
They're going to, oh, they claim it's going to be the world's first stable rolling release

501
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,620
because only things go into the rolling release after they've been fully tested by our magic

502
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,380
testing system.

503
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,380
That's according to them.

504
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,760
So they're going to have rolling releases, then they're going to have OpenSUSE, which

505
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,040
is going to be somewhere in between a real steady enterprise distro, but it's going to

506
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,600
be sourced from an enterprise distro.

507
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,800
So that's kind of going to be somewhere like in the CentOS range of type products, somewhere

508
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
between CentOS and Fedora if I'm following.

509
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,040
And of course, we're going to talk about all this in a minute.

510
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,640
And then you're going to have, of course, the SLE, the SUSE Linux Enterprise editions.

511
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,440
And what you just said, that could be where OpenSUSE is going to fit very, very nicely

512
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,600
potentially.

513
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,920
So we'll just have to, but maybe not.

514
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,920
And maybe I have that wrong.

515
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,600
We'll talk about that in the SUSE segment.

516
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,280
But first, I want to get to Stefan's email.

517
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,680
This one got me thinking, long time listener, he says, huge fan of just about all of the

518
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
shows.

519
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,880
I'm sure he meant all of them, not just about.

520
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Of course.

521
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,400
He says, I'm writing because the conversation around privacy and trusting your data and

522
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,460
information, especially with companies like Google, seems to always result in, and this

523
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,960
is his quote here, we shouldn't because that's just creepy.

524
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,420
We feel that it's not morally right for companies to sell or use our data in order to serve

525
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,880
free products and services, to which I do agree, or at least I think I do.

526
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,640
Would it be possible for you to talk about why exactly this is not okay?

527
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,920
What are we afraid of?

528
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:23,840
Why should we take so good care of our privacy and personal information in the first place?

529
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,840
Is it all just aggregated?

530
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,960
And isn't it all just being aggregated and impersonalized by a bunch of computers anyways

531
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,040
and grouped together with thousands of other people's information?

532
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,680
Has this just become a principle that storing user data is wrong?

533
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,120
Why is this fight so important to fight?

534
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,000
We want technology to engage with us in every aspect of our life, yet the companies developing

535
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,560
these technologies are not allowed to know anything about us?

536
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,000
That doesn't sound about right.

537
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,400
Why is my weight, age, sex, height, favorite food, most used train station, travel history,

538
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,920
etc., so damn important that I should know them and only I should know them?

539
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,000
And again, is that really privacy?

540
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,800
Best regards, Stefan, and keep up the amazing work.

541
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,560
What a fast, why, Wes, what do you think?

542
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,600
Do you ever get creeped out about Google?

543
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,480
You know, they are somewhat integrated.

544
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,840
I do appreciate his argument.

545
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,440
I was installing Telegram on my girlfriend's iPhone the other day.

546
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,280
You know, I've been using it with some of my friends, and she wanted to use it too.

547
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,360
And I was telling her about some of the encryption, and I'd used TechSecure before.

548
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,120
And whenever I mention encryption, she does kind of just laugh.

549
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,160
You know, she understands, but...

550
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Not a priority for her.

551
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Not at all.

552
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Yeah.

553
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,760
I don't think she has any problem with Google, you know, knowing every little bit about her.

554
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
I waffle on this.

555
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
I go back and forth.

556
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
I do too.

557
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,800
Sometimes I think it's really a great service, and how can you have JARVIS and Star Trek

558
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,920
Enterprise computer system and all these things without that data collection?

559
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:50,440
At the same time, though, I think I have put my finger on what creeps me out about it,

560
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
but I'm going to hold on to that for a second.

561
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
I'll let Wimpy jump in.

562
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
Wimpy, you go first.

563
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,840
What do you think?

564
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,320
What's your take on this topic?

565
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,800
Well, I live in the UK.

566
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,360
And the UK is doing some crazy things at the moment.

567
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:12,920
So our government believes that the UK citizens have no right to electronic privacy anymore.

568
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:20,600
And I would say that this is important because if your civil liberties and your privacy are

569
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,760
eroded bit by bit, piece by piece, and you don't think it's important, these are just

570
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,640
stepping stones.

571
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,920
And it might not be this thing or the next thing, but maybe the thing after that or the

572
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,840
thing after that is the thing that you think is too much, too far, that encroaches into

573
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,040
your life.

574
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:45,080
And certainly in the UK, if they're going to ban, in air quotes, some of these encrypted

575
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,640
messaging platforms, which we've now concluded is basically anything that's encrypted, then

576
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,160
that gives people the right to, or gives the government the right to potentially siphon

577
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,240
and archive your message streams that you're using over encrypted channels, such as like

578
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,840
Facebook Messenger.

579
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,880
So if your family is using Facebook Messenger to send photographs of your family members

580
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,080
and your children backwards and forwards, and the government is taking a feed off that

581
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,400
and doing percentage of flesh tone analysis, is your account now being flagged up because

582
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,940
you've got young children that are prone to taking off all their clothes and running around

583
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,520
in the garden naked?

584
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,440
And do you now look like a suspicious individual?

585
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,840
And should you not have a right to privacy?

586
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,040
I wonder about that same thing.

587
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,960
Like if my wife sends me a picture of our daughter's butt in the bathtub, and that goes

588
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,560
through Hangouts, and they're analyzing everything that goes through Hangouts, is there some

589
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,820
algorithm analyzing my daughter's butt and flagging my account for having nudity in my

590
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,820
...

591
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,820
That's a good question.

592
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,820
How do I know?

593
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,820
Exactly.

594
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,340
I think that's a big part, too, is for right now with the technology we have, maybe there

595
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,120
aren't that many ramifications, but we don't know what kind of retention policies maybe

596
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
are in effect.

597
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
It's a huge part of it.

598
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,560
You can recognize people based on iris scans, face profiles.

599
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,840
I'm not trying to be a conspiracy theorist, but...

600
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,760
The computing power just keeps getting better and better.

601
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
Right.

602
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,680
The map produced these things, and you can learn a lot.

603
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,920
Wimpy, also there's a certain amount of power a company like Google has when they know everybody

604
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,840
I'm with, every location I'm at all the time.

605
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,040
Does that concern you?

606
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:21,200
To some extent, more so if now governments are wanting to put hooks into organizations

607
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,640
such as Google and Facebook, because there's a proven track record of people that work

608
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:33,280
for the security services to not be discreet in the way that they access this data for

609
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,280
lulls and giggles.

610
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,100
Your stuff isn't private anymore, because they're just perusing over it when it takes

611
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,840
their fancy, and that seems to be.

612
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,760
The only papers I've seen published about that were from North America, but it seemed

613
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,920
to be an alarming number of people that had abused that privilege.

614
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
Yes.

615
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
That's a good point.

616
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,400
The people that are in that position sometimes abuse that.

617
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,040
Ubi, you want to take the other side of the fence as somebody who's not quite as concerned

618
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,000
about privacy, right?

619
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,080
To be honest, I am quite concerned about privacy, but I know people who aren't, as a lot of

620
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,640
people do.

621
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:15,440
A point that I find hard to argue against, maybe there can be some ideas here, is why

622
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,140
care because there's so much data they're collecting that they won't be interested in

623
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,160
looking at mine?

624
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,280
Because it's not individuals looking at your data, it's computers looking at the data in

625
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:35,320
aggregate, and computers are flawed, and so my example of flesh tone analysis is a real

626
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:41,640
example where your legitimate and legal use of a service could flag your account as being

627
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,520
suspicious and now you're under observation for doing nothing wrong.

628
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:51,880
It's not that you've got nothing to hide, it's that you shouldn't have anything that

629
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
people are prying upon.

630
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,000
I mean, if the UK government suddenly want to conduct all of their communications in

631
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,440
the clear, then I'll back their proposals, but until they do that, it's a nonsense.

632
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
Yeah, that's interesting.

633
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,880
Just as easily as computers can anonymize the data, they can also de-anonymize it.

634
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Yes, very good point.

635
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,440
Okay, so here's kind of where I come down on it, and I think about like the long-term

636
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,420
picture here, and I think what Wes was kind of touching on is like computing power is

637
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,800
only going to get better, storage is only going to get greater, and they can keep this

638
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,340
stuff for years and years and years, and sometimes what you find when you read through history

639
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,920
is what we find to be sort of totally acceptable and okay today will not necessarily be totally

640
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,840
fine and acceptable 20 years ago.

641
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:36,220
And when I think about my son and my daughters, who will, my son, for God's sakes, already

642
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,040
has like a children's Google account.

643
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Oh, wow.

644
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,480
Yeah, because he's at school and he's six years old, and now he can get on YouTube and

645
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
look at like a kid's version of YouTube.

646
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,440
He already has a Google account.

647
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,280
Now I know they have different policies for how they track children, but in a large sense,

648
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,440
my son at six years old has already begun getting just about everything he does online

649
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
logged.

650
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,160
Does the 20-year-old him feel that he really consented to do that?

651
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,160
Right.

652
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,720
And will 20-year-old him really want to be, you know, like once it's recorded, it never

653
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,720
goes away.

654
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Exactly.

655
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,640
And people change a lot, and it's just to have all of that on file and then to have

656
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,840
this AI that can sit back there and analyze it and determine what kind of person you are

657
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,800
so that way they can better target dick pills at you.

658
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,800
I just don't find it to be a valuable trade.

659
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,120
It's not worth it for me.

660
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,000
Sunsol, you think the convenience does trump in the end?

661
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,160
I mean, it appears to be so far, right?

662
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Yeah.

663
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,760
I mean, I think like let's just be frank.

664
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,680
Like when you get a cell phone, your privacy is out.

665
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
You know what I mean?

666
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,480
Like once you turn on that phone, like you've almost given a lot of your privacy away.

667
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
That's true, huh?

668
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:47,120
I mean, not trying to, you know, be the devil's advocate here, but it's just that like users

669
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
really love convenience.

670
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
You know what I mean?

671
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,200
Like just whether it's your Siri, iPhone, whether it's Google on your cell phone or

672
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,480
whatever it is, like just having that convenience to get data at your fingertips is what users

673
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
really like.

674
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
Yeah.

675
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,480
Or you know what?

676
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
You could zoom out.

677
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,280
I mean, phones is what's on our mind really, but it's if you use a credit card, you know,

678
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,160
a bank account, all this stuff, there's data brokers that are aggregating all of it, but

679
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
that's a great point.

680
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,820
Wimpy, I want to give you the final word and then we'll move on to some other Linuxy feedback,

681
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,120
but I want to give you one last chance to jump in.

682
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:23,800
So cryptography allows us the facility to have non-repudiation, which is to prove that

683
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,640
I sent something and it hasn't been tampered with.

684
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,220
In the meantime, a hacking team were beautifully hacked last week.

685
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:36,040
The delicious irony of that is not lost upon me, but one of the products that they sell

686
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:45,840
is a product that deliberately injects false evidence into a target's computer system so

687
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,640
that they can be tried in a, air quotes, court of law.

688
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,960
And if we are now in a position where you have no expectation of privacy and encryption

689
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,000
is not a tool that's open to you, then what's going to happen in some of these oppressive

690
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,520
regimes or even in the UK if they decide that they don't, you know, you're not flavor of

691
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
the month anymore.

692
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,800
It makes it all the easier to actually inject evidence, you know, false evidence into your

693
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
system.

694
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Hmm.

695
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Yeah.

696
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
And Corky makes a great point in the chat room.

697
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,480
He can't join because there's a ping spike, but he says, when data is permanent, you have

698
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,320
to hope that every single executive or CEO or government that has access to that data

699
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,200
does not use it against you.

700
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,360
One government gone wrong could have a large leverage to prosecute you or prison you or

701
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,640
to destroy your reputation or to silence you.

702
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,640
That's a big part, too.

703
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,640
Corporations go bankrupt and sell off their assets that, you know, you might trust Google

704
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,240
to have that, but the person who buys Google in 30 years, you don't like someone.

705
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,080
Or when Larry and Sergey step down, does the new guy that runs the place have a different

706
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,160
concern about how much privacy users get to enjoy?

707
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,920
Well, I think this is fascinating.

708
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
You know what?

709
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
I see NorthRanger has a topic.

710
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
We'll pick it up in the post show, too, if you guys want.

711
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,640
It's a fascinating topic, but I want to get to some of the other Linux emails we've gotten,

712
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,040
but it's one that, you know, privacy and security is a huge reason why we use open source in

713
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:06,560
Linux, so I don't think it's a conversation that is not worth having.

714
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,360
I just think we have to bide our time, but we'll do more in the post show.

715
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,840
That sounds pretty fascinating.

716
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,320
I wanted to get to an email that came into the show about, well, about Flash, to be honest,

717
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
in a sense.

718
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,960
But sometimes people that want to watch our show have to use a proprietary technology

719
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
to do so.

720
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,360
Like maybe you're going to watch an HD64 encoded video, or maybe you're going to watch the

721
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,360
live Flash stream.

722
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,040
Well, some big, big developments are happening this week, really big, actually, today that

723
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,960
may finally change this for good, I hope.

724
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,600
And a very public company and two very public browsers are taking a very public position

725
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,640
on all of that.

726
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,000
But before we talk about, hopefully, the final death of Flash, I want to mention our friends

727
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
at Ting.

728
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Go to linux.ting.com.

729
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,640
Now, when Wes got here the other day, he was like, geez, Chris, how many phones do you got?

730
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,800
And I was like, Wes, man, I got plenty of phones.

731
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Why?

732
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
Because it's $6 a line.

733
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,280
Yeah, I love Ting.

734
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,160
So I've got right now in my hot hands right here, I've got the Galaxy S6.

735
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,720
And it's been a really great phone for me.

736
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,920
It's recently available on the Ting network.

737
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,360
And here's what's fantastic about Ting.

738
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,720
You only pay for what you use.

739
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,840
Ting takes your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes, and they add them all up.

740
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,480
Whatever bucket you fall into, that's all you've got to pay.

741
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,680
And it's just $6 for the line and then the taxes.

742
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,600
So it makes it very economical to have several lines if you've got like a family, or maybe

743
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,000
you have a small business and you want to give folks in your business some lines.

744
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,400
Or in my case, when we had a nanny for a short period of time, I got her a phone.

745
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,880
And it sounds like, oh my gosh, you're such a baller.

746
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
Well, no.

747
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,920
You can get an unlocked phone for under $100, and it's $6 for the line, and you just pay

748
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,380
for your usage on top of that.

749
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,180
And then what's really fantastic about Ting is the way their business is structured, they're

750
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,160
really able to focus on the customer.

751
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,960
And so they're able to build out additional functionality that most carriers wouldn't

752
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,960
bother with.

753
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,040
Like they have really great mobile applications and a fantastic web UI to manage all of this.

754
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,240
It's really good stuff.

755
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,840
And they have no hold customer service.

756
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,680
You can call them at 1-855-TING-FTW, and a real person answers the phone.

757
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,960
Now here's the core essentials that I love about Ting.

758
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,040
Unlocked phones, you own them outright, and you're only paying for what you use.

759
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,160
Like hotspot tethering, it's all built in.

760
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,240
So no more like prepaying for like, oh, I might use 800 minutes, so I better buy the

761
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,000
1,000 minute plan, like that kind of crap.

762
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,680
Or like I might need three gigs of data, but they only offer six gigs if I need that much

763
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,680
data.

764
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,960
That is done.

765
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,400
And really, it is so liberating when you realize that once I get the phone and I do all that,

766
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
that's done.

767
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Like that's the hardest part.

768
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,400
I'm easy.

769
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,400
I'm ready to go.

770
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
And here's the best part.

771
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,440
When you go to linux.ting.com, you're going to take $25 off an unlocked device.

772
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,400
And if you've got a Ting-compatible device, and there's a whole S-ton of Ting-compatible

773
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,400
devices, because check this out, they've got a GSM network and a CDMA network.

774
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,120
And if you get a fancy phone, you can swap between the networks.

775
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,960
I've done that with the Nexus 5, for example.

776
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,280
So you get these phones.

777
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
They're unlocked.

778
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,160
And if you get your phone to a high-end like Nexus 6 or Moto X2 or, I don't know, the OnePlus

779
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,920
or the S6 or iPhone 6, whatever you want to get, Ting's got it.

780
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,520
And then you're on the plan and you're done.

781
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
The hard part's over.

782
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
And that's not even that hard.

783
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,800
$6 a month, pay for what you use, call them any time you've got an issue.

784
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,040
It's really slick.

785
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,380
Go to linux.ting.com.

786
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,920
That supports the show and gets you the discount.

787
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,280
Also, this is a really slick way to go if you want like a MiFi device.

788
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:09,240
If you're in any kind of job or if you just have a need for a high level of connectivity,

789
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,720
what a great way to do this at an incredible value, because you're only paying for what

790
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,080
you use with Ting.

791
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,900
So go get a MiFi device, you buy it once, and then it's just $6 a month and then any

792
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,080
data usage.

793
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:27,720
As an independent contractor when I was doing IT, I had this really expensive MiFi device

794
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,040
from one of the duopoly mobile providers.

795
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,240
And I lived with the guilt every time it sat in my drawer for like a couple of weeks and

796
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,240
I didn't use it.

797
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,760
I could hear Angela in the back of my mind, that's a waste of money, that thing costs

798
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,720
us $60 a month, how come you're not using it right now?

799
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,720
And I would just like bring it with me just in case I might need it because I am paying

800
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,960
so much money for it and I wouldn't use it.

801
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,660
Now this is gone with Ting because you're only paying for what you use.

802
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,040
If you don't use the MiFi device, it's just $6 for the line, but here's the even better

803
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
part.

804
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,040
I can't even believe Ting let you do this.

805
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,120
You can just turn the line off for a while.

806
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,480
You can just turn it off.

807
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
How slick is that?

808
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,920
Go to linux.ting.com to get started, check out their dashboard, they have a savings calculator

809
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,920
there.

810
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,160
Also, while you're there, peruse their blog.

811
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,480
They've got great app pics, they have an unboxing of the Moto E second gen edition and they

812
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,560
also have app pics there as always and like tips for Google Maps, really cool stuff.

813
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,520
Linux.ting.com and a huge, huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged

814
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
program.

815
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,040
Linux.ting.com and thanks to everybody who visits that because that supports the show

816
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,360
and lets Ting know that you appreciate them keeping us on the air.

817
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
Right Wes?

818
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,360
Oh yeah.

819
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
Hey, thank you for grabbing me another beer, sir.

820
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
I really appreciate that.

821
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
My pleasure.

822
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,360
All right.

823
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
So we got a little bit more feedback.

824
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,520
I kind of want to pick up the pace just a tad because I want to get to some of the big

825
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,360
topics today, but let's talk about this huge, huge, huge story and I want to start, kick

826
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:52,240
it off with a piece of feedback that I get almost at least a weekly basis, more often

827
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,820
in the chat room on a daily basis.

828
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,160
So this came in from Yellow Mango, which is kind of funny, he says, while setting up my

829
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,960
new Fedora install, I went to add my favorite podcast to Rhythmbox.

830
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,120
Oh, thanks man.

831
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,800
And however, when I went to play the video, I noticed I needed to download a decoder.

832
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,280
The decoder just happens to be a non-free one.

833
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,120
Why in the world is an open source focused podcast using a non-free encoding?

834
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,800
Maybe there's a legitimate reason I just don't know about it.

835
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,400
And this comes in in a couple of different phases or different ways like you guys have

836
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,960
a flash player, for example, like our livestream.

837
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,080
And Wes, what are your thoughts on when it comes down to this codec stuff?

838
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,880
Do you have a hard line on this at all?

839
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,320
I mean, I definitely follow the people over at Ziff.org, you know, Monty and his wonderful

840
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,640
demos and I would love for open source and free codecs to rule the world, but I think

841
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,480
the top commenter in this Reddit post does have a certain point that...

842
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
What did he say?

843
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
I didn't see that.

844
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,320
He said, because he wants to actually be discovered and watched by 95% of the world who live in

845
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,040
proprietary prisons, which unfortunately many people do.

846
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,880
Oh, there is a sort of a sick truth to that.

847
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,040
There is definitely a sick truth to that.

848
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,440
So yeah, we do actually pretty make...

849
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,520
We make every show available in WebM.

850
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,520
Yeah, which is awesome.

851
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,840
But we don't necessarily make it available for direct download.

852
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,800
We, in most cases, make it available via torrent, which is linked in the show notes in most

853
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
cases.

854
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,240
The thing is, is we've not been very happy with WebM, so it costs us a lot to store it

855
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,360
and distribute it.

856
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:20,440
It actually costs us more to distribute a 420p version of a show in WebM than it does

857
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,720
to distribute a 720p version of the show in x264.

858
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:34,600
So it is only because we want to see open standards progress that we actually pay...

859
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,480
WebM is the most expensive thing we distribute.

860
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
So it is...

861
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Kudos to you guys.

862
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,360
Well, it makes HTML5 playback work, so that's another reason why we have to do it.

863
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:50,700
And then Rekai can attest to the fact that it is by far, by far, by far the slowest file

864
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,960
to encode.

865
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,440
We can get...

866
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,960
We could crank out four HD versions almost of a show in the time it takes one 420p WebM

867
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,360
version to come out.

868
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:05,360
Almost four versions of the HD version in the time it takes one WebM version to be encoded,

869
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,680
almost that long.

870
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:12,240
And so this, though, often comes up in terms of our jblive.tv live stream, which is powered

871
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,060
by Flash, because really, live streaming...

872
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,320
We have other options, in fact.

873
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,320
By the end of this segment, I think we should all just disable Flash in our computers for

874
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
a week and see if it works.

875
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,320
Amen.

876
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,960
Go to jblive.tv and grab the RTMP or HLS stream and watch it MPV or VLC.

877
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,240
So I'll say that up front.

878
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,760
But we do have one Flash player on the Jupyter broadcasting site, and that's our live player.

879
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,720
Well, today, depending on what browser you're in, you may have had troubles loading the

880
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,400
live stream, because Mozilla, and I think Google Chrome too today, have started blocking

881
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,800
Flash, just as Facebook's security chief calls for its death, all in light of the hacking

882
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,460
group that Wimpy was just talking about getting hacked and zero-day Flash vulnerabilities

883
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,560
being splashed all over the Web.

884
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,960
Adobe's been scrambling to patch these new zero-day vulnerabilities, and in response

885
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,640
to that, the Facebook security chief has taken up the Steve Jobs mantle of saying, kill Flash,

886
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,060
kill Flash, and is proclaiming its death.

887
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:06,480
He says the time is now, and in response, Mozilla is disabling Flash because the zero-day

888
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,960
is affecting Flash installations right now as we record this show.

889
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,560
There's a lot of stuff happening here.

890
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,800
Do you think the Web is ready for Flash to die, Wes?

891
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,000
I really wish that it was.

892
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Personally, I am.

893
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,480
I don't think I need it.

894
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,760
But I recognize there are a lot of users with random use cases, like, oh, my one banking

895
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,680
company requires me to use Flash for this login form, or who knows.

896
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,360
But I feel like we hear a lot about those one-time uses.

897
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,520
Wimpy, I bet you have a few of those use cases in mind, don't you?

898
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,520
Mr. Wimpy?

899
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Oh, sorry.

900
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,520
Oh, there you go.

901
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Yep.

902
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,520
Thank you.

903
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,520
Thank you.

904
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,520
So can you hear me?

905
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
Yep.

906
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
We got you.

907
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,520
Yeah.

908
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,520
Can you hear?

909
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Yeah.

910
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
OK.

911
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,520
Yeah.

912
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:55,320
In the UK, Amazon Prime, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, and catch-up TV services all

913
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,080
use Flash.

914
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:05,000
Some of them even use the DRM module in Flash, which is no longer supported on most Linux

915
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,200
systems because HAL went away that used to provide that little crypto stub.

916
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:18,080
So if Flash goes away, then all of the major UK streaming services cease to be relevant

917
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,240
for Linux users because there is no other option.

918
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,240
Wow.

919
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:28,880
You know, the only one that continues to work is Netflix using Google Chrome, which is also

920
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,880
proprietary.

921
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,080
But this is not about Flash on Linux.

922
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,640
This is a Flash in general, and that Mozilla and Google are blocking it across the platform.

923
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,600
So yeah, but the same is true.

924
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:46,440
These services, with the exception of Amazon Prime, which you can use Silverlight for on

925
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,520
Windows, all of those other streaming services require Flash regardless of whether you're

926
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
on Windows or Linux.

927
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,520
Right.

928
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,480
But I'd rather Flash die and those services not work and make them actually use something

929
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,720
that isn't garbage for a downtime of like a month or two than to just throw your hands

930
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,720
up and give up.

931
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,720
Yeah, those services aren't going to change in a hurry.

932
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,840
Well, let me, let me, let's just, as for, just for fun discussion purposes.

933
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,040
If anyone was going to move away from Flash, people have started doing it more aggressively.

934
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:16,720
But don't you think now, Wimpy, with them disabling it in Firefox and things like that,

935
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,320
don't you think that's going to accelerate, because this, like Rotten said, this isn't

936
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
a Linux thing.

937
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,320
This is everybody.

938
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,960
And plus, the iOS platform and Android platforms are not Flash friendly still, so there's incentive

939
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,960
to get off there.

940
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,880
Do you think this push could do it?

941
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,880
Hopefully.

942
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,160
I mean, if it was just Mozilla doing it, then, you know, there'd be a, you know, you couldn't

943
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,160
guarantee it.

944
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,080
But the fact that Google is joining the force.

945
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,820
And Facebook, I think, Facebook too.

946
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,480
And it's going to put a huge dent in Flash and hopefully even kill it.

947
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,120
So I think here, it's pretty obvious, the streaming services are the ones still rely

948
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,120
on Flash.

949
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,120
Yes, yes, yes.

950
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,120
But if you access the streaming services through a mobile phone nowadays, you already see that

951
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,680
they don't really require Flash.

952
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,680
So currently, Flash is there for convenience.

953
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:09,560
Well, I'll tell you this, unfortunately, so the way it works currently, and man, Alan,

954
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,160
it would be way better explaining this.

955
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,520
He does a great job explaining this.

956
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,400
But the way it works on mobile currently, most of the time, well, I think every time,

957
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,840
it is delivered, live video is delivered via HLS.

958
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,760
And HLS, and I'm sorry, I'm not going to explain this as well as Noah, or I'm sorry, as well

959
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,760
as Alan would.

960
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,160
But HLS, what it essentially does is it takes H.264 video and MP3 or AAC audio, whatever

961
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:36,840
your audio is, and it wraps it in tiny M3U playlist files.

962
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,840
Yeah, oh, you know how this works?

963
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,640
I've streamed from it before.

964
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:45,320
So HLS is about as proprietary as it gets, because it's using H.264, and it's really

965
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
very clunky.

966
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,320
Yes.

967
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,560
Because what the player is doing on the other end is it's constantly cycling the playlist

968
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,560
files.

969
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,560
Constantly pinging to download the newest playlist.

970
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,560
Yeah.

971
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,560
It's pulling the playlist file, pulling the playlist file, and then loading that into

972
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,560
the player, and playing it as fast as it can, and pulling down the playlist file and loading

973
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,160
it into the player, and playing it as fast as it can, and it's really dumb.

974
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,160
Yes.

975
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
And easy to lose the stream too.

976
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,160
Yes.

977
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,520
And so you get, and on a mobile, you get a little hiccup there, and you know, you lose

978
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,300
some of that playlist file, one of the playlist files, and you just drop the whole stream.

979
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:14,480
And so we don't really have a solid, ready to go live Flash replacement yet.

980
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,540
And anybody who watches this show in VLC sometimes notices that MPV handles it a little bit better,

981
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,540
but yeah.

982
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:23,720
I honestly used the Flash player when I first started watching, because VLC couldn't keep

983
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,720
up.

984
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,720
It's definitely better now.

985
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,720
Mm-hmm.

986
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,720
But MPV is great too.

987
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,720
Mm-hmm.

988
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,720
I heard somebody, and they're going ahead.

989
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,720
I don't like, I don't like VLC at all.

990
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:38,200
Actually, I think that its streaming features are so clunky that it gets way more hype than

991
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,680
it deserves on, at least on Linux.

992
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,480
Maybe on Windows there's nothing better, but on Linux there's a lot.

993
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,480
Now Wimby, very true.

994
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,480
I have had not that experience.

995
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,480
Oh, go ahead Daryl.

996
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:53,000
I was just saying that I have had, I haven't had that experience with, regarding to VLC.

997
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,960
I'm pretty sure that that's a discussion for another show.

998
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,960
Yeah, we could.

999
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,960
Yeah, we could have another.

1000
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:03,160
Wimby, do you, are you joking, or do you really think that if we prematurely kill Flash, which

1001
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,280
I can't even believe I'm going to say that, but let's just argue that maybe it's too soon.

1002
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,960
If we prematurely killed Flash, do you really think people would jump to another proprietary

1003
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,560
alternative like Silverlight, or is it like H.264, are we just going to lock in some other

1004
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,000
proprietary garbage if we kill Flash right now?

1005
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,680
That was for you, Wimby, if you're still there.

1006
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,160
I don't mind proprietary garbage.

1007
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,600
Yeah, I am.

1008
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,680
I think there's a bit of lag on the line here.

1009
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,680
I'm not sure if it's me or someone else anyway.

1010
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:37,120
I'm not sure, I don't mind which proprietary solution people pick so long as it's one that

1011
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,240
runs on multiple platforms.

1012
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:44,680
So I don't have a problem with H.264 because Cisco are backing the licenses for that being

1013
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:49,440
embedded into Firefox, for example.

1014
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,080
So our rule, Gabe, I'm not pro-proprietary, I'm just pragmatic.

1015
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,320
If the only way Linux users are going to have access to premium content which is going to

1016
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:04,440
be DRM encumbered, then at least give us a level playing field so we can all access it.

1017
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:11,840
But there is a new streaming service, a Netflix-alike service in the UK that launched on Silverlight,

1018
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,720
and that was only nine months ago.

1019
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:21,640
So yes, there are organizations that still go for Silverlight solutions, even on new

1020
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,640
products.

1021
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,640
I know, just it's crazy, isn't it?

1022
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,400
I would say, I want to take the DRM discussion, I just want to table it, yes, I agree DRM

1023
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,000
is bad, and I also agree proprietary garbage is bad.

1024
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,600
And if you don't want to watch DRM content and proprietary garbage, the solution isn't

1025
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:40,040
in what the browsers are implementing, the solution is in the customer stop paying for

1026
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,580
it and stop watching it.

1027
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:45,980
So if you want DRM to change and you don't want proprietary garbage, you got to change

1028
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,400
what you do and let the market follow it.

1029
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,280
And that's a hard thing to actually, it's easier said than done when you say something

1030
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,280
like that.

1031
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:56,240
But I think that's the silver bullet to DRM, not convincing these companies.

1032
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,200
Or just cross-platform proprietary garbage.

1033
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,680
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1034
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,680
That gives everybody a chance to at least play, at least until we stop using it.

1035
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,680
Yeah, I agree.

1036
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:11,280
I do have to say that potentially in the near future, the new copyright directive on the

1037
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,880
new level will actually kill DRM with copyright legislation.

1038
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,960
Because it's currently seen as breaking the exceptions to copying your private copy.

1039
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,960
So it will have to be dropped.

1040
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,120
That'll be fascinating to watch.

1041
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,120
Thanks guys.

1042
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:31,920
All right, so let's shift gears and talk about this gentleman who was a hardcore KDE user.

1043
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,760
And he tried out Gnome for a week and then wrote up about it.

1044
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,760
And I saw this article and I thought, oh, here's some clickbait.

1045
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,080
And I read through it and I went, that was really well done.

1046
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,080
Really articulate.

1047
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,380
And I want to talk about it in the show.

1048
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,880
And I know we're going to have some different opinions here, but we've got a lot more to

1049
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,880
get to.

1050
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,160
And then we also got the OpenSUSE to discussion.

1051
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,200
So let's take a quick moment and thank our next sponsor, Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com

1052
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,200
slash unplugged.

1053
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,920
Go there, get our 33% Linux discount.

1054
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,880
Linux Academy is a platform set up by people who are truly passionate about Linux and open

1055
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,880
source.

1056
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,920
And they really follow the content.

1057
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,920
They really follow the material.

1058
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,360
And they've got step-by-step video courses to help you learn.

1059
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,800
They've got downloadable comprehensive study guides.

1060
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,240
The courseware comes with its own server.

1061
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,240
It spins it up in the lab for you on demand.

1062
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,400
The seven plus distributions you get to choose from.

1063
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,640
Refresh topics that you care about all the time.

1064
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,000
Docker, OpenStack, virtualization.

1065
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,780
All of the technology around Linux as well.

1066
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:27,300
Everything from like Ruby on Rails development to Android development to Linux basics.

1067
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,160
They've got over 1500 self-paced courses.

1068
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,640
And I love the way the interface works.

1069
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,720
You log in, you get a great map of how long something's going to take you.

1070
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,920
You can download the guide for that before you go jump in.

1071
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,920
You can tell they have availability programming, so you can go in there and say, I have this

1072
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,920
much time available.

1073
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,180
It'll automatically generate courseware that matches your availability.

1074
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,680
This is all really high-tech stuff.

1075
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,200
And of course, they're using all Linux on the back end too.

1076
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,600
Their virtualization platform, I learned a little bit about it when they became a sponsor.

1077
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,880
They were just finishing building it out.

1078
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,400
It was so, so slick.

1079
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,040
There is obviously a passion for the technology over at Linux Academy.

1080
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,560
And I think that when you're learning from somebody, that passion truly makes a difference.

1081
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,880
It's almost like CG in a movie.

1082
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,480
When you look at a CG character, you're like, oh, boy, that Uncanny Valley, that is just

1083
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,280
enough creepy that it's not a real thing.

1084
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,520
That's how I feel like a lot of these online training course systems are.

1085
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,440
It's real close, except for, well, they needed to have a couple of check boxes in the Linux

1086
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,440
and open source.

1087
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,440
Let's get the Apache course in here.

1088
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,480
Let's get the Linux course in here.

1089
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,480
Let's get the engine.

1090
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,600
They check the boxes.

1091
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,300
And that's their commitment to Linux and open source.

1092
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,800
That's not Linux Academy.

1093
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,720
Linux Academy is truly people passionate about this stuff.

1094
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,060
And that closes that Uncanny Valley gap.

1095
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,060
That makes it real.

1096
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,820
That makes it people that are truly living it and breathe it and trust it.

1097
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,800
And that's what they base their life around.

1098
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,900
And that's who you want to learn from.

1099
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,580
That's why you listen to podcasts made by people who truly love Linux and not a podcast

1100
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,600
made by Engadget talking about Linux.

1101
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,600
That would be awful.

1102
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,600
Right?

1103
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,480
It's that same kind of disconnect and that big difference in that closing the gap that

1104
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,560
Linux Academy makes.

1105
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,560
They just refreshed their OpenStack course where they just really updated the Red Hat

1106
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,560
certified stuff.

1107
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,560
It's great.

1108
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,560
Go to LinuxAcademy.com.

1109
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:02,880
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged to get our special 33 percent discount that supports

1110
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,880
this show.

1111
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,280
Also, shoot, while you're over there, see if they've updated any of their nuggets.

1112
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,400
I think these nuggets are the greatest thing ever.

1113
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,720
Oh, look at this one.

1114
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,280
So these nuggets are like anywhere from like two minutes to 16 minute like deep dive on

1115
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,720
courses that just show you like, hey, you want to know how to do X?

1116
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,720
Just do this.

1117
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,720
Well, look at this one.

1118
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,720
Video conversions on the command line with Handbrake.

1119
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,720
Oh, that's awesome.

1120
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,720
That's great.

1121
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,720
Right?

1122
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,720
VirtualBox.

1123
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,720
Start a headless VM on boot.

1124
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,720
That's genius.

1125
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,720
They got some AWS stuff in here.

1126
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,840
They got building a firewall with IP tables.

1127
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,240
Just go deep dive on a topic.

1128
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,240
Right?

1129
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,240
Just dig in.

1130
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,240
You know, it doesn't feel like a lecture.

1131
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,040
It feels like a new toy that you've just got.

1132
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,040
Right?

1133
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,040
Exactly.

1134
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,040
I love it.

1135
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,220
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged and support the Linux unplugged program.

1136
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,220
It's a really good setup.

1137
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:48,460
And I also just I love that they've built it around the Linux environment in such a

1138
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,040
cool way with those virtual servers.

1139
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,160
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1140
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,200
OK, guys.

1141
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,480
So I couldn't believe it.

1142
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,440
I thought for sure there was no way I was going to get sucked into this article, but

1143
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,440
I did.

1144
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,680
A week with Gnome as my main Linux desktop, what they get right and what they got wrong.

1145
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,240
And I'm just going to read a couple of bits from it and then we'll get into discussion

1146
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,240
here.

1147
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,840
It says, yeah, I know I have a couple of points I want to touch on, but let's start on the

1148
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,840
article itself.

1149
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,880
An important distinction between KD and Gnome, the author writes, Gnome feels like a product.

1150
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,080
It feels like a singular experience.

1151
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:25,540
When you use it, it feels complete and that everything you need is at your fingertips.

1152
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:32,320
It feels like the Linux desktop in the same way Windows or OS 10 have the desktop experience.

1153
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,480
What you need is there and it's all written by the same guys working towards the same

1154
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,880
team goal.

1155
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,240
It feels like the Linux desktop.

1156
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,840
Now, Wes, KD, Gnome user?

1157
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,840
Gnome user myself.

1158
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,840
Do you agree?

1159
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,400
Does Gnome feel more like a Linux complete desktop to you?

1160
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,760
Well, you know, I think what we were talking about earlier, a lot of things Qt does feel

1161
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,800
much more, you know, wider world.

1162
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,200
It runs on so many things.

1163
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,360
I really love the framework and to code with it.

1164
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,040
Maybe not so much GTK.

1165
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,480
But you're right, Gnome really fits in with Linux, you know, especially the hardcore support

1166
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,120
that they get from Fedora, how well integrated it is.

1167
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,120
Sits right on top of system D.

1168
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,120
Exactly.

1169
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,120
Yeah.

1170
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,840
So, the author spent five days of his week logging into Gnome manually, not turning on

1171
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,840
automatic login.

1172
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,360
And I love this observation.

1173
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,040
It's the small things in Gnome.

1174
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,040
It really is.

1175
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,920
In fact, the alternative article title was a cut, a death by a thousand paper cuts for

1176
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,920
KDE.

1177
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,840
Here's like an example of something that bugs me under KDE that I like under Gnome.

1178
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,200
And it's like this times a hundred.

1179
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,400
He says, I spent the first five days of my week logging into Gnome manually, not turning

1180
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,960
on automatic login.

1181
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,220
On the night of the fifth day, I got annoyed with having to login by hand and so I went

1182
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:39,320
into the user manager and turned on automatic login.

1183
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,960
The next time I logged in, I got a prompt.

1184
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,640
Your key chain was not unlocked.

1185
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,400
Please enter your password to unlock your key chain.

1186
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,520
That's when I realized something.

1187
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:53,160
Gnome had been automatically unlocking my key chain, my wallet in KDE speak, every time

1188
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,100
I logged in via GDM.

1189
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:59,640
It was only when I bypassed GDM's login that Gnome had to step up and make it do me do

1190
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,640
it manually.

1191
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:05,860
It was at that moment I realized something simple, something that made the desktop feel

1192
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,120
like it was working with me.

1193
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:14,840
When I log into KDE via SSDDM, before the splash screen is even finished loading, there

1194
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:20,480
is a pop-up over that splash screen animation, thereby disturbing that splash screen, prompting

1195
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,360
me to unlock my KDE wallet or GPG key ring.

1196
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,160
And then it goes into the dysfunctions in creating those.

1197
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,800
And I thought that was an interesting point.

1198
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,480
It is the small things about KDE that bugged me.

1199
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,160
He also talks about the login manager and the way that looks, but this point, this KDE,

1200
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,080
when you log into the KDE desktop and you have to unlock your wallet and this dialog

1201
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,500
box pops up before you've even finished logging into your desktop, it just feels disoriented.

1202
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,500
It feels jumbled.

1203
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,500
It feels disconnected.

1204
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,500
It feels jumbled.

1205
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,500
Which is a big criticism of Linux in general, right?

1206
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,500
Yes.

1207
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,500
A hodgepodge of different tools.

1208
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,500
Gnome doesn't feel that way.

1209
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,500
Here's another hodgepodge.

1210
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,500
Software manager.

1211
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,240
Something that's been seeing a lot of push in the recent years and will likely see a

1212
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,880
bigger push in months to come.

1213
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,520
Unfortunately, it's an area where KDE gets close, but then fell on its face.

1214
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,480
Gnome Software is now his new favorite software center, minus one gripe.

1215
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,080
But Muon, which is the KDE one, it's a design nightmare.

1216
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,000
And he's got some examples in here.

1217
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,320
I'm not bashing KDE, but he's right.

1218
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,400
There are, there are, there are wiggles in the software center, like the fact that the

1219
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,160
updates in software and two different applications, the fact that software discovery is a total,

1220
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:25,600
like you look at this, it is, and what's really kind of a tragedy about it, and he goes on

1221
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,800
to point this out, is that KDE knows about this.

1222
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,960
That's why they created the visual design group.

1223
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,320
And the visual design group had mock-ups for the software center that looked totally different

1224
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,320
than what shipped.

1225
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,320
Wow.

1226
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,640
He says someone must have gotten drunk when they coded the UI.

1227
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,400
That's the only guess he has.

1228
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,380
And then I'm gonna, and then we're almost done and we'll get to jump in, but I just

1229
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,960
want to get through his major points here.

1230
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,800
When we bring up an important distinction between KDE and GNOME, GNOME feels like a

1231
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,800
product, right?

1232
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,800
That's what he says.

1233
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,800
It feels like a product.

1234
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,760
But KDE, that doesn't, KDE doesn't feel like a cohesive experience.

1235
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,680
He says KDE doesn't feel like it has a direction it's moving on.

1236
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,200
It doesn't feel like it's a full experience.

1237
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,680
KDE feels like it's a bunch of pieces that are moving in a bunch of different directions

1238
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,560
that just happen to have a shared toolkit beneath them.

1239
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,560
Right.

1240
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,320
I think this speaks a lot to what we see in general, where, you know, a lot of people

1241
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,660
gripe about GNOME, lose customization, all that kind of stuff, and I think there's very

1242
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,520
diverse camps within the Linux group.

1243
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,120
Some people want to be able to tinker, they want, they're okay if it doesn't work for

1244
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,440
the first 10 hours, but afterwards it works great.

1245
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,800
But GNOME really does feel like a product where it's been integrated, it's been considered,

1246
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,800
it's been designed.

1247
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,160
And it looks like, you know, you feel like a lot of elements were painstakingly thought

1248
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,160
about.

1249
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,160
Exactly.

1250
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,080
He says, so then I thought this was a final conclusion here, and you'll have the whole

1251
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,040
article linked in the show notes, which is a good read with lots of good screenshot examples.

1252
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,560
He says, well, I still use GNOME after this week.

1253
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,100
Probably not, no.

1254
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:41,960
GNOME is still trying to force a workflow on me that I don't follow or abide by.

1255
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,920
I feel less productive when using it because it doesn't follow my paradigm.

1256
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,540
So at the end of all of this, he's not switching back to GNOME.

1257
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:53,040
But this hit a lot of pieces for me, and Rotten, do you want to open up, because I know you

1258
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,680
just mentioned at the top of the show that you've been running KDE for a little while

1259
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:01,160
now, and as you switched from GNOME to KDE, do you detect this sort of, I thought this

1260
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:04,980
line that he put here, a bunch of different moving software pieces and going in different

1261
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,240
directions that use the same shared toolkit beneath them, that really struck a chord with

1262
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,240
me when I think of KDE.

1263
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:15,240
It's like, everything does talk super well together, but at the same time, it is a bit

1264
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:20,080
of a mess in terms of jumbled together, like, man, look at the sound.

1265
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:21,400
You go look at the sound settings, right?

1266
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,280
When you're looking at the sound settings in KDE, don't you think it's really bizarre

1267
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,920
that they have, in fact, he has a screenshot.

1268
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:34,640
So here's a screenshot right here of GNOME sound versus KDE sound.

1269
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:39,680
Now here is what blows me away about KDE sound, the sound settings.

1270
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,440
You see what's at the very top of the GNOME, what's that very top slider right there, Wes?

1271
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,440
What is that right there?

1272
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,440
Output volume.

1273
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,440
That's the output volume.

1274
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,040
You know what's missing completely from the KDE sound applet?

1275
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,120
There is no effing volume slider.

1276
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,560
But you know what there is?

1277
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:58,840
There is a left-hand list of device priorities for application notifications, music, video

1278
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,680
communications, audio recording, video recording, and in each one of these categories, I can

1279
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,000
move around which sound card takes priority.

1280
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,880
Pretty neat feature.

1281
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,720
Probably not used as often as the volume slider in the volume control panel, though.

1282
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,720
Ten to one right there, yeah.

1283
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,720
Right.

1284
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,720
This is what I'm talking about.

1285
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,240
What kind of sense does that make?

1286
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:19,760
For developers and advanced users, that's a really slick feature, and I bet even advanced

1287
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,680
users and developers set that once or twice when they set up the KDE desktop, and they

1288
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,520
never go back and change that priority list.

1289
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,160
I never mess with that priority list.

1290
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,920
I just want to set my default audio device and set the volume.

1291
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,360
I just want to do two things.

1292
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:36,400
And this Gnome system lets me set my output device and set the volume right there.

1293
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,160
And it's like that everywhere.

1294
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,640
The defaults are crazy in KDE.

1295
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:44,120
Now, Rotten, have you noticed this as you've moved over from Gnome to KDE or to you?

1296
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,120
Is it refreshing in a sense?

1297
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,200
As far as the way the cohesiveness of KDE?

1298
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,200
Yeah.

1299
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,840
Does it feel like a bunch of different stuff just share the same toolkit?

1300
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,840
No.

1301
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,840
I mean, it feels like a cohesive unit.

1302
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,760
It's just a messy cohesion.

1303
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,280
The example of the sound slider does exist in KDE.

1304
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,020
It's just not in the settings section.

1305
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:13,480
It's in the applet that's on the panel, or the taskbar, as they call it, which is fine.

1306
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,160
You would say, well, these are settings, so you want to change the different devices and

1307
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,160
stuff like that.

1308
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:23,200
So it's nice, and it's more polished the way Gnome does it, but it's not necessarily a

1309
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,760
complete necessity for KDE to do that way because they already give you the slider,

1310
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:33,400
and KMix gives you a ton of control over the different sliders for the different applications

1311
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,360
and the different outputs and stuff like that.

1312
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,880
It's really nice because it's all right in that one widget, so you don't have to open

1313
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,880
up.

1314
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:45,320
For example, if you want to change stuff based on a particular application or a particular

1315
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,560
output for, say, a plug-in that you have two different YouTube channels playing.

1316
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:53,840
Yeah, that's neat, but why not – okay, so this is a use case scenario.

1317
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,840
Let's be honest.

1318
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,840
How many people are doing this?

1319
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,840
Probably not very.

1320
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,120
I mean, people that could do that could just install Poova control.

1321
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:08,280
Yeah, but my point is that if you have – it's not really that polished if the aspects of

1322
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,880
what you want to do are available in KDE, but they're not available at all in Gnome.

1323
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,880
I would say –

1324
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:13,880
And then vice versa, the same kind of thing.

1325
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,880
I would disagree.

1326
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:21,320
I think what they have struck is such an imbalance between polish and options that it's a mess.

1327
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,840
It's not polished at all, and I think if – yes, there is a sound slider –

1328
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,320
Gnome is the polished one.

1329
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,320
Yeah, okay.

1330
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:34,840
Well, that – I just – I think it is a little – the sound settings here is a little

1331
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,920
indicative of the whole problem.

1332
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,840
I know there's a sound slider in the menu bar, but every other desktop environment – literally

1333
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:46,440
made every other desktop environment, like Windows and OS X included in that, have the

1334
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,960
slider there for a very good reason, because when you're changing your different output

1335
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,160
devices and you're changing your different alert settings, you want to be able to adjust

1336
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,040
the volume to see what – I do this all the time.

1337
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,840
This is a very, very common function, and it just makes sense to have it there.

1338
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,840
Anyway –

1339
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:08,120
But to be fair, they're still porting a lot of stuff to 5, and he's showing a screenshot

1340
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:13,560
from Plasma 5, but that's not really a fair screenshot considering that's KDE 4 version

1341
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,060
of that application.

1342
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:18,840
So just because that's how it looks in Plasma 5 doesn't mean that's what it's going

1343
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,880
to be when it finally releases the new port.

1344
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,440
Well, here's what I was going to ask.

1345
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,080
It's also true with pretty much most of their applications.

1346
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,080
Does it matter?

1347
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:29,160
Like, is the KDE approach necessarily wrong?

1348
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,000
It's sort of – I mean, what's the Unix philosophy?

1349
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,060
A lot of little tools working together to build something great.

1350
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:38,600
Is that necessarily – if you could have a nice desktop environment, a lot of different

1351
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,680
tools that use a common toolkit and a common design language, which is what the visual

1352
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:47,080
design group is supposed to be pushing, but it depends on the projects adopted, then is

1353
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,960
that necessarily the wrong approach?

1354
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,960
I think a lot of times we see two different approaches to something, and we just assume

1355
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,960
one is right and one is wrong.

1356
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,720
I don't necessarily think that's the case.

1357
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:02,800
I think, for me, I like – so I said this a long time ago – I really like the fact

1358
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,960
that GNOME feels like the Linux desktop.

1359
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,240
For some reason, like, from just something about the whole thing, it feels like GNOME

1360
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:14,440
is sitting directly on top of more fundamental Linux technologies than site KDE is.

1361
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:19,120
And so, to me, the whole cohesiveness feels like a really good desktop environment.

1362
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,560
That's what I want out of my environment.

1363
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,800
But like Rodden's saying right now, there's a whole other group of people who want those

1364
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,800
other things.

1365
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:25,800
Doesn't mean that's the wrong approach.

1366
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,800
Yeah, definitely.

1367
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,680
I think it enriches our ecosystem to have both being actively developed.

1368
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,680
Yeah.

1369
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,880
Were you going to say Rodden?

1370
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:34,880
No?

1371
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,880
Okay.

1372
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:36,880
Rodden has nothing to that.

1373
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,880
Actually, I –

1374
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,880
Yeah, go ahead.

1375
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,880
Oh, no, I totally do.

1376
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,880
I totally do.

1377
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:41,880
I always have something to say.

1378
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:50,600
So, I just posted a screenshot in the IRC of KDE – what my KDE looks like now.

1379
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,040
I'm not done, but you'll see it kind of resembles something, right?

1380
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,640
Wow, it looks a lot like GNOME, to be honest with you.

1381
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,040
Yeah, that was actually the purpose.

1382
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,040
Yeah, it looks exactly like GNOME.

1383
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,840
Yeah, it does.

1384
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:09,560
So the reason why is because I think KDE is atrocious looking.

1385
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:17,160
It is like the default for 5 is actually to the point where it's reasonable to say that

1386
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,560
I might actually try that.

1387
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:23,680
But the default for KDE 4, which is the current stable release, is atrocious.

1388
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:30,660
So the reason why my KDE looks good and it looks like a lot more cohesiveness is because

1389
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:33,360
I changed a crap load of things.

1390
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,920
I've done that too.

1391
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,840
It just seems like such a waste of energy.

1392
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,760
It almost feels like you used KDE to make a GNOME.

1393
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,000
I did, actually.

1394
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:48,080
But my point is that you can take KDE to any direction you want, and that's the power

1395
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,640
of it.

1396
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:53,240
The design group is actually going to fix the overall cohesiveness of it.

1397
01:03:53,240 --> 01:04:01,160
So eventually, it will be a very good solution, but it's not necessarily there yet.

1398
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,160
I'm starting to doubt the design group will actually have much influence.

1399
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:08,400
I mean, they've had some great influence on the desktop itself, but then other projects

1400
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,040
outside of the Direct Desktop don't really seem to be like Dragon Player, for example,

1401
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,840
or Armor Rock, for example.

1402
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,320
Not seen a lot of changes there.

1403
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,160
They haven't gotten to the point of actually starting to port those.

1404
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:26,340
Even Dolphin is one of the most important applications for KDE users, and it's only

1405
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:29,440
had slightly started the porting process right now.

1406
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,440
It's painful.

1407
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,840
So they still have a lot of work to do.

1408
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:39,840
And it's actually impressive how much work they've done in only like nine months.

1409
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:46,880
They've essentially rewritten like 70% of the code of KDE in order to do Plasma 5, and

1410
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,680
it is very impressive.

1411
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:55,160
It's not ready by any means, but it is getting to the point where you can see the potential

1412
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,160
of it.

1413
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:01,280
But Rotten, that's where it's been since before Plasma 5 was even a thing.

1414
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,800
You talked about one of the, well, there's always been a couple of constants.

1415
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,760
Qt's always been badass, and Kwin's always gotten, well, Kwin's gotten extremely badass,

1416
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:10,760
right?

1417
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:15,780
In fact, Martin's just recently been talking about all the work on his, to get Kwin working

1418
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:16,780
on Wayland.

1419
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,360
It's getting really close.

1420
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,360
It's really exciting.

1421
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,360
Yeah.

1422
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,880
Kwin is actually fantastic, and it's more fantastic, people know, because Kwin has this

1423
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:30,760
built-in feature for window rules, which is basically like saving features of how you

1424
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,520
actually lay out your windows.

1425
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,680
So if you don't want window decorations, you can turn it off, save that.

1426
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:40,560
If you want your windows to be a specific size, specific location on your screen, which

1427
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,200
screen you want it to be on, what desktop you want it to be on, different things like

1428
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:48,680
that, you can control it to ridiculous degrees that there are certain settings that I would

1429
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:52,080
never even bother because they're so specific.

1430
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:57,480
And the coolest one right now is, 4 does not have it, but Plasma 5 is an example of the

1431
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:03,920
design group seeing how this is going to be a benefit, is that the window rules in 5 allow

1432
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,600
you to change the colors per application.

1433
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,920
But are you, well, okay, that is kind of cool, you're going to do that and I'm like, well,

1434
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,880
maybe you would just so it grabs you, yeah, okay, I mean, I love this stuff.

1435
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,880
Yeah, exactly.

1436
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:17,440
Functionally, KDE is amazing.

1437
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:24,680
Visually, right now in 4, it is actually kind of like hurts my eyes most of the time, but

1438
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,040
it is getting to the point where they actually have improved the icons, they've improved

1439
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:34,840
the window decorations and they've improved a ton of things and it has potential to eventually,

1440
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:40,520
you know, even visually compete against GNOME, but right now, GNOME is definitely the more

1441
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:46,280
visually appealing, but it's also not as powerful functionally as KDE is, so it depends on which

1442
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,280
one you want.

1443
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,920
At the end of the day, I think the big problem, KDE's biggest problem is that there might

1444
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,720
be too much desktop for what people really use today.

1445
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:59,320
I think a very common use case scenario for the Linux desktop is a couple of applications

1446
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:03,920
running all the time, like a web browser, a chat program, email probably, and...

1447
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,920
Throw in a terminal, please.

1448
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,920
Absolutely.

1449
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,000
And you're pretty much done.

1450
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,840
And you don't need a lot more functionality from your desk, that's why so many people

1451
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,240
are able to use Tiling Window Managers.

1452
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,240
Yeah, exactly.

1453
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:18,320
Now, that said, I too, Rotten, have gone down the path you had where I, I mean, I really

1454
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,880
spent some time, I got the icon-only launcher sidebar going for a dock, I got a, you know,

1455
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,600
a top bar going with the clock, I mean, it really made it look nice, but it just still

1456
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,980
didn't feel as one cohesive product.

1457
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:31,980
But I like...

1458
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:37,240
Well, I mean, I just, I don't think that GNOME feels like a cohesive product that's got certain

1459
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,240
pieces that are broken.

1460
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:43,800
And just to point out, I'm a GNOME fanboy, I've been using GNOME for a decade, and I

1461
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,840
actually love GNOME Shell and GNOME 3.

1462
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:52,580
That is the, the reason why I, my current KDE setup looks like GNOME is because I actually

1463
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,400
enjoy the workflow of GNOME.

1464
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,120
So the guy who's wrote that article said he hated that workflow and didn't want it anymore.

1465
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,160
I was like, well, I actually love that workflow.

1466
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,160
Yeah, it works for me too.

1467
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,600
And I will use it on either KDE or GNOME, it doesn't matter, I love that workflow.

1468
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,600
Yeah, me too.

1469
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:12,320
But the point is mainly that if I set up something in KDE, it will remember, it will save it,

1470
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,680
it will do exactly what I tell it to do.

1471
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:20,000
With GNOME, if I tell it to, I have to install an extension in order to get it to load an

1472
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,360
application on a particular workspace, but if I put it on a different monitor, it won't

1473
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,360
remember that monitor.

1474
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,360
Yeah, that drives me crazy.

1475
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:28,360
I have to move everything.

1476
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,520
I know, I know, I agree, I agree.

1477
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:34,480
And Dolphin, in my opinion, Dolphin is a better file manager than Nautilus too, in my opinion.

1478
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,680
I would say Dolphin is the better for Linux, just in general.

1479
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,680
So that's, that's, that's.

1480
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:42,000
Gosh, you're kind of making me want to try KDE out for like a week again.

1481
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Kind of making me.

1482
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,920
I'm actually, I'm kind, I'm actually kind of feeling dirty about saying all this stuff

1483
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,040
as a GNOME fanboy.

1484
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:55,520
I even, I've released, I actually like released updates and patches to extensions for GNOME

1485
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:59,480
because I use them and someone didn't, wasn't maintaining it, so I started maintaining it

1486
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,480
and stuff like that.

1487
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:05,480
And I still do it even while I'm running KDE, so it's, it makes me feel a little weird,

1488
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:11,480
but I have to acknowledge the fantastic features that KDE provides.

1489
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,480
I agree.

1490
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,480
Yeah.

1491
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:14,480
Yeah.

1492
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,480
And you've made it look pretty good.

1493
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,040
It didn't take so much effort to make it look good.

1494
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,040
Exactly.

1495
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:23,840
If it didn't take so much effort to do that, it would be a fantastic desktop environment.

1496
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,840
How long do you think it took you?

1497
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,760
How long do you think you spent?

1498
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,360
To actually make it look right?

1499
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:32,800
Well, for me, it's not fair to comparison the time.

1500
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:36,960
For other people, it would take a lot longer because I'm a graphics artist.

1501
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:42,720
I know how to modify SVGs and everything like that, which, by the way, KDE is dependent

1502
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,440
on SVGs for the desktop shells themes.

1503
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:50,380
So if you don't know how to do that, you're pretty much hopeless if, I mean, it is hopeless

1504
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:56,000
for you to do it because you have to learn how to modify SAGs to do that.

1505
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,800
But you have to figure out what app, what widgets fit and what, but like the very first

1506
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,640
time I did it, it took me probably about a week and a half.

1507
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,520
And this time it took me about two or three days because I had to first teach myself how

1508
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,840
does KDE do all these different things.

1509
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:21,120
And it was a lot more effort than I expected, but it was still possible to do it.

1510
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,680
But I think the majority of people who don't have the skill set I do would not have as

1511
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,440
fast of an experience.

1512
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,040
And even though it's not, it's still a couple of days and it's not fast, I think it would

1513
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,920
be much worse for them.

1514
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:37,280
Yeah, it took me a couple of days to get it the way I want, I might, gosh, dang it.

1515
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,280
Hmm.

1516
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:42,520
I'm going to have to install it again, I'm going to have to give it a go.

1517
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:48,320
I can show you another, I actually have like a whole, the very first time I made my Gnome

1518
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,480
like KDE set up, it looked different than what I have now.

1519
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:56,540
But I did like a full layout of like, here's a screenshot of here's what it looks like

1520
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:57,880
in here because I finished it.

1521
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,480
It took me about a week and a half.

1522
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:00,480
I don't know what I get.

1523
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,560
I mean, Gnome works for me and I don't have sound issues.

1524
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,560
That's what I keep coming back to.

1525
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,560
But I want to try it.

1526
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,280
I keep wanting to, when I try KDE for you for a little while, I usually really enjoy

1527
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,280
it.

1528
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,280
So.

1529
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,200
Here's the other, here's one of the first, last thing I'll say, the reason why I actually

1530
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:19,680
got really annoyed at Gnome and I love Gnome, I got really annoyed by multiple monitor support.

1531
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,680
Yeah.

1532
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:26,040
Because it is, it is like, not only does it not remember the applications where they're

1533
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:31,840
supposed to be, it actually wouldn't remember which one I wanted to be primary.

1534
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,560
And it would, it would start breaking in the point where one monitor would want to take

1535
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:40,720
over to the primary and then it would switch, swap back and forth, like weird things started

1536
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,720
happening.

1537
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:45,480
But so it just, it got so, it happened so many times that it just, I just kind of threw

1538
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,480
my hands up.

1539
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,920
I was like, well, let's see how KDE handles multiple monitors.

1540
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:51,640
And I haven't had a single problem with it at all.

1541
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,640
Yeah.

1542
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:57,320
We were talking at lunch, KDE does have pretty good monitor control and yeah, all right Rod

1543
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,320
and you convinced me.

1544
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,620
Anybody else in the member room want to jump in on the topic of Gnome versus KDE when they

1545
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:01,620
switch between?

1546
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:02,620
Any final thoughts?

1547
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,200
I really want to recommend everybody go read the article.

1548
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,200
I thought it was a particularly good one though.

1549
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,200
All right.

1550
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,200
Going once, going twice.

1551
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,200
All right.

1552
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:15,440
Chris, I think as you mentioned before, there's definitely a spectrum from the bare bones

1553
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:21,920
Gnome, very polished, but not a lot of options to KDE with all of its options.

1554
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:29,280
I'm curious to see over the last year or so that Gnome has, the Gnome community has kind

1555
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:33,560
of come back or learned their lesson from the initial Gnome three days.

1556
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,640
Well, I hope so.

1557
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:41,840
So I'm curious to see as time goes on if Gnome plus extensions are going to continue to be

1558
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:47,600
supported enough to eat into the user base of KDE users that want all the options.

1559
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,600
Yeah.

1560
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,600
I mean-

1561
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,860
The extensions are actually very solid.

1562
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:53,800
This is actually a misconception I'd like to clear up about the Gnome extensions because

1563
01:12:53,800 --> 01:13:00,320
I've been maintaining some and this is just, it's a problem with the Gnome version software

1564
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:05,160
checking that it doesn't do it very well and it doesn't have like, for example, Firefox

1565
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,900
does a much better solution.

1566
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:10,000
It's this version plus future versions.

1567
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,540
With Gnome, it's this version or nothing.

1568
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:18,140
So if it doesn't detect in your, just your metadata that you are using that particular

1569
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:21,040
version you are currently on, it just breaks the extension.

1570
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:27,320
That's a really bad way to do it, but that's their current solution for making sure that

1571
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,980
you're not running stuff that's broken.

1572
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:33,180
So people think that every single time you update, you're breaking an extension when

1573
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:36,520
really it's just because the version number is not telling and it's the right one.

1574
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:41,380
If you just go in and change that version number, almost like 90% of them work immediately.

1575
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:45,280
And also means most of them, it's a quick update by the author to make it work too.

1576
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,280
So that's been happening.

1577
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,920
It's getting turned around immediately these days.

1578
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,880
Like that plugin is getting fixed all the time.

1579
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:55,160
Now Wes, have you noticed a change in tone towards Gnome 3 in the Linux community?

1580
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,160
Yeah, I would think so.

1581
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:59,880
I mean, probably two years ago, a year and a half ago, mostly negative.

1582
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,880
Yeah, right?

1583
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:01,880
At least in, you know, publicly facing discussion.

1584
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,880
Yeah, okay.

1585
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:03,880
That's what I observed too.

1586
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:06,880
But now it feels like, you know, it may not be everyone's favorite, it may not be what

1587
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,880
you use.

1588
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,480
You know, I usually use a tiling window manager at home, honestly, but I'm always happy to

1589
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,640
stick Gnome on something and use it.

1590
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:14,640
Yeah.

1591
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:15,640
What's your favorite tiling window manager?

1592
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,200
I'm using Awesome currently.

1593
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,200
Nice.

1594
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,200
Interesting.

1595
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:24,000
I think I'm going to try KD on a secondary machine, but I'm not planning to switch away

1596
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,400
from Gnome anytime soon.

1597
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,000
I just keep getting happier and happier with it.

1598
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,320
Probably just about in time to start hearing about the next Gnome 3.18 release too, which

1599
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,320
could be pretty cool.

1600
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,320
All right.

1601
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,800
Well, if you guys have any thoughts on that story, we'd love to get your opinions, especially

1602
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,120
if you've been recently trying one of the other desktops and have a good perspective.

1603
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:42,960
Go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com and look for the feedback thread for episode 101 of

1604
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,480
the unplugged program.

1605
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,480
Now on Sunday's Linux action show, we talked about the big changes coming to this open

1606
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:52,800
SUSE project, and I know several people wanted to give us some feedback on that.

1607
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,040
Before we get to that, I've got to thank DigitalOcean, sponsor of the Linux Unplugged Program, and

1608
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,640
DigitalOcean is great.

1609
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,320
If you want some Linux infrastructure right now on demand for testing or production, check

1610
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,320
them out.

1611
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,680
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

1612
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:10,600
easy way for you to spin up your own cloud server, and they have fantastic Docker support

1613
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,920
on their droplets, so you can create a nice local container, get a system all set up on

1614
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:17,720
your laptop or your desktop and push it up to the DigitalOcean cloud.

1615
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,800
No problem at all.

1616
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,400
And here's the best part, you know, you could do that and save yourself a ton of time, but

1617
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,920
if you just want to create a server from scratch, it's amazing.

1618
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,320
You can get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans are only $5, that's where

1619
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,320
they start, $5 a month.

1620
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:34,000
Then the pricing structure goes up from there, really nice, makes a lot of sense, and they

1621
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,120
even have hourly pricing available if you just want to do some testing.

1622
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,120
For $5 though, you're going to get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, because they're

1623
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,060
all SSDs, one CPU and a terabyte, a terabyte of transfer.

1624
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:48,720
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam

1625
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:53,280
and London, and they've got a brand new one in Germany, which is a great location.

1626
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:57,640
Now what I love is all of this is backed by Linux, it's all running on top of KVM and

1627
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:01,520
all of the disks are SSD based, so you're going to get really, really good performance.

1628
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,640
You log into DigitalOcean's interface, it works on your tablet, it works on your phone,

1629
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,300
it works on your desktop, you get HTML5 console access, so if you want to watch the machine

1630
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:11,160
post and all the way up to the login screen, you can do that.

1631
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,760
It is a slick system.

1632
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:16,160
They've really taken the best open source Linux technologies and wrapped it around in

1633
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,520
a package that makes it very presentable and very easy for you to use.

1634
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,520
And I don't know if you've ever tried it, Wes.

1635
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,520
Oh yeah, definitely.

1636
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,520
Oh yeah?

1637
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,520
Oh, of course.

1638
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,480
So one of the things I love about DigitalOcean is it's like I know that if I want to go over

1639
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:30,240
and start getting working on something, the delay isn't going to be the creating the server,

1640
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:33,380
deploying the software, like that's no longer the barrier anymore.

1641
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:37,640
Getting started on that stuff, which 10 years ago was like a two week process to order the

1642
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,520
server and install the operating system, configure the firewall, rack it.

1643
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,080
Wait for the ticket to get updated.

1644
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,080
Yes, right.

1645
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,760
Talk to support.

1646
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,280
And now with DigitalOcean, you go over there and it's like, well, it's under a minute.

1647
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:52,000
You have a Linux virtual machine deployed and if you use our promo code DOUNPLUGED, you'll

1648
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,820
get a $10 credit and you can try out the $5 rig two months for free.

1649
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,560
And you can do one click deployment of applications.

1650
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,080
Like I've done one click deployment of Ubuntu 14.04 with Apache already just ready to go

1651
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,080
on there.

1652
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,080
So I don't have to bother with that.

1653
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,380
And the nice thing is it's already subscribed to the repo, so it's going to get all the

1654
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:07,840
updates from Ubuntu.

1655
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,720
And I'll do local mirrors of the Ubuntu repos too, so you can pull it down at like tens

1656
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:12,720
of megabytes a second.

1657
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:13,720
It's crazy.

1658
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:14,720
It's so cool to watch that.

1659
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,400
I love watching the updates go boom, boom, boom, boom, like, yeah, that, it feels like

1660
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,640
it's supercharged.

1661
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,700
Their interface is so great for managing all this.

1662
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:21,700
Very intuitive.

1663
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:24,320
But the best part is they have an API to let you replicate it, which is really nice.

1664
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,000
There's some great apps around that.

1665
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,760
They have really, really good tutorials too.

1666
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,120
In fact, go over to DigitalOcean.

1667
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,240
Remember, use the promo code DOUNPLUGED.

1668
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,400
Check out that community section.

1669
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,560
They're updating this all the time.

1670
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,480
Like here's one, how to update the scaling of your web application on DigitalOcean.

1671
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,360
That's genius when you think about the fact that DigitalOcean is hourly pricing, so if

1672
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,400
you need to scale for a little while, ooh, that's cool.

1673
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,560
Oh, buddy, buddy, buddy, I've been waiting for this one.

1674
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:49,560
How to create a blog with Ghost and NGINX on Ubuntu 14.04.

1675
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,560
This is it.

1676
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,560
If you're going to do a blog for yourself or for your company, WordPress is great.

1677
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,000
Mad props to WordPress.

1678
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Check out Ghost.

1679
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,280
And they have a community tutorial on it right here, or how to use a Rango DB.

1680
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,880
Are you familiar with a Rango?

1681
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:02,880
I am not.

1682
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,880
I don't know what a Rango is.

1683
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,040
I like how it has avocados as it's a...

1684
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,840
I know where we can learn more though.

1685
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:07,840
Yes, exactly.

1686
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,520
DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1687
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:16,760
They've also got FreeBSD if you're a masochist, CoreOS, Fedora 22, Debian, Ubuntu.

1688
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:17,760
I'm kidding about the FreeBSD thing.

1689
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,760
I think it's really cool.

1690
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,760
They have support for it.

1691
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,480
It's actually no technical joke either.

1692
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:23,560
They got that working in KVM.

1693
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,600
They worked upstream with the FreeBSD project.

1694
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,680
Same with CoreOS too.

1695
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,820
They worked directly with the project to make this stuff happen.

1696
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:30,820
It's really cool.

1697
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:34,480
And you can try it out two months for free when you use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1698
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,480
Go get yourself a Linux rig.

1699
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,480
You want to try de-Google-fying your life for a little while?

1700
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:40,440
Maybe you want to do an own cloud instance or maybe you want to see if you can host your

1701
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:44,120
own photo gallery or maybe you want your own mumble chat server.

1702
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,520
Set up your own lug.

1703
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,000
You do it all on a DigitalOcean droplet, DigitalOcean.com.

1704
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,240
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and a big, big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

1705
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,600
the Unplugged program.

1706
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,600
All right.

1707
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,280
So this was the basic feedback we got from Sunday's show.

1708
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:02,160
One lost user wrote, I don't really get why Chris and Noah are puzzled by SUSE and what

1709
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,760
OpenSUSE intend to do.

1710
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:09,520
The new distro will be SUSE Linux Enterprise to what CentOS is to Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

1711
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,920
There will be Tumbleweed, the bleeding edge, always rolling distro.

1712
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:16,120
They'll be in much better shape than Rawhide because OpenSUSE actually expects people to

1713
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:20,200
use it as a desktop OS as opposed to Rawhide is always borkin'.

1714
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:24,720
There will be OpenSUSE 42 which is going to be based on SUSE Linux Enterprise sources.

1715
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:28,080
People will be able to use it as such others do with like CentOS.

1716
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:34,200
It'll be extremely easy for OpenSUSE and SUSE to switch between 42 to switch to the Enterprise

1717
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,200
version of back and forth.

1718
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,280
It looks like a very smart move, he believes.

1719
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,280
Now Rotten, you were watching live and we covered it and you said you wanted to jump

1720
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,960
in on the feedback so I'll open it up to you first and then we'll kick around to other

1721
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:44,960
people.

1722
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,080
Rotten, what was your main takeaway from the coverage and your opinion on the setup?

1723
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:53,000
Well, the first thing is that this guy is wrong.

1724
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,440
The guy who you just read wrote in, that's wrong.

1725
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,440
It's not a CentOS to Red Hat.

1726
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:58,440
I agree with that too.

1727
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:01,600
I don't think it really is a CentOS to Red Hat Enterprise thing either.

1728
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:06,920
So basically what they're saying, they even specifically were asked if they did this,

1729
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:12,680
was OpenSUSE going to become like an OpenSLE thing and they said no, definitely not.

1730
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:17,160
They're going to be doing, their OpenSUSE is just going to be based on SLE so it's going

1731
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:23,200
to have all the same packages for SLE but it's not going to have the, you know, it's

1732
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,200
not going to be the exact same thing.

1733
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:29,200
They're going to have SLE packages plus their own packages to create the OpenSUSE desktop.

1734
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:34,240
The goal was to have like an integration with SUSE and OpenSUSE which they didn't used to

1735
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,240
have.

1736
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,400
There was a huge gap between the two.

1737
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:42,800
But also, sorry, my dog's actually drinking water.

1738
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,800
Yeah, I know.

1739
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,800
That's all right.

1740
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:51,420
So we got a lot of different feedback, Rotten, on it and some people like this a lot.

1741
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:55,640
So here was a response we got from R Brown from SUSE.

1742
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,720
He says something like this is what he wanted to do.

1743
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,720
He gave us a couple of links.

1744
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:03,480
He says, what we realized is we were building here doesn't fit into traditional models anymore.

1745
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:08,600
We find that for us that we're not really serving the purpose they used to traditional

1746
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:12,800
release models do for a community-based distro or even an enterprise distro perspective.

1747
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,560
With all the testing we do for Tumbleweed and our open QA process, we've managed to

1748
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:20,920
make a rolling release that only rolls when we know the test, the thing isn't broken.

1749
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,320
So they test it first.

1750
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,440
Given the motivator for so many people for traditional community releases is I want the

1751
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:29,240
latest shiny new stuff but I only want it when it works, Tumbleweed managed to do that

1752
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:32,500
without a six or 12 month waiting period.

1753
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:33,960
Is that possible?

1754
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:34,960
Yeah.

1755
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:38,360
They actually had known first before Arch.

1756
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:42,040
That doesn't mean that it's flawless.

1757
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,920
It actually wasn't flawless.

1758
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,560
I think it's an exaggeration to claim flawless.

1759
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,760
But it was very stable.

1760
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:52,440
And I tried it out because I was being impatient.

1761
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,200
And it actually was really good.

1762
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,080
I didn't notice any huge breaks or anything.

1763
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:00,640
I noticed some Gnome specific things but that was just Gnome things.

1764
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:06,560
But the point about Tumbleweed though is they kind of explained in a weird diagram of what

1765
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:15,400
the initial goal is that Tumbleweed will be like the sources for SLEE eventually in snapshot

1766
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,400
form.

1767
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:22,000
So Tumbleweed will be constantly being updated and maintained and then at some point in every

1768
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,960
couple of years or so, they would take a snapshot of Tumbleweed, throw it into SLEE, then SUSE

1769
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:34,320
would do their stuff to it, then they would become the core base to OpenSUSE which then

1770
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,520
does their own stuff on top of it.

1771
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:46,120
So basically what Noah was talking about last how he wanted a desktop enterprise solution,

1772
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:52,480
that's pretty much what OpenSUSE is talking about.

1773
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:56,040
It seems to me though that OpenSUSE is essentially going to be just about as, and I think it's

1774
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:59,320
where the comparison to CentOS comes in, it's going to be just about as stale as Slew's

1775
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:00,880
Enterprise Linux, right?

1776
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:01,880
No.

1777
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:04,760
Because you think they'll replace certain components as they need to?

1778
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:05,760
Yes.

1779
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:10,060
They've already said that they were even thinking about updating the desktop environments away

1780
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,160
from SLEE.

1781
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:15,440
They haven't specified whether they're going to or not but they said that there's a potential

1782
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:22,400
that they will so that there could absolutely be, the core fundamental packages are going

1783
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:30,280
to be the same, I guess stale if you want to say it, like with SLEE stuff, but the user

1784
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:36,760
space on top would be pretty much not as fast as Tumbleweed but a lot faster than their

1785
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:37,760
current structure.

1786
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,360
So it would be kind of like a LTS base with a nod on it.

1787
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:45,920
Right, okay, that's what I was going to ask, am I picturing the right thing when it's like,

1788
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,320
I guess, here's what, and Richard, I really appreciate him responding in the subreddit

1789
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:57,920
too, I guess what I don't quite understand is how, I still don't, why would I choose,

1790
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:02,380
why would I choose, I guess I would have to wait and find out what components they're

1791
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:08,080
going to individually choose to replace and upgrade apart from SLEE before I know if OpenSUSE

1792
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,080
is going to fit for me.

1793
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:14,840
And right now it sounds like there's a lot of what ifs, well no, hear me out, if they

1794
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:19,760
decide to update the desktop environment and the web browsers and things like that, all

1795
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,320
those user land applications, that's pretty slick, kind of sounds like what Mint's doing.

1796
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:27,480
But if they decide, well, we don't really have the manpower to do that, then it seems

1797
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:32,540
like it could get to be just a basic CentOS kind of clone, and here's why I am concerned

1798
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:38,600
about that happening, A, I don't believe that OpenQA is going to catch all this stuff, I

1799
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:42,360
think the way you catch stuff in Linux a lot of times is just a function of, a lot of people

1800
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:45,560
use it for a while, they eventually find a bug and they fix it and then somebody patches

1801
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:51,100
that bug and then a distro finally ships it, otherwise, right, because otherwise you could

1802
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,320
just use rolling all the time.

1803
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:58,600
So I think, I don't know if unit testing is really going to make a rolling distro that

1804
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:01,360
much stable over another one, and I think you could have a bit of a reputation burn

1805
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,680
there, okay, but that's point number one, now let me make a second point.

1806
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:06,980
Second point, the reason why I'm concerned more about OpenSUSE and what components they're

1807
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:10,760
going to replace is because I think if we're totally honest with ourselves, why are we

1808
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,560
in this position right now?

1809
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,880
Why are they making OpenSUSE 42?

1810
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,240
Why are they doing Tumbleweed?

1811
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:20,080
Why are they going to base OpenSUSE off of SLEE?

1812
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,200
Why?

1813
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:25,600
Because only a couple of people are working on the project anymore, OpenSUSE, nobody's

1814
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:30,440
working on it, nobody cares about it, they're all working on Tumbleweed or SUSE Enterprise,

1815
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:34,480
they said so themselves, in their own presentation and in their own blog post, the fundamental

1816
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:38,640
problem with the last release of OpenSUSE is nobody wants to work on it, they all want

1817
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:44,720
to work on Tumbleweed or the big dog, and so if that is a problem today, how is that

1818
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:48,420
not going to be a problem two years, a year down the road, when they have this thing that's

1819
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:51,120
based on something that's already done, but now they have this pain in the neck where

1820
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,600
they have to replace certain components and stay on top of that and ship it all the time?

1821
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:58,000
It seems like they'll eventually just be right back in the same position they're at today,

1822
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Tumbleweed will get all of the current active attention, and SLEE's going to get all of

1823
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,080
the stability and money focused attention.

1824
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:05,200
How does this solve their fundamental problem?

1825
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:12,320
Okay, so to answer one about what is the reason to use this, you use Arch, so everything is

1826
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:16,880
rolling anyway, so you would be Tumbleweed, like the exact transition, you would just

1827
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,440
move to Tumbleweed and you'd have the same stuff you would have right now.

1828
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:22,320
Yeah, and I get that, Tumbleweed makes sense to me, I get it, I don't know if I believe

1829
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:26,400
it's going to be as trouble-free as they say, but I bet it's going to be more trouble-free,

1830
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:30,440
but I saw it, Tumbleweed makes sense, SUSE Enterprise makes sense to me, and I also see

1831
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,280
from a business standpoint, where they have the dedication and resources, that it all

1832
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,280
makes sense.

1833
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:40,280
Okay, so the second one, you don't understand why they would do this.

1834
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:44,840
So OpenSUSE to me, 42, sounds like what it's going to be, is a pretty cool product based

1835
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:48,800
on some pretty nice stable Enterprise upstream source code.

1836
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:52,280
Now then they're going to go, well this chunk and this chunk and this chunk, and they've

1837
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:55,520
explained they've made it very easy to modulize and replace these chunks, they're going to

1838
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,280
say this chunk, this chunk, and this chunk, we're going to swap out and we're going to

1839
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:04,440
maintain this ourselves on top of this SLEE base, KDE, Gnome, Firefox, whatever, we're

1840
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:07,040
going to maintain this on top of the SLEE base ourselves.

1841
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,520
Well then aren't they just getting right back on this treadmill that they've been running

1842
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,500
this entire time, that they all jumped ship from, and I'm mixing a lot of analogies here,

1843
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:16,940
but isn't this, what is different?

1844
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:17,940
What changes?

1845
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:22,160
Isn't the core issue, the focus for the distro, wasn't the core issue that sort of prompted

1846
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:27,800
this, was that nobody was working on OpenSUSE, and I guess what this sounds like is it sounds

1847
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,760
like we're trying to manage OpenSUSE a little bit.

1848
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:34,980
We need some, you know, Red Hat has CentOS and Fedora, they're doing Fedora Core, they're

1849
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:38,920
making Fedora Workstation and Fedora Cloud, they're getting very serious with the Atomic

1850
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:44,400
project about making Fedora an actual cloud deployable system.

1851
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:48,880
You're seeing places like Rackspace, you're seeing places like DigitalOcean deploy Fedora,

1852
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,060
you're not seeing them deploy OpenSUSE, that's got to bother them.

1853
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:55,800
So they want to get OpenSUSE into a place where it could be part of a VPS package, it

1854
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,080
could be something that's installed on demand.

1855
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:02,700
It's kind of embarrassing, isn't it, that one of the biggest, for a long time, well-known

1856
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:07,140
distributions has like had very little game in the whole cloud space.

1857
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:11,680
Like Ubuntu just came and ate their lunch by surprise, and now I agree, they have to

1858
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,440
do something to make OpenSUSE relevant in this space, it'd be great for them.

1859
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:17,000
And I think this could do it, I think this would do it.

1860
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,600
If I knew OpenSUSE was based on enterprise source code, man, I'd feel a lot better about

1861
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:23,720
deploying that on a production VPS for sure.

1862
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:28,600
I still don't see though why they are incentivized to maintain these individual layers of it

1863
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:32,560
and keep those competitive when they're not incentivized to do it today.

1864
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,160
That's the part I'm not seeing.

1865
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:36,720
Okay, there's two things.

1866
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:39,720
There's the gap between SUSE and OpenSUSE.

1867
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:44,320
For example, with Red Hat, they have the code in Fedora, they have code in CentOS that they

1868
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:48,440
can take improvements from Fedora and CentOS and easily put them in the Red Hat if they

1869
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,880
deem worthy to be in there.

1870
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:55,240
SUSE and OpenSUSE don't have that, they don't have the integration that Red Hat does.

1871
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:59,840
So for one, it solves that integration problem because the core structure of OpenSUSE is

1872
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:04,360
going to be based on SLEE, and then Tumbleweed would eventually become Snapshots for SLEE,

1873
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:10,380
so they would get this integration level back into the benefits of SUSE with the backing

1874
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:14,600
and funding of everything and actually have a lot of work that's not just on the OpenSUSE

1875
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,600
side.

1876
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:20,280
So right now, the reason why, your example, they didn't have much attention in OpenSUSE

1877
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:23,960
because they wanted to do Tumbleweed, well, it's a community effort in that case, and

1878
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:28,260
the people choose what they want to work on, and OpenSUSE didn't have a lot of people working

1879
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:31,720
on the OpenSUSE stable release because they wanted to be on Tumbleweed, and they didn't

1880
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:36,240
have a base that they could build on to actually make that work.

1881
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:39,760
So this is actually solving that problem, so it doesn't matter what they want.

1882
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:40,760
What does it change?

1883
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,640
Because they're not going to have to put that work in, because the whole point of OpenSUSE

1884
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:47,720
right now, the reason that was a problem is because they only had a handful of people

1885
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:52,760
working on this fundamental thing that they're handling everything, now they don't have to

1886
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:53,760
handle it.

1887
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:54,760
Because they're going to pull it in from Tumbleweed.

1888
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:57,280
Because they're going to do the work in Tumbleweed.

1889
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:00,960
Pull it in from Tumbleweed and in from Sleeve, so it's kind of like a hybrid in those.

1890
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:04,800
And then, plus, I'm sure they've, and maybe you could tell me if this is true or not,

1891
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,900
have they finished development on LibMagick that totally resolves all of the library issues

1892
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,760
between major versions when you're going from a stable enterprise district to something

1893
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,760
rolling?

1894
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:15,840
Does LibMagick just handle all of that?

1895
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,320
I don't know.

1896
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,520
I mean, let's look at Cinnamon.

1897
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:25,980
Why has Cinnamon had so many problems landing in Arch when it's a rolling distribution?

1898
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:30,200
Because GTK underneath changes, and Cinnamon depends on an older version of GTK, and then

1899
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:33,640
all of a sudden, you can't install Cinnamon on a rolling distro anymore.

1900
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:38,120
Now, is Tumbleweed going to make the decision in this case to hold GTK back, or am I going

1901
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:43,200
to be able to replace the entire GTK installation using the OpenSUSE build service?

1902
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,560
How are they legitimately going to solve these real-world problems that have plagued every

1903
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,680
other Linux distro since the invention of a rolling distro?

1904
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:51,960
How are they going to solve that?

1905
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:52,960
They're not going to roll everything.

1906
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:57,300
Like, Tumbleweed will roll everything, and you're not going to have any kind of connection

1907
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,880
with the stability issues whatsoever.

1908
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:03,860
The part where they're pulling stuff from, they're going to pull stuff from Tumbleweed

1909
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:08,080
when it suits, like, for example, application level of, like, Firefox and things like that

1910
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,800
that will not have any kind of linkage.

1911
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:14,320
That makes sense, but it seems like then there's going to be limitations.

1912
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:19,960
There's going to be a certain pressure to keep OpenSUSE at least in somewhat compatibility

1913
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:22,860
sync with Tumbleweed so that way they can move more stuff over, because the further

1914
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:26,720
those two drift, the less and less things they should be able to pull over from Tumbleweed,

1915
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:27,720
I would think.

1916
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:31,800
Well, yeah, but like fundamental things, yes, that'd be the problem, but they also are saying

1917
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,760
that it's not just Tumbleweed that they're pulling from.

1918
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:38,360
They're also going to be, as the community of OpenSUSE, not just of Tumbleweed.

1919
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,560
Yeah, sure, but why isn't that happening today?

1920
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,360
See, that's part of the argument I don't get.

1921
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,160
Yeah, sure, they can custom develop that stuff.

1922
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,880
They can make that stuff keep working on OpenSUSE, so they could be doing that today and they're

1923
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:47,880
not doing it.

1924
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:48,880
I mean, they are doing it, but barely.

1925
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,120
They're barely getting it out the door.

1926
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,080
That's because they are doing everything.

1927
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,560
Yeah, you know, that could be, right?

1928
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,920
Yeah, maybe this will be enough of a pressure release.

1929
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:58,920
Yeah, boy, that'd be great.

1930
01:31:58,920 --> 01:31:59,920
Good point.

1931
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:04,440
That'd be really cool if this could – I have these questions that I've raised, and

1932
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:08,120
I guess sometimes when I ask these kinds of questions it sounds like I think it's a really

1933
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,600
dumb idea, or it sounds like I don't think they should do it, and that's not the case

1934
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,600
at all.

1935
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:15,360
I'm just wondering, like, how are they going to – these – I guess what I'm trying to

1936
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:18,240
do is I'm trying to identify what I perceive to be challenges they're going to have to

1937
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:23,160
overcome, and I'm really glad somebody's trying this approach, because I don't really

1938
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:28,560
think the Fedora one's going to necessarily resonate for a lot of people on servers, and

1939
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:33,000
I just think that there is a great space in here for OpenSUSE to fill with this sort of

1940
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,720
SLE based upstream source codes that give me a sort of assurance that it's based on

1941
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:38,400
a really quality enterprise product.

1942
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,600
I think this could be a killer.

1943
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,760
I'm not saying it's going to be a flop, but I am saying I think there's going to be significant

1944
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:47,080
challenges that I don't quite see all the solutions to, so I'm not trying to poop on

1945
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:48,080
it.

1946
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:53,040
Well, I mean, I just think that – like, the fundamental changes is that the people

1947
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:59,360
who are working on the stuff to improve the user space in OpenSUSE, and they also had

1948
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:03,400
to deal with the core fundamentals as well, but now they don't have to do that so they

1949
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:08,880
can do a lot more even in the OpenSUSE stable release level without the Tumbleweed, so they

1950
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:14,180
have – they can – like, the pressure release is the biggest benefit of this, but you also

1951
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:20,240
have the people who want a stable base with a rolling top, or not even necessarily rolling,

1952
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:23,920
but just more up to date than a regular release of most distros.

1953
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:24,920
I got it.

1954
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:25,920
Oh, man.

1955
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:28,760
I think for me, I think – because I don't really care what happens with SLE or OpenSUSE

1956
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:33,920
as so much as I think Tumbleweed is going to get really appealing to a user like me

1957
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:38,200
because – so not only do you have some really interesting technologies there, but I also

1958
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:43,580
find the technologies around SUSE or OpenSUSE to be pretty sexy, like the OpenSUSE build

1959
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:47,240
service and the images where you can go custom machine and crank that out and download that

1960
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:51,140
as an ISO, and it's like, here's my machine already pre-set up, like, all that stuff really

1961
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:52,140
makes me hot.

1962
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:53,140
I think that's super great.

1963
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:56,520
And so you build a really great distro around that, and I actually think Zipper is a pretty

1964
01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:00,200
decent technology, and I like that they're bold enough to back butter FS, even if I think

1965
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:05,600
it's currently a train wreck that makes people lose data, but, you know, like, Martin from

1966
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,800
the Netherlands wrote in, and Martin said, what makes OpenSUSE unique is that it's easy

1967
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,200
enough to understand for anyone with a Windows technical background.

1968
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:16,520
You kind of have the Windows paradigm when you use their KDE desktop, Yast is a lot like

1969
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:21,400
the control panel, all system settings can be configured via a GUI, unlike Fedora, and

1970
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:25,040
at the same time, it remains fully focused on open source, where everything is contributed

1971
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:28,000
back upstream, unlike Ubuntu, which is...

1972
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,800
They have a corporate backing, giving me a feeling that the distribution won't disappear

1973
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:31,800
anytime soon.

1974
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:36,920
He says, and I love this line, Martin says, it's like the Toyota of Linux distributions.

1975
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:41,600
It's a bit boring to drive, but from a technical and reliability standpoint, it's the best.

1976
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,220
That's not bad.

1977
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:45,760
That's not a bad way to put it, really, and I don't think that's a slam at all.

1978
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,760
I think that's a...

1979
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,800
I think it's a really good spot to be in as a distro, especially if you want people installing

1980
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:50,800
your servers.

1981
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:55,000
All right, guys, anybody have any closing thoughts before we close the books on this

1982
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
one?

1983
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,320
Well, finally, just the OBS is another example of the updating software.

1984
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:05,240
So like the PPAs that Ubuntu have, OBS are going to provide a similar thing, but a lot

1985
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,360
more organized way to do it.

1986
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,360
But also...

1987
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,360
And more approachable.

1988
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:11,360
Definitely.

1989
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:15,620
The cool thing is not only is the sources from SLEE coming to OpenSUSE, they're actually

1990
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:16,740
going to the OBS.

1991
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:21,280
So really, anybody who wants to get a source can do it.

1992
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:24,880
You can actually, if you wanted to, maybe, this is just like...

1993
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:27,600
I'm completely talking out of my butt right now.

1994
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:33,800
But SUSE Studio, plus the OBS, plus the SLEE releases, maybe you can make your own SLEE.

1995
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,480
Yeah, I think you definitely could.

1996
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,480
I think that's a...

1997
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:40,600
Wow, yeah, especially with the build service, that's going to be a thing.

1998
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:41,600
That's definitely going to be...

1999
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,600
And that could be great for enterprises.

2000
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:43,600
Oh, yeah, definitely.

2001
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,040
Ah, good, good, good thought.

2002
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,040
Good thought.

2003
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:47,640
Well, Wes, man, thank you for joining me in studio today.

2004
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:48,640
My pleasure.

2005
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:49,640
It's good having you here.

2006
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:52,480
Thank you, everybody, in the mumble room for joining us and giving us your thoughts.

2007
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:56,440
If you'd like to join the Unplugged program, hang on our virtual lug, go to jupyterbroadcasting.com

2008
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:57,440
slash calendar.

2009
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,720
You get the live times over there.

2010
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:02,800
We do it over at jblive.tv where you can have your Flash player armed and ready to go.

2011
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,560
No, disable Flash this week.

2012
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:05,560
That's our mission.

2013
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:06,560
Disable Flash.

2014
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,340
Use HLS, RTSP, RTMP.

2015
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:09,340
We've got it.

2016
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:10,340
They're linked.

2017
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:12,160
Or go to jblive.fm and listen in audio.

2018
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:13,960
Now, we do it over at jblive.tv.

2019
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:17,680
You don't have to use Flash if you don't want to, but we do it at 1 p.m. or 2 p.m.?

2020
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:18,680
2 p.m.

2021
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,680
Yeah, that's right.

2022
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:20,680
That's right.

2023
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:21,680
Because we've got to have time for lunch, guys.

2024
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:22,680
Right?

2025
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:23,680
Got to have time for lunch.

2026
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:24,680
And beer.

2027
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:25,680
And beer.

2028
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:28,000
LinuxActionShow.reddit.com for feedback to this week's episode, and join us right back

2029
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
here next Tuesday.

2030
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:49,880
Okay, just do this.

2031
01:36:49,880 --> 01:37:07,960
And another show is in the bag.

2032
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:12,960
Any post-show topics we wanted to get to before we skedaddle?

2033
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:17,160
I got a meeting I gotta get to in a little bit.

2034
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:18,880
I feel like I talked just as much as you did.

2035
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:19,880
Yeah, you did talk a lot.

2036
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:22,960
But it was good because it was a good thing you were here today because it was topics

2037
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:23,960
that were up your alley.

2038
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:26,320
I'm glad we got it covered.

2039
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:27,320
First hand sushi experience.

2040
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:29,120
Great topics and great conversation, guys.

2041
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:30,120
Yeah, it was.

2042
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,120
Thank you.

2043
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:32,120
And it's great having Wes.

2044
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:34,200
It's fun having someone I can look over to and talk to because otherwise I'm just standing

2045
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,200
here by myself.

2046
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:41,240
Now, there was a privacy topic I wanted to retouch on.

2047
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:44,420
But maybe, I don't know, since we don't have a lot of time, maybe it'd be better to address

2048
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:47,880
it next time when we can actually spend some serious time on it.

2049
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:54,180
The mumble's got an update that's coming out soon for the next version of 1.3 is not going

2050
01:37:54,180 --> 01:37:56,800
to have the stupid lips.

2051
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,640
What is it going to have instead?

2052
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:03,500
It's actually replacing the theme with an actual good theme from this guy named X-Poke

2053
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:07,760
and he made something called Metro Mumble, which looks pretty slick.

2054
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:08,760
Using it now.

2055
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:11,080
Is that the skin you and I were already using?

2056
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:12,080
Yes, it is.

2057
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,080
Metro Mumble, huh?

2058
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,480
It does look pretty though, doesn't it?

2059
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,480
Yeah.

2060
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:22,880
A thing to note though, if you have a custom theme already applied and then you update,

2061
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:28,480
it will unapply your custom theme and default to the light new theme.

2062
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:32,640
So if you're using the dark theme, like I was, it'll just go away randomly and you wonder

2063
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,640
why.

2064
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:37,800
And then you go and see that, oh, there's new options in the look and feel section.

2065
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:41,720
Not only is it new options, they've completely rebuilt the system so the skin structure where

2066
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:44,380
you can control what you use is gone.

2067
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:49,280
You have to change a new arbitrary folder structure that you have to place the themes

2068
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:54,680
in and they don't tell you on Linux where your stuff is.

2069
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:57,920
They tell you on Windows and only Windows.

2070
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:04,160
I had to figure out where everything was and it's like a stupid arbitrary location that

2071
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:12,760
even in its own selection is just absurd because it is, I'm just going to type it in the chat

2072
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,560
right now actually.

2073
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,120
I'm so close to jeopardizing my mumble setup here.

2074
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:21,320
Is this just a theme that you could apply to an existing mumble?

2075
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,320
Yeah I just applied it.

2076
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2077
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:24,320
You can apply it to your existing mumble right now.

2078
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,320
BOOM!

2079
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:26,320
But in the new version...

2080
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,320
Go ahead, if you want to download and play it, you can.

2081
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:28,320
It's up to you.

2082
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,960
All you have to do is restart the mumble and restart the client.

2083
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:34,080
Oh, I didn't even have to restart, I just hit apply and then bam, I had it like a boost,

2084
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:35,080
I think.

2085
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:36,080
Well, some of the icons won't update once you restart.

2086
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,080
Oh yeah, you're right.

2087
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:38,080
I'll do that.

2088
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,080
I'll restart.

2089
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:41,480
I posted the location of the themes folder now.

2090
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:49,320
It's local share mumble mumble themes and the mumble twice is important and also the

2091
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,840
themes folder does not exist.

2092
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,840
You have to create it first and then put the theme in there.

2093
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:58,600
So hey, would you mind, Mr. Corbs, if we reset just really quick so we can put this in the

2094
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:01,060
pre-show since a lot of people listening to this show use mumble.

2095
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:02,960
If you want to say, say how can we do this?

2096
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:05,280
Actually why don't we make this the mumble pre-show?

2097
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:06,280
Sure.

2098
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:10,720
Yeah, so maybe the theme, where to get it and where to put it on Linux while I go grab

2099
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,120
this printout and that will be like the pre-show.

2100
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:13,120
Sure.

2101
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:14,120
All right, I'm muting my mic.

2102
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,120
There you go.

2103
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:16,120
Have at it.

2104
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:17,120
Okay.

2105
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:22,160
So mumble is, they're actually updating to a new version.

2106
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:26,880
This currently you can get in a PPA or in the AUR in a snapshot version and it's 1.3.

2107
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:31,560
They're instituting a new default theme, which is actually really nice looking, but you can

2108
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,960
get it right now.

2109
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:38,400
It's for use in 1.2 to add as a skin.

2110
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:48,320
And you get it from the GitHub link I posted in IRC and put it wherever you want.

2111
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:56,240
And you can just go into your settings for configure and then choose the QSS file inside

2112
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:58,840
of the skins structure.

2113
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:03,520
This is how you do it in 1.2 and 1.3 it's automatically already available and you can

2114
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,360
choose between the light and the dark.

2115
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:11,320
The problem with that is that in 1.3 the theme is embedded into the program so you can't

2116
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,600
change anything.

2117
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:17,320
And one of the reasons this theme is actually awesome is because the majority of the icons

2118
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:19,040
are SVGs.

2119
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:25,960
So like for example, when you open this theme by default the non-talking icon is red and

2120
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:31,800
I think that is hideous, especially when it goes into my system tray and it just falls.

2121
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:39,360
So you can change that in the SVG code with just a slight hex value, change it to white

2122
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:42,400
or gray or whatever fits best on your theme and it's good to go.

2123
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:47,920
So the problem with the 1.3 is that you can't do that unless you download this theme and

2124
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,920
put it in the correct themes folder.

2125
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:57,640
And the correct theme folder is an arbitrary location that actually does not exist.

2126
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:02,360
You have to create the folder there.

2127
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:04,820
It is the location I just posted in IRC.

2128
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:10,440
It's.local slash share slash mumble slash mumble then themes folder does not exist.

2129
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:16,440
You create the theme folder then you put this extracted theme into that folder and then

2130
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:21,640
the new 1.3 snapshot will notice that theme has been added and you can select it from

2131
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:31,800
the drop down and it will save all of your modifications and things like that.

2132
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:36,960
So I just applied it and lost all my audio.

2133
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,440
That shouldn't make any difference for the themes.

2134
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:45,720
And I've just switched back and the audio came back.

2135
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:47,520
It's very weird.

2136
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,240
It's just again it shouldn't change any audio.

2137
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:52,600
Yeah it doesn't change any audio whatsoever.

2138
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:57,200
I got the new theme installed and working.

2139
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:01,200
I'm running the new theme on 1.3.

2140
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:05,880
The thing that was annoying to me is that when I had the theme already and they updated

2141
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:12,720
and it went to the same theme but it turned into white and it also essentially ignored

2142
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:16,640
all the modifications I did because it wasn't looking for the right folder anymore.

2143
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:21,640
And when I went to ask them where it was they had no idea.

2144
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:26,280
The developers or maybe not the developers that actually made the change but the people

2145
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:32,600
who are the support team in mumble for the IRC had no clue where the stuff was located

2146
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:33,600
in Linux.

2147
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:36,760
They sent me a link that said here's where it is.

2148
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:39,880
That's Windows only and that's not very helpful.

2149
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:44,240
So essentially I had to figure it out myself and it took me about 30 minutes but that's

2150
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:48,720
the folder structure where it is now so at least no one else has figured it out.

2151
01:43:48,720 --> 01:44:15,360
I'm going to edit their wiki so it actually displays it properly.
