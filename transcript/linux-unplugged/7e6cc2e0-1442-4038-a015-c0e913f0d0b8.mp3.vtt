WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
I watched Mad Dog's 50 Years of Unix and Linux Advances talk.

00:05.260 --> 00:06.280
It's great, wasn't it?

00:06.280 --> 00:10.440
That room was so full, it was standing room only.

00:10.440 --> 00:13.300
Yeah, that looked like it was a good talk.

00:13.300 --> 00:14.360
And he made a great point

00:14.360 --> 00:16.120
that if we're gonna call it GNU slash Linux,

00:16.120 --> 00:18.320
we should probably also call it GNU slash Linux,

00:18.320 --> 00:22.360
MIT slash Linux, BSD slash Linux,

00:22.360 --> 00:24.280
insert license here because it's all,

00:24.280 --> 00:26.640
the user land now is full of so many different licenses

00:26.640 --> 00:29.320
that it might be time to update that whole naming thing.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.040
I think I called that a couple of years ago,

00:31.040 --> 00:32.960
isn't it system D slash Linux now?

00:34.680 --> 00:39.680
This is Linux Unplugged episode 287 for February 5th, 2019.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.840
Oh, hi there and welcome to Linux Unplugged,

00:52.840 --> 00:54.480
your weekly Linux talk show

00:54.480 --> 00:56.960
that's hunkered down in a windstorm.

00:56.960 --> 00:57.800
My name is Chris.

00:57.800 --> 00:58.920
My name is Wes.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.040
And Wes, you're hunkered down in a snowstorm,

01:01.040 --> 01:02.880
but that's not what we're here to talk about today.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.060
No, no, we have some community news,

01:05.060 --> 01:07.200
including everyone's favorite media player

01:07.200 --> 01:11.560
getting a major update and everyone's favorite desktop.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.480
Well, at least that's what the stats would tell us.

01:13.480 --> 01:16.000
Gnome Shell is getting a major speed boost.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.520
We'll talk a little about open source cryptocurrency crashes,

01:19.520 --> 01:21.560
some big updates in housekeeping,

01:21.560 --> 01:23.540
and then a FOSDEM check-in.

01:24.520 --> 01:27.560
Not only do we have a couple of choice moments from FOSDEM,

01:27.560 --> 01:30.480
but the one and only good smelling Popey joins us.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.280
There's nobody else that smells as good as Popey does.

01:32.280 --> 01:34.960
And he joins us this week to talk about FOSDEM,

01:34.960 --> 01:37.920
maybe his lightning talk and other observations.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.440
In fact, we've got a mumble room full of people,

01:39.440 --> 01:42.020
so we'll see, perhaps they have some experiences as well.

01:42.020 --> 01:43.880
But later on in the show,

01:43.880 --> 01:46.120
something Wes and I've been wanting to do

01:46.120 --> 01:47.560
for a good long while now,

01:47.560 --> 01:49.440
but we've never really had the opportunity,

01:49.440 --> 01:52.280
just never really came up in the cycle of things

01:52.280 --> 01:53.680
until this week.

01:53.680 --> 01:58.680
PiHole, everyone's favorite network-wide ad blocker,

01:59.400 --> 02:03.600
has a big update, version 4.2 this week.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.720
So we're gonna kick the tires,

02:04.720 --> 02:06.320
give you a rundown of PiHole,

02:06.320 --> 02:08.440
how it works, what makes it tick,

02:08.440 --> 02:10.200
the open source projects it's using

02:10.200 --> 02:12.140
to accomplish what it does,

02:12.140 --> 02:14.640
and Wes's experiences giving it a go,

02:14.640 --> 02:15.720
and how you can also install it

02:15.720 --> 02:18.280
and other things besides the Raspberry Pi.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.100
And then we'll wrap it all up

02:20.100 --> 02:21.840
with another excellent pick, as we do.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.480
But before we go any further,

02:23.480 --> 02:24.940
you know what we gots to do.

02:24.940 --> 02:26.840
We gotta bring in that virtual lug time.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.160
Appropriate greetings.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.000
Hello.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.240
We have quite the show today,

02:32.240 --> 02:36.000
so it's appropriate that we have quite the showing.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
We have Brent, Bruce, Cubicle Nate,

02:38.000 --> 02:39.720
Dan Rabbit, Foursquare,

02:39.720 --> 02:41.960
Popey, Sean, Skull, TechMav,

02:41.960 --> 02:44.680
ThisGeekTweets, William on his iPhone XS Max,

02:44.680 --> 02:46.560
and Mr. Martin Wimpress,

02:46.560 --> 02:48.800
all joining us in our virtual lug today.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.000
We have the first study group after the show today,

02:52.000 --> 02:55.280
so stick around, guys, and learn some YAML.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.180
I think it's gonna be a great episode.

02:57.180 --> 02:59.500
Yeah, first you get to goof off with us here on Unplugged,

02:59.500 --> 03:02.120
and then we can get some serious studying done.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.560
I think it's gonna be good.

03:03.560 --> 03:04.400
I think it's gonna be good.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.020
I really do, because we've gotten a lot of interest.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.160
We set up a meetup.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.920
We got people voting on topics.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.920
I'm just gonna say I'm pretty excited, Wes.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.220
Pretty, pretty excited.

03:14.220 --> 03:18.080
Now, I'm in, I think it's like a desert, Palm Desert.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.760
I'm in some desert area in California.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.800
It's like, yeah, it's like Palm Desert.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.560
And you are up at the studio

03:24.560 --> 03:27.440
where we are both in very different weather conditions.

03:27.440 --> 03:32.220
So if you hear a bunch of crazy sounds in my background,

03:32.220 --> 03:34.440
it's not me like throwing things at the dog or wife.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.320
It is a big windstorm,

03:37.320 --> 03:41.400
like 40, 50, 65 mile per hour winds

03:41.400 --> 03:43.720
that are coming at us in three different directions.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.300
We're like in the center of this valley

03:45.300 --> 03:47.960
where all this wind is being funneled in

03:47.960 --> 03:51.900
from the polar vortex, and it's just, it's what it is.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.780
It's gonna be in the background a little bit this week.

03:53.780 --> 03:55.680
Not ideal podcasting weather.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.280
It turns out that is a thing.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.720
Yeah, but I mean, thankfully,

03:59.720 --> 04:01.880
now that Joe is our full-time editor,

04:01.880 --> 04:03.840
anything that sounds weird, you can just blame on Joe.

04:03.840 --> 04:04.680
It's not my fault.

04:04.680 --> 04:05.840
You know, it's not my fault.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.320
He must've just missed it in the edit.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.940
Fix everything in post.

04:08.940 --> 04:10.560
How are you and how are the doggies holding up

04:10.560 --> 04:12.920
in the snow there you have in the Pacific Northwest?

04:12.920 --> 04:13.920
Oh, they're having a great time.

04:13.920 --> 04:14.740
Actually, they really like the snow.

04:14.740 --> 04:15.580
Do they love it?

04:15.580 --> 04:18.080
We went on a big hike on Sunday,

04:18.080 --> 04:19.800
and it was just as the snow was starting to hit.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.180
So we left, trail was clear,

04:21.180 --> 04:23.360
just a nice kind of soggy Pacific Northwest day

04:23.360 --> 04:25.120
by the time we got back covered in snow.

04:25.120 --> 04:28.780
Oh man, dogs playing in the snow, along with kids,

04:28.780 --> 04:30.200
one of the most adorable things ever.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.520
And they get so tired, right?

04:31.520 --> 04:32.560
And then they just take naps later.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.820
It's great, you can get some work done.

04:33.820 --> 04:36.020
It's the best, it is the best.

04:36.020 --> 04:37.240
All right, well, we gotta start the show out

04:37.240 --> 04:38.760
with the breaking news this week.

04:38.760 --> 04:42.440
This is CNN Breaking News.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.460
That's right, right here on the show,

04:44.460 --> 04:46.640
developing as we record,

04:47.600 --> 04:51.900
the plus is being dropped from GTK.

04:51.900 --> 04:52.740
What do you think of this, Wes?

04:52.740 --> 04:54.660
Beg your first, what are you learning now, Wes,

04:54.660 --> 04:55.920
while you're on the scene?

04:55.920 --> 04:59.380
Well, there's kind of a gnarly little commit diff here,

04:59.380 --> 05:01.280
mostly because you have to rebalance

05:01.280 --> 05:02.600
all the careful equal signs

05:02.600 --> 05:05.320
you've placed underneath the titles.

05:05.320 --> 05:08.060
Yeah, yeah, this commit is great

05:08.060 --> 05:10.160
because it's basically the same thing

05:10.160 --> 05:11.760
that's always been there,

05:11.760 --> 05:13.580
but it's just everything without the plus.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.440
So they've removed the plus from everything

05:15.440 --> 05:17.660
and it's a pretty huge commit.

05:18.640 --> 05:21.480
And can I just be the first to say, congratulations?

05:22.720 --> 05:27.720
Congratulations to the GTK team for making this move.

05:27.920 --> 05:31.160
It is high time that the plus dies.

05:31.160 --> 05:34.080
It goes away, it needs to be done.

05:34.080 --> 05:37.320
I find it offensive, I find it revolting,

05:37.320 --> 05:39.040
and I am happy to see it go.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.280
I think this is a move for the user.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.960
This is a move for usability.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.440
And clearly now we should all switch

05:44.440 --> 05:46.200
to Gnome and the GTK stack.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.080
Your thoughts?

05:47.080 --> 05:49.720
It's nice to see them taking things so seriously.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.920
I actually do, I am somewhat serious about that though.

05:52.920 --> 05:57.800
Like I do think it is a much more user-friendly facing look.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.120
I know it's a weird thing to comment on,

05:59.120 --> 06:01.560
but it makes it, when it's GTK+,

06:01.560 --> 06:02.640
I don't know, it's just something about it.

06:02.640 --> 06:03.840
It's a little more techy.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.120
It's sort of like, what does the plus mean?

06:05.120 --> 06:06.520
What's happening here?

06:06.520 --> 06:08.640
GTK at least is some sort of just like

06:08.640 --> 06:10.600
a normal three-letter acronym.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.280
And our lives will never be the same.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.080
Everything has changed.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.600
The story continues to develop.

06:15.600 --> 06:20.280
So you're pleased to see the plus go away from GTK, right?

06:20.280 --> 06:21.120
Oh, I hated it.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.760
I just thought, I was so bothered by the plus, you know?

06:24.760 --> 06:28.320
Okay, what's your opinion on Pop OS?

06:28.320 --> 06:32.720
Wait, is it, wait, the inter-capping,

06:32.720 --> 06:36.200
the underscore or the exclamation mark, which part of it?

06:36.200 --> 06:37.520
Sorry, I wasn't clear.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.440
What's your opinion on Pop OS?

06:39.440 --> 06:42.760
I just wish they'd change it to a dash

06:42.760 --> 06:44.640
instead of an underscore, and then I'd be fine.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.480
That's the thing.

06:45.480 --> 06:46.480
You see, the underscore is part

06:46.480 --> 06:48.120
of the overall brand strategy.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.920
You see, the underscore is representative

06:49.920 --> 06:51.160
of the System76 name,

06:51.160 --> 06:53.360
and they like to have that underscore throughout.

06:53.360 --> 06:54.400
So it's not going away.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.360
It's not going away.

06:55.360 --> 06:58.280
And I think my thoughts on that are clear, actually.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.480
Now, there's everybody's favorite media player,

07:03.480 --> 07:04.920
although I happen to love MPV,

07:04.920 --> 07:07.440
but I did have love for many years for VLC.

07:07.440 --> 07:11.080
Now it's like, we're still, we're still on good terms.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.440
I still haven't installed on my machine,

07:12.440 --> 07:15.120
but it's not my default media player.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.600
Maybe that'll change, though.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.880
If this is coming out of FOSDEM this week,

07:18.880 --> 07:20.360
we'll be talking more about FOSDEM in a moment,

07:20.360 --> 07:24.320
but the lead developer, Jean-Baptiste,

07:24.320 --> 07:29.320
has announced some solid details around version 4.0,

07:29.720 --> 07:34.720
which, among many things, will be sporting a new playlist,

07:34.720 --> 07:38.760
redone user interfaces, a new video output architecture,

07:38.760 --> 07:40.760
which supports VR.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.600
Thank you.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.160
I'm sure Wimpy's been waiting for that.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.200
And the removal of some old platforms.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.240
Oh, yeah, that includes stuff in there,

07:48.240 --> 07:49.800
like 360 degree video,

07:49.800 --> 07:53.560
which I'm sure you're all using 3D audio to go along,

07:53.560 --> 07:55.760
support for the desktop VR head-mounted display,

07:55.760 --> 07:58.440
so stuff like the HTC Vive and Oculus,

07:58.440 --> 08:00.320
and just a whole bunch of stuff for various things,

08:00.320 --> 08:02.080
like better HDR support.

08:02.080 --> 08:02.920
Yeah.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.960
I mean, that I actually kind of think is pretty great,

08:05.960 --> 08:09.000
but probably the most user-facing change

08:09.000 --> 08:11.360
is the new interface.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.760
There will be GNOME and KDE adaptations of it,

08:13.760 --> 08:16.040
but my understanding is this new user interface

08:16.040 --> 08:20.320
is using QML, and it looks very clean.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.160
It looks a lot, actually, like GNOME MPV in some regards.

08:23.160 --> 08:26.520
It's got a transparent play bar down at the bottom.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.000
The playlist looks different.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.760
It's an overlay that you can see through it,

08:30.760 --> 08:35.760
and along with all of the standard GTK and Qt versions,

08:35.960 --> 08:39.640
they'll also make sure it works with client-side decorations,

08:39.640 --> 08:44.640
server-side decorations, Wayland, and X11 as well.

08:44.840 --> 08:48.200
So when you think about what it takes now

08:48.200 --> 08:53.200
to be a full-class, full-fledged desktop Linux application,

08:55.280 --> 08:56.560
this is kind of insane.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.520
You gotta have a Qt version, a GTK version,

08:59.520 --> 09:01.800
an X version, and a Wayland version.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.880
You gotta support server-side decorations

09:03.880 --> 09:05.520
and client-side decorations.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.160
Now, you don't have to,

09:07.160 --> 09:10.280
but every time you don't support one of those,

09:10.280 --> 09:13.480
somebody on one of the distros on one Linux desktop

09:13.480 --> 09:14.880
is gonna be making a compromise.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.480
Oh, yeah, see, I was just thinking to myself there,

09:16.480 --> 09:18.520
like, it's like they're really taking this seriously.

09:18.520 --> 09:19.960
Doesn't the show, like, the project's doing,

09:19.960 --> 09:21.760
must be doing pretty great if they're doing all these things,

09:21.760 --> 09:23.560
but yeah, the flip side is exactly what you're saying.

09:23.560 --> 09:24.800
That's a lot to do.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.320
It is a lot to do.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.720
And, Poppy, I'm wondering, do you think I'm exaggerating

09:28.720 --> 09:31.120
what it takes to be a full-fledged Linux desktop,

09:31.120 --> 09:32.520
or do you think that's the reality of it right now

09:32.520 --> 09:34.040
if you wanna support all that stuff?

09:34.040 --> 09:36.760
I think VLC's in a very particular position

09:36.760 --> 09:38.560
in that they're used everywhere.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.400
It's used on Mac and Windows

09:41.400 --> 09:43.560
and every single Linux distribution,

09:43.560 --> 09:47.960
and they have a lot of work to make it look good

09:47.960 --> 09:50.120
and consistent across all of those platforms,

09:50.120 --> 09:51.600
and I think they do a great job.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.200
I'm also interested to point out

09:55.200 --> 09:57.640
that you can, of course, track VLC

09:57.640 --> 09:59.480
from the Edge channel in the Snap Store,

09:59.480 --> 10:02.000
and you'll get daily builds of version four,

10:02.000 --> 10:03.080
so when this stuff lands,

10:03.080 --> 10:05.600
you'll get it right on your desktop

10:05.600 --> 10:07.080
directly from the developers.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.560
There it is.

10:08.560 --> 10:09.400
There it is.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.560
That's some good sauce.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.480
So, Dan, what are your thoughts on something like this?

10:12.480 --> 10:13.680
I think this is the problem,

10:13.680 --> 10:17.120
and I honestly think this is something

10:17.120 --> 10:19.560
that elementary OS could aim to solve.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.400
If you really wanna be a full-fledged

10:21.400 --> 10:23.440
Linux desktop application,

10:23.440 --> 10:26.000
there's so many different camps

10:26.000 --> 10:27.680
you need to make sure you make happy.

10:27.680 --> 10:32.360
Qt, GTK, client-side, server-side, Wayland, X11,

10:32.360 --> 10:33.960
and that's not even getting into the actual look

10:33.960 --> 10:35.560
and design of the application.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.760
You know, I remember a long time ago

10:37.760 --> 10:41.440
having a conversation with the CEO over at Yorba

10:41.440 --> 10:43.520
and telling him, you know, this is the future

10:43.520 --> 10:48.360
that the quote-unquote Linux desktop is going toward.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.120
It's not a unified thing.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.200
Like, the Linux desktop is not a platform.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.400
The Linux is a kernel,

10:53.400 --> 10:55.720
and there are so many different desktops.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.680
I think that as application developers,

10:57.680 --> 10:59.080
you should pick a camp,

10:59.080 --> 11:02.120
and cross-platform development is super expensive,

11:02.120 --> 11:03.960
super difficult to do right,

11:03.960 --> 11:06.360
and for most application developers, it's not worth it.

11:06.360 --> 11:07.880
Just write for the distro you use

11:07.880 --> 11:10.600
and be happy that you have a set of users

11:10.600 --> 11:12.680
that like the thing that you made.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.240
Yeah, I feel like what's gonna happen

11:16.240 --> 11:18.360
is developers will look at all the options

11:18.360 --> 11:21.480
and go, eeny, meeny, miny, electron,

11:21.480 --> 11:23.040
and they'll just ship everything with electron.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.440
It'll be like, all right, good enough.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.400
Everybody's happy.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.440
The right answer.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.360
Jesus.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.680
Actually, it's interesting you should say that.

11:30.680 --> 11:31.920
I know we'll come to FOSDEM later,

11:31.920 --> 11:33.360
but there was an interesting talk

11:33.360 --> 11:36.600
about using Go and HTML

11:37.520 --> 11:40.440
to build lean desktop applications

11:40.440 --> 11:42.400
rather than, it was a counterpoint

11:42.400 --> 11:44.000
to big fat electron apps,

11:44.000 --> 11:45.440
and they were talking about how you can use Go

11:45.440 --> 11:48.200
as your runtime and HTML for rendering,

11:48.200 --> 11:51.760
and so there are people exploring different ways

11:51.760 --> 11:55.320
to make cross-platform applications that are not electron.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.120
Oh, give it a couple of years, Go,

11:57.120 --> 12:00.040
plus FFmpeg, plus another interpreted language,

12:00.040 --> 12:00.880
plus a toolkit.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.960
It'll be as fat as mustard before too long.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.160
Yeah, I mean, that's where you get, eventually,

12:05.160 --> 12:07.120
when you want all of the things.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.080
Yeah, hmm.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.400
Well, that does sound promising.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.720
I mean, I think the idea is obviously proven out,

12:12.720 --> 12:15.400
and so now how do we make it as palatable as possible

12:15.400 --> 12:16.840
becomes the next challenge,

12:16.840 --> 12:18.480
and hopefully they can figure it out.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.400
But the thing I didn't hear in all of that was Rust,

12:20.400 --> 12:22.320
so not really convinced.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.520
I've seen Rust on the desktop, a desktop.

12:25.520 --> 12:26.360
Oh yeah?

12:26.360 --> 12:27.520
It was something on Gnome, or?

12:27.520 --> 12:29.320
No, it's Pop OS again.

12:29.320 --> 12:30.160
Oh, okay.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.440
Good, right.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.800
They're trailblazing with the stylized name

12:34.800 --> 12:36.800
and the use of Rust and everything.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.360
That's true, they are.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.920
In fact, there's some Rust fans there at that System76.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.600
That's a good point.

12:42.600 --> 12:46.240
Now, the Gnome shell on the other side of the,

12:46.240 --> 12:47.320
I don't know, on the other side of what,

12:47.320 --> 12:48.640
I guess, I felt like, oh yeah,

12:48.640 --> 12:50.640
because we're talking QML.

12:50.640 --> 12:54.560
There's a lot of good performance fixes coming to Gnome.

12:54.560 --> 12:58.400
The work around Mudder has seen a lot of bug fixes

12:58.400 --> 12:59.880
and performance fixes.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.000
There's different camps involved.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.040
Obviously, canonicals help tackle stutter,

13:04.040 --> 13:06.840
latency, CPU issues within Gnome shell.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.320
That's been, we've seen that trickling in

13:08.320 --> 13:10.080
over the last couple of months,

13:10.080 --> 13:15.080
and I got a hands-on experience with it on Ubuntu 19.04,

13:16.560 --> 13:20.400
and I noticed I actually just could proceed with it.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.960
It is a perceivable performance improvement.

13:22.960 --> 13:23.800
That's the kind of, I mean,

13:23.800 --> 13:25.760
that's the level we're talking about here.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.720
When you can start to perceive it,

13:27.720 --> 13:30.840
that means a lot of things have had to go into that

13:30.840 --> 13:31.880
to actually make that.

13:31.880 --> 13:32.880
Does it also mean, though,

13:32.880 --> 13:35.680
that they kind of needed that sizable of a change?

13:35.680 --> 13:38.360
Ah, yeah.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.120
Yeah, maybe somebody can talk me out of this funk,

13:40.120 --> 13:42.120
but I look at this and I think,

13:42.120 --> 13:44.640
A, very appreciative of this work.

13:44.640 --> 13:48.080
They're doing the people's work here with this stuff.

13:48.080 --> 13:51.600
There's also a developer over at Endless recently

13:51.600 --> 13:54.800
that submitted some performance fixes upstream.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.960
There's multiple camps now doing the people's work,

13:57.960 --> 14:00.400
but it's still really not there,

14:00.400 --> 14:03.000
and the fundamental issue is still that architecture

14:03.000 --> 14:06.480
where it's a lot of things riding on a single process,

14:06.480 --> 14:08.640
from mutter to extensions.

14:08.640 --> 14:12.320
It's just an architecture issue,

14:12.320 --> 14:16.000
and it is definitely appreciated that it is faster

14:16.000 --> 14:18.560
and that it is a better end user experience,

14:18.560 --> 14:22.160
and I'll take that, and I will happily use that,

14:22.160 --> 14:24.960
but I can't help but have this sinking feeling

14:24.960 --> 14:26.280
in the back of my head.

14:26.280 --> 14:30.560
It's still not a workstation-grade desktop.

14:30.560 --> 14:33.520
It still feels very consumer.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.040
I don't know what the right word I'm looking for there,

14:35.040 --> 14:37.520
because I wouldn't even say consumer.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.720
If the architecture is fundamentally busted,

14:40.720 --> 14:41.680
what does it really matter

14:41.680 --> 14:44.760
if it's getting near 60 frames per second animation?

14:44.760 --> 14:47.440
I mean, it matters, but it's kind of like saying

14:47.440 --> 14:50.120
that you have really great appliances,

14:50.120 --> 14:52.600
and you redid your kitchen counters and cabinetry

14:52.600 --> 14:55.680
in your home, but your foundation is crumbling.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.480
I mean, I guess it depends on who it matters for,

14:58.480 --> 15:02.080
and I guess it seems like it has bad foundations to us now,

15:02.080 --> 15:04.320
but at one time, it was probably fine.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.120
I mean, we were just kind of talking the other day

15:06.120 --> 15:09.440
about how just running on a laptop, GNOME does pretty well,

15:09.440 --> 15:11.400
and honestly, on my ThinkPad,

15:11.400 --> 15:13.800
I've had way more plasma desktop crashes

15:13.800 --> 15:15.480
than I have GNOME crashes.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.320
Oh, really?

15:16.320 --> 15:17.760
Yeah, oh yeah, I mean, not major crashes,

15:17.760 --> 15:19.840
but just this morning, I was working on show prep,

15:19.840 --> 15:22.480
and all the title bars disappeared, and I couldn't Alt-Tab.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.720
I couldn't change which window was selected anymore,

15:24.720 --> 15:27.000
and I just had to log out and log back in.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.760
Your server-side decorations died.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.880
It just, yeah, totally gone, yeah.

15:30.880 --> 15:34.000
Whereas with GNOME, by and large, it kind of just worked,

15:34.000 --> 15:34.840
but you're right.

15:34.840 --> 15:38.160
It obviously is running into limitations of its design now,

15:38.160 --> 15:39.600
but maybe it worked for a while,

15:39.600 --> 15:40.840
and it's also probably difficult, too,

15:40.840 --> 15:43.920
because I think we ended up using the older versions of GNOME

15:43.920 --> 15:45.680
in workstation-type things.

15:45.680 --> 15:46.840
It had been really proved out.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.520
It would kind of fit in that space,

15:48.520 --> 15:51.400
and obviously, GNOME's kind of targeting something else now.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.080
I think you're being a little unfair.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.880
There are millions of people right now using GNOME

15:55.880 --> 15:58.440
as their workstation platform.

15:58.440 --> 16:02.400
They're running it for either gaming for consumers,

16:02.400 --> 16:06.280
but also tons of developers have developer-oriented things,

16:06.280 --> 16:11.280
IDEs, Android Studio, Atom, VS Code,

16:11.640 --> 16:13.640
all these kind of applications they're using

16:13.640 --> 16:16.640
on a daily basis to do development on a Linux desktop.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.640
They might not be developing for a Linux desktop.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.280
They might be developing Java business applications,

16:21.280 --> 16:22.960
or they might be developing Android apps,

16:22.960 --> 16:27.120
but there definitely are many, many people using

16:27.120 --> 16:30.440
GNOME Desktop as a workstation machine on a daily basis,

16:30.440 --> 16:32.240
and they get on just fine.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.480
Yeah, I think I have to acknowledge that that's fact,

16:34.480 --> 16:36.520
so there's no getting around that.

16:37.520 --> 16:41.440
It's sort of one of those confidence issues.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.680
It'd be just like if I had a beautiful car,

16:43.680 --> 16:44.600
you open up the hood,

16:44.600 --> 16:47.680
and it was just a mess underneath the hood.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.960
It would betray my confidence in that vehicle

16:49.960 --> 16:52.120
to really carry me the distance.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.600
You probably have other objectives too, right?

16:54.600 --> 16:55.840
Like you don't really care, for instance,

16:55.840 --> 16:58.320
if like the swarm animation got a little more fluid.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.320
You want a desktop that you know is rock solid,

17:00.320 --> 17:02.360
won't crash, and won't ever lose your work.

17:02.360 --> 17:05.160
I've had so few crashes in GNOME Shell.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.720
Like I am the epitome of that person

17:07.720 --> 17:09.400
who leaves their machine on all the time,

17:09.400 --> 17:11.120
like days and days and days and days and days.

17:11.120 --> 17:14.080
I have very long uptime on my GNOME Shell desktop

17:14.080 --> 17:17.480
with multiple screens with very long running applications

17:17.480 --> 17:19.840
that eat tons and tons of memory,

17:19.840 --> 17:23.640
and I almost never restart GNOME Shell,

17:23.640 --> 17:26.120
almost never log out, almost never reboot,

17:26.120 --> 17:29.600
and I cannot remember the last crash that I had.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.400
The most annoying things I have

17:31.400 --> 17:34.640
are actually things to do with the things beneath that,

17:34.640 --> 17:36.360
like the NVIDIA driver.

17:36.360 --> 17:39.120
Like Ubuntu, not Ubuntu, GNOME itself,

17:40.280 --> 17:42.640
it's actually more rock solid now

17:42.640 --> 17:44.240
than I've ever seen it before.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.200
Huh, okay.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.960
You know, you're making me wanna stick with it even more,

17:49.960 --> 17:51.840
which really gets under my skin

17:51.840 --> 17:54.160
because that's gonna make Westpain's prediction,

17:54.160 --> 17:56.480
it's gonna, I mean, I think I still have like a month

17:56.480 --> 17:59.040
to like, to get out of this,

17:59.040 --> 18:02.560
but it's not trending in the right direction.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.720
I have been really impressed.

18:04.720 --> 18:06.200
Now, I haven't gone all cray-cray

18:06.200 --> 18:08.800
with like external video cards and multiple monitors

18:08.800 --> 18:09.640
and stuff like that.

18:09.640 --> 18:10.920
The real pressure test, right?

18:10.920 --> 18:11.760
Right, that's what,

18:11.760 --> 18:14.520
that was where my love affair with plasma started.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.720
It's not that I don't like it still,

18:15.720 --> 18:19.680
it's just that I started to hit up against a set of cracks

18:19.680 --> 18:22.080
that I hadn't encountered before.

18:22.080 --> 18:27.080
And that, so far, I have not fully, fully tested.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.120
I've done a brief test where I hooked up to all the screens

18:30.120 --> 18:31.680
and things seemed like they were working well

18:31.680 --> 18:32.520
and I went, okay, cool.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.840
And I, you know, three hours later, I was done.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.300
Like, but I need to spend days with it still.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.560
So I have a feeling that's gonna happen.

18:39.560 --> 18:44.560
I should write a book about the perpetual distro hopper

18:46.600 --> 18:47.520
and desktop hopper

18:47.520 --> 18:49.480
because I've been doing this now since the 90s

18:49.480 --> 18:51.600
and I don't, I don't know.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.040
I mean, I'm pretty much sticking

18:53.040 --> 18:54.480
with the Ubuntu base these days.

18:54.480 --> 18:57.640
You know, I've slowed down my base hopping

18:57.640 --> 18:59.520
where I was on Arch for a while

18:59.520 --> 19:01.680
and then I came back to Ubuntu.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.280
And like, if I ever jumped again,

19:03.280 --> 19:04.120
it might, you know,

19:04.120 --> 19:05.560
like say like something like Debian or something,

19:05.560 --> 19:07.220
I feel like it would be a good five-year run.

19:07.220 --> 19:09.760
Like I'm slowing down the base,

19:09.760 --> 19:13.560
but the desktops, I'm still at like a six to nine month clip.

19:13.560 --> 19:15.680
How long have we been on plasma, Wes?

19:15.680 --> 19:18.720
I guess it's been since Linux Fest last year.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.320
So it's almost been a year that I made it for plasma.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.800
Now you do seem tempted every now and again

19:23.800 --> 19:26.720
when we review a particularly good Fedora workstation,

19:26.720 --> 19:27.560
I will say.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.080
I think it's been longer than a year

19:29.080 --> 19:33.600
because we were with you in Seattle this time last year

19:33.600 --> 19:35.060
when you did the plasma challenge

19:35.060 --> 19:36.560
and that's when Papi switched.

19:36.560 --> 19:37.400
Right.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.480
Yeah, that's when I did it on the plane

19:38.480 --> 19:41.400
and I still have that same install.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.420
Okay. Okay.

19:42.420 --> 19:44.200
So that is a pretty good run for me.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.960
That's a pretty good run actually.

19:46.840 --> 19:48.560
So I don't have to really beat up on myself

19:48.560 --> 19:49.480
for trying out Gnome again

19:49.480 --> 19:50.960
because that would be a reasonable thing to do

19:50.960 --> 19:53.400
after a period of time is to try out Gnome again

19:53.400 --> 19:54.280
and see if it.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.120
And there it is.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.960
There's the personal acceptance

19:56.960 --> 19:59.040
and where's your protection is about to come true.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.960
Yeah, there's the self-justification.

20:00.960 --> 20:01.800
Job done.

20:01.800 --> 20:02.620
Thank you, gentlemen.

20:02.620 --> 20:03.920
All right.

20:03.920 --> 20:06.060
Well, we've got to talk Bitcoin.

20:09.020 --> 20:10.400
Oh no, please no.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.240
Yeah.

20:11.240 --> 20:14.520
Just, you know, I don't know what you guys make of this.

20:14.520 --> 20:15.600
Is it done now?

20:15.600 --> 20:18.320
So it's around 3,400 US greenbacks

20:18.320 --> 20:20.680
is the average price of Bitcoin.

20:20.680 --> 20:23.920
But if you look at the trading volumes on cryptocurrency

20:23.920 --> 20:27.480
exchanges, they've dipped to new lows in January,

20:27.480 --> 20:31.560
according to an analysis that was published on the 4th.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.320
So that would be yesterday.

20:33.320 --> 20:34.460
Since the beginning of the year,

20:34.460 --> 20:36.920
the digital currency exchanges have reportedly registered

20:36.920 --> 20:40.340
lower trading volumes, marking new lows

20:40.340 --> 20:43.920
that have not been recorded since 2017.

20:43.920 --> 20:47.040
Since 2017 is kind of forever in the Bitcoin world.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.860
That has been a long, long time.

20:49.860 --> 20:51.440
Can I just say I enjoy not having

20:51.440 --> 20:52.600
to talk about it all the time?

20:52.600 --> 20:53.820
That has been nice.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.200
Yeah, you're right.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.680
Coinbase also chimed in and says they're experiencing lows

20:58.680 --> 21:01.200
which they haven't seen since May of 2017.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.800
So what does that tell us?

21:04.800 --> 21:07.320
Is the cryptocurrency hype dead

21:07.320 --> 21:11.240
and we're just seeing like the base market at play here now?

21:11.240 --> 21:14.600
Or is the whole idea kind of over?

21:14.600 --> 21:16.840
I think the more interesting metric

21:16.840 --> 21:21.840
is the cost of Ethereum over the last say 14 months.

21:23.720 --> 21:27.000
Because when the whole crypto boom happened

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
and people were off buying GPUs

21:30.000 --> 21:31.200
like they were going out of fashion

21:31.200 --> 21:33.460
and driving up the cost of GPUs,

21:33.460 --> 21:35.480
they were mining Ethereum in order

21:35.480 --> 21:38.000
to turn Ethereum into Bitcoin ultimately,

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
because you can still mine Ethereum on not ASICs.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.360
And that's dropped in price from about $1,400

21:47.360 --> 21:50.200
to a touch over $100 in the same period.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.160
I wonder, so this Geek Tweets,

21:52.160 --> 21:54.560
do you think if we had a killer app all of a sudden

21:54.560 --> 21:57.480
spring up that used Bitcoin, it'd be better off?

21:57.480 --> 21:59.720
You think the issue is that there just isn't really

21:59.720 --> 22:03.600
any sign of a resurgence coming to Bitcoin's aid here?

22:03.600 --> 22:06.960
I don't think there is in terms of financial transactions,

22:06.960 --> 22:10.360
but if there is an application for it then potentially,

22:10.360 --> 22:13.240
but I don't really see one at the moment.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.520
It worked well for me like doing

22:14.520 --> 22:16.100
some actual financial transactions

22:16.100 --> 22:19.360
way back when it was like $200 a coin.

22:19.360 --> 22:20.640
And you know, maybe it was like fast enough

22:20.640 --> 22:21.480
you could get through.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.760
I paid for some like seed boxes and stuff with it

22:23.760 --> 22:24.800
and that was fine.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.240
But these days there's just,

22:26.240 --> 22:28.280
other payment methods have gotten better.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.440
Credit card processing is a little faster.

22:30.440 --> 22:33.520
It's hard to say that there is a killer app out there

22:33.520 --> 22:35.840
besides all the other sort of like distributed

22:35.840 --> 22:37.920
ledger research the bigger companies are doing.

22:37.920 --> 22:41.160
But yeah, I think it's in part that the cost

22:41.160 --> 22:45.440
to get your Bitcoin transaction approved fast

22:45.440 --> 22:48.280
got kind of high as the network got really busy.

22:48.280 --> 22:50.920
But also there's like a dozen different ways now

22:50.920 --> 22:54.280
to easily send cash directly between people,

22:54.280 --> 22:55.120
at least here in the States.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.080
And I think it's even better in some countries

22:57.080 --> 22:58.420
outside the States.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.200
Like for example, the cash application

23:00.200 --> 23:02.680
or Google Pay or Apple Pay,

23:02.680 --> 23:05.680
make it very simple now to just use a messaging system

23:05.680 --> 23:07.700
and send somebody some money.

23:07.700 --> 23:10.960
And that direct person to person transfer,

23:10.960 --> 23:13.000
which is behind the scenes,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.760
really probably ACH transfers between banks

23:15.760 --> 23:17.320
and all kinds of complicated things.

23:17.320 --> 23:20.080
Complicated fronting to make it seem like it shows up.

23:20.080 --> 23:20.920
Right.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.480
That's gotta be happening,

23:22.480 --> 23:24.780
which isn't necessary with Bitcoin.

23:24.780 --> 23:27.880
But the banks are willing to operate at that risk level

23:27.880 --> 23:30.440
and they're willing to do all the behind the scenes work

23:30.440 --> 23:32.000
to make it seem very seamless.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.360
From our perspective with using the cash app,

23:35.360 --> 23:37.280
I could send a hundred bucks to Hadia

23:37.280 --> 23:40.840
in two minutes and she could transfer to her account

23:40.840 --> 23:41.840
in two minutes after that.

23:41.840 --> 23:45.740
And it's essentially as good as using Bitcoin

23:45.740 --> 23:46.880
in that regard.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.440
So you have that downward pressure for consumers,

23:49.440 --> 23:53.120
plus you have the challenges they hit as the network grew,

23:53.120 --> 23:55.200
and then some of the challenges they continue to have

23:55.200 --> 23:58.600
just as the cryptocurrency market matures.

23:58.600 --> 24:02.080
And it really kind of just comes down to your perspective.

24:02.080 --> 24:05.080
If you bought into Bitcoin when it was $11,

24:05.080 --> 24:08.720
when I came to Bitcoin, it was between $2 and $11.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.360
And that's when we started covering it

24:10.360 --> 24:11.560
on the TechSnap program.

24:12.620 --> 24:15.240
And so if you bought in at $11,

24:15.240 --> 24:18.840
then $3,400 is still a pretty fantastic return.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.900
It's not $21,000, but it's still pretty fantastic.

24:21.900 --> 24:24.560
Yeah, the last time I actually paid for Bitcoin,

24:24.560 --> 24:28.160
like bought Bitcoin, I was paying $100 a coin.

24:28.160 --> 24:33.060
So even that is a good return on today's prices.

24:33.060 --> 24:34.880
But I don't think it's gonna last for much longer.

24:34.880 --> 24:38.020
I think it's on the edge of capitulating completely.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.260
Well, Skoll Leader, what do you think?

24:41.260 --> 24:42.960
Maybe the currency goes away,

24:42.960 --> 24:45.480
but the blockchain technology sticks around?

24:45.480 --> 24:49.440
Yeah, I think that most businesses are looking at blockchain,

24:49.440 --> 24:53.440
especially with IoT, as a method of exchange.

24:53.440 --> 24:55.320
And I think that's what's going to stay.

24:55.320 --> 24:58.280
I think Bitcoin is a store of value.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.800
It's just, it's untenable.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.080
The higher it got, the more transactions cost,

25:03.080 --> 25:04.480
the longer it took.

25:04.480 --> 25:08.760
But blockchain is for doing transaction.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.560
I think that's where it's going to be.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.040
Yeah, I could definitely see that.

25:12.040 --> 25:15.080
I think that I could see all kinds of different uses

25:15.080 --> 25:18.140
for business for the blockchain and forks of it,

25:18.140 --> 25:20.240
essentially, it'll be blockchain technology

25:20.240 --> 25:21.760
with their own twist on it.

25:21.760 --> 25:24.000
Yeah, smart contracts, as you're pointing out, Poppy,

25:24.000 --> 25:25.260
I could clearly see that.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.320
Or just between companies

25:27.320 --> 25:28.500
that don't necessarily trust each other.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.040
There's a lot of value in being able to have a document

25:31.040 --> 25:32.800
that they can rely on.

25:32.800 --> 25:36.200
It almost writes its own checks in that case,

25:36.200 --> 25:37.440
at least I think.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.440
So, Dan, I was thinking about it in the context

25:39.440 --> 25:41.440
of taking online payments.

25:41.440 --> 25:45.040
To me, I always thought the ideal situation would be

25:45.040 --> 25:46.640
is if Bitcoin was a successful,

25:48.000 --> 25:49.520
not only just a transfer mechanism,

25:49.520 --> 25:50.680
is what I was going to call it,

25:50.680 --> 25:53.600
but also if it was a stable store of value.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.720
So say it was pegged at $100 US,

25:56.720 --> 25:58.520
and it was that way for five years,

25:58.520 --> 26:02.760
and you knew for five years, one Bitcoin was $100.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.640
I actually thought this would be the perfect way

26:04.640 --> 26:07.560
for open source projects to take in donations

26:07.560 --> 26:08.600
from different currencies,

26:08.600 --> 26:10.880
convert it to one common currency,

26:10.880 --> 26:12.600
and then cash it out in whatever country they're at.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.800
And same with things like app stores.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.740
Do you think that's a legitimate use

26:16.740 --> 26:17.960
for something like a cryptocurrency,

26:17.960 --> 26:20.480
assuming some of those things are standardized

26:20.480 --> 26:21.340
and normalized?

26:21.340 --> 26:23.280
I think some of the big problems we have

26:23.280 --> 26:27.960
is just not technology, but it's also on the legal side.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.560
And so something that we get from a payment processor

26:30.560 --> 26:33.760
like Stripe isn't just the ability to process credit cards,

26:33.760 --> 26:35.480
but they also keep track of things like

26:35.480 --> 26:37.560
which countries are on the US sanctions list

26:37.560 --> 26:39.220
that we're not allowed to do business with,

26:39.220 --> 26:41.720
when the government's going to come after us.

26:41.720 --> 26:44.640
So it's stuff that we have to be really careful with

26:44.640 --> 26:45.560
on the legal side,

26:45.560 --> 26:47.440
and just solving the technology piece

26:47.440 --> 26:50.880
doesn't really help us as a business stay

26:50.880 --> 26:54.280
in the kind of legal area we need to be in.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.200
Right, fair enough.

26:55.200 --> 26:58.440
And when you have things like GDPR and other countries

26:58.440 --> 27:02.280
that are thinking about adopting policies like GDPR,

27:02.280 --> 27:04.680
it's nice to know that there's companies

27:04.680 --> 27:08.160
whose business it is, is to navigate that kind of thing

27:08.160 --> 27:10.840
and make sure that you're not going to get in trouble.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.400
Makes sense, because that's not your core competency.

27:13.400 --> 27:16.200
You've got a distribution to build, you know?

27:16.200 --> 27:17.420
And we don't want to be lawyers.

27:17.420 --> 27:18.960
We don't want to have a big legal team

27:18.960 --> 27:20.120
and do all these kind of things.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.240
So it is really nice to offload that off

27:22.240 --> 27:25.680
onto another team that does want to be in that business.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.360
And it keeps us writing software

27:27.360 --> 27:29.280
instead of doing all these other things.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.360
Right, fair enough.

27:30.360 --> 27:33.640
Well, so you've got to imagine it's things like that

27:33.640 --> 27:35.720
and a million others that are applying downward pressure.

27:35.720 --> 27:38.520
And we just have to wait and see where things fall.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.600
I think ultimately there's a use for the technology.

27:41.600 --> 27:44.320
I think the current price even is ridiculous.

27:44.320 --> 27:47.280
And maybe that's because I've been coming in forever now.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.880
And so I've seen it when it was very cheap,

27:48.880 --> 27:53.160
but to me, really a ridiculous price right now.

27:53.160 --> 27:56.600
And I could see it falling much, much further.

27:56.600 --> 27:59.480
But even if Bitcoins were only worth a few dollars

27:59.480 --> 28:02.560
or a hundred dollars, there's still a market for them.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.000
Some of it's illegal, but there's still a market for them.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.600
And so I don't think they're going away completely.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.480
I want to do a FOSDM check-in

28:09.480 --> 28:10.680
and we got to talk about Pi-Hole.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.080
So let's do a moment of housekeeping first,

28:13.080 --> 28:15.340
just here about midway through the show.

28:15.340 --> 28:16.560
This is a tricky one.

28:16.560 --> 28:19.060
I've never really done this on air before.

28:19.060 --> 28:21.400
Ooh, a big wind, big winds are hitting me right now.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.860
I've never done this on air before,

28:22.860 --> 28:26.400
but I'm going to ask if a few of you

28:26.400 --> 28:30.520
wouldn't kindly mind updating our Wikipedia entry.

28:30.520 --> 28:31.960
It's pretty out of date now.

28:31.960 --> 28:36.340
And there's probably more source material coming soon

28:36.340 --> 28:39.420
that could go on there, like new logos

28:39.420 --> 28:41.920
and descriptions of our hosts,

28:41.920 --> 28:44.200
like Jim and Jason that have joined recently

28:44.200 --> 28:46.320
and Elle, who we just met last week.

28:46.320 --> 28:47.660
So there's a lot of stuff

28:47.660 --> 28:50.020
that we don't have source material for to use from.

28:50.020 --> 28:53.700
So unless you happen to just know it all, I understand.

28:53.700 --> 28:56.000
And don't worry, we are working on that,

28:56.000 --> 28:58.440
but yeah, if you have a free time, free moment,

28:58.440 --> 29:01.520
a free second, a reason to edit Wikipedia

29:01.520 --> 29:04.040
and would like to update some of that stuff that you know,

29:04.040 --> 29:05.640
I'd appreciate that.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.360
Because as you know,

29:07.360 --> 29:10.320
I'm not supposed to be the one to update the entry,

29:10.320 --> 29:12.600
which is understandable, but also kind of silly

29:12.600 --> 29:14.680
because I could just write all that stuff.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.940
I could just write all this stuff that's not on our website,

29:16.940 --> 29:19.020
that's needs to be on our website, but that's cool.

29:19.020 --> 29:21.080
I understand that's how the system works.

29:21.080 --> 29:24.800
Also, looking for somebody who might be interested

29:24.800 --> 29:28.040
in continuing the development of our Roku application.

29:28.040 --> 29:30.200
It seems Roku as a platform is continuing to grow

29:30.200 --> 29:33.060
and our application is very old.

29:33.060 --> 29:34.800
And it is an open source project

29:34.800 --> 29:38.260
that is up on our Jupiter broadcasting GitHub.

29:38.260 --> 29:41.860
Sibo Jar has donated his time so far to maintain it,

29:41.860 --> 29:44.400
but I don't even think he has a Roku anymore.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.620
And we would definitely love to have somebody

29:46.620 --> 29:48.960
help us update that and then, you know,

29:48.960 --> 29:50.840
maybe we would submit it to the store.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.880
I don't really know how that process works,

29:52.880 --> 29:54.660
but that's something that Wes and I are thinking about

29:54.660 --> 29:57.440
is maybe, you know, we have a community maintained

29:57.440 --> 30:01.000
open source Roku app that other podcast networks

30:01.000 --> 30:03.240
could also use to host their shows

30:03.240 --> 30:04.600
or get their shows up on Roku

30:04.600 --> 30:06.360
because that's the thing people like to do.

30:06.360 --> 30:07.800
You know, and a lot of times you just need to like,

30:07.800 --> 30:10.360
sort of, you know, it might have like a tiny little theme

30:10.360 --> 30:12.480
or skin to it and then it's basically implementing

30:12.480 --> 30:15.040
whatever video player they ship in their SDK

30:15.040 --> 30:16.800
and pointing it at one of our URLs.

30:16.800 --> 30:19.360
Yeah, we also have JSON feeds and stuff

30:19.360 --> 30:24.040
that we didn't have before when that application

30:24.040 --> 30:24.880
was originally written.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.560
So maybe there's a different way, I don't know.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.080
So that's just something to think about.

30:28.080 --> 30:31.240
If you want to participate in that, keep in mind,

30:31.240 --> 30:35.660
we also have an art refresh coming to our shows.

30:35.660 --> 30:38.160
So if you do maintain a JB related application,

30:38.160 --> 30:39.080
keep that in mind.

30:39.080 --> 30:40.940
And if you want to get the new art when it is ready,

30:40.940 --> 30:43.640
you can contact Angela or you can join

30:43.640 --> 30:46.280
our Jupiter broadcasting telegram group

30:46.280 --> 30:48.300
for Jupiter developers, which we have linked in the show notes

30:48.300 --> 30:49.940
that Jupiter Dev Telegram,

30:49.940 --> 30:52.000
which I think Wes you're in there, I'm in there.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.240
I sure am. So if you want to work with us

30:56.240 --> 30:59.360
on updating an application or have one that you maintain,

30:59.360 --> 31:03.040
do be aware that new art is coming in the near future

31:03.040 --> 31:05.640
and you'll need to grab that stuff because it's good stuff.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.360
Yeah, but now's a good time to go figure out

31:07.360 --> 31:08.820
like, yeah, what platform should we be on?

31:08.820 --> 31:10.960
What are we missing now and how do we make it happen?

31:10.960 --> 31:12.200
I have been thinking about that.

31:12.200 --> 31:15.680
I have been wondering what other platforms we should get on.

31:15.680 --> 31:18.440
We've gotten, everybody has now, but we're on Spotify

31:18.440 --> 31:20.120
like everybody else is now,

31:20.120 --> 31:22.240
which is kind of cool, I suppose.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.960
And I don't think they re-host.

31:23.960 --> 31:26.800
Have you guys considered using BitChute yet?

31:26.800 --> 31:28.020
I can't remember if we actually got around

31:28.020 --> 31:28.860
to testing or not.

31:28.860 --> 31:30.240
It has been discussed, absolutely,

31:30.240 --> 31:31.480
but I can't remember if we actually got around

31:31.480 --> 31:32.600
to testing it.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.000
I might circle back to BitChute.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.720
And of course we have the PeerTube instance as well.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.160
And now another bit, one more thing.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.240
Well, actually we have two more things,

31:42.240 --> 31:45.160
but something that we just open sourced,

31:45.160 --> 31:50.160
Mr. Wes Payne, software developer and podcaster

31:50.480 --> 31:54.200
and man about town has released FM,

31:54.200 --> 31:57.240
which is a simple script that takes in an RTMP stream

31:57.240 --> 31:59.680
from anything that you can get an RTMP stream from,

31:59.680 --> 32:02.800
and then we'll re-stream the audio of that

32:02.800 --> 32:04.360
to an ice cast server.

32:04.360 --> 32:07.800
Wes, why don't you tell people like how we have this set up,

32:07.800 --> 32:11.000
why we have this set up, like the way it's running,

32:11.000 --> 32:12.560
like all of the, like any of the kind of details

32:12.560 --> 32:14.920
it'd be cool to share, because this is a neat stuff.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.400
You know, I was just, I was just pleased to know

32:16.400 --> 32:18.400
that besides being able to send an RTMP stream,

32:18.400 --> 32:20.440
well, FFFPEG can receive one.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.120
So you don't have to set up a complicated stateful server

32:23.120 --> 32:25.080
to handle all that stuff.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.480
We ran into this problem because, well,

32:27.480 --> 32:29.000
we used to do a lot of video shows.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.760
That's not really the case anymore.

32:30.760 --> 32:32.560
Maybe that will change, we will see.

32:33.440 --> 32:36.440
So our main streaming rig is all set up to operate

32:36.440 --> 32:39.440
around OBS and sending video streams up to scale engine

32:39.440 --> 32:42.720
and YouTube and everywhere else that you can find us.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.960
Turns out we also like to have an audio stream,

32:44.960 --> 32:47.840
especially since we're doing so many audio shows.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.920
Unfortunately, the various things and codecs that play

32:50.920 --> 32:54.960
over in RTMP world, not so friendly over in ice cast.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.480
So we needed a little bridge to connect

32:56.480 --> 32:58.520
our already existing ice cast server

32:58.520 --> 33:01.120
with our live streams from scale engine.

33:01.120 --> 33:03.440
So that's what FM does, it's not super complicated,

33:03.440 --> 33:05.840
but if anyone else runs into that situation,

33:05.840 --> 33:07.960
it might be handy, it just runs on a little Docker file,

33:07.960 --> 33:10.800
runs in a loop, and then once we start a live stream,

33:10.800 --> 33:14.040
scale engine says an RTMP push over to FM.

33:14.040 --> 33:17.160
Yes, it's actually, it's really simple and straightforward

33:17.160 --> 33:19.600
in that West put it all up in a container.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.280
We have it up on a digital ocean droplet

33:21.280 --> 33:22.960
that we run for other things.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.560
So it doesn't take a ton of resources.

33:24.560 --> 33:27.040
It's basically as much as like a VLC would pulling

33:27.040 --> 33:29.560
in a video stream, and then it's stripping the audio

33:29.560 --> 33:30.960
and sending it back out.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.720
And we have that streaming at jblive.fm.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.920
And what's great is it's actually,

33:36.920 --> 33:39.880
I think in most cases ahead of the video streams

33:39.880 --> 33:42.400
because of the way the whole RTMP streaming order

33:42.400 --> 33:45.020
works over at scale engine, like it's the first feed

33:45.020 --> 33:46.960
for jblive.fm, so now our audio streams,

33:46.960 --> 33:51.320
like I think our lowest delay stream.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.880
It'll be right there with RTMP, they'll be real close,

33:53.880 --> 33:56.160
but everything else will be behind.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.240
Yeah, that's pretty great.

33:57.240 --> 34:01.360
And it works great in the mobile web browser too, jblive.fm.

34:01.360 --> 34:04.560
And if you for some reason ever need to take audio

34:04.560 --> 34:07.320
off of the RTMP stream and restream it,

34:07.320 --> 34:09.000
go grab West's open source code.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.240
We have it up on github.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

34:12.240 --> 34:14.080
All right, that's a lot of stuff,

34:14.080 --> 34:18.040
but we're trying to figure out a way to talk about

34:18.040 --> 34:21.240
some of the open source projects we're beginning to release

34:21.240 --> 34:23.640
in a way that doesn't drag down the show,

34:23.640 --> 34:25.920
but still lets you know they're out there,

34:25.920 --> 34:27.400
because what's the point of releasing them

34:27.400 --> 34:28.560
if we don't tell you?

34:28.560 --> 34:30.680
So hopefully this format works.

34:30.680 --> 34:32.640
I suppose in the future, if it was some massive project,

34:32.640 --> 34:34.440
we might dedicate a show to it,

34:34.440 --> 34:36.440
but right now we'll put it in the housekeeping section.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.640
And last but not least, we have the votes open

34:39.640 --> 34:40.860
for a March study group.

34:40.860 --> 34:44.920
We've gotten so many good meetup signups, feedback,

34:44.920 --> 34:46.200
people already beginning to vote

34:46.200 --> 34:48.040
because we've released it earlier.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.840
Like there's just so much feedback already coming in

34:49.840 --> 34:51.280
before we even held the first study group

34:51.280 --> 34:53.760
that we decided we try another one in March

34:53.760 --> 34:56.120
and let you vote on what the topic's gonna be.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.040
There's a couple in there that are really good.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.400
So I'll have a link to that in the show notes

34:59.400 --> 35:02.200
at linuxunplugged.com slash 287.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.600
You know, I see Vim, the improved editor.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.440
That's an option.

35:05.440 --> 35:06.640
I vote for that already,

35:06.640 --> 35:08.160
just so we can finally get you to learn.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.000
The bastard.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.400
How come there's not one on Nano in there?

35:10.400 --> 35:13.200
I should go create a Nano Essentials course.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.040
You have fun with that.

35:14.040 --> 35:18.900
It'd probably be the least viewed course on the platform.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.620
Yeah, there's some good things in here.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.240
Visual Studio Code Essentials course, surely.

35:24.240 --> 35:26.220
Yeah, that would be good, wouldn't it?

35:26.220 --> 35:28.040
The first step when setting up a Linux studio

35:28.040 --> 35:30.040
is to set your editor back to Nano

35:30.040 --> 35:32.780
after Wes Payne's been in there changing things to Vim.

35:32.780 --> 35:33.960
Like I wouldn't notice.

35:33.960 --> 35:35.900
Like I wouldn't notice.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.600
Yeah, there's also LXC and LXD.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.240
Deep dive in here.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.080
Big Data Essentials, if you wanna wrap your head

35:43.080 --> 35:45.280
around that, or DevOps Essentials.

35:45.280 --> 35:47.920
But the one that I'm kinda hoping people vote for

35:47.920 --> 35:50.960
is either Linux, I'm not gonna, I don't wanna sway it,

35:50.960 --> 35:53.040
but I'm just gonna say there's a Git Quick Start

35:53.040 --> 35:55.540
and a Linux Operating System Fundamentals in there.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.240
We'll be doing future study groups on.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.160
And those study groups will be taking place

36:00.160 --> 36:01.620
after Linux Unplugged.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.320
It's not in the show.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.440
It's just, it's not part of the show.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.720
If you wanna join us, go to meetup.com

36:07.720 --> 36:11.280
slash Jupiter Broadcasting for the details on that.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.040
All right, well that's the housekeeping.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.400
So, oh, you know, while we're just talking

36:15.400 --> 36:17.760
about network stuff, Mr. Wes Payne

36:17.760 --> 36:19.320
has been on the Coder Radio program

36:19.320 --> 36:22.080
while I have been in Texas and killing it.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.320
I just think you've been doing a great job.

36:24.320 --> 36:27.300
So if you haven't checked out Coder Radio, coder.show.

36:27.300 --> 36:28.620
Go listen to the last few episodes.

36:28.620 --> 36:31.180
I think the last one was your guys' best episode, Wes.

36:31.180 --> 36:32.400
I think it was a really good one.

36:32.400 --> 36:33.280
Oh, well, thank you.

36:33.280 --> 36:34.720
Having lots of fun chatting with Mike

36:34.720 --> 36:37.080
and getting to pick his weird Floridian brain.

36:37.080 --> 36:40.440
Yeah, yeah, it is that, isn't it?

36:40.440 --> 36:42.340
All right, well, let's talk a little bit

36:42.340 --> 36:45.160
about FOSDEM 2019.

36:45.160 --> 36:48.000
It was something that I had really, really, really

36:48.000 --> 36:49.240
high hopes of attending.

36:49.240 --> 36:53.240
And it did not work out for multiple reasons.

36:53.240 --> 36:56.560
But I did manage to catch a flavor of FOSDEM

36:56.560 --> 36:58.840
by watching the live streams.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.040
Good morning, everyone.

37:00.040 --> 37:03.200
I hope you can all find a seat somewhere.

37:03.200 --> 37:05.240
There's plenty of them available.

37:06.660 --> 37:09.900
So welcome to FOSDEM 2019.

37:09.900 --> 37:12.340
It's a bit more snowy than we expected.

37:12.340 --> 37:14.040
I hope you all got here safely.

37:15.080 --> 37:17.960
But yeah, at least some of you made it, so that's good.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.680
Some of you, like Mr. Popey, made it.

37:20.680 --> 37:22.180
It was a pretty big crowd, it looked like,

37:22.180 --> 37:23.960
from the streams that I saw, Popey.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.760
And I don't know if you got any idea

37:25.760 --> 37:27.400
of how many people attended.

37:27.400 --> 37:28.960
Lots, thousands.

37:28.960 --> 37:33.000
The main room is called Janssen,

37:33.000 --> 37:34.840
and that's where all the keynotes happen.

37:34.840 --> 37:37.680
And the reported capacity for that room

37:37.680 --> 37:41.400
is like 1,400 people, and it was people sat all up and down

37:41.400 --> 37:43.680
all the stairs, so every chair was full.

37:43.680 --> 37:46.400
They were like demanding people move into the middle

37:46.400 --> 37:48.760
of the rows so that everyone could get a seat.

37:48.760 --> 37:51.200
And then there were people spilling out all over the floor,

37:51.200 --> 37:53.380
like people coming in all through all the talks

37:53.380 --> 37:54.400
and sitting all over the floor.

37:54.400 --> 37:58.200
It was a ton of people there, and every room was busy.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.280
Some of them, obviously most of the rooms

38:00.280 --> 38:02.240
are much smaller than that, and it got to the point

38:02.240 --> 38:05.000
where some of the rooms were just rammed all day.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.960
There's like a DNS room, and it was just full

38:06.960 --> 38:08.280
all day, every day.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.480
And if you go to a room, there are people queuing

38:10.480 --> 38:11.920
to get in, waiting to get in.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.360
If someone goes out to the toilet,

38:13.360 --> 38:14.920
they're like busting to get in.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.600
But the good news is every room was live-streamed,

38:18.600 --> 38:20.880
so if you couldn't get in the room,

38:20.880 --> 38:22.760
you could stand outside and get your phone out

38:22.760 --> 38:24.360
or your laptop out, and there were people just standing

38:24.360 --> 38:27.080
around watching live streams or huddled around a laptop

38:27.080 --> 38:29.680
to watch a stream of a room they're standing next to.

38:29.680 --> 38:30.520
It was quite amazing.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.480
Wow, that is an impressive feat.

38:32.480 --> 38:34.040
That is.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.780
I feel like I have a bond now with them,

38:36.780 --> 38:39.280
because I was doing a lot of that online,

38:39.280 --> 38:41.780
and they are also posting a lot of these talks.

38:41.780 --> 38:43.160
It takes a while to get all of them out there,

38:43.160 --> 38:44.260
but they've already posted a whole bunch,

38:44.260 --> 38:46.400
which we will have linked in the notes.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.760
The way they do it is the speaker gets an email

38:48.760 --> 38:52.480
after their talk, and the speaker gets to review it,

38:52.480 --> 38:55.400
and once they review it, it goes live shortly after that.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.800
But it's pretty much all automated.

38:57.800 --> 39:01.240
It's pretty amazing the way they've got it working now.

39:01.240 --> 39:02.240
It's really, really good.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.920
So is it too much?

39:03.920 --> 39:04.760
Is it too big?

39:04.760 --> 39:05.840
Is it too many things?

39:05.840 --> 39:06.880
Like, looking at the schedule,

39:06.880 --> 39:09.560
it just seems there's so much FOMO,

39:09.560 --> 39:12.500
because you can't make it to any of that stuff.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.500
You can only make it to one thing at a time,

39:14.500 --> 39:19.500
and then you add the crowds and how packed the rooms are.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.280
Is it too much?

39:21.280 --> 39:25.000
I think they, I mean, they constantly have to think about

39:25.000 --> 39:27.960
what venue they use, and it is a sizable venue.

39:27.960 --> 39:31.840
There's 63 tracks, 43 dev rooms,

39:32.720 --> 39:36.020
and then there's exhibition space as well with 65 stands.

39:36.020 --> 39:38.840
So there's a lot of space taken up,

39:38.840 --> 39:42.840
and they use a lot of rooms spread across loads of buildings.

39:42.840 --> 39:45.640
You have to hurry from one room to another,

39:45.640 --> 39:48.960
and all you get embedded in one room

39:48.960 --> 39:51.520
for a talk that you want to see in three hours' time,

39:51.520 --> 39:54.800
but you get in there early in order to sit through two talks,

39:54.800 --> 39:57.360
and then, and you might even be watching a talk

39:57.360 --> 39:59.400
from another room while you're waiting for the talk

39:59.400 --> 40:01.060
that you actually want to see coming up.

40:01.060 --> 40:02.240
I mean, it's a bit ludicrous,

40:02.240 --> 40:05.280
but that's mitigated by all the live streaming

40:05.280 --> 40:07.200
and the recorded video that's published afterwards.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.840
So they have an app, so you can sit there

40:09.840 --> 40:12.360
and tag all the things that you want to go and see,

40:12.360 --> 40:13.800
and it will remind you when they're coming,

40:13.800 --> 40:15.000
or it's got a little map,

40:15.000 --> 40:16.880
and it will navigate you to the room you want to go to.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.760
So it's just so well run, really, really well done,

40:19.760 --> 40:22.880
and it's all community run by an organizing committee.

40:22.880 --> 40:25.120
It's not a corporate event by any stretch.

40:26.080 --> 40:28.120
They have a few sponsors.

40:28.120 --> 40:31.480
The university itself in Solbosch in Brussels

40:31.480 --> 40:33.480
is the main sponsor.

40:33.480 --> 40:36.140
Google and Red Hat also sponsor at a high tier,

40:36.140 --> 40:39.520
and then there's like 10 other sponsors, including us.

40:39.520 --> 40:44.160
But it's a major event, and you walk the halls,

40:44.160 --> 40:46.520
and as I'm walking along,

40:46.520 --> 40:48.040
you get that little flutter of celebrity.

40:48.040 --> 40:50.600
You see all your friends,

40:50.600 --> 40:52.520
but also you see loads of other people

40:52.520 --> 40:54.480
from the open source world,

40:54.480 --> 40:57.160
anyone you can name, not just the Uber celebrities

40:57.160 --> 40:58.080
who've been around for years and years,

40:58.080 --> 40:59.080
like John Mad Dog Hall,

40:59.080 --> 41:01.240
but you can see Leonard Pottering,

41:01.240 --> 41:03.800
and people from other podcasts,

41:03.800 --> 41:06.800
and developers who work on that favorite project

41:06.800 --> 41:07.640
that you have.

41:07.640 --> 41:11.060
There's so many people go to this event, yes,

41:11.060 --> 41:14.100
and I'm sure they do their absolute best

41:14.100 --> 41:16.080
to get people in the rooms, but it is very difficult.

41:16.080 --> 41:18.040
So that was gonna be my next question was,

41:18.040 --> 41:21.720
is the MeetSpace meetings,

41:21.720 --> 41:23.600
is it very valuable?

41:23.600 --> 41:25.320
Because I know you're a great person

41:25.320 --> 41:26.160
to ask that question to,

41:26.160 --> 41:28.760
because you've gone to so many different Linux events

41:28.760 --> 41:30.040
in different countries,

41:30.040 --> 41:32.480
and literally all around the world,

41:32.480 --> 41:34.760
and so I'm wondering how this kind of stacks up

41:34.760 --> 41:36.280
that sort of MeetSpace value

41:36.280 --> 41:37.740
compared to some of the other events.

41:37.740 --> 41:38.580
It's great.

41:38.580 --> 41:43.160
It's got one of the better social calendars of any,

41:43.160 --> 41:45.440
because there's opportunity

41:45.440 --> 41:46.960
to talk to so many different people.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.560
I mean, there's also opportunity

41:48.560 --> 41:50.040
to miss conversations with people,

41:50.040 --> 41:51.620
because there are so many people there.

41:51.620 --> 41:54.880
It's not like there's only one person

41:54.880 --> 41:56.480
that you're likely to want to talk to.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.440
I missed conversations with so many people.

41:58.440 --> 42:01.760
I had great meetings with people from the KDE community

42:01.760 --> 42:03.160
and people from the GNOME community,

42:03.160 --> 42:06.560
and bumped into my old boss who now works at GitLab,

42:06.560 --> 42:09.960
and you bump into podcasters who you haven't seen for years,

42:09.960 --> 42:13.660
and it was just lovely to meet up with those people

42:13.660 --> 42:15.720
in corridors and just bump into them,

42:15.720 --> 42:17.700
and people would come up to me and shake my hand.

42:17.700 --> 42:20.820
In fact, it became a running joke of Fosdian with my friends,

42:20.820 --> 42:22.400
because people came up to me and were like,

42:22.400 --> 42:23.720
oh, you're Alan Pope, aren't you?

42:23.720 --> 42:25.520
And I'd shake my hands, really like the podcast,

42:25.520 --> 42:28.160
and to the point where that is now something

42:28.160 --> 42:30.360
my friends say to me in real life.

42:30.360 --> 42:31.680
Oh, you're that podcaster, aren't you?

42:31.680 --> 42:33.120
Just to take the mix.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.560
I have no idea what you're talking about.

42:35.560 --> 42:37.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.

42:37.860 --> 42:40.140
But it's a great event.

42:40.140 --> 42:43.200
It's so well run, and the facilities are great.

42:43.200 --> 42:45.320
There's food and drink nearby,

42:45.320 --> 42:47.500
and there's public transport.

42:47.500 --> 42:48.700
You can get a tram or a bus,

42:48.700 --> 42:50.900
or if you have to, you can get an Uber.

42:50.900 --> 42:52.900
And there are even little Lime scooters

42:52.900 --> 42:55.000
you can jump on and scoot around the place.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.920
It's really worth going.

42:57.920 --> 42:59.480
And there's so many great talks as well.

42:59.480 --> 43:03.520
So they have tracks for loads of different subjects,

43:03.520 --> 43:04.760
but obviously there's keynotes

43:04.760 --> 43:07.160
that are definitely worth seeing.

43:07.160 --> 43:08.980
And there was one at the very start

43:08.980 --> 43:11.500
with Bradley Coon and Karen Sandler talking about,

43:11.500 --> 43:15.860
is it possible to live a life of only using free software?

43:15.860 --> 43:18.360
And talking about the challenges that come with,

43:18.360 --> 43:19.600
you know, if you work for a company

43:19.600 --> 43:21.440
that mandate you shouldn't demand

43:21.440 --> 43:23.160
that anyone has to use proprietary software,

43:23.160 --> 43:26.480
that you should only use free software if you possibly can.

43:26.480 --> 43:27.860
You know, it's quite a challenge to do that,

43:27.860 --> 43:30.120
and I'm sure many people appreciate that.

43:30.120 --> 43:33.680
And there are other talks like the Tor project

43:33.680 --> 43:35.920
gave a talk about the state of Tor,

43:35.920 --> 43:38.160
and the Matrix project talked about

43:38.160 --> 43:41.640
how Matrix is being adopted by French government,

43:41.640 --> 43:43.120
and they're using it internally,

43:43.120 --> 43:46.000
and the amount of changes they've had to make,

43:46.000 --> 43:47.800
and user interface changes to Matrix

43:47.800 --> 43:49.000
in order to facilitate that.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.600
And it's, yeah, there's so many talks,

43:52.600 --> 43:54.000
but the great thing is, because it's archived,

43:54.000 --> 43:56.240
I can queue them up and sit and watch them later.

43:56.240 --> 43:57.760
True.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.240
I'll link to the John Mad Dog one,

44:00.240 --> 44:03.080
because that would look like just,

44:03.080 --> 44:04.440
I watched the whole thing live.

44:04.440 --> 44:08.440
It was 50 years of Unix and Linux advances.

44:08.440 --> 44:10.280
And it's really poignant right now,

44:10.280 --> 44:12.240
especially in the age of the cloud.

44:12.240 --> 44:15.140
I don't know if I 100% agree with all of his conclusions,

44:15.140 --> 44:17.320
but if he isn't just one of the best speakers

44:17.320 --> 44:18.220
in our community.

44:18.220 --> 44:22.880
Right, that was like sitting around the campfire

44:22.880 --> 44:26.040
with granddad telling you stories of the last 50 years,

44:26.040 --> 44:30.160
but the grandchildren being like 2,000 of them in the room.

44:30.160 --> 44:33.320
And it was very well received, that talk.

44:33.320 --> 44:36.600
Yeah, I think it's one of my favorite random moments

44:36.600 --> 44:37.920
that's ever happened to me still,

44:37.920 --> 44:41.920
is when I was at Linux Fest Northwest many years ago,

44:41.920 --> 44:44.240
while we were live on air,

44:44.240 --> 44:46.340
the guys around the booth funneled John Mad Dog Hall

44:46.340 --> 44:47.400
down to sit next to me.

44:47.400 --> 44:50.080
And I just got this completely unplanned,

44:50.080 --> 44:53.240
unexpected interview with John Mad Dog.

44:53.240 --> 44:54.140
And it was just great.

44:54.140 --> 44:56.600
I just really enjoyed the conversation.

44:56.600 --> 45:00.920
And I noted in his talk that he said he's going

45:00.920 --> 45:04.360
to stop traveling around to these events in 2025.

45:04.360 --> 45:06.720
So there's only a few more years of this.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.800
So I will have that linked in the show notes.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.680
Also, I'll have linked in the show notes,

45:10.680 --> 45:12.720
Mr. Popey did a lightning talk.

45:12.720 --> 45:14.200
So you were in the lightning talk track.

45:14.200 --> 45:17.000
What was that like, being involved in that process?

45:17.000 --> 45:18.640
So that is interesting,

45:18.640 --> 45:20.920
because like most conferences I go to,

45:20.920 --> 45:23.800
lightning talks is like they set aside a portion

45:23.800 --> 45:25.760
of a day for lightning talks.

45:25.760 --> 45:28.320
But no, not FOSDEM, it's like all day, both days,

45:28.320 --> 45:31.360
Saturday and Sunday, solid lightning talks all day.

45:31.360 --> 45:33.280
And so there's a constant change.

45:33.280 --> 45:35.400
There's like your 15 minute talk

45:35.400 --> 45:36.880
and then five minutes changeover.

45:36.880 --> 45:38.560
15 minute talk, five minutes changeover.

45:38.560 --> 45:41.180
And they are strict, super strict.

45:41.180 --> 45:45.620
There's a clock, like a little, I don't know if it's Arduino

45:45.620 --> 45:48.240
or Raspberry Pi based digital clock on the desk,

45:48.240 --> 45:50.040
which faces both you as the speaker

45:50.040 --> 45:51.160
and it faces the audience.

45:51.160 --> 45:53.460
So everyone knows whether you're going to overrun or not,

45:53.460 --> 45:55.020
and they don't let it happen.

45:55.020 --> 45:58.320
So it's very much kept to time.

45:58.320 --> 46:00.760
And so I went in the room that I was going to be in,

46:00.760 --> 46:04.220
that I was giving my talk in a few talks ahead of time.

46:04.220 --> 46:06.880
So I was well prepared and I could make sure my slides worked

46:06.880 --> 46:10.040
and laptop worked and all that kind of stuff.

46:10.040 --> 46:12.960
And I learned some things.

46:12.960 --> 46:14.320
For example, there was a lightning talk

46:14.320 --> 46:16.160
about an application called Monica

46:16.160 --> 46:17.760
that I had never heard of.

46:17.760 --> 46:20.320
And I'm sure most people haven't heard of it.

46:20.320 --> 46:22.080
And it's a thing I totally need

46:22.080 --> 46:23.320
and I never knew I needed it.

46:23.320 --> 46:27.040
It's like a personal relationship manager, they call it.

46:27.040 --> 46:30.920
It's a database in which you can put all your memories,

46:30.920 --> 46:34.080
like remembering who that cousin is married to

46:34.080 --> 46:35.640
and what the names of their children are.

46:35.640 --> 46:38.620
And when was the last time you went out with this person

46:38.620 --> 46:40.840
and when's so-and-so's anniversary

46:40.840 --> 46:43.400
and all those things that you try and keep in your head

46:43.400 --> 46:44.240
and you forget.

46:44.240 --> 46:46.820
And you know, like when you get old, you forget that stuff.

46:46.820 --> 46:49.840
And it's all local, it's all stored internally.

46:49.840 --> 46:51.100
It's never meant to be shared.

46:51.100 --> 46:53.920
It's not like Facebook, it's not social network.

46:53.920 --> 46:55.920
It's just a little bit.

46:55.920 --> 46:56.920
And I'd never heard of this.

46:56.920 --> 46:59.280
And the guy gave a lightning talk before I went on.

46:59.280 --> 47:00.880
And I was like, this is fantastic.

47:00.880 --> 47:02.600
This is exactly why I come to FOSDEM

47:02.600 --> 47:03.560
because learn about stuff

47:03.560 --> 47:06.240
that I would never discover otherwise, it was brilliant.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.040
And then I gave a lightning talk and it was all right.

47:08.040 --> 47:09.400
So yeah, it was good.

47:09.400 --> 47:10.980
Now, do you have to, so you have to,

47:10.980 --> 47:11.820
for the lightning talks,

47:11.820 --> 47:13.800
is it like you have to stick to the 15 minutes no more?

47:13.800 --> 47:14.900
Is it 10 minutes?

47:14.900 --> 47:17.480
Yeah, it's 15 minutes and then a five-minute changeover.

47:17.480 --> 47:19.200
So you got an ability way to get off the stage

47:19.200 --> 47:21.000
and get back on and the next one to get on.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.380
I burned through my slides in about 10 minutes

47:24.380 --> 47:25.880
and left time for questions

47:25.880 --> 47:29.280
because whenever I talk about snaps and SnapCraft,

47:29.280 --> 47:30.520
there are always questions.

47:30.520 --> 47:31.920
It's never like, oh, that was interesting.

47:31.920 --> 47:33.320
And then everyone gets up and leaves.

47:33.320 --> 47:34.740
What's the most common,

47:34.740 --> 47:35.940
like when you're in a group setting,

47:35.940 --> 47:37.040
what's the most common one?

47:37.040 --> 47:39.780
So usually there's something about security,

47:39.780 --> 47:42.640
something about the fact that you're bundling libraries in

47:42.640 --> 47:43.960
and who's responsible for security.

47:43.960 --> 47:45.480
So that question came up.

47:46.580 --> 47:47.680
There was a question this time

47:47.680 --> 47:50.680
about parallel installs of snaps,

47:50.680 --> 47:53.200
like having multiple snaps of different versions

47:53.200 --> 47:54.580
on the system.

47:54.580 --> 47:55.760
And I didn't realize that that feature

47:55.760 --> 47:57.960
has actually landed like this weekend.

47:57.960 --> 48:01.360
So I said, oh, it's coming and it's actually all right.

48:01.360 --> 48:02.200
That worked out.

48:02.200 --> 48:04.920
And then there was the inevitable question I always get

48:04.920 --> 48:06.920
is how does this compare to Flatpak?

48:06.920 --> 48:09.760
Which like, please, could you compare this to Flatpak?

48:09.760 --> 48:11.600
And I had two and a half minutes left on the clock

48:11.600 --> 48:12.440
and I was like, no,

48:12.440 --> 48:14.920
I'm not gonna compare them in two and a half minutes.

48:14.920 --> 48:17.280
So yeah, I kind of ducked that one,

48:17.280 --> 48:19.400
but it was really, really good.

48:19.400 --> 48:20.360
Really, really good.

48:20.360 --> 48:22.040
That does make me wanna make sure I try to get it

48:22.040 --> 48:24.800
to a FOSDEM 2020.

48:24.800 --> 48:26.480
Wow, 2020, geez, that's crazy.

48:26.480 --> 48:28.540
Yeah, it's the 20th one next year, I think.

48:28.540 --> 48:30.920
Joe always says it's the worst time of year to travel though

48:30.920 --> 48:32.320
because everybody's sick.

48:32.320 --> 48:35.840
Did you manage to avoid the con crud?

48:35.840 --> 48:38.640
I haven't come down with anything yet.

48:38.640 --> 48:42.560
I did notice a few likely patient zeros

48:42.560 --> 48:44.520
who were kind enough not to shake my hand

48:44.520 --> 48:46.080
and they realized they were patient zero

48:46.080 --> 48:47.560
and didn't wanna spread it.

48:47.560 --> 48:48.440
But you know, it's very difficult

48:48.440 --> 48:49.760
when you're in a room full of people.

48:49.760 --> 48:52.960
But the travel, I went on the Eurostar.

48:52.960 --> 48:56.760
So I just get a train from my place to London,

48:56.760 --> 48:59.160
which is like 45 minutes and then cross London,

48:59.160 --> 49:01.240
it's like 20 minutes on the underground

49:01.240 --> 49:02.640
and then get on the Eurostar

49:02.640 --> 49:04.240
and it's a train direct from London

49:04.240 --> 49:05.840
all the way through the Channel Tunnel,

49:05.840 --> 49:08.080
through France, into Belgium,

49:08.080 --> 49:11.360
get out, quick cab ride or bus or tram

49:11.360 --> 49:13.680
and you're at the hotel, it's fantastic.

49:13.680 --> 49:17.000
It's a great way, if you're coming from where my house,

49:17.000 --> 49:18.520
it's great.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.440
If you're coming from where you are, Chris,

49:20.440 --> 49:21.560
maybe not so much.

49:21.560 --> 49:24.200
Yeah, no, no, it's not.

49:24.200 --> 49:26.960
It's a slight distance difference, I guess.

49:26.960 --> 49:28.440
It's also important to understand

49:28.440 --> 49:30.160
that Joe is something of a delicate flower

49:30.160 --> 49:31.880
when it comes to conference attendance

49:31.880 --> 49:34.400
and getting sick and being concerned about getting sick.

49:34.400 --> 49:36.200
So you need to bear that in mind as well.

49:36.200 --> 49:38.520
Hey, as the boss, I gotta respect the fact

49:38.520 --> 49:41.080
that the man wants to make sure his voice is functional

49:41.080 --> 49:43.200
because I got a lot of shows that go out of business

49:43.200 --> 49:44.880
if he's too sick.

49:44.880 --> 49:46.760
Also, he is a bit taller than me

49:46.760 --> 49:48.600
and he is a bit cramped on the Eurostar

49:48.600 --> 49:51.760
unless you're able to play a little bit extra.

49:51.760 --> 49:55.080
Actually, the fact that Chris has never met Joe,

49:55.080 --> 49:57.920
it's gonna be interesting to see that first encounter

49:57.920 --> 50:02.640
when Chris is staring squarely at Joe's navel

50:02.640 --> 50:04.040
when they meet for the first time.

50:04.040 --> 50:04.880
Yes.

50:04.880 --> 50:07.360
Brent, you had a great question to ask Poppy.

50:07.360 --> 50:09.400
Yeah, my question actually was

50:09.400 --> 50:13.800
with Linux Fest Northwest coming up.

50:13.800 --> 50:15.080
I know it's the 20th anniversary

50:15.080 --> 50:17.560
and I just wondered if you think that the rooms

50:17.560 --> 50:22.560
will be just as packed with how it's the 20th anniversary

50:23.320 --> 50:26.000
and how that's gonna affect sort of that closeness

50:26.000 --> 50:28.560
that it feels like at Linux Fest Northwest.

50:28.560 --> 50:29.400
That's one for you, Chris.

50:29.400 --> 50:31.240
I've never been to Linux Fest Northwest.

50:31.240 --> 50:32.200
This is my first time.

50:32.200 --> 50:34.400
You'll be able to answer, won't you, soon?

50:34.400 --> 50:35.680
Yeah, yeah, totally.

50:35.680 --> 50:37.080
I think what your answer would be,

50:37.080 --> 50:38.400
and I'm just gonna guess,

50:38.400 --> 50:40.800
it would be great if we could remember to go back to this,

50:40.800 --> 50:42.480
but I think what your answer would be, Poppy,

50:42.480 --> 50:45.040
is that the size is much more manageable

50:45.040 --> 50:46.000
at Linux Fest Northwest.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.240
You can find a seat,

50:48.240 --> 50:50.680
you can make your way to a talk in time,

50:50.680 --> 50:52.400
but there's just also not gonna be necessarily

50:52.400 --> 50:53.520
all of the same selection.

50:53.520 --> 50:55.040
And that's the tricky part about some of these

50:55.040 --> 50:58.240
is the thing about FOSDEM is it's kind of a unique event

50:58.240 --> 50:59.840
in the sense that there's some folks

50:59.840 --> 51:01.520
that only make the trip to FOSDEM,

51:01.520 --> 51:02.360
just like there's some folks

51:02.360 --> 51:03.840
that only make the trip to Linux Fest

51:03.840 --> 51:04.960
or only make the trip to Scale.

51:04.960 --> 51:07.200
That's why they're all unique.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.280
Same with all the different events.

51:08.280 --> 51:10.720
So I bet that would be your takeaway,

51:10.720 --> 51:12.440
but I might be wrong.

51:12.440 --> 51:14.680
I don't wanna put words in your mouth.

51:14.680 --> 51:16.200
Yeah, Chris, I think the crux of my question

51:16.200 --> 51:19.520
is judging by how last year was pretty full

51:19.520 --> 51:21.960
and this year there's, only in this chat room,

51:21.960 --> 51:22.960
there's a bunch of people coming

51:22.960 --> 51:24.880
for the first time from overseas.

51:24.880 --> 51:26.440
I know, we're freaking a big crowd this year.

51:26.440 --> 51:28.440
Is that an indicator of what might happen, right?

51:28.440 --> 51:29.680
I mean, I hope so.

51:29.680 --> 51:33.120
The Bellingham Technical College is a large campus

51:33.120 --> 51:34.560
and they've been very generous.

51:34.560 --> 51:37.480
Perhaps they'd open up more space, more space in the future.

51:37.480 --> 51:38.320
You know what they need to do

51:38.320 --> 51:40.480
is they need to adopt a policy like FOSDEM has.

51:40.480 --> 51:42.000
Out of all of the events I've gone to,

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
I've never heard this line before.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.880
Please also make sure to clean up after yourselves.

51:46.880 --> 51:50.560
Like, that's, that's fantastic.

51:51.440 --> 51:54.160
Yeah, us nerds, we're not always the cleanliest people,

51:54.160 --> 51:55.080
are we?

51:55.080 --> 51:58.040
Yeah, and because you can buy beer and Club Marte,

51:58.040 --> 52:00.120
there's always glasses clinking around

52:00.120 --> 52:02.080
as people are like moving in and out of the room.

52:02.080 --> 52:03.440
As people put the glass down on the floor,

52:03.440 --> 52:04.280
there's nowhere else to put it.

52:04.280 --> 52:07.200
I've just put an image in IRC

52:07.200 --> 52:08.160
you might want to have a look at.

52:08.160 --> 52:09.920
It's, you can find this yourself

52:09.920 --> 52:14.240
if you do an online search for FOSDEM Richard Stallman

52:14.240 --> 52:17.560
preaching to the converted, I think the image is called.

52:17.560 --> 52:21.560
And it's a panorama of the main room, Jansen.

52:21.560 --> 52:23.560
And so that room, that photo,

52:23.560 --> 52:26.680
if you go and find it is from 2005 and it's Richard Stallman.

52:26.680 --> 52:29.160
I was there, I'm right at the back of that picture.

52:30.200 --> 52:32.880
And when Mad Dog was there this year,

52:32.880 --> 52:35.440
you imagine every single one of those seats full.

52:35.440 --> 52:39.000
This room isn't full in 2005, all of that full

52:39.000 --> 52:40.840
and people all the way up the stairs either side

52:40.840 --> 52:42.400
and sat around the front as well.

52:42.400 --> 52:44.240
It was mad.

52:44.240 --> 52:47.280
I will put a link to the 2005 photo in the show notes

52:47.280 --> 52:48.960
so people want to compare.

52:48.960 --> 52:51.440
Yeah, you're right, that's a good point.

52:51.440 --> 52:54.680
I think when it's a community event,

52:54.680 --> 52:57.600
it also leaves room for slight rough edges.

52:57.600 --> 53:00.280
Going back to the cleanup thing, I laugh,

53:00.280 --> 53:03.200
but they have a real community attitude about it.

53:04.560 --> 53:07.560
We have to pack up tomorrow in about two hours time.

53:08.480 --> 53:10.760
We have to be out of the buildings

53:10.760 --> 53:12.760
come nine o'clock tomorrow evening.

53:12.760 --> 53:15.640
So there's not a lot of time to do the cleanup.

53:15.640 --> 53:17.040
If you do the bulk of the work,

53:17.040 --> 53:18.680
that leaves less work for us.

53:18.680 --> 53:21.120
So we'd be very grateful if you would do that.

53:21.120 --> 53:22.640
It's not only is it something

53:22.640 --> 53:24.120
that you just wouldn't really hear in the States,

53:24.120 --> 53:26.160
like there's their general attitude about the event.

53:26.160 --> 53:28.520
It's not the same attitude that you have here in the States.

53:28.520 --> 53:30.160
So it's different in that regard,

53:30.160 --> 53:32.080
but it really does have that community feeling to it,

53:32.080 --> 53:34.120
even watching from afar.

53:34.120 --> 53:35.960
So thank you, Mr. Proby for the recap.

53:35.960 --> 53:39.360
I love living vicariously through you.

53:39.360 --> 53:40.920
I wish I could have made it.

53:40.920 --> 53:42.440
Well, I would encourage your listeners,

53:42.440 --> 53:44.440
if you get an opportunity next year,

53:44.440 --> 53:46.520
you might want to book early to avoid disappointment.

53:46.520 --> 53:47.840
You don't have to pay for tickets, by the way,

53:47.840 --> 53:49.760
it's completely free event.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.200
You can, it's just got to pay for your travel

53:52.200 --> 53:53.600
and accommodation, but book early,

53:53.600 --> 53:56.280
because I suspect it's going to be even more full next year.

53:56.280 --> 53:58.560
So you might want to make sure you can get accommodation

53:58.560 --> 54:00.600
and all that stuff at a time

54:00.600 --> 54:02.240
and look out for the announcement

54:02.240 --> 54:04.720
when that comes later in the year.

54:04.720 --> 54:05.800
Very good.

54:05.800 --> 54:07.200
Let's take a moment in the show now

54:07.200 --> 54:10.640
and talk about the new release of Pi-Hole.

54:10.640 --> 54:14.760
Pi-Hole version 4.2 is now available with shared memory,

54:14.760 --> 54:18.000
new blocking modes, and much, much more.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.480
And Mr. Wes and I were chatting before the show.

54:20.480 --> 54:21.320
We said, this is it.

54:21.320 --> 54:22.800
This is now our chance.

54:22.800 --> 54:23.920
Talk about Pi-Hole.

54:23.920 --> 54:25.600
And you did a deep dive, Wes.

54:25.600 --> 54:27.920
You went all in into the Pi-Hole.

54:27.920 --> 54:29.600
Oh yeah, I'm stuck down in there now.

54:29.600 --> 54:30.480
It's running on my laptop.

54:30.480 --> 54:31.480
It's running on my network.

54:31.480 --> 54:33.040
I can't escape.

54:33.040 --> 54:35.200
So did you really?

54:35.200 --> 54:37.360
Okay, so you did a laptop install.

54:37.360 --> 54:39.360
I mean, not to throw us off course here,

54:39.360 --> 54:41.680
but maybe that's not a bad place to start.

54:41.680 --> 54:43.080
Like this isn't actually something

54:43.080 --> 54:45.000
you have to install on a Raspberry Pi.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.360
I think everybody knows that,

54:46.360 --> 54:48.440
but this is proof positive right here.

54:48.440 --> 54:51.200
Yeah, it's kind of a little bit different of a project

54:51.200 --> 54:53.360
because it doesn't come on like an SD card

54:53.360 --> 54:55.720
that you just flash and stick into your Pi.

54:55.720 --> 54:57.400
It's really just an installer script.

54:57.400 --> 55:00.000
So they have a set of supported operating systems.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.560
And honestly, it's pretty wide.

55:01.560 --> 55:04.520
Raspbian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, CentOS even.

55:04.520 --> 55:07.040
And on most of those, they also support ARM.

55:07.040 --> 55:09.120
So whether you wanna use the script

55:09.120 --> 55:11.480
on your Raspberry Pi or on your server,

55:11.480 --> 55:12.680
it doesn't really matter.

55:12.680 --> 55:14.280
It just sets everything up the same.

55:14.280 --> 55:19.280
Yeah, so Pi-Hole is a network-wide

55:19.640 --> 55:23.600
DNS-based advertising blocking appliance.

55:23.600 --> 55:26.240
It uses several different technologies like DNS mask,

55:26.240 --> 55:27.720
which is a lightweight DNS server.

55:27.720 --> 55:29.440
It can also do DHCP.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.320
Uses curl for transferring data

55:31.320 --> 55:33.360
with different URL syntaxes between things.

55:33.360 --> 55:36.200
HTTP D for the web server to manage it.

55:36.200 --> 55:39.200
PHP, which is the web interface I believe is written in.

55:40.160 --> 55:44.120
And the admin dashboard is based on admin LTE.

55:44.120 --> 55:46.480
All of that sits on top of Linux.

55:46.480 --> 55:48.400
Using these open-source technologies

55:48.400 --> 55:52.880
to intercept DNS requests and use what's called,

55:52.880 --> 55:56.200
I think the Pi-Hole comes from DNS black-holing of things.

55:56.200 --> 55:57.600
Wes, that's where the name comes from.

55:57.600 --> 55:59.040
It's essentially a DNS black-hole

55:59.040 --> 56:02.600
for things like ad sites and malware and whatnot.

56:02.600 --> 56:03.440
Yeah, exactly.

56:03.440 --> 56:05.600
So usually what you do is you install on a Pi

56:05.600 --> 56:07.840
or in a VM or a container.

56:07.840 --> 56:09.240
Or sync-holing, sync-holing.

56:09.240 --> 56:10.160
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

56:10.160 --> 56:11.920
And so once you've done that,

56:11.920 --> 56:14.720
you usually update your router to push a DHCP option

56:14.720 --> 56:17.000
that says like, hey, go use this for DNS.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Or you could obviously go manually edit

56:19.000 --> 56:21.560
your DNS configuration on whatever client you wanna use.

56:21.560 --> 56:23.560
Right, you do have to adjust your client DNS.

56:23.560 --> 56:24.760
That's a good point to mention, right?

56:24.760 --> 56:27.400
Because otherwise, if you're not doing it the DHCP level,

56:27.400 --> 56:29.000
then you need to go adjust the DNS

56:29.000 --> 56:31.200
at anything that you want to use this thing.

56:31.200 --> 56:32.040
Yeah, exactly.

56:32.040 --> 56:33.440
Go point it at whatever IP you've given

56:33.440 --> 56:34.880
wherever you installed it.

56:34.880 --> 56:36.840
And then from there, it's got a modified,

56:36.840 --> 56:39.800
a forked version of DNS mask that it's using

56:39.800 --> 56:41.920
to go block all these things you can load in.

56:41.920 --> 56:43.800
Honestly, the web UI, it's pretty decent.

56:43.800 --> 56:45.600
They've got these fun little glowing counters.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.160
So every time it blocks a new request,

56:47.160 --> 56:48.760
you get, you see that kind of count up

56:48.760 --> 56:52.080
and you're like, oh yeah, more ads that got killed.

56:52.080 --> 56:52.960
And it makes it easy too.

56:52.960 --> 56:54.200
Like you could do this, obviously,

56:54.200 --> 56:55.320
I mean, I run DNS mask.

56:55.320 --> 56:58.200
I'm sure many of our listeners do for exactly those things,

56:58.200 --> 57:02.000
DHCP, DNS, but their forked version's got some improvements.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.400
And with the web UI, it makes it really easy

57:04.400 --> 57:06.200
to go manage what block list you're using,

57:06.200 --> 57:07.040
kind of tweak that.

57:07.040 --> 57:09.120
Cause maybe you, maybe you're really privacy conscious

57:09.120 --> 57:11.200
and you want to block every single thing from Facebook,

57:11.200 --> 57:12.720
all their IP space, anything,

57:12.720 --> 57:14.560
even remotely associated with it.

57:14.560 --> 57:17.400
That works for some people, but kind of would hurt,

57:17.400 --> 57:18.600
you know, if your kids are on there

57:18.600 --> 57:21.520
or your family members, that's not gonna work.

57:21.520 --> 57:23.080
Yeah, well, if you use like, for example,

57:23.080 --> 57:24.400
there's a bunch of default lists

57:24.400 --> 57:26.520
that you can subscribe to during the installation.

57:26.520 --> 57:29.200
And when you subscribe to just those defaults,

57:29.200 --> 57:32.360
there's even parts of YouTube that don't render quite right.

57:33.320 --> 57:36.880
And there's not as much of a direct action as you can take

57:36.880 --> 57:38.960
when you're using an ad blocker in your web browser,

57:38.960 --> 57:40.200
cause you could just go to the toolbar

57:40.200 --> 57:41.520
and turn it off for a brief moment.

57:41.520 --> 57:44.760
Then the broken webpage renders properly.

57:44.760 --> 57:46.840
When you do it at the network level,

57:46.840 --> 57:49.800
there's a little more work involved to fix that.

57:49.800 --> 57:52.440
But the advantage is A, you don't have to install

57:52.440 --> 57:55.520
ad blocking software on the individual end machines,

57:55.520 --> 58:00.280
but B, it's also preventing tracking and advertising

58:00.280 --> 58:02.480
on any of the devices on your network.

58:02.480 --> 58:06.240
So a smart television, your phones, your tablets,

58:06.240 --> 58:07.520
things that aren't web browsers

58:07.520 --> 58:10.160
that you can't install ad blocking extensions into

58:10.160 --> 58:11.800
can also be protected.

58:11.800 --> 58:16.240
And that's even more important now with smart televisions

58:16.240 --> 58:18.360
that basically ship from every manufacturer

58:18.360 --> 58:20.040
that monitor what you do.

58:20.040 --> 58:21.400
That's really nice.

58:21.400 --> 58:23.080
And it's not 100% peace of mind,

58:23.080 --> 58:24.720
but it's a bit more peace of mind.

58:24.720 --> 58:25.560
Well, that's a great point.

58:25.560 --> 58:27.840
I wouldn't, you know, I'm not gonna remove

58:27.840 --> 58:30.400
any of the like application specific ad blockers.

58:30.400 --> 58:31.680
Cause kinda like you said, you know,

58:31.680 --> 58:33.400
because they block it at a DNS level,

58:33.400 --> 58:35.880
you do sometimes see a space that was made for an ad

58:35.880 --> 58:37.680
that was supposed to be there, but doesn't load.

58:37.680 --> 58:40.280
So you don't see the ad, but it's not quite as seamless

58:40.280 --> 58:42.240
as some of the fancy ad blockers we have today.

58:42.240 --> 58:44.120
But with all the changes we've seen,

58:44.120 --> 58:46.560
browsers making some moves to make that harder,

58:46.560 --> 58:48.360
it's a nice fallback that you can have

58:48.360 --> 58:49.520
at the edge of your network.

58:49.520 --> 58:52.080
And like I said, if you just have,

58:52.080 --> 58:55.000
if you just have like a stock router

58:55.000 --> 58:56.560
that you got from your ISP,

58:56.560 --> 58:59.160
and you're not already managing your DNS and DHCP,

58:59.160 --> 59:01.800
and you're all interested, this is a great first step.

59:01.800 --> 59:04.320
Cause it's all the same technology under the hood

59:04.320 --> 59:06.040
with a nice interface to manage it.

59:06.040 --> 59:08.600
And even if the ad blocking isn't perfect,

59:08.600 --> 59:10.120
it still does those other services.

59:10.120 --> 59:12.240
So you only have something to gain.

59:12.240 --> 59:15.600
And there is a moderate performance improvement

59:15.600 --> 59:18.680
if you switch from checking a DNS lookup

59:18.680 --> 59:21.320
across the internet versus checking for that DNS lookup

59:21.320 --> 59:22.200
on your local LAN.

59:22.200 --> 59:24.280
It's just a faster response time.

59:24.280 --> 59:26.720
And DNS mass will start to catch those things.

59:26.720 --> 59:29.280
And then when another machine looks up google.com,

59:29.280 --> 59:31.640
it doesn't go all the way out to the internet or your ISP

59:31.640 --> 59:34.400
or Google DNS, it can just get it from your

59:34.400 --> 59:35.960
local DNS mass server.

59:35.960 --> 59:38.000
But I guess the skeptic in me

59:38.000 --> 59:39.840
would be listening to this right now.

59:39.840 --> 59:42.640
And I would challenge this, Wes, I would say,

59:42.640 --> 59:47.640
why not just use something like my own local files,

59:47.920 --> 59:50.440
like Etsy host and others where I could,

59:50.440 --> 59:52.200
I could create my own sinkholes.

59:52.200 --> 59:56.280
And I could essentially do what Pi-hole is doing

59:56.280 --> 59:58.400
just using my local configs.

59:58.400 --> 59:59.440
Yeah, you certainly could,

59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.120
but I honestly, I don't see you doing that.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.240
Whereas using the GUI for Pi-hole, you probably would.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.880
And you're always gonna have devices,

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.560
maybe you're just trying out a new distro

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.520
or you've opened something in incognito tab

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.240
and you forgot to enable the specific ad blocker extension

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.840
in incognito, will you still get all the benefits?

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:19.000
So you could still do it, but like they have it pretty easy.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.400
People have a lot of scripts out there

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.440
that have compatible blocking lists.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.400
And actually, Poppy makes a great point.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.920
You can also add whitelists if you're having trouble

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:30.240
or you always wanna know like all the requests to work,

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.400
always allow those.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.240
Yeah, I use Pi-hole at home.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:36.120
And one of the things we do is send out

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.840
some marketing emails and we use a third party service.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.240
And unfortunately that's blocked by Pi-hole

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.440
because for some reason people think that's spam.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.760
And I need to see those.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.160
And so I just whitelist that service on my Pi-hole

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.200
so that I can see it.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.640
But the thing you won't do, I mean, you could,

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.200
you could just go and put like these big lists

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.560
of blocked hosts in your Etsy host file and you're done.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.720
Right, you could do that.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.400
But you've got to keep that up to date

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.000
and Pi-hole has an automatic update system, right?

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.240
Also Pi-hole has a really nice reporting system.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.560
So you can actually see the top blocked domains,

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.640
the top rated domains, top clients on your network.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.120
So I can see which machines on my network

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:18.720
are doing the most DNS requests and where they're going.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:22.400
And I can make decisions that can affect the decisions

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.600
I make about the software that I install

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.980
or services that I enable and what extra things

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:30.280
I might want to take belt and braces to block.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.960
I think it's an amazing project and the guys behind it

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.400
have the absolute best intentions for it.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.360
It's just such a wholesome project, it's fantastic.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.200
I love it.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.020
That's a great point.

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.260
It is, I mean, kind of, it's just DNS mask on steroids,

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.440
but with a whole bunch of supporting community members

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.560
and a lot of active development.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.320
Chris, you also found, so like part of that is

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.880
they've been working part of this update

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.200
is using shared memory to make exporting

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.480
all the statistics they gather more efficient.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.320
And then they're implementing a Rust API

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.760
to just be able to grab that.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.800
Part of that means you can also have things

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.220
like this neat little GTK control panel you found

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:09.360
that'll show you all the things that you're blocking.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.640
Yeah, right there on your desktop,

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.000
you can get the stats from your Pi-hole system.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:13.840
Oh, really?

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:14.720
Yeah, isn't that neat?

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.320
Yeah, it's a GTK Python app.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.840
I had no idea.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.400
I'm logged into the web admin tool

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.640
and I look at the pretty graphs

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.560
and I see spikes at certain times of the day

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.840
when I know I've got cron jobs

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.200
that are doing loads of busy stuff

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.760
and I can see when the kids come home

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.720
because all their devices, IP addresses start showing up

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.120
and I can see they're all using YouTube

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:35.320
and Snapchat and Instagram and all that kind of stuff.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.040
I just love it.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.040
And the web admin tool is nice.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.100
It's good enough, that's all you need.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.320
I just, I dropped a link to it in the IRC,

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.520
but I'll also, I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.000
Awesome, I'm totally getting that.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.520
Now, the other thing that I was curious about

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.160
is we've gotten a lot of emails from the audience

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:56.760
about using this in a FreeNAS VM or on a PF

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:01.040
or doing like a KVM box with PF sense in a VM,

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.920
FreeNAS in a VM and Pi-Hole in a VM.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.240
And each one of these, obviously,

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.440
each one of these use cases,

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.080
they're not using a Raspberry Pi at all,

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.420
but they're taking advantage of the automated installation

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.560
where it walks you through

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.920
how to get all the subscriptions,

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.880
how to just set all that up.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.520
And obviously they're taking advantage of the updates.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.640
And it's still a very much like an appliance.

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.360
So you don't have to run it on a Raspberry Pi,

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.480
but you can just get the image

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.320
and then flash it to the Raspberry Pi.

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.000
But they've also now started shipping it

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.620
as a Docker container as well.

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:34.600
That's what I'm using to run it on my laptop.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.800
And honestly, it works pretty well.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.140
You gotta go fiddle with a few environmental variables

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:39.880
and supply those with your like,

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.200
the IP address of the machine that Docker is running on,

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.040
stuff like that.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.020
But honestly, they have decent instructions

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:46.160
and it just works.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.200
Now do be aware,

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.120
they've only recently got the cadence switch

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.720
so that when new releases come out,

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.500
new Docker builds are available,

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.080
but the Docker files aren't that complicated.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.260
You can build it yourself.

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:56.780
And the kind of the question

01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:58.480
when you look at all of those emails that came in,

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.320
the core of it is,

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.240
could this work for an enterprise LAN?

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.380
And when you look at the underlying technology

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:05.200
like DNS mask and whatnot,

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.360
it absolutely holds up.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.980
It really just depends on the resources

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.040
of the machines you deploy it on.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.880
You could absolutely use this

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.440
to provide ad blocking and malware blocking

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.760
across an entire LAN of employees.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.880
I think you could certainly test it out

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.440
on a subset of your estate,

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.920
like try out on the techies first

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.880
and then add this to your DHCP leases

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:31.020
for some parts of your user base

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.320
and slowly roll it out.

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.880
And as you add departments,

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:34.760
you'd find,

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.660
oh, well, so-and-so in accounts

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.800
needs access to this thing

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.760
and we need to add a white list for that.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.640
So I certainly think if you rolled it out

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.200
in a managed way,

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.600
you could use something like this, definitely.

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.440
Yeah, you could just,

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.120
initially a handful of users

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.640
where you switch their DNS manually

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.200
and just see how that goes for even one lease cycle

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.240
of the DHCP lease.

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.840
You could just see what happens.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.160
And the admin is really easy.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.060
While I've been talking to you,

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.280
I remembered, oh, I haven't updated it for a while.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.760
So I just SSHed into my Pi

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.280
and ran Pi-hole-up

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.120
and it's updated while I'm talking to you.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.560
It's brilliant.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.620
That's cool.

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.640
So what do you think, Wes,

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.120
after trying it out for the show,

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.280
are you gonna stick with it at the home network?

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.120
Yeah, I think so.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.120
I mean, I really don't see why not.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.000
I've been doing some rebuilding in the home network anyway,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
simplifying things.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.040
And I like having, right now,

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.400
my DNS and routing stuff

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.160
is a little too commingled for my tastes.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.740
And if I can have an appliance that does the same thing,

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:28.580
I'm in.

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.160
Mm, I like that.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.560
We'll have some of Wes's notes

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.960
linked in our Linux Unplug blog,

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.320
which is linked up at the top of linuxunplug.com site.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.020
And he's got information here

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.040
about versions that they officially support

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.520
that aren't on Raspberry Pi on there,

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.200
whitelist, blacklist information,

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.000
how to run the Docker container,

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.520
how to add additional block lists,

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.840
how to just grab the PyHole installer

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.040
and run it on your own Linux, all of that.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.320
So that, as well as additional resources,

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.960
are linked in the show notes.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.820
And please do let us know your experiences with it.

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.200
I know it's been around for a while.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.960
It's on us that we haven't talked about it, really.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.800
That's our bad.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.040
And so this was our chance to do it.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:08.300
Let us know your experiences, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:09.480
And I don't know, Mr. Payne,

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.940
is there anything else we should relay about PyHole

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:13.520
and the new version 4.2?

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.620
No, it's really easy.

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:16.320
If you're interested in trying it out,

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.640
there's no reason not to.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.200
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:22.240
Yeah, it gets the Linux Unplug seal of approval.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.960
And I have a sense we'll be talking about more

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:24.800
in the post-show.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.920
But I do wanna head out of here with an app pick.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:31.320
It's great to see it if you've decided to spend the money,

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.560
like Mr. Wimper's has, on a nice, fancy Nvidia card.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.740
And you look over at the folks on Windows

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.520
and you see them with their graphical overclocking tools.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:43.080
And you think to yourself, why?

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.180
Why can't I have that?

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:46.520
I am green with envy.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.540
Well, I have good news for you

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.080
because that is a new tool designed

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:52.080
to let you manage your fans, your CPU,

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:55.760
I guess the GPU of your Nvidia card under Linux.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:58.720
And it's literally called Green with Envy.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.880
And Joey has a great write-up with some screenshots

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.200
over at omgabuntu.co.uk if you wanna check it out.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:07.120
You'll generally get general CPU stats,

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.440
I'm sorry, GPU stats, power, clock information,

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.080
like the rate, GPU temperature, the fan speed.

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.760
You can set up custom fan profiles.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.180
You can view historical data.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.480
And yes, yes, you can overclock.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.920
Finally, Mr. Wimperis, are you gonna give this a go?

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.280
No, cause it's easier to do through the API and the script.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.520
Oh, okay.

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.840
So I've already put the effort in.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.880
Yeah, I've got a script and yeah.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:38.180
I mean, certainly having a GUI is a great thing, right?

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:39.960
Because when you buy the Nvidia cards

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:42.320
and you get your Windows drivers from insert name

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.920
of board partner of Nvidia,

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:48.680
they have their own skin on top of the drivers

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:52.120
and their own overclocking utilities.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.080
And they're all pushing the same parameters around.

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:58.400
It's all about clock speed, memory frequency,

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.000
fan profile and power limit.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.240
They're basically the four things that you can tweak.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:05.360
So, and you can do that through Nvidia settings

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.840
and Nvidia SMI and stuff like that.

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.440
But having a GUI, which reproduces the custom UIs

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.040
that you see on these board partners, Windows drivers

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:15.880
is no bad thing.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:18.120
And it's a little bit more computing parity

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.560
for Linux users.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.400
Yep.

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.240
Completely agree.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.200
I don't actually think I'm going to do it,

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.560
but I'd love to see it.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.640
Oh, you should totally do it.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.480
Really?

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.440
Oh, I'm squeezing tons more performance

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:30.680
out of my 1080 Ti with this.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.520
Really?

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.340
It's astonishing.

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:36.480
Yeah, I've got over a gigahertz memory clock uplift

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.400
on my 1080 Ti.

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:43.400
And I think between 350 and 500 megahertz core clock,

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.720
and that requires that you up the power limit.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.440
So the power governor for Nvidia cards is quite constrained.

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.520
And so you push the power limit up,

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.520
which means you can push more juice into the card

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.720
in order to support those clock and memory frequencies.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.000
And then of course, to do that,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.840
you then need to configure the fan profile

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.480
to make sure you don't burn the thing out.

01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:06.200
So yeah, all the tools are there.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.000
Not even sure if my GPU doc has a fan.

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.040
So what I have discovered is if you've got

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.960
mobile Nvidia things,

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.240
so the sort of the M series from the nine,

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.320
you know, the nine series and the 10 series

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:25.160
and the max Q stuff.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.880
So far, I've only got a few of those available to me.

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:31.400
So far, you're not able to overclock those.

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:34.080
Even if you turn on all the magic bits

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.760
to strictly enable that,

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:38.040
when you actually try and poke at those values,

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.720
they all come back as their read only

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.480
and you can't actually change them.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.840
So question for the audience,

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.400
have you got a max Q or a mobile series Nvidia chipset

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:50.960
and have you figured out how to overclock it?

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.600
If so, come and join us next week and tell us how.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.520
Tell us how to do that.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.200
That would be really good to know.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.240
Well, all right.

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.320
So hey, while I've got you for a moment,

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.240
I saw there was a flash update

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.200
over on the Ubuntu podcast feeds,

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.800
a flash podcast with a very important announcement

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.800
about a community meetup on March 16th, that's a Saturday.

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.360
What do people need to know?

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.120
Yeah, we're breaking with tradition a little bit

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:19.000
this year on the Ubuntu podcast

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000
and we're gonna have a listener get together

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.760
ahead of the next season to have a chat with the listeners,

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.160
find out what they like, what they like to hear more of

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:36.160
and use their feedback to go into our curry meetup

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.320
where we decide what we're gonna do for the coming year.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:45.320
So yeah, it's gonna be in Reading in the UK on March 16th.

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.200
