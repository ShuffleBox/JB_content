WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.640
Well, if you bet that the LinuxCopter would make it more than a year,

00:04.240 --> 00:05.120
you might be able to cash in.

00:05.120 --> 00:08.920
It looks like the Pioneer Little Chopter has made the one-year mark on Mars,

00:08.920 --> 00:10.560
which I can't believe.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.360
I don't know, Wes, I would have guessed six months.

00:12.440 --> 00:13.480
It's been six months.

00:13.720 --> 00:16.680
I think after it did so well, I thought it would just keep going.

00:16.720 --> 00:19.680
But from the start, I was, I was pretty nervous, you know, like you just,

00:19.680 --> 00:22.680
until these are proved out, anything could happen on Mars.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.920
I'm also still bracing myself every time I see one of these articles.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.960
I'm like bracing myself for, well, it did so good and exceeded our

00:28.960 --> 00:32.600
expectations, but it's definitely starting to fade now.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.480
There's too much dust on the solar panels, right?

00:34.480 --> 00:36.400
Cause it's not like they can go out there and brush those things off.

00:36.440 --> 00:40.720
But there's a quote here that says, we're quote, still going very strong.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.760
And that was from the deputy operations lead at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

00:45.520 --> 00:47.120
So they would know.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.040
More exciting science to come.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.600
It's probably because it runs Linux, right?

00:50.600 --> 00:59.800
It's gotta be.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.360
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.040
My name is Chris.

01:04.040 --> 01:04.920
My name is Wes.

01:05.080 --> 01:05.960
And my name is Brent.

01:06.160 --> 01:06.880
Hello, gentlemen.

01:07.080 --> 01:08.120
Thanks for joining me today.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.120
Hello.

01:09.200 --> 01:14.240
You know, last week we had fun talking about low end $15 Linux boxes.

01:14.640 --> 01:18.360
Well, this week we're going to the other extreme and we're reviewing a new

01:18.360 --> 01:21.240
Ryzen powered kudu from a system 76.

01:21.880 --> 01:24.120
I gave this thing the full ML special.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.840
No, not machine learning.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.600
The Michael Larable special.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.680
No, actually, it was machine learning benchmarks from the Franxx test suite.

01:31.080 --> 01:34.160
But I also just punished the heck out of it with my Steam library because.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.680
Yeah, it's got an RTX 3060 in it.

01:37.160 --> 01:40.480
I don't think I've used a graphics card that new since the pandemic began.

01:40.520 --> 01:41.600
So I was excited.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.640
So after we talk about what I did with this thing and who I think this laptop

01:46.640 --> 01:50.160
is going to be good for, we'll round it all out with some great emails,

01:50.360 --> 01:53.800
some great emails, a whole rash of pics.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.520
It's a rash, Wes, and more.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.000
So you're going to want to stick around for all of that.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.080
I mean, I would.

01:59.440 --> 02:02.640
But before we go any further, we got to say hello to our virtual log

02:02.640 --> 02:03.640
time appropriate greetings.

02:03.640 --> 02:04.080
Mumble room.

02:04.200 --> 02:04.560
Hello.

02:04.560 --> 02:07.680
Hello, hello, Brent.

02:07.840 --> 02:11.200
Good to have you all in there today on a Sunday on a Sunday.

02:11.240 --> 02:11.960
Come on and join us.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.200
Sometimes you're listening to this.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.160
You want to join us on Sunday?

02:14.160 --> 02:21.160
JB live dot TV, we usually get the stream going around noon, 30, sometimes noon.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.440
There's just kind of be like the standby screen, but, you know, you can get there,

02:23.440 --> 02:27.240
get yourself set up, get your chair ready, walk your dogs.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.320
Wes is always good about that.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.640
You know, before he does something for a while, he goes and walks the dogs.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.120
I mean, yeah, you got to that way.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.880
You don't get any annoying interruptions while you're trying to enjoy yourself.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.960
There is that there is that there is that advantage, I suppose.

02:37.960 --> 02:43.760
So before we get to the kudo kudu, we'll try not to do that the whole episode, I

02:43.760 --> 02:47.800
wanted to talk about our thoughts on Linode and the acquisition with Akamai, because

02:47.800 --> 02:51.520
this has probably been the number one thing that's come in via like Telegram

02:51.520 --> 02:52.040
and Twitter.

02:52.720 --> 02:56.560
And so I wanted to take a few days and think about it because like, you know,

02:56.720 --> 03:00.320
it's hard to really say anything at this point because the deal is still so new.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.240
But I know that all of us and we've watched or even been through good or bad

03:04.240 --> 03:06.880
transitions, so I know some of us are like, oh, it's going to happen.

03:06.880 --> 03:11.560
I've seen that I felt like that vibe, you know, and it's it's totally understandable.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.400
But the truth is, you know, we don't know yet.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.240
We're going to watch and see.

03:15.240 --> 03:19.160
But we do know that Linode has a pretty good history with transitions.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.360
It's tough transitions.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.000
I mean, I've watched them deal with a lot of that.

03:24.840 --> 03:30.160
And I think the other thing that gives me some comfort for sure is that Akamai

03:30.160 --> 03:33.880
doesn't have a compute VPS solution.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.880
There's not like duplicate work being done there.

03:37.160 --> 03:39.920
They're just going to roll Linode into their existing thing.

03:39.920 --> 03:44.000
And yeah, yeah, it seems like they're adding Linode as a way to give their

03:44.000 --> 03:48.120
large customers good, fast compute resources that complements their worldwide

03:48.120 --> 03:48.640
CDN.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.640
That's probably a best case scenario because you figure like these folks at

03:52.640 --> 03:55.480
Linode have been hard at this for like 19 years, right?

03:55.480 --> 04:03.560
And so where do you go in a world where AWS, Google, Amazon, Amazon,

04:03.560 --> 04:07.720
and Microsoft are sucking all of the air out of the room, right?

04:07.720 --> 04:08.880
Like, what do you do here?

04:08.880 --> 04:15.520
And if Linode was, I say, acquired by AWS, for example, that'd be a lot of

04:15.520 --> 04:16.600
duplication of effort.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.600
I would be pretty concerned about the future of Linode.

04:19.600 --> 04:25.280
And, you know, I look out there at the market and there's not anywhere I really

04:25.280 --> 04:26.760
want to move our systems to.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.920
We have over a dozen boxes in production on Linode.

04:29.920 --> 04:33.240
And I don't really want to move anywhere else.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.840
Linode has like the sweet spot there.

04:34.840 --> 04:35.840
And this isn't part of the ad.

04:35.840 --> 04:36.840
This is just how I feel about it.

04:36.840 --> 04:41.560
And I'm looking at it from like, not as like, oh, JB's kind of concerned about

04:41.560 --> 04:44.600
future sponsor revenue and how we're going to be sustainable as a business.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.560
Like putting that aside, I'm looking at it from a customer who uses this for my

04:47.560 --> 04:52.320
business and I'm really glad they didn't get bought by something like a Microsoft.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.320
Yeah, really?

04:53.320 --> 04:54.320
Geez.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.520
It'd just be, you know, it just sort of, the product would fade away.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.920
Guess we're using Azure now.

04:58.920 --> 04:59.920
Yeah.

04:59.920 --> 05:00.920
Yeah.

05:00.920 --> 05:06.360
You know, you think about it too, I hope this works out for the best simply because

05:06.360 --> 05:09.920
I don't really see like another Linode starting at this point.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.920
They started at a special time.

05:11.920 --> 05:15.880
And now with AWS and the other big cloud providers, it doesn't seem like anybody's

05:15.880 --> 05:16.880
going to...

05:16.880 --> 05:17.880
How are you going to catch up?

05:17.880 --> 05:18.880
Yeah.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.760
Which VCs are you going to trick into, you know, funding you to compete against these

05:21.760 --> 05:23.720
monsters at this point?

05:23.720 --> 05:27.800
So I feel like as far as like, you know, you can go get a Linux box that you can SSH into

05:27.800 --> 05:30.560
and it's a full OS that you have access to.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.040
Do whatever you want on?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.680
That's a bit of a dying breed.

05:33.680 --> 05:40.240
And so there's a lot at stake here, but I can't see like quitting Linode in protest

05:40.240 --> 05:43.800
over this because A, the product's still the same product, right?

05:43.800 --> 05:44.800
The product hasn't changed.

05:44.800 --> 05:45.800
Right.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.800
Yeah.

05:46.800 --> 05:47.800
If that doesn't change then...

05:47.800 --> 05:52.600
And if a bunch of us took our business away in protest, that would only kind of accelerate

05:52.600 --> 05:55.820
a future we don't want to have happen.

05:55.820 --> 05:59.060
So like, I'm not going to quit over...I'm not going to stop being a customer over this

05:59.060 --> 06:03.240
and I'm not going to stop having them sponsor our shows over this because it hasn't changed

06:03.240 --> 06:04.240
the last 19 years.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.240
It's a new era.

06:05.240 --> 06:09.640
It means it's a new era and we don't really know where things are going to go.

06:09.640 --> 06:13.760
And it's these waves in the industry that the show has rid since the very beginning.

06:13.760 --> 06:18.880
I mean, the whole network has sort of observed these trends and rode these waves.

06:18.880 --> 06:23.680
I feel like all these changes are happening in the backdrop of the podcast advertising

06:23.680 --> 06:33.040
market getting rougher because the reality is Spotify and YouTube are sucking a lot of

06:33.040 --> 06:34.040
the oxygen out of the room.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.080
They're just so dominant now.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.320
There's another key piece to it too.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.840
It's not just their network effect.

06:39.840 --> 06:43.840
They give the advertiser a single point to sell.

06:43.840 --> 06:49.740
They go to a dashboard, they pick the demographic, they pick all of the options about runtime.

06:49.740 --> 06:52.440
There's no email chains and back and forth with individual creators.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.440
No negotiating.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.760
It's all just automated.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.680
That's why Facebook ads do so well too.

06:57.680 --> 07:04.400
It's like taking the Facebook ad model and applying it to podcasts, including the monitoring.

07:04.400 --> 07:10.680
So Linode is like super pivotal in helping keep podcasting decentralized and independent.

07:10.680 --> 07:17.160
I also feel like ultimately podcasting can't hitch its wagon to whatever is the big wave

07:17.160 --> 07:20.560
in the industry right now because these waves fade over time and they transition.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.560
That's what happens, right?

07:21.560 --> 07:22.560
That's this industry.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.520
That's the novel we want to have happen to the shows.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.360
So I'll tell you, this is a little bit of confession time.

07:27.360 --> 07:34.080
I don't think I've ever said this on air, but this whole sponsor race, always trying

07:34.080 --> 07:39.480
to get the next sale, the stress of that is ultimately the number one factor that led

07:39.480 --> 07:47.140
me to sell JB back in 2018 because a sponsor relationship can take anywhere from two months

07:47.140 --> 07:51.280
if you're extremely lucky, that's probably the shortest deal I've ever experienced, to

07:51.280 --> 07:52.660
about a year.

07:52.660 --> 07:55.920
If anybody's ever worked with sales or worked with a salesperson, you know what I'm talking

07:55.920 --> 07:57.440
about.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.120
It takes a ton of investment in time.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.200
It takes reaching out every single day.

08:03.200 --> 08:09.760
It takes being willing to be told no 20 times for every yes.

08:09.760 --> 08:14.200
It means sometimes you're constantly worried about how you're going to balance all of this.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.740
Then of course there's the meta pressure of making sure that you serve the audience first,

08:18.740 --> 08:24.920
the content isn't impacted, like there's so much stress behind it that it was ultimately

08:24.920 --> 08:29.120
the number one factor in why I sold because it was impacting my health.

08:29.120 --> 08:33.360
That's why when we talk about things like the value for value payment systems or the

08:33.360 --> 08:39.720
Jupiter.party membership, I can't see, and maybe I hope I'm wrong, but I can't see a

08:39.720 --> 08:45.600
future 10 years down the road when I turn 50 where I'm still doing this unless it's

08:45.600 --> 08:46.600
audience funded.

08:46.600 --> 08:50.560
I just can't really see that sustainably working out because I'll probably die before then

08:50.560 --> 08:55.560
to be honest with you that the, what has become really kind of clear to me in the second year

08:55.560 --> 08:59.160
is a lot of the pressure and stresses that led me to sell.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.360
I can feel them building again.

09:01.360 --> 09:04.840
I'm already experiencing health side effects that I don't really feel like talking about

09:04.840 --> 09:08.880
on air and it's a very dynamic marketplace.

09:08.880 --> 09:15.720
The tech industry, specifically the very technical aspect of it is extremely fluid.

09:15.720 --> 09:20.160
I would not have been able to do this if Linode wasn't such a great business partner to work

09:20.160 --> 09:21.160
with.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.540
They made it okay to do sponsorships again for me.

09:24.540 --> 09:28.900
They were the first to answer my email.

09:28.900 --> 09:35.480
When I jumped on a video call with them, they had JB Swag on the desk and it has been a

09:35.480 --> 09:39.080
great relationship since day one.

09:39.080 --> 09:43.400
Since I knew I was going independent, but I couldn't say anything public.

09:43.400 --> 09:49.400
Since that moment forward, they were just right there supporting us and so I'm not going

09:49.400 --> 09:54.120
anywhere with them and as far as I'm concerned, these guys have earned a payout after 19 years

09:54.120 --> 09:59.180
of hard work, guys and gals of course, but we don't know what the future will hold.

09:59.180 --> 10:01.360
They don't know what the future will hold.

10:01.360 --> 10:05.380
Wes and I have been through acquisitions and we know how it goes.

10:05.380 --> 10:09.880
The staff aren't aware and things are fluid, they're dynamic, but nobody's going to also

10:09.880 --> 10:11.000
throw away a valuable business.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.800
They didn't spend nearly a billion dollars on Linode to just throw out what it does.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.760
That's not how you make good on an investment.

10:17.760 --> 10:23.200
So I am of the opinion that when it comes to working with potential possible sponsors,

10:23.200 --> 10:28.120
we couldn't have found better alignment with Linode because we do use them, right?

10:28.120 --> 10:29.600
Yeah, absolutely.

10:29.600 --> 10:37.120
And they're clearly providing a valuable service for our audience and that $100 credit is legit.

10:37.120 --> 10:42.280
That's like real monies that you can use on their platform for a while, right?

10:42.280 --> 10:45.240
And I don't like AWS, I don't like Azure.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.700
It's way too expensive, it's way too complicated.

10:47.700 --> 10:51.580
The dashboards are like their own proprietary land now and I don't want to have to interface

10:51.580 --> 10:52.580
with any of that.

10:52.580 --> 10:56.160
I want a Linux box.

10:56.160 --> 10:59.960
Maybe I'll orchestrate it, centrally manage it, maybe I'll use containers, maybe I'll

10:59.960 --> 11:04.560
just use it as a traditional Linux box and I'll gasp, maybe I'll install something from

11:04.560 --> 11:05.560
the repo.

11:05.560 --> 11:09.920
I want that kind of flexibility and there's only a few businesses now that offer that

11:09.920 --> 11:15.200
and so I still think Linode is the best of them, regardless of this, but we'll see.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.200
And that's just it, right?

11:16.200 --> 11:17.200
Like we won't.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.200
We won't know.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.200
It's a long kind of time frame.

11:19.200 --> 11:24.160
We have friends there and so far none of them are panicking, so that's usually a pretty

11:24.160 --> 11:26.040
good sign.

11:26.040 --> 11:31.240
But yeah, it's a stressful thing and managing sales while you're also running four or five

11:31.240 --> 11:35.720
shows and running a business and I'm not trying to complain here, I love what I do.

11:35.720 --> 11:38.480
I don't mean to come across like I'm complaining, I'm just saying.

11:38.480 --> 11:41.240
It's frustrating to you when you're focused, when you're having to spend so much time focusing

11:41.240 --> 11:45.000
on the sponsorship, not that you don't value those relationships, but it's a secondary

11:45.000 --> 11:47.520
thing to making really good shows.

11:47.520 --> 11:50.360
And I just don't know if I'd ever have a relationship like I've had with Linode again.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.080
Maybe it's possible, you know?

11:52.080 --> 11:53.080
So I hope it just continues.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.560
I hope they want to keep working with us forever.

11:54.560 --> 11:55.560
We'll see.

11:55.560 --> 11:58.640
We just don't know at this point, but they're still, you know, they've still got ads on

11:58.640 --> 12:01.780
here and we're still happy to run them for as long as they want to.

12:01.780 --> 12:03.320
So that's sort of it.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.320
And you know what?

12:04.320 --> 12:07.080
I've chatted with them briefly about this because really, what can they say, right?

12:07.080 --> 12:11.800
But we've chatted and you know, business continues as usual for now.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.280
That's the word.

12:13.280 --> 12:18.520
And I hope that maybe even this inspires somebody else to invest in this area.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.520
We'll see.

12:19.520 --> 12:20.520
We'll see.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.600
And you know, Akamai kind of makes a lot of sense.

12:22.600 --> 12:27.680
I couldn't really, if you're going to ask me who else really could make this acquisition,

12:27.680 --> 12:29.480
I can think of a lot of bad names.

12:29.480 --> 12:32.520
They've been around much like Linode for a long time as sort of an independent actor

12:32.520 --> 12:33.520
in the space.

12:33.520 --> 12:37.880
So all respect to the folks that work at Cloudflare, but I'm kind of glad it wasn't Cloudflare.

12:37.880 --> 12:43.200
In conclusion, if you find value out of these shows, I would love your support Jupiter.party

12:43.200 --> 12:48.680
so you can support all of the shows or you could become a core contributor at unpluggedcore.com

12:48.680 --> 12:50.240
and support just this show directly.

12:50.240 --> 12:55.240
Because you know, when I get to a certain age, there may be a point and I'm not saying

12:55.240 --> 13:00.240
this jokingly, but there may be a point where maybe the only shows I still do are the shows

13:00.240 --> 13:04.660
that have enough member support because you know, at some point my health will have to

13:04.660 --> 13:06.400
come first and this isn't an ultimatum.

13:06.400 --> 13:09.880
I don't mean to make it sound weird like this, it's just, this is what's been on my mind

13:09.880 --> 13:10.880
in the news.

13:10.880 --> 13:11.880
This is what I've been processing.

13:11.880 --> 13:15.480
And I want to be transparent with everybody because if there's ever a shift that happens,

13:15.480 --> 13:19.240
I want everyone to know what my thought process is and I don't want to surprise anybody.

13:19.240 --> 13:23.800
A lot of you have been listening for a really long time, following this journey, and I

13:23.800 --> 13:25.480
just want to be straight with you.

13:25.480 --> 13:29.680
Right now everything's fine, but you know, there could be a day where I decide we need

13:29.680 --> 13:33.560
to scale back a little bit for health reasons and it's going to be the shows that have member

13:33.560 --> 13:36.380
support that stay on the air.

13:36.380 --> 13:40.840
I would love one day to just do these shows until the day I die and have it be member

13:40.840 --> 13:46.580
supported because I have been doing this for 15 years.

13:46.580 --> 13:52.040
About 13 of those years, maybe 12 of those years have been primarily sponsor funded and

13:52.040 --> 13:53.820
I figure I can do that.

13:53.820 --> 13:58.720
I'm a pretty good salesman, I feel, and I have a pretty good success rate once I actually

13:58.720 --> 14:01.620
get into a conversation with somebody.

14:01.620 --> 14:06.580
So I feel like I could keep doing it for a while, but you know, the tricky thing is when

14:06.580 --> 14:12.640
I'm selling ads for Linux Unplugged, I'm typically not selling an ad for self-hosted or Koda

14:12.640 --> 14:13.760
Radio.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.740
Every now and then you can bundle them, every now and then a sponsor is interested in that,

14:17.740 --> 14:24.120
but most of the time energy spent on one show is energy not spent on another show and you

14:24.120 --> 14:28.540
could see how when you have four or five things you're buying, you're selling ads against,

14:28.540 --> 14:34.060
how that really multiplies in time and stress and anxiety, especially when it's just one

14:34.060 --> 14:35.520
person doing it.

14:35.520 --> 14:39.100
So my thoughts on this really are if you're in a position where you can support us through

14:39.100 --> 14:43.700
a membership program or you want to participate in the value for value system with one of

14:43.700 --> 14:49.600
the new podcast apps at newpodcastapps.com, please do because long-term that's probably

14:49.600 --> 14:56.940
what's going to make it all viable and long-term I'd rather the network spend its energy on

14:56.940 --> 15:02.460
super serving the show content to super serve the audience and taking the energy that we

15:02.460 --> 15:05.100
have and putting it 100% into the content.

15:05.100 --> 15:08.640
The only way to do that is with membership programs.

15:08.640 --> 15:12.700
Now that all said, we've made it work for a while, I think we can keep making it work

15:12.700 --> 15:17.060
for a while, but I just wanted to be straight with everybody where we're at on that.

15:17.060 --> 15:21.300
And we will get to some of the boost messages that have been sent in using the new podcast

15:21.300 --> 15:22.300
apps.

15:22.300 --> 15:26.780
This is my new favorite thing, but we'll talk about in the feedback because now it is time

15:26.780 --> 15:27.780
to talk about this laptop.

15:27.780 --> 15:29.020
Yeah, we got some work to do.

15:29.020 --> 15:30.020
So we have the new CUDA.

15:30.020 --> 15:34.340
I think this is like the sixth generation from system 76.

15:34.340 --> 15:38.900
This thing is a multitasking Linux boost.

15:38.900 --> 15:42.960
It has an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX CPU.

15:42.960 --> 15:47.660
It turbos up to 4.6 gigahertz.

15:47.660 --> 15:49.420
Take that in for a second.

15:49.420 --> 15:54.660
It turbos up to 4.6 gigahertz, eight cores, 16 threads.

15:54.660 --> 16:00.840
That also is packed with an Nvidia RTX 3060 GPU.

16:00.840 --> 16:06.620
It has an integrated GPU as well, which is an RX Vega 8 class GPU, which is still actually

16:06.620 --> 16:07.940
surprisingly great.

16:07.940 --> 16:09.580
Right, that's no slouch.

16:09.580 --> 16:13.300
You could really just get by on the integrated graphics for most jobs until you need to do

16:13.300 --> 16:15.940
something that really pushes that GPU.

16:15.940 --> 16:21.180
It has a 1920 by 1080 FHD matte display.

16:21.180 --> 16:28.700
So it's a 1080p display, however, it's very vibrant and it runs at 144 hertz.

16:28.700 --> 16:30.100
It does seem pretty darn smooth.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.540
Yeah, it really adds to that.

16:31.540 --> 16:32.540
That is the thing about it.

16:32.540 --> 16:36.700
It's got two M.2 SSD slots in it, so you could put two disks.

16:36.700 --> 16:40.780
Everything's configured with 500 gigs, a single M.2 with 500 gigs.

16:40.780 --> 16:44.100
It's got kind of a weird smattering of connectivity.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.860
I thought this was really odd.

16:45.860 --> 16:48.040
I just don't get the USB ports on this.

16:48.040 --> 16:55.100
So it has one USB-C Gen 2, but it doesn't support power delivery over that.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.700
Doesn't support Thunderbolt because, again, this is an AMD system, most of them don't.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.540
I like none of them really.

17:00.540 --> 17:02.900
But it does support DisplayPort out that.

17:02.900 --> 17:05.940
So you got a USB-C port that can do DisplayPort.

17:05.940 --> 17:10.460
You've also got HDMI out, and you've got a mini DisplayPort, and you've got the internal

17:10.460 --> 17:11.460
screen.

17:11.460 --> 17:12.460
Wow.

17:12.460 --> 17:14.940
So you could pretty easily run four screens off this sucker.

17:14.940 --> 17:25.100
But continuing on with the USB, it's got one Gen 2 Type-A, one Gen 1 Type-A, and one 2.0

17:25.100 --> 17:29.540
Type-A. So it's got three different types of Type-A USB ports.

17:29.540 --> 17:30.540
Oh, okay.

17:30.540 --> 17:33.460
Maybe that's good if you've got some sort of very fiddly USB device.

17:33.460 --> 17:34.460
I guess.

17:34.460 --> 17:37.340
And, like, wouldn't it just be nice if they were all just one generation and it was the

17:37.340 --> 17:39.260
latest generation?

17:39.260 --> 17:42.500
That feels like something most users might not understand.

17:42.500 --> 17:43.500
And you put in a disk...

17:43.500 --> 17:44.500
That could be very confusing, yeah.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.500
Yeah, yeah.

17:45.500 --> 17:46.500
But what are you going to do?

17:46.500 --> 17:50.060
I don't think they necessarily have control over the board layout and that kind of stuff.

17:50.060 --> 17:53.520
It has a whopper of a power supply with a barrel connector.

17:53.520 --> 17:59.380
It's a 230-watt power supply because, I mean, again, this thing is taking some serious power

17:59.380 --> 18:05.060
when it needs it, rocking a 5.5-millimeter barrel connector on that thing.

18:05.060 --> 18:10.560
It's got a 48-watt-hour battery, about 49-watt-hours, really, four-cell lithium-ion battery.

18:10.560 --> 18:16.380
So this is not a lot of battery life, especially when you turn on the RTX.

18:16.380 --> 18:18.500
It actually did better than I expected.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.100
I got, like, a solid three hours.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.100
Okay.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.100
I did not expect that.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.100
That's, I mean, that's...

18:23.100 --> 18:24.100
Yeah.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.660
That's long enough to hang out in a coffee shop for a while or something.

18:25.660 --> 18:30.740
And definitely long enough to, like, get something done if you forgot your power adapter.

18:30.740 --> 18:32.380
You know, that too.

18:32.380 --> 18:38.540
But not long enough to go all day, you know, nowhere near, like, the MacBook Pro level.

18:38.540 --> 18:41.620
But I did benchmark this against a MacBook Pro.

18:41.620 --> 18:47.380
Now, granted, not a lot of the machine learning stuff is actually available on the Mac.

18:47.380 --> 18:50.660
And from what I can kind of tell, it doesn't seem like what is available is necessarily

18:50.660 --> 18:51.660
M1-optimized.

18:51.660 --> 18:53.240
So keep that in mind.

18:53.240 --> 18:58.060
But I did do a little Pharaonic's benchmark comparison against this KUDO and a MacBook

18:58.060 --> 18:59.060
Pro Max.

18:59.060 --> 19:00.060
Oh.

19:00.060 --> 19:01.060
Okay.

19:01.060 --> 19:03.900
Totally loaded out MacBook Pro Max.

19:03.900 --> 19:05.300
And fresh boot on both.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.300
Still running Pop!

19:06.300 --> 19:07.300
OS on this guy.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.300
Latest version, I assume, of Mac OS on the Mac.

19:09.300 --> 19:10.300
I don't know if I...

19:10.300 --> 19:11.300
But I'm pretty sure it's the latest.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.300
You're not updating it?

19:12.300 --> 19:13.300
I don't see it.

19:13.300 --> 19:18.380
I have to say, the KUDO kicked the butt of the MacBook Pro in just about every category

19:18.380 --> 19:22.580
where the MacBook Pro could run a viable comparison.

19:22.580 --> 19:23.620
With just a few exceptions.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.380
There were actually a couple of exceptions where the MacBook Pro pulled ahead.

19:26.380 --> 19:27.380
Okay.

19:27.380 --> 19:29.060
I bet those are probably M1-optimized benchmarks.

19:29.060 --> 19:30.680
I didn't dig further than that.

19:30.680 --> 19:37.300
But for the most part, almost universally, the KUDO just kicked butt, especially in the

19:37.300 --> 19:42.700
RTX version, accelerated versions of the benchmarks, because I compared it with the AMD GPU and

19:42.700 --> 19:43.700
with the video.

19:43.700 --> 19:44.700
Oh, the built-in compared to...

19:44.700 --> 19:45.700
Yeah.

19:45.700 --> 19:48.620
And when you turn on the RTX graphics, it just takes things up to a level that the MacBook

19:48.620 --> 19:49.740
can't touch.

19:49.740 --> 19:52.460
So there is definitely more performance to be had there.

19:52.460 --> 19:54.140
At least in these Ferronix benchmarks.

19:54.140 --> 19:56.180
If you're doing something that really takes advantage of a GPU.

19:56.180 --> 19:57.180
Yeah.

19:57.180 --> 20:00.140
And he's downloading real tools like TensorFlow and running them against the system.

20:00.140 --> 20:01.500
So they're legit tools.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.700
They're not just like synthetic benchmarks.

20:03.700 --> 20:06.060
The trade-off obviously is the KUDO is making more noise.

20:06.060 --> 20:07.060
Yeah.

20:07.060 --> 20:08.060
I've got it going here right in front of me.

20:08.060 --> 20:09.060
You may be able to hear.

20:09.060 --> 20:10.060
Maybe.

20:10.060 --> 20:11.060
Is that where we're...

20:11.060 --> 20:12.060
Are we hearing that right now?

20:12.060 --> 20:13.060
I think so.

20:13.060 --> 20:14.060
Oh, you're right.

20:14.060 --> 20:15.060
What are you doing?

20:15.060 --> 20:16.060
That's making it go.

20:16.060 --> 20:18.460
I thought I heard that breaking through your gate.

20:18.460 --> 20:19.460
I just...

20:19.460 --> 20:20.460
I had opened Steam a while ago.

20:20.460 --> 20:21.460
Maybe that.

20:21.460 --> 20:22.460
You're downloading, right?

20:22.460 --> 20:23.460
Oh, probably.

20:23.460 --> 20:24.460
Yeah.

20:24.460 --> 20:25.460
While we're streaming was...

20:25.460 --> 20:26.460
Geez.

20:26.460 --> 20:29.020
Well, I had to put the thing to the test.

20:29.020 --> 20:32.580
So it definitely has a fan noise that the MacBook does not.

20:32.580 --> 20:33.580
You can hear...

20:33.580 --> 20:34.580
You can kind of hear it right now.

20:34.580 --> 20:41.620
Here, why don't you point your microphone down at it or pick it up, yeah.

20:41.620 --> 20:43.380
And now you've picked it up and pointed at the mic.

20:43.380 --> 20:44.620
So of course that's...

20:44.620 --> 20:46.900
But it can kick up.

20:46.900 --> 20:50.020
It's I think they've managed the fan curve here.

20:50.020 --> 20:53.940
I don't actually know this for sure, but it seems to me it goes quite a while before it

20:53.940 --> 20:54.940
kicks in.

20:54.940 --> 20:59.300
And then once it kicks in, it stays spun up for a bit and then very slowly ramps back

20:59.300 --> 21:00.300
down.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.300
I suppose that's the safe way to do it.

21:01.300 --> 21:03.100
You know, when you're putting that kind of horsepower in there, I don't know how you're

21:03.100 --> 21:04.100
going to get away from it.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.180
And it's blowing out both sides as well.

21:06.180 --> 21:07.980
That's already tripping down a little bit though.

21:07.980 --> 21:08.980
Okay.

21:08.980 --> 21:09.980
That's not bad.

21:09.980 --> 21:10.980
Yeah.

21:10.980 --> 21:11.980
It is coming down now.

21:11.980 --> 21:12.980
You can tell.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.700
And I don't know how you're going to have an RTX graphics card in there and not have fans.

21:15.700 --> 21:16.700
I don't think that...

21:16.700 --> 21:18.900
And it's 230 watts of power this thing's taking.

21:18.900 --> 21:21.780
That's another reason why it's not doing USB-C power delivery, right?

21:21.780 --> 21:23.060
Now you do have some options, right?

21:23.060 --> 21:26.580
With POP for switching between what graphics card you're actually using.

21:26.580 --> 21:27.580
Yeah.

21:27.580 --> 21:28.580
Take a look at that.

21:28.580 --> 21:32.120
So if you go in the system menu there in GNOME and you go to the power, like where the battery

21:32.120 --> 21:33.120
is at.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.120
Oh yeah.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.120
It powers it.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.120
Okay.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.120
Yeah.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.120
You've got integrated graphics, hybrid graphics.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.120
You can do the discrete Nvidia graphics only.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.120
And then they have compute mode.

21:40.120 --> 21:41.120
Do you see that?

21:41.120 --> 21:42.120
Compute graphics.

21:42.120 --> 21:43.120
Disables external displays.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.120
Right.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.900
So it's supposedly just even more performance for the internal GPU.

21:46.900 --> 21:48.900
So if you've got some sort of job you're going to do.

21:48.900 --> 21:49.900
Well, you don't, yeah.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.180
You're not actually using any of the ports.

21:51.180 --> 21:52.180
Right.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.180
Wow.

21:53.180 --> 21:54.180
Right.

21:54.180 --> 21:56.060
I like that they give you that option because by default I'm going to want those ports.

21:56.060 --> 21:59.940
And this thing really, if you're buying this, you're somebody who's running four or five

21:59.940 --> 22:03.140
pretty performance intensive apps simultaneously.

22:03.140 --> 22:05.800
Because you could load this thing with multiple M.2s.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.660
This thing can take up to 64 gigabytes of RAM.

22:08.660 --> 22:14.580
I mean, you know, like you could really push this thing and it really doesn't flinch at

22:14.580 --> 22:15.580
all.

22:15.580 --> 22:18.220
It's got so much bandwidth it's working with.

22:18.220 --> 22:23.220
It reminds me of a high performance car that is maybe, you know, kind of has like a tight

22:23.220 --> 22:24.220
suspension.

22:24.220 --> 22:28.060
So it's a little bit of a bumpy ride sometimes, but this thing corners like a bastard and

22:28.060 --> 22:31.320
goes like zero to 60 in like three or four seconds.

22:31.320 --> 22:33.480
And it even kind of has a bit of a car look to it.

22:33.480 --> 22:37.560
If you look at it, the hood is a brushed metal look.

22:37.560 --> 22:41.940
It's got a discrete set of LED lights that kind of almost look like a scoop in a hood,

22:41.940 --> 22:43.060
but they're done in a tasteful way.

22:43.060 --> 22:47.060
I'd say it's less distracting than a glowing Apple logo.

22:47.060 --> 22:50.060
And then the keyboard area has kind of a brushed metal look.

22:50.060 --> 22:54.020
It's a plastic that's pretty comfortable to put your arms on, but it has kind of like

22:54.020 --> 22:56.300
an almost an automotive look to it.

22:56.300 --> 22:59.480
It kind of reminds me of a car like that.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.340
It kind of has an aesthetic to it like that.

23:01.340 --> 23:06.220
And something about the back vents remind me of like the hood of a car.

23:06.220 --> 23:10.540
Yeah, well, it's kind of got the same style of design, a few elegant lines and curves.

23:10.540 --> 23:15.780
Now you'll notice if you hold that under your microphone right now, pick it up, do you hear

23:15.780 --> 23:16.780
that buzz?

23:16.780 --> 23:17.780
I do, yeah.

23:17.780 --> 23:23.340
That's one downside that as a podcaster, yeah, I don't know.

23:23.340 --> 23:24.820
That's just some machines do that.

23:24.820 --> 23:28.300
Even some wireless keyboards do that, where if you put them under a microphone, you get

23:28.300 --> 23:29.300
a buzz like that.

23:29.300 --> 23:31.660
That's just something we have to deal with.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.340
This one does create that issue.

23:33.340 --> 23:34.940
The audio in and out are good and clean.

23:34.940 --> 23:39.520
They sound just fine, but it does seem to buzz when it's near a microphone.

23:39.520 --> 23:40.980
So that's one thing that I noticed.

23:40.980 --> 23:44.200
I was sitting there using it underneath my mic the other day and it was buzzing like

23:44.200 --> 23:45.200
that.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.200
You know.

23:46.200 --> 23:47.200
But that doesn't...

23:47.200 --> 23:48.200
Fairly niche use case right there.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.200
Yeah, it's fairly niche.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.300
That's one of our problems, but...

23:51.300 --> 23:54.460
I can't podcast and play Steam games at the same time.

23:54.460 --> 23:59.140
So I did throw a bunch of Steam games at this and I think it goes without saying, it just

23:59.140 --> 24:00.140
crushes everything.

24:00.140 --> 24:05.460
I literally played every single game, including Cyberpunk 2044 or whatever it is, 20 whatever.

24:05.460 --> 24:10.100
I played that at ultra graphic settings, everything at max freaking graphics.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.100
I'm like, you know what?

24:11.100 --> 24:12.340
The deck's coming.

24:12.340 --> 24:13.820
Let's see what the state of Linux gaming is.

24:13.820 --> 24:18.980
And basically if it works on Linux at this point, it worked on the Kudu and at max settings.

24:18.980 --> 24:23.380
And I have not got to experience that treat in a couple of years.

24:23.380 --> 24:29.560
And if you were looking for gaming, I mean, yeah, 4k might be nice, but Linux does so

24:29.560 --> 24:30.560
good at 1080p.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.060
We've really got that nailed down.

24:32.060 --> 24:33.060
It does, dude.

24:33.060 --> 24:39.380
And graphics with that RTX at 1080p, you can run everything at max and just love it.

24:39.380 --> 24:40.380
Just super smooth.

24:40.380 --> 24:41.380
All right.

24:41.380 --> 24:42.940
I got a question for you guys.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.060
How's the keyboard on this thing?

24:45.060 --> 24:46.200
Great question.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.200
Great question.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.200
What do you think Wes?

24:48.200 --> 24:50.060
I put it somewhere in the middle personally.

24:50.060 --> 24:54.860
Yeah, it's definitely not the worst laptop keyboard I've used by a mile.

24:54.860 --> 24:56.260
You know, it's backlit.

24:56.260 --> 24:57.260
I appreciate that.

24:57.260 --> 24:59.460
That is legitimately handy.

24:59.460 --> 25:03.100
It's got, I'd say, yeah, maybe middle, these pretty decent key travel.

25:03.100 --> 25:04.940
It's a little, it's kind of got a light feeling.

25:04.940 --> 25:10.140
And then the position of the track pad relative to the keyboard is throwing me off at the

25:10.140 --> 25:11.140
moment.

25:11.140 --> 25:15.900
That's the first, literally the first comment I get from anyone I've shown it to.

25:15.900 --> 25:19.980
Is that the track pads off center, the track pad is actually centered with the QWERTY part

25:19.980 --> 25:23.220
of the keyboard, but this laptop has a 10 key.

25:23.220 --> 25:27.620
And so it's not centered with the entirety of the laptop keyboard, but it is centered

25:27.620 --> 25:29.060
with the QWERTY part of the keyboard.

25:29.060 --> 25:30.700
Do you get what I'm saying?

25:30.700 --> 25:34.100
It's like, I get it because when you're typing, where is your thumb?

25:34.100 --> 25:37.020
Your thumb is where the track pad is at.

25:37.020 --> 25:38.020
But it looks weird.

25:38.020 --> 25:40.680
It's not, it's just not symmetrical.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.900
The solution honestly is just a giant track pad.

25:43.900 --> 25:49.020
That is really, it should just be a huge ass track pad and then problem solved.

25:49.020 --> 25:52.500
I think I would worry, now I haven't really tested this, I suppose it's doing a pretty

25:52.500 --> 25:55.980
good job here, but I think I would worry that while I was typing, I'd be constantly bumping

25:55.980 --> 25:57.980
the track pad and making my mouse jump around.

25:57.980 --> 26:01.780
If I'm thinking like I'm on like a train to work or a bus with tight quarters kind of

26:01.780 --> 26:02.780
thing.

26:02.780 --> 26:03.780
I could see that.

26:03.780 --> 26:05.860
Okay guys, that being said, how is the track pad?

26:05.860 --> 26:08.700
I know that's been an issue in Linux for a little while.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.500
I think we're getting better at that, but how's this one performing for you?

26:11.500 --> 26:16.660
You know, the fact that I didn't even notice a single problem is probably all of the commentary

26:16.660 --> 26:17.740
you probably need from it.

26:17.740 --> 26:22.980
I actually, huh, I had very little, I had no complaints about the track pad at all.

26:22.980 --> 26:23.980
It just worked.

26:23.980 --> 26:27.300
I'd love it to be bigger, but the buttons are a little loud.

26:27.300 --> 26:28.300
Yeah.

26:28.300 --> 26:29.300
Yeah.

26:29.300 --> 26:30.580
And I'd love to have buttons at the top of the track pad.

26:30.580 --> 26:34.380
I'd love to have buttons at the top, but the surface itself, it feels quite nice.

26:34.380 --> 26:35.780
It's smooth.

26:35.780 --> 26:39.860
By default here, the integration with pop, I think the cursor speed and the track pad,

26:39.860 --> 26:43.020
like the combo of total speed to get across the screen, but still having fine control

26:43.020 --> 26:44.100
is pretty dialed in.

26:44.100 --> 26:51.620
Yeah, this is probably nicer than any desktop computer I have by a pretty good percentage

26:51.620 --> 26:53.780
and it's in a laptop form factor.

26:53.780 --> 26:59.380
And for somebody who lives in a small space, I'm never probably ever going to buy a desktop

26:59.380 --> 27:00.500
for home.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.500
Just never going to do that.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.780
Where would you put it?

27:02.780 --> 27:03.780
Right.

27:03.780 --> 27:08.080
But I absolutely loved being able to play my games again.

27:08.080 --> 27:12.780
You know, like just having access to all those games, it honestly made me super stoked for

27:12.780 --> 27:13.780
the deck.

27:13.780 --> 27:17.680
Just having access to my games and making them look good again and stuff like, whew,

27:17.680 --> 27:20.140
this is a really nice machine.

27:20.140 --> 27:23.660
And if it wasn't for the buzzing under the mic, I'd probably be really tempted to have

27:23.660 --> 27:28.460
one for the RV, I have to be honest, because the multiple display support is pretty great.

27:28.460 --> 27:31.940
Really does have quite a few ports, even if it's a somewhat odd set.

27:31.940 --> 27:37.520
And it's got Wi-Fi 6, which is nice because I can't really run ethernet in the RV.

27:37.520 --> 27:41.220
So having good Wi-Fi is huge for me.

27:41.220 --> 27:45.120
And the other thing I have to note because I think this stuff really kind of matters

27:45.120 --> 27:51.900
is it's really, at least in my personal Chris score, it's getting high marks for repairability

27:51.900 --> 27:53.580
and upgradability.

27:53.580 --> 27:58.220
This is something I want to look at more is like, what are the DIY options for these machines?

27:58.220 --> 28:00.580
And I have to say, they nail this.

28:00.580 --> 28:07.740
They have a technical document, which I'll link in the show notes, that gives you a brilliant

28:07.740 --> 28:10.340
under the hood look at this thing.

28:10.340 --> 28:15.040
And they have specifically labeled and identified every major component you might want to replace

28:15.040 --> 28:16.460
or upgrade.

28:16.460 --> 28:19.020
The RAM is immediately accessible.

28:19.020 --> 28:23.500
The two M.2 slots are instantly accessible, but they kind of went above and beyond that

28:23.500 --> 28:24.500
too.

28:24.500 --> 28:28.820
They even labeled like the fan connectors, the LCD connectors, how the keyboard is wired

28:28.820 --> 28:33.420
to where the keyboard connector is wired to the main board, where the Wi-Fi card's at,

28:33.420 --> 28:35.940
the speaker connectors, the CMOS battery.

28:35.940 --> 28:39.240
They've gone through and labeled everything in highlights and then have a map that shows

28:39.240 --> 28:40.860
you what that stuff is that you can repair.

28:40.860 --> 28:42.500
This is really nice.

28:42.500 --> 28:43.500
Yeah.

28:43.500 --> 28:47.660
I think every menu, this is a standard that every manufacturer should be held to.

28:47.660 --> 28:48.720
Yeah, definitely.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.380
You could sit here and say, yeah, okay, it's kind of big.

28:50.380 --> 28:56.420
It's a big laptop, although compared to my Bonobos and Aurexes, this is not big.

28:56.420 --> 29:00.860
You're talking to a guy who's had multiple Bonobo workstation laptops that were probably

29:00.860 --> 29:04.460
twice the thickness of this thing, at least, maybe even more.

29:04.460 --> 29:08.920
And it's really not that heavy even for, if it's a little thicker here, but it's, yeah.

29:08.920 --> 29:12.140
They say it's four pounds, like 4.8 or something.

29:12.140 --> 29:13.360
I don't know about that.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.460
If it is, it's very well distributed.

29:15.460 --> 29:17.940
It does not feel heavy.

29:17.940 --> 29:23.900
And the fact that you can pop that bottom off and get access to replace the fans to,

29:23.900 --> 29:27.980
I don't know, maybe in eight years, maybe 10 years down the road, you want to put a

29:27.980 --> 29:32.620
little more heat transfer treatment on your CPU, you're going to be able to figure out

29:32.620 --> 29:33.620
how to do that.

29:33.620 --> 29:35.580
And they make all that information documented.

29:35.580 --> 29:37.580
And I don't know, I feel like everybody should have to do that.

29:37.580 --> 29:42.620
And if it means that it's a little bit thicker to have a removable bottom, that seems like

29:42.620 --> 29:47.460
a pretty good trade-off because if I'm buying this kind of machine, I'm not looking for

29:47.460 --> 29:50.100
like the half pounder that I throw on my laptop for my, you know.

29:50.100 --> 29:51.100
That's a different system.

29:51.100 --> 29:52.100
Yeah.

29:52.100 --> 29:53.820
This isn't my coffee shop machine.

29:53.820 --> 29:58.240
This is my multitasking, heavy workload machine.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.780
That's why I bought Bonobos.

29:59.780 --> 30:04.320
In the past, I bought them because I would go to my clients and I would run five or six

30:04.320 --> 30:05.320
virtual machines.

30:05.320 --> 30:10.620
I would like do test migrations in VMs on my laptop and then give them the results.

30:10.620 --> 30:14.140
And I would just, you know, I had data machine with a lot of horsepower to do that.

30:14.140 --> 30:17.660
So I was fine that it only had a, you know, two hour battery because I just needed to

30:17.660 --> 30:19.140
set it up at a desk and plug it in.

30:19.140 --> 30:20.140
Right.

30:20.140 --> 30:21.140
You would have it out there.

30:21.140 --> 30:25.500
So, you know, a lot of us still have those kinds of workloads and I think it nails that

30:25.500 --> 30:26.500
so well.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.500
I'm so impressed.

30:27.500 --> 30:28.860
Like I'm really sad that I have to send it back.

30:28.860 --> 30:32.780
It's just a review unit because it's been really fun to have a machine that games as

30:32.780 --> 30:35.900
good as my son's laptop.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.080
And it's a nice compromise.

30:38.080 --> 30:41.660
It does get loud, but for the horsepower, I mean, it's pretty understandable.

30:41.660 --> 30:42.660
Okay.

30:42.660 --> 30:46.500
One last question for you, and it's a bit of a long form one.

30:46.500 --> 30:53.140
We were lucky enough to get a really wonderful tour of system 76 over the summer.

30:53.140 --> 30:56.660
And ever since that I've had a hesitation with system 76 as laptops.

30:56.660 --> 31:03.300
And I wonder if you guys share this sentiment because of the quality and the care and attention

31:03.300 --> 31:08.100
that we saw them putting into, you know, the launch keyboard and everything they manufacture

31:08.100 --> 31:15.700
in house, I've had this hesitation about buying a system 76 laptop because they're not quite

31:15.700 --> 31:16.940
making those in house yet.

31:16.940 --> 31:22.600
I think maybe I feel like they might be headed that way, but how do you each kind of bridge

31:22.600 --> 31:28.080
the gap between what we saw over the summer and the amazing quality and thoughtful engineering

31:28.080 --> 31:32.860
that went into everything they make in house versus these laptops?

31:32.860 --> 31:37.340
I think you're definitely right to point out that it's not quite the same because yeah,

31:37.340 --> 31:42.380
they're creating these things from whole cloth for the most part, which is very impressive.

31:42.380 --> 31:47.140
But I think the nature of what you're talking about, that same intention, those same skill

31:47.140 --> 31:50.700
sets, they're applied to the base that they work with for their laptops.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.420
I think that's, you know, that's like the fan curves, some of the nice integrations

31:53.420 --> 31:58.580
with BopOS itself, a lot of these firmware efforts that have been going on, those are

31:58.580 --> 32:00.300
things that just not that many other folks are doing.

32:00.300 --> 32:04.460
So yeah, you do need to look at the hardware and look at the aesthetics of the hardware,

32:04.460 --> 32:08.340
look at, you know, those things they can't change right now, but they add some nice stuff

32:08.340 --> 32:09.340
on top.

32:09.340 --> 32:15.180
There's still like the net benefit of them doing something for so long, like they bring

32:15.180 --> 32:17.500
all that experience to every machine they make.

32:17.500 --> 32:26.580
Like I spent my own money, full price, on a pretty loaded out ThinkPad X1, and I haven't

32:26.580 --> 32:28.340
been super thrilled with it.

32:28.340 --> 32:30.340
And you notice we haven't seen any updates.

32:30.340 --> 32:34.780
There's been a few releases of Fedora, there's been a few Intel chip setup dates that have

32:34.780 --> 32:38.820
come out, and there's been nothing from Lenovo on a new Fedora ThinkPad.

32:38.820 --> 32:43.060
I don't know what that's about, but I wonder if maybe it wasn't a huge success or maybe

32:43.060 --> 32:49.340
that's just not something they're super focused on, but that experience that System76 brings

32:49.340 --> 32:52.020
to the product is noticeable.

32:52.020 --> 32:57.620
I definitely have noticed over the years their ideas working their way into these machines

32:57.620 --> 33:02.900
that they don't necessarily manufacture themselves, I would prefer them to build it in-house.

33:02.900 --> 33:06.220
And when they get there, I'm probably going to be one of the first people in line to pick

33:06.220 --> 33:07.940
one of those machines up.

33:07.940 --> 33:14.460
But Linux users have always had a limited set of truly Linux-first native hardware to

33:14.460 --> 33:18.260
pick from, and System76 has always kind of been there offering something.

33:18.260 --> 33:20.620
Yeah, and you just don't have to worry about that, right?

33:20.620 --> 33:24.740
I mean, you can install, you know, it's going to support whatever Linux workload you really

33:24.740 --> 33:26.300
want to throw at it.

33:26.300 --> 33:27.300
Yeah.

33:27.300 --> 33:29.100
And in the moment, Maroum, you've got some thoughts on this?

33:29.100 --> 33:34.540
Yeah, I purchased a System76 laptop about a year ago now, the Lemur Pro when it first

33:34.540 --> 33:35.540
came out.

33:35.540 --> 33:39.580
And I agree that it's clearly not a device that they made themselves.

33:39.580 --> 33:44.020
But at the same time, when you're checking out, it has that one-year warranty that comes

33:44.020 --> 33:45.020
with it.

33:45.020 --> 33:50.020
And the quality that they put into their post-sale care is just as good as the quality that they

33:50.020 --> 33:52.160
put into the devices they make themselves.

33:52.160 --> 33:56.860
They take great care of you when things go wrong, and they do it in a way that is much

33:56.860 --> 34:02.180
more upfront and, like, honest than a lot of companies that have had to do laptop warranty

34:02.180 --> 34:03.180
repairs with.

34:03.180 --> 34:04.180
Right.

34:04.180 --> 34:06.500
At the end of the day, you know, even if maybe you like some aspects of a, say, Dell machine

34:06.500 --> 34:08.980
a little more, who do you want to be on the phone with?

34:08.980 --> 34:13.580
Yeah, we know the support team, and we definitely have seen them working.

34:13.580 --> 34:16.260
You know, obviously, we're friends with them.

34:16.260 --> 34:18.180
They have sponsored Coder.

34:18.180 --> 34:19.580
They don't sponsor this show.

34:19.580 --> 34:23.020
I don't know if they've ever sponsored Linux Unplugged.

34:23.020 --> 34:27.380
But we're friends with them because they've made something good, and so we were drawn

34:27.380 --> 34:28.380
to them.

34:28.380 --> 34:32.420
I mean, it's a bunch of nerds making some needs, yeah, right?

34:32.420 --> 34:36.820
And we just, you know, being fancy podcasters, I guess, get to be lucky enough to get to

34:36.820 --> 34:38.740
meet these people sometimes.

34:38.740 --> 34:41.420
It's going to be interesting to watch them when they do get the opportunity to build

34:41.420 --> 34:42.540
their own laptops.

34:42.540 --> 34:46.220
I would imagine that's got to be the hardest thing they're ever going to try to do.

34:46.220 --> 34:47.860
They were smart to start with the keyboard.

34:47.860 --> 34:48.860
You get that, right?

34:48.860 --> 34:49.860
That does a lot.

34:49.860 --> 34:52.900
Well, and they have a high—they clearly have a high bar for what they make, so.

34:52.900 --> 34:53.900
You can't put it into words.

34:53.900 --> 34:57.460
It's not like they're—they're not making the job of implementing this for themselves

34:57.460 --> 34:59.060
any easier just in that regard.

34:59.060 --> 35:02.660
I think it'd be so great if they could bring customers through their factory on the regular

35:02.660 --> 35:08.620
because people—there's people who have seen System76 Factory and there's people who haven't.

35:08.620 --> 35:13.380
And it's a ridiculous obsessive amount of attention to detail they put into this stuff.

35:13.380 --> 35:17.780
And it really only—you can only really wrap your head around how much goes into a business

35:17.780 --> 35:20.300
like this unless you go there.

35:20.300 --> 35:22.420
Humans are so bad at this.

35:22.420 --> 35:23.420
We do this.

35:23.420 --> 35:25.300
I'm sure people do this about JB.

35:25.300 --> 35:28.900
You think you understand how a business can work, so you think you can conceptualize it,

35:28.900 --> 35:32.620
and then you get in that industry and you realize it is infinitely more complex.

35:32.620 --> 35:33.620
It is an entire world.

35:33.620 --> 35:36.420
A thousand more things that you had no idea about and debates and trade-offs.

35:36.420 --> 35:38.980
Totally, totally.

35:38.980 --> 35:44.220
So that is them to a T right there is I realize when I toured that factory, which I've done

35:44.220 --> 35:50.180
a few times now, every time I'm like, holy shit, I had no idea they were even worrying

35:50.180 --> 35:52.500
about this or thinking about this or solving this.

35:52.500 --> 35:55.820
Or a whole problem that requires a machine or a custom setup to handle, even if it's

35:55.820 --> 36:00.020
a small little thing at the end.

36:00.020 --> 36:02.140
Leno dot com slash unplugged.

36:02.140 --> 36:07.980
Go there to support this here show and get yourself $100 in stick credit on a new account,

36:07.980 --> 36:08.980
and you go there to support the show.

36:08.980 --> 36:11.460
Oh, I almost got a little prospector in there.

36:11.460 --> 36:12.980
He's in the back.

36:12.980 --> 36:15.180
Brent mentioned him in the pre-show, so now the prospector is—

36:15.180 --> 36:16.180
I'm ready for him.

36:16.180 --> 36:17.180
Coming down from the hills.

36:17.180 --> 36:18.180
Yeah.

36:18.180 --> 36:21.540
He was just there for a moment, but then I said something and he snuck away anyways.

36:21.540 --> 36:24.980
But real, you know, actual Chris will tell you, it's just the best place to host something

36:24.980 --> 36:28.900
like I've looked at the options and Linode's got the perfect mix.

36:28.900 --> 36:32.780
They have a bonkers, crazy fast bandwidth.

36:32.780 --> 36:35.180
They have 11 data centers you can choose from.

36:35.180 --> 36:39.640
Their pricing is, you know, 30 to 50 percent less than the hyperscalers that want to lock

36:39.640 --> 36:43.500
you into their complex platforms that just want to just essentially create their own

36:43.500 --> 36:44.500
version of the Internet.

36:44.500 --> 36:47.260
You don't have to deal with any of that with Linode, none of that stuff.

36:47.260 --> 36:51.020
And they've invested in their infrastructure year after year after year.

36:51.020 --> 36:52.020
They've been really clever.

36:52.020 --> 36:57.060
Like they just did a round of AMD epic processor upgrades not too long ago.

36:57.060 --> 37:01.400
And then they just got done doing a round of MVME PCI storage upgrades not too long

37:01.400 --> 37:02.460
ago.

37:02.460 --> 37:06.080
And they're working on a new product that they haven't even announced yet.

37:06.080 --> 37:07.740
And there's always stuff going on in the background.

37:07.740 --> 37:09.740
They're always taking stuff to the next level.

37:09.740 --> 37:13.580
And the thing that's really cool about them that I've really appreciated is they are Linux

37:13.580 --> 37:14.580
geeks.

37:14.580 --> 37:18.020
Like they've looked at the way the industry does stuff and they'll often go, OK, that's

37:18.020 --> 37:19.020
great.

37:19.020 --> 37:20.740
How do we do that with Linux instead?

37:20.740 --> 37:23.820
Which now is just like you can do everything with Linux.

37:23.820 --> 37:25.500
But that wasn't always the case.

37:25.500 --> 37:26.500
That wasn't always the case.

37:26.500 --> 37:31.080
And, you know, they spent 19 years figuring this stuff out and building the best platform

37:31.080 --> 37:33.080
to host your stuff.

37:33.080 --> 37:37.980
Anything that is user facing, man, I just wouldn't have it anywhere else but Linode.

37:37.980 --> 37:41.180
You know, it's like when you're running a business, you don't have to worry about this

37:41.180 --> 37:42.180
stuff.

37:42.180 --> 37:44.440
You don't want to have to worry about it and you want it to be reliable.

37:44.440 --> 37:46.060
You don't want complaints.

37:46.060 --> 37:49.020
I sleep easy at night having our infrastructure on Linode.

37:49.020 --> 37:50.660
So go get a hundred dollars.

37:50.660 --> 37:52.460
Try it out and support the show.

37:52.460 --> 37:54.980
It's Linode dot com slash unplugged.

37:54.980 --> 37:55.980
All right.

37:55.980 --> 37:58.380
Well, I already did.

37:58.380 --> 38:00.220
My plug is really unplugged core dot com.

38:00.220 --> 38:02.740
If you want to become a member, you get two options.

38:02.740 --> 38:08.340
You get the full live uncut, like when I screw up and hit the wrong button or Wes goes into

38:08.340 --> 38:10.460
one of his cussing rants.

38:10.460 --> 38:11.460
Happens sometimes.

38:11.460 --> 38:12.460
Happens.

38:12.460 --> 38:15.500
You get the pre and post in the show, plus you get the pre and post show, which you think

38:15.500 --> 38:17.540
you you think you get the pre and post show.

38:17.540 --> 38:18.540
Oh, no.

38:18.540 --> 38:19.540
Oh, no.

38:19.540 --> 38:20.540
There's so much more show.

38:20.540 --> 38:21.540
You're responsible about it.

38:21.540 --> 38:25.820
Or maybe maybe you don't want to spend like two hours listening to a Linux podcast.

38:25.820 --> 38:27.860
We also make a shorter version.

38:27.860 --> 38:30.780
It's still got all the fine touches from our editor, Joe.

38:30.780 --> 38:33.140
So it sounds great, but it's ad free.

38:33.140 --> 38:34.140
So it's shorter.

38:34.140 --> 38:35.140
It's a little tighter.

38:35.140 --> 38:40.020
And it it's like a special like Joe signature edition.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.780
That's what we should call it.

38:41.780 --> 38:42.780
That's what we should call it.

38:42.780 --> 38:43.780
Because it's great.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.460
You know, it's all the same production, but we just out the ads.

38:45.460 --> 38:46.460
Yeah.

38:46.460 --> 38:47.460
He cuts all of our crap out.

38:47.460 --> 38:48.460
Yeah.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.460
It's not crap.

38:49.460 --> 38:50.460
Wait.

38:50.460 --> 38:53.060
I mean, it's we presume our members are so dedicated to the show.

38:53.060 --> 38:55.900
They already have enjoyed our sponsors offer.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.420
And so now they listen to the member fee.

38:57.420 --> 38:59.140
Oh, I meant I meant I meant our ramblings.

38:59.140 --> 39:00.140
Oh, yeah.

39:00.140 --> 39:01.140
You're cussing rants.

39:01.140 --> 39:02.140
Yeah, for sure.

39:02.140 --> 39:03.140
Definitely get that.

39:03.140 --> 39:04.700
Well, actually, that's my favorite part.

39:04.700 --> 39:05.700
That's my favorite part.

39:05.700 --> 39:06.700
We'll get it.

39:06.700 --> 39:08.260
We'll have to have its own dedicated feed someday.

39:08.260 --> 39:09.260
Definitely.

39:09.260 --> 39:10.260
We also love your feedback.

39:10.260 --> 39:11.260
We didn't get a lot this week.

39:11.260 --> 39:12.260
We got a lot of boosts.

39:12.260 --> 39:13.340
We'll cover those.

39:13.340 --> 39:15.740
But Brent went through and he said, Chris, this is the biggest pile of shit I've ever

39:15.740 --> 39:16.740
seen.

39:16.740 --> 39:17.740
That's what he said.

39:17.740 --> 39:18.740
It takes a lot to rile him up.

39:18.740 --> 39:19.740
He didn't really say that.

39:19.740 --> 39:20.740
I wouldn't.

39:20.740 --> 39:28.220
But we'd love to get your feedback at Linux unplugged dot com slash contact thoughts on

39:28.220 --> 39:34.180
what we've said, ideas for the show, projects to check it out, put it all in there and join

39:34.180 --> 39:35.220
our matrix community.

39:35.220 --> 39:36.560
It's growing every single day.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.540
We got dedicated feedback rooms for each show.

39:39.540 --> 39:42.500
We've got discussion topic rooms for individual topics.

39:42.500 --> 39:46.300
There's even a Bitcoin room because Brent insisted all of that.

39:46.300 --> 39:49.260
You can get information at Linux unplugged dot com slash Matrix.

39:49.260 --> 39:54.140
And last but not least, the last thing I have to say, this is going on way too long and

39:54.140 --> 39:55.460
I'm just making it worse right now.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.860
So it's like getting really bad now.

39:56.860 --> 39:59.740
The last thing I'll say is Linux unplugged dot com slash mumble.

39:59.740 --> 40:00.740
You know, we got a mumble room.

40:00.740 --> 40:02.860
I don't need to repeat it again.

40:02.860 --> 40:06.900
Join it for God's sakes.

40:06.900 --> 40:10.820
You know, I told you both that we didn't get much feedback this week, but actually we got

40:10.820 --> 40:16.260
a ton of great feedback this just long form ideas that people have been working on, which

40:16.260 --> 40:17.260
have been really great.

40:17.260 --> 40:18.260
OK, good.

40:18.260 --> 40:19.260
But it takes you know.

40:19.260 --> 40:20.260
So why were you swearing so much?

40:20.260 --> 40:23.520
It just seemed like completely inappropriate in retrospect.

40:23.520 --> 40:27.500
More that I only have certain, you know, only so much brain capacity for all the great things

40:27.500 --> 40:28.900
that everyone's sharing with us.

40:28.900 --> 40:29.900
And true.

40:29.900 --> 40:33.400
It was early to some of them can only be put into the show at the right time.

40:33.400 --> 40:39.580
So we do have a few and we'll get to the boost in a sec, but Joshua did share some cool things

40:39.580 --> 40:41.900
he's working on with his pie.

40:41.900 --> 40:46.500
Since that was our topic, he says, I like playing with circuits and I have used Arduinos

40:46.500 --> 40:47.500
a lot.

40:47.500 --> 40:52.980
Recently, I acquired the new pie zero to w and decided to use the GPIO on it instead

40:52.980 --> 40:54.420
of an Arduino.

40:54.420 --> 40:56.740
The workflow was so much nicer.

40:56.740 --> 40:59.780
First I could program in Python instead of C++.

40:59.780 --> 41:03.580
And he says here, I think I could even do rust.

41:03.580 --> 41:08.580
Second, I can connect the pie to Wi-Fi, code remotely and upload to the pie without having

41:08.580 --> 41:12.380
to power it down, connect to my computer and reflash it.

41:12.380 --> 41:16.980
I can also just SSH in and pull up a Python interpreter to experiment live.

41:16.980 --> 41:22.260
I even could imagine a setup where I hook up VSCode to seamlessly code on the pie from

41:22.260 --> 41:23.260
my computer.

41:23.260 --> 41:26.660
I'm not even sure I'm going to go back to Arduinos, he says.

41:26.660 --> 41:29.500
Yeah, that's those are all great ideas.

41:29.500 --> 41:32.560
Now there may be some times, you know, whether you just need something smaller or for power

41:32.560 --> 41:36.140
reasons or for the particulars of connecting to hardware that an Arduino makes more sense.

41:36.140 --> 41:41.680
But yeah, I mean, pies are super capable these days and all the reasons that Joshua points

41:41.680 --> 41:45.620
out here, they're just super friendly and accessible to development because everything

41:45.620 --> 41:46.620
runs on them.

41:46.620 --> 41:53.060
I also feel like that capability that VSCode has to do the debugging on a remote system.

41:53.060 --> 41:57.420
I hear from so many people that write into Coder Radio that love that kind of stuff and

41:57.420 --> 42:02.860
not just specifically that, but we have people that write into Coder Radio that are on Windows

42:02.860 --> 42:06.980
and Mac because that's what they use for their day job, but they have a Raspberry Pi running

42:06.980 --> 42:10.300
that they can execute builds on and stuff or a VM or a VPS.

42:10.300 --> 42:11.300
Like that's so cool.

42:11.300 --> 42:14.060
Casey, you're doing the Rust on there?

42:14.060 --> 42:16.260
I'm doing Rust based robotics on there.

42:16.260 --> 42:18.900
I have a blast working on it.

42:18.900 --> 42:24.740
Yeah, the tools that are available for the pie inside of crates.io, which is the Rust

42:24.740 --> 42:31.540
package manager, are like top tier and actually when the 02W first came out, the Rust devs

42:31.540 --> 42:35.820
had support for the 02W before a lot of Python devs.

42:35.820 --> 42:37.560
I was really impressed.

42:37.560 --> 42:38.660
That is very impressive.

42:38.660 --> 42:39.660
Dang.

42:39.660 --> 42:43.420
What I feel like is really amazing about the pie that I'm learning and we'll soon get a

42:43.420 --> 42:46.460
chance to play with is its versatility.

42:46.460 --> 42:51.340
And I know there are like about 12 different pies to choose from, from old ones to new

42:51.340 --> 42:52.340
ones.

42:52.340 --> 42:53.340
Pick the right one, Brent.

42:53.340 --> 42:56.260
You can't get any of them, but I feel like that's its real advantage.

42:56.260 --> 43:00.740
It's just a platform for people to throw their ideas at and see what comes out the other

43:00.740 --> 43:02.660
side, which feels like a beautiful thing.

43:02.660 --> 43:03.660
Yeah.

43:03.660 --> 43:05.380
Low cost, low risk, but all the possibility.

43:05.380 --> 43:06.380
Yeah.

43:06.380 --> 43:09.780
I want to say thanks to our audience again.

43:09.780 --> 43:17.300
It turns out New West has a Pi 4 2 gig that he has offered to ship my way, which is really

43:17.300 --> 43:18.300
great.

43:18.300 --> 43:23.460
So I, you know, despite betraying you both, I think I might have a chance to jump on the

43:23.460 --> 43:24.460
bandwagon.

43:24.460 --> 43:25.460
So thank you to New West.

43:25.460 --> 43:30.540
I've been wondering how we're going to do this because now that I know you've never

43:30.540 --> 43:33.620
tried a Raspberry Pi, like I want it to be a good experience.

43:33.620 --> 43:35.180
I was going to say we want to be there.

43:35.180 --> 43:36.180
We want you to document it.

43:36.180 --> 43:37.180
Yeah.

43:37.180 --> 43:40.020
We definitely want to document it, but I feel like I wish I could be there to guide you

43:40.020 --> 43:45.580
through the experience because I want to set the expectation right and, you know, like

43:45.580 --> 43:46.580
I'll say this.

43:46.580 --> 43:50.420
If you set it up and expected to use it as a desktop, I think your first impressions

43:50.420 --> 43:56.780
would be bad, but if you wanted to set it up and use it as a Docker system or a way

43:56.780 --> 44:00.260
to run us a couple of packages, I think your impressions would be good, right?

44:00.260 --> 44:01.260
Like it.

44:01.260 --> 44:05.740
So, uh, you have to make sure you don't necessarily buy into the hype that it's like a desktop

44:05.740 --> 44:10.140
replacement because that's been said for years and it's definitely getting there and with

44:10.140 --> 44:15.140
faster storage, it's closer to being possible, but it's definitely not quite there yet.

44:15.140 --> 44:18.620
And so you just got to go in with expectations set, right?

44:18.620 --> 44:23.320
I think we might need like a Brent's Pi road trip when we could just like drive around

44:23.320 --> 44:26.980
and then we come up with ideas on the road.

44:26.980 --> 44:30.460
I'm imagining a photo essay sort of thing where you're taking pictures of you with a

44:30.460 --> 44:32.860
Pi at various like monuments and parks.

44:32.860 --> 44:35.660
We will like go to different places, get inspiration for what it could do.

44:35.660 --> 44:36.660
Yeah.

44:36.660 --> 44:39.900
It'd be like a $3 million trip, but totally worth it.

44:39.900 --> 44:40.900
Yeah.

44:40.900 --> 44:42.180
Low budget.

44:42.180 --> 44:45.340
I think what I will work on actually that we can talk about a little bit more in the

44:45.340 --> 44:49.580
future is I think I'm going to put together a list of hopes and dreams I have for things

44:49.580 --> 44:51.100
I think it might be able to do.

44:51.100 --> 44:56.220
Like for instance, one thing I've always wanted, because as you gentlemen know, I tend to record

44:56.220 --> 45:01.280
in this space with my laptop and we've just been talking about how laptops are sometimes

45:01.280 --> 45:03.100
problematic when it comes to microphones.

45:03.100 --> 45:09.460
I've always for like the last three or four years wanted a little setup that would just

45:09.460 --> 45:14.300
be my little recording machine that's completely silent, no fans, no nothing, no like electronic

45:14.300 --> 45:15.300
noise or anything.

45:15.300 --> 45:18.900
And I'm curious to know if you think that's even possible with this thing.

45:18.900 --> 45:22.540
And I think the answer might be no, but I'm curious what you think.

45:22.540 --> 45:23.540
I think you're going to have to try it.

45:23.540 --> 45:24.540
Yeah.

45:24.540 --> 45:25.540
I mean, you could try it, right?

45:25.540 --> 45:28.700
So a Pi 4 has a pretty good little CPU on it.

45:28.700 --> 45:33.260
I think you're probably going to run into disk IO issues.

45:33.260 --> 45:37.660
You're going to want to run your OS probably off a USB disk and probably not off of an

45:37.660 --> 45:43.260
SD card, which then means your OS disk is consuming a lot of your USB bandwidth.

45:43.260 --> 45:47.220
So you don't have a lot of bandwidth leftover for recording to the disk.

45:47.220 --> 45:48.220
So it'd just be tricky.

45:48.220 --> 45:51.140
It might be doable, you know, but it's just something you'd have to play with.

45:51.140 --> 45:53.420
Reaper is available for the Raspberry Pi.

45:53.420 --> 45:54.420
Yeah, right.

45:54.420 --> 45:57.100
I mean, it's got that handy little web interface even too.

45:57.100 --> 45:59.140
Yeah, that's true.

45:59.140 --> 46:00.940
Wes and I have also talked a lot about this.

46:00.940 --> 46:01.940
We've thought about this too.

46:01.940 --> 46:04.180
I don't know why we haven't actually tried it yet.

46:04.180 --> 46:07.740
Well, because, you know, turns out these x86 boxes do a pretty damn good job.

46:07.740 --> 46:08.740
So we just stick with that.

46:08.740 --> 46:09.740
All right.

46:09.740 --> 46:11.340
Well, we did get some boosts.

46:11.340 --> 46:14.700
If you don't know what I'm talking about, that's totally understandable.

46:14.700 --> 46:19.740
This is part of the value for value system that the new podcast apps support.

46:19.740 --> 46:24.500
And so when listeners have the app, one of these apps that supports us, which is really

46:24.500 --> 46:26.940
only a small handful at this point.

46:26.940 --> 46:31.620
We've been using Fountain and Cast-O-Matic, but it's iOS only.

46:31.620 --> 46:35.300
And the neat thing is, is when you're listening, you can use the Lightning Payment Network

46:35.300 --> 46:39.700
to send Satoshi's to the podcast.

46:39.700 --> 46:43.500
So it's a direct way to support the show without like going through a payment process or something

46:43.500 --> 46:44.500
like that.

46:44.500 --> 46:46.820
And JB actually runs its own node.

46:46.820 --> 46:54.940
So the payments literally come to the studio and are held here at JB one, which is pretty

46:54.940 --> 46:55.940
neat.

46:55.940 --> 47:05.620
So if you're using some cloud server somewhere or, you know, safely in a bank account, so

47:05.620 --> 47:06.620
please send them there.

47:06.620 --> 47:11.620
Actually, you know, when it comes to money, you want to be careful, but it's really not

47:11.620 --> 47:12.620
about the money.

47:12.620 --> 47:16.380
I was saying this on the pre-show, like I've been doing this for a while, and this is my

47:16.380 --> 47:20.600
absolute favorite way to get feedback from the audience.

47:20.600 --> 47:25.500
It's just neat to see it originate from the episodes, you know, it's sort of like a like

47:25.500 --> 47:30.460
a, oh, it's you're right there with them as they're listening and experiencing the content.

47:30.460 --> 47:35.140
It feels like I'm hearing from a new set of people too.

47:35.140 --> 47:39.340
And it's just so, I don't know, it's so novel too.

47:39.340 --> 47:41.940
But all right, we got one here from Dale.

47:41.940 --> 47:46.420
And Dale's boost came from last week's episode, Brent's Betrayal.

47:46.420 --> 47:50.680
And he writes, I made this little tool that helps me pay JB while listening.

47:50.680 --> 47:55.540
It's the value for value calculator, and this is really for anybody, but it lets you kind

47:55.540 --> 47:59.140
of figure out like, OK, if I want to send these guys two bucks, like how many sats

47:59.140 --> 48:00.140
is that?

48:00.140 --> 48:01.140
This is handy.

48:01.140 --> 48:02.140
Yeah.

48:02.140 --> 48:03.140
OK, yeah.

48:03.140 --> 48:04.140
You put two bucks in and that.

48:04.140 --> 48:05.140
Let's see.

48:05.140 --> 48:08.540
He says, I am no crypto enthusiast, so I just tend to think about these things in dollars,

48:08.540 --> 48:11.100
which feels more real to me than some block change coinage.

48:11.100 --> 48:14.500
But he still made this, which is so awesome.

48:14.500 --> 48:17.300
Like talk about actually, truly trying to support, right?

48:17.300 --> 48:20.740
Like he kind of gets where this kind of maybe has to go.

48:20.740 --> 48:27.340
And also, I wonder if we push this, and I know nobody else in our sphere is going to

48:27.340 --> 48:31.380
push this, but maybe someday in a few years when people realize what's going on and they

48:31.380 --> 48:36.020
start pushing for this, I feel like we could get something here that works for open source

48:36.020 --> 48:37.020
too.

48:37.020 --> 48:38.900
And who knows what it'll be one day, but I feel like we're testing something out bigger

48:38.900 --> 48:39.900
here.

48:39.900 --> 48:41.700
And Dale sent 500 sats to say that.

48:41.700 --> 48:43.740
I don't know what 500 sats works out to even.

48:43.740 --> 48:47.500
It's because you're not using the value for value calculator yet.

48:47.500 --> 48:52.140
We also got 500 sats from anonymous who said no to discord.

48:52.140 --> 48:55.860
I can't use it without doxing a phone number.

48:55.860 --> 49:01.540
And you know, I have heard that from multiple listeners when I talk to them in person and

49:01.540 --> 49:04.580
they say, oh yeah, I'm not on the telegram group or I'm not in discord.

49:04.580 --> 49:06.620
I don't want to give them my phone number.

49:06.620 --> 49:09.820
I don't think we can really appreciate how many people were excluding because they're

49:09.820 --> 49:11.660
not participating in the conversation.

49:11.660 --> 49:12.660
So they're not getting representation.

49:12.660 --> 49:14.140
It's true.

49:14.140 --> 49:18.260
So I don't know who anonymous is that sent 500 sats to make that mention about no discord

49:18.260 --> 49:21.020
because of the phone number thing, but that did resonate with me.

49:21.020 --> 49:25.580
So I appreciate you sending that in and that's something I'm going to take into serious consideration.

49:25.580 --> 49:27.180
Hopefully we'll see you on our matrix.

49:27.180 --> 49:29.940
Wes, you earned the network a few sats.

49:29.940 --> 49:33.780
Dave Jones sent us one, two, three, four, five sats.

49:33.780 --> 49:34.980
I like that number.

49:34.980 --> 49:35.980
What is that?

49:35.980 --> 49:36.980
Can you do the calculator?

49:36.980 --> 49:39.060
One, two, three, four, five.

49:39.060 --> 49:44.140
Dave Jones, he's the creator of helipad, which lets us read these boost messages and he says,

49:44.140 --> 49:46.540
thanks for helping me bug fix hella bad guys.

49:46.540 --> 49:48.500
Here is a bug bounty.

49:48.500 --> 49:54.060
So do you want to just give us like a super brief synopsis on what actually let me set

49:54.060 --> 49:55.060
it up.

49:55.060 --> 49:56.060
Okay.

49:56.060 --> 49:59.980
Cause you will not give yourself the fricking credit that you deserve because you are a

49:59.980 --> 50:01.300
mad lad.

50:01.300 --> 50:06.500
And so here we were on last Sunday during the super bowl and it was after the show where

50:06.500 --> 50:09.780
it was still daylight out and the super bowl was still going.

50:09.780 --> 50:13.740
And instead of going home, what Wes Payne did is he helped us troubleshoot.

50:13.740 --> 50:17.660
We were having an issue rendering these boost messages, uh, because you know, they come

50:17.660 --> 50:19.500
in and they get stored in a database.

50:19.500 --> 50:23.020
And then Dave has this back, this backend rust app actually.

50:23.020 --> 50:24.020
Yeah.

50:24.020 --> 50:25.020
Hella bad.

50:25.020 --> 50:26.020
Yeah.

50:26.020 --> 50:28.700
That kind of acts as like this, um, API that we can, it has an API that we can connect

50:28.700 --> 50:29.700
to and get the messages.

50:29.700 --> 50:33.580
And it kind of, it kind of is like this backend tool to pull those messages and he's built

50:33.580 --> 50:36.180
a front end that displays them.

50:36.180 --> 50:37.220
But it wasn't working.

50:37.220 --> 50:41.780
We could see the messages were in the database, but the front end wasn't displaying the message.

50:41.780 --> 50:46.020
So like the legit mad lad that he is, Wes sat down during, I don't know, the last half

50:46.020 --> 50:47.380
of the super bowl.

50:47.380 --> 50:53.300
And before the super bowl was over, had rebuilt portions of the entire app and Python.

50:53.300 --> 50:58.420
So I don't know, in like an hour rebuilt 20, 30% of the app and Python got it querying

50:58.420 --> 51:03.460
the backend rust server to troubleshoot what the issue was, reproduce the bug in his own

51:03.460 --> 51:07.340
app that he had just built during the last half of the super bowl, tracked it down to

51:07.340 --> 51:12.300
like a weird character that was in the database, removed that line from the database and fixed

51:12.300 --> 51:14.640
it and then sent the info over to Dave.

51:14.640 --> 51:15.640
That was really well done.

51:15.640 --> 51:16.640
Wes.

51:16.640 --> 51:17.640
Well done.

51:17.640 --> 51:18.640
Well done.

51:18.640 --> 51:19.640
Nobody else will give you the credit, but I was there.

51:19.640 --> 51:22.780
Hey, we had a lot of fun and it was a great excuse to learn a little bit more about like

51:22.780 --> 51:26.900
the lightning Damon and helipad and umbral and just how all some of these neat tools

51:26.900 --> 51:27.900
work.

51:27.900 --> 51:28.900
Yeah.

51:28.900 --> 51:29.900
It was actually very educational.

51:29.900 --> 51:31.900
It turned out to be a really, really good kind of under the hood.

51:31.900 --> 51:34.220
And I walked away even more impressed actually.

51:34.220 --> 51:35.500
I really like it.

51:35.500 --> 51:38.940
That's one of the areas I think, depending on, you know, whatever your interest in crypto

51:38.940 --> 51:44.140
generally, a lot of these tools are very familiar to us, like self hosting, loving Linux users.

51:44.140 --> 51:46.100
And so they're very accessible to just play with.

51:46.100 --> 51:51.000
Very exciting too, to like to cut out any kind of payment processor means that nobody

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
could censor us.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.620
Not that we really even say anything that would be censored, right?

51:54.620 --> 51:56.780
But just the idea that that's not a threat anymore.

51:56.780 --> 52:00.100
Well, or just as we've said before, you know, not everyone loves PayPal.

52:00.100 --> 52:01.780
I don't love PayPal, but all kinds of different things.

52:01.780 --> 52:05.260
Like you don't have to necessarily worry about the affiliation of the middleman that you

52:05.260 --> 52:07.100
have to choose to go do business through.

52:07.100 --> 52:08.100
That is a huge thing.

52:08.100 --> 52:10.860
A lot of people in free software don't like PayPal.

52:10.860 --> 52:12.620
That is something I have run into a lot.

52:12.620 --> 52:13.620
All right.

52:13.620 --> 52:14.620
Last one.

52:14.620 --> 52:15.620
We got a thousand.

52:15.620 --> 52:17.140
Oh, by the way, uh, Hydra looked it up.

52:17.140 --> 52:20.820
One, two, three, four, five Satoshis is about four dollars and seventy cents.

52:20.820 --> 52:21.820
Thanks, Dave.

52:21.820 --> 52:22.820
Isn't that great?

52:22.820 --> 52:23.820
Yep.

52:23.820 --> 52:27.900
So we got a thousand stats from another anonymous who came in, um, on episode 444 much to do

52:27.900 --> 52:29.700
about Ubuntu.

52:29.700 --> 52:34.900
And he said, I'm pressing boost to pay my respects for lady tubes or too soon.

52:34.900 --> 52:35.900
I don't know.

52:35.900 --> 52:36.900
No, actually.

52:36.900 --> 52:40.580
Um, so we, we did get out of the rat town that we were in.

52:40.580 --> 52:43.700
I don't mean to be disrespectful, but it was bad.

52:43.700 --> 52:45.740
Um, and we hired professionals.

52:45.740 --> 52:48.860
We actually, we, and a few other people like they're, it's all getting taken care of.

52:48.860 --> 52:50.820
It's all getting addressed.

52:50.820 --> 52:52.940
And you know, we were kind of shaken up actually.

52:52.940 --> 52:57.780
I won't lie because after Tucson and then getting stuck in the woods and then getting

52:57.780 --> 53:02.580
out of the woods and getting a rat that chewed up some of our electrical wiring and mad props

53:02.580 --> 53:06.360
to my wife who like learned on the fly with help from Brent on how to like rewire this

53:06.360 --> 53:09.340
stuff while I was down here doing a show.

53:09.340 --> 53:13.580
And we got out of there and we went to the coast and we got this beautiful spot on the

53:13.580 --> 53:19.140
coast where I had the most epic shot for, for Starlink.

53:19.140 --> 53:24.140
So I was getting like 200 megabits down on my Starlink glorious and we spent about three

53:24.140 --> 53:25.140
weeks out on the coast.

53:25.140 --> 53:27.520
I think it's been about three weeks, two and a half weeks.

53:27.520 --> 53:31.980
We just left on Saturday and uh, it was a real nice reset.

53:31.980 --> 53:36.940
And I spent a couple of mornings watching otters fish, man, those things can swim.

53:36.940 --> 53:41.100
You know, they sit there all playful and but when they're hunting, they move like a missile

53:41.100 --> 53:43.860
underwater and I actually saw one of them get a salmon.

53:43.860 --> 53:46.500
That salmon put up a big old fight flopping all over the place.

53:46.500 --> 53:48.820
It's so wonderful when you're just around nature like that.

53:48.820 --> 53:49.820
Yeah, yeah.

53:49.820 --> 53:54.460
Big old crane birds and it reminds you to get your outside of yourself a little bit.

53:54.460 --> 53:57.500
Reminded me also why we did the art, why we chose to do the RV thing.

53:57.500 --> 54:01.800
And you know, my whole, my whole philosophy was that is like, yeah, maybe I could do that

54:01.800 --> 54:05.080
one day, but I don't really ever plan to retire.

54:05.080 --> 54:11.460
So I'd rather do this stuff now when I'm in my 30s and 40s than when I'm in my 60s and

54:11.460 --> 54:12.460
70s.

54:12.460 --> 54:16.140
Uh, because I'll tell you what, it is a ton of work loading and unloading and packing

54:16.140 --> 54:17.140
stuff up.

54:17.140 --> 54:19.000
It is a physical job.

54:19.000 --> 54:22.100
And so God knows I'm probably not going to be in better shape when I'm in my 60s and

54:22.100 --> 54:23.100
70s.

54:23.100 --> 54:24.100
So I figured do it now.

54:24.100 --> 54:29.420
It was really a nice reset and reminded me, um, I don't think we've repaired all the damage.

54:29.420 --> 54:35.180
I still actually, I am manually rewiring my slide right now.

54:35.180 --> 54:39.160
I go underneath to the controller and I switch the wires around.

54:39.160 --> 54:43.620
So I, I always push the extend button, which is up, but I switched the wires.

54:43.620 --> 54:48.540
So up is now reversed to in or out or whatever, you know, like, so I reversed the in and outs

54:48.540 --> 54:52.940
and I do it manually and it's working, but we still have more wiring repairs to do.

54:52.940 --> 54:56.620
We're not completely fixed, but she's operational enough that we can do work.

54:56.620 --> 54:58.020
You're not in pure manual mode.

54:58.020 --> 54:59.020
Right.

54:59.020 --> 55:00.020
Exactly.

55:00.020 --> 55:01.020
I'm not like breaking a rib trying to get the slide in.

55:01.020 --> 55:03.860
So it's, it is in a much, much better place now.

55:03.860 --> 55:10.060
And we had a really great time on the coast and the kids absolutely loved it.

55:10.060 --> 55:12.420
They just loved being on the beach so much.

55:12.420 --> 55:14.180
They did so much fricking exploring.

55:14.180 --> 55:18.580
So it turned out to be really great, but thank you anonymous.

55:18.580 --> 55:23.580
We are still, we are still making fixes and we have more fixes to do, so I appreciate

55:23.580 --> 55:30.420
the thousand sats, which is probably like a buck, but yes, all right, we've got to bust

55:30.420 --> 55:31.420
through these pics.

55:31.420 --> 55:32.780
Cause I was rambling on today.

55:32.780 --> 55:35.180
I, you, did you find spot cast?

55:35.180 --> 55:36.180
Yeah.

55:36.180 --> 55:37.180
All right.

55:37.180 --> 55:38.180
Spotify.

55:38.180 --> 55:43.940
These bastards love to have RSS shows, uh, that could just be on the open web, locked

55:43.940 --> 55:44.940
up behind their app.

55:44.940 --> 55:46.940
They're probably even powering the damn system with RSS.

55:46.940 --> 55:47.940
Let's be honest.

55:47.940 --> 55:48.940
Yeah.

55:48.940 --> 55:50.580
Uh, you know, you know what I'm talking about.

55:50.580 --> 55:55.700
And so Wes came across spot cast, which fixes this.

55:55.700 --> 55:56.700
Yeah.

55:56.700 --> 56:00.260
It's a caching Spotify podcast to RSS proxy.

56:00.260 --> 56:03.900
So you do have to do some setup, you know, there's some, uh, get, get your Docker going.

56:03.900 --> 56:06.140
And then it basically talks to spot podcast.

56:06.140 --> 56:10.260
I can't even talk, talks to Spotify API via some Python.

56:10.260 --> 56:14.200
So you got to sign in with your Spotify account to get access to that, but then it'll run

56:14.200 --> 56:17.580
and build you an RSS feed that you can play in any old player.

56:17.580 --> 56:18.580
Right.

56:18.580 --> 56:19.580
So you got to have that.

56:19.580 --> 56:22.220
You got to have the Spotify account, but this thing handles all of the Spotify interactions

56:22.220 --> 56:23.220
for you.

56:23.220 --> 56:24.780
And then you just plug that into your app of choice.

56:24.780 --> 56:25.780
Now I got to be honest.

56:25.780 --> 56:28.760
I don't have a Spotify account these days, so I've not actually tested it, but I could

56:28.760 --> 56:31.460
imagine if I did, or there was some, maybe there's some shows that you could only find

56:31.460 --> 56:35.780
on Spotify, but you just want in your regular old podcast player or antenna pod or something.

56:35.780 --> 56:40.100
Well, and maybe your favorite show gets like deleted, like they've pulled a couple of creators

56:40.100 --> 56:43.700
recently and they've pulled episodes from back catalogs before.

56:43.700 --> 56:45.260
This would be a great way to just back that stuff up.

56:45.260 --> 56:48.080
If you're a collector, that's a pretty neat pick.

56:48.080 --> 56:52.920
So we'll have that at linuxunplug.com slash four, four, six, if you want the link to that,

56:52.920 --> 56:53.920
but then get ready.

56:53.920 --> 56:58.260
We got a whole batch of Rust picks.

56:58.260 --> 57:08.300
Ha man, you know, I've wanted a replacement for that boring old watch command for so long,

57:08.300 --> 57:09.300
right?

57:09.300 --> 57:10.300
It's, it's one of the worst.

57:10.300 --> 57:11.300
Oh, so old fashioned.

57:11.300 --> 57:12.300
Yeah.

57:12.300 --> 57:13.300
I know.

57:13.300 --> 57:14.300
We'll rewrite it in Rust.

57:14.300 --> 57:18.140
All of, all of these core utils seem like they're getting rewritten in Rust stuff.

57:18.140 --> 57:22.840
That's like just, I've taken for granted for 20 years is just getting completely redone

57:22.840 --> 57:23.840
in Rust these days.

57:23.840 --> 57:26.900
So why would I want Rust watch or what are they calling it?

57:26.900 --> 57:27.900
H watch?

57:27.900 --> 57:28.900
Yeah.

57:28.900 --> 57:29.900
H watch.

57:29.900 --> 57:31.540
Well, well, and it's easy to install cause you can just download the Rust app.

57:31.540 --> 57:34.940
They've also got a Deb, which I tried here on non-pop OS on the kudu, which worked, worked

57:34.940 --> 57:35.940
just fine.

57:35.940 --> 57:36.940
All right.

57:36.940 --> 57:37.940
All right.

57:37.940 --> 57:38.940
Do you need a, no, probably not.

57:38.940 --> 57:39.940
But does it have some niceties?

57:39.940 --> 57:42.980
One, it's got some color support, which Hey, that's handy right there.

57:42.980 --> 57:43.980
Okay.

57:43.980 --> 57:46.940
And then you can do some clever difference tracking and kind of scroll through the differences

57:46.940 --> 57:47.940
as well.

57:47.940 --> 57:49.520
And then it also, it's not just like a dumb pipe.

57:49.520 --> 57:51.280
You can scroll through the execution result.

57:51.280 --> 57:54.860
So just like a little quality of life upgrade for your terminal experience.

57:54.860 --> 57:55.860
All right.

57:55.860 --> 57:56.860
You got me.

57:56.860 --> 57:57.860
You got me.

57:57.860 --> 57:58.860
You got me.

57:58.860 --> 57:59.860
That actually sounds pretty great.

57:59.860 --> 58:00.860
We've got another one.

58:00.860 --> 58:04.180
This one looks like it's, it's a note taking of a form, right?

58:04.180 --> 58:05.860
But not like regular notes.

58:05.860 --> 58:09.980
No, this is more like if you're trying to doodle or draw or add annotations free for

58:09.980 --> 58:14.980
maybe you've got a pen on a tablet, something like that, or a touch screen and it's available

58:14.980 --> 58:15.980
on flight hub.

58:15.980 --> 58:16.980
Yeah.

58:16.980 --> 58:19.140
And it's GTK four too.

58:19.140 --> 58:23.100
So this is a super easy install and we have had people that have written in and asked

58:23.100 --> 58:29.180
us, do you know of an app we can use with like a Wacom style pencil interfaces and always

58:29.180 --> 58:31.080
asking us, how can I use this on Linux?

58:31.080 --> 58:33.420
Our note seems like the way to go.

58:33.420 --> 58:37.660
Also if you just want an easy to try out GTK four first application that does something

58:37.660 --> 58:40.340
a little different, our note could be a great way to go.

58:40.340 --> 58:43.820
Or maybe you're a developer and you're curious to see some GTK four and rust interactions.

58:43.820 --> 58:45.540
Maybe take a look in the source code.

58:45.540 --> 58:46.540
All right.

58:46.540 --> 58:47.980
Now I know you're a dog man.

58:47.980 --> 58:48.980
So tell me about dog.

58:48.980 --> 58:51.100
Well, it's another rust app.

58:51.100 --> 58:52.100
Yeah, that's right.

58:52.100 --> 58:53.100
Our last one for this episode.

58:53.100 --> 58:54.100
It's command line DNS client.

58:54.100 --> 58:55.100
I know you need another one, right?

58:55.100 --> 59:02.540
You're probably still doing a host or something terrible or still using dig when you could

59:02.540 --> 59:03.540
be using drill.

59:03.540 --> 59:04.540
No, now you can use dog.

59:04.540 --> 59:05.540
Oh, I like dog.

59:05.540 --> 59:06.540
D O G is easy.

59:06.540 --> 59:07.540
It's quick.

59:07.540 --> 59:08.540
It's easy.

59:08.540 --> 59:10.100
I like the little catch line here too.

59:10.100 --> 59:12.940
Dog can look up.

59:12.940 --> 59:15.700
Dog is an open source DNS client for the command line.

59:15.700 --> 59:17.540
It has colorful output.

59:17.540 --> 59:19.660
I'm noticing a trend with us.

59:19.660 --> 59:20.660
That's pretty great.

59:20.660 --> 59:22.000
Oh God, of course.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.680
And it can also output the results as JSON, right?

59:25.680 --> 59:30.580
It's also got, um, you know, DNS over TCP, DNS over HTTP support built right into.

59:30.580 --> 59:33.920
So if you've got some of those modern fancy DNS going on, you want to build a query that

59:33.920 --> 59:35.980
with first party support, that's great.

59:35.980 --> 59:39.660
And yeah, JSON support, maybe you're doing something you shouldn't or setting up a crazy

59:39.660 --> 59:41.740
little shell pipeline.

59:41.740 --> 59:42.740
Dog could fit right in.

59:42.740 --> 59:46.420
I think as soon as Brent and I saw JSON support on there, we're like, oh yeah, no, this is

59:46.420 --> 59:47.420
why West.

59:47.420 --> 59:48.420
Oh yeah, here we go.

59:48.420 --> 59:49.420
Yep.

59:49.420 --> 59:51.420
That's got West written all over it.

59:51.420 --> 59:53.580
You don't have to grab and do like text parsing.

59:53.580 --> 59:54.580
It's data.

59:54.580 --> 59:56.140
You know, it's fun when we do a lot of picks.

59:56.140 --> 59:59.500
It's been a little while since we've done a, like a whole bunch of them.

59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.100
We usually try to like reserve it to just one and make one really good one.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.620
But sometimes you just can't choose.

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:05.620
Those are all good.

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.380
And you know, there's so many rust apps coming out these days.

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:11.420
If we just did one a week, we couldn't keep up.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:12.420
No, no.

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.420
All right.

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:14.420
Well, I think that's probably everything.

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.420
Yeah.

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:16.420
I think we're all done.

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:17.420
Man, that laptop's been fun.

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.660
Kind of be sad to see it go, but now it must get packed back up probably for someone else

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.660
to review.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.620
I would imagine they're going to have fun though.

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.620
Yeah.

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:26.620
Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:30.060
So if you want links to anything we talked about today, Linux, unplug.com slash four,

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.060
four, six.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.340
I do remember we do have that love plug getting together.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.000
They get together before the show starts.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.660
We do the show on Sundays, Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar is your place to do

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:41.660
that.

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:42.660
See you next week.

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.660
Same bat time.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:44.660
Same bat station.

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:49.740
I didn't know you called YouTube a bat station these days, but okay.

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:56.460
You know, I, I guess the hip thing to do would be to like follow and do the bell thing, right?

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:59.660
If you're on the YouTubes or if you're on the Twitch to do what they do on Twitch, which

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:00.660
is whatever.

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.660
I don't know.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:02.660
I don't know.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:09.060
You know, the pod ping folks that, that, uh, are part of podcasting 2.0 are working on

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:13.940
announcing live streams in podcast apps podcast app could tell you when they're live.

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:14.940
I like.

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:17.620
It's probably a year or two away, but they're laying the groundwork right now.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:18.620
All right.

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.620
That's everything for today's episode.

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:35.540
We'll see you right back here next Sunday.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:02:07.180
Maybe I should start running an ad for the donations, you know, cause we only have one

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:10.820
sponsor right now and the show's kind of built around a two sponsor format.

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:13.500
Um, you could do like a Jupiter dot party.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:17.340
I should just, can we come up with a really like, like, uh, yeah, we need like a great

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:20.180
ad, like we need something that's really good.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.500
We need a little jingle music.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:22.500
Yes.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.500
Yeah.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:24.500
Somebody that could create a, we need a director and a producer.

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.780
I think I'm going to need a character to play.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.780
Obviously you're going to need a character.

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:29.780
Yeah.

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:31.420
Sort of a, uh, how about a burnt out podcast host?

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:32.420
Yeah.

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:33.420
Yeah.

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:34.420
Yeah.

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:35.420
Maybe like a cowboy hat character for me.

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:38.260
I don't know why, but like, you know, with like a lasso and I'm like, I was thinking maybe

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:40.100
you had like a gold pan in your hand.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.100
Oh yeah.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.100
Or what about like, we'll podcast for food side.

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:45.340
That's pretty much what it is, dude.

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:46.340
It is.

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:48.100
You weren't going to do the show until I brought those tacos.
