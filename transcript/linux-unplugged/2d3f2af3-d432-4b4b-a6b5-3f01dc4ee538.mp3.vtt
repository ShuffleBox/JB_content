WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
So who wants to tell us about OggCamp?

00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
Because over here on the stateside, we don't get to hear much about it.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
So who wants to tell us about it?

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
Poppy, you want to start?

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
I think so.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Poppy should start because I'm an OggCamp newbie.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
All right, Poppy.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
You've been going since...

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
What, during the show or pre-show?

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Oh, well, I mean, if you talk about it right now, we'll include it in the show.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
So it'll be actually in the show.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
So it's got a really ridiculous name, OggCamp.

00:23.000 --> 00:32.000
But it came about in 2009 when the Lug Radio Live stopped happening.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
And the people who ran Ubuntu UK podcast and Linux Outlaws.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
So that's, you know, all the Fabian Schirschel, Dan Lynch, myself, Laura, Tony and so on.

00:43.000 --> 00:53.000
We all wanted to continue having a UK-based free culture, free software, you know, unconference type thing.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
So when you say, this is something I've wondered, when you say culture, is that like Creative Commons music and things like that?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Or what does culture kind of mean?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah, it can mean that.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
It can mean anything.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
It could mean electronics.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Maker stuff.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I mean, it's evolved into some of that as well.

01:09.000 --> 01:19.000
I mean, at the first one, we had someone who was doing analysis of people's psychology by the way they draw a picture of a pig or something as a presentation.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Awesome. That sounds really fun.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
This year, a few years later, we had a teletype that would print out anything that you tweet at it, which was brilliant.

01:29.000 --> 01:40.000
You know, it's like a full-on mix of technology from the 1950s and technology from now, you know, being able to tweet at a thing that would print your tweets out forevermore.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
The Linux Voice guys were there, loads of other people doing exhibition stuff.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
There was loads of kids there.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
People who came along to the event brought their children along and it's a safe environment for people to bring their children.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
I gave a presentation about Ubuntu Phone while kids were eating their lunch and walking.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Booing in the background.

01:59.000 --> 02:06.000
Yeah, I was having to step over them while I was giving my presentation, but it was all fine.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
That sounds really neat.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
And you were saying earlier it's a really friendly atmosphere.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
It's about 400 or so people, right? Or in that range.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
It depends each year, but yeah, it can vary between about 200 and 400.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
And, you know, that's a really good size where it's big enough where you can still meet new people for sure.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
But see people that you like, this is kind of like your chance to see them again.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
And, you know, the other thing is we are about to today, we're going to talk about all this internet drama, right?

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
And I'll tell you one thing that I cannot put a value on quite right yet.

02:38.000 --> 02:46.000
But something that I have noticed every time I go to one of these conferences, Linux Fest or OSCON or whatever.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Sometimes I walk away with something I didn't expect at all.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
Like this last time I made two really great contacts at OSCON that I'm still talking to them.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
And we're developing some new show ideas that are really exciting that I didn't go to OSCON expecting that to happen at all.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
They walked up to me at the conference and we started a dialogue.

03:03.000 --> 03:11.000
And same thing like, you know, like I really the only time I ever get to see Blaster is when we're at a conference.

03:11.000 --> 03:19.000
And it has the side effect of kind of reenergizing people creatively and refocusing them on the actual work.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
Like the social interaction, you walk away from that with a new vigor for the mission.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
And I think so often like we're going to talk about the drama today.

03:29.000 --> 03:37.000
I think so often that is the lacking piece is that we as human beings are not particularly good at this form of communication over a long period.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
We can use it to fill in gaps, but there is something about that physical meat space.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
And the reason why I think this is a big deal is because I was somebody who thought that was crap for a really long time.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
I thought technology was finally going to flatten the world and solve this problem.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
You know, I thought webcams and Google Hangouts and Skype and all of that would solve this.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
But it is not still quite the same.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
You know, the video helps, but there's just something about like going to an event, working together for the event,

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
being there as a group, you know, all of the effort that's involved with that,

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
that the mass amount of all working together that happens right in that moment,

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
that sort of reconnects that work ethic and all of those things.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
It's almost an intangible value, but it's so important.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
And having a meal with someone too.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah, right. Yeah.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
And projects start at conferences like that.

04:28.000 --> 04:35.000
I know at least two projects which are in embryonic stage that have resulted out of conversations at our camp.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
Stuart Langridge talked about having a portable device in your pocket that you could use for giving presentations.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
He's called it Splinter.

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
And he started a whole project around developing a device so you don't have to carry your laptop to a conference.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
You just plug this device into a projector and then use your phone to wirelessly cast your presentation.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Hold on now. Now he's stepping on Ubuntu Touch.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
That's what I want my Ubuntu Touch device to do.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Well, it's good.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Give me HDMI output and I'm good.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
And then we had a guy from Mozilla, James Huggman.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
He's a fantastic and lovely guy.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
He was talking about the offline world and going completely offline

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
and how someone in a remote village in the middle of nowhere

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
manages to keep in contact with people in the next village or people around the world

05:27.000 --> 05:34.000
and how we should enable offline access to information and services.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
These are things I just would not have thought of going to.

05:37.000 --> 05:45.000
So to dovetail with that, Poppy, I've been exchanging emails and had long conversations with James as a result of meeting him at Ogg Camp

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
because the extreme offline being in a remote rural location where you're connected to the internet by a shortwave radio

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
means that I have some experience in how you get online.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
He was asking about that and I looked around to find you in the presentation when he was talking about that.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
I went to see his second presentation and had a chat with him afterwards

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
and I've put him in touch with the people that I worked with.

06:09.000 --> 06:22.000
Colonel Linux was talking about the Microtech devices and how they have all of the bits of that jigsaw that can be fitted together to solve this problem.

06:22.000 --> 06:29.000
That is particularly... He gave me one of those.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
But he gave it to me right when I was doing the studio move and I put it in a box somewhere and it's so damn small I cannot find it.

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
But that's what I think I want to do for my firewall here at the studio, but I'm still... I don't know, PF Sensor, I just don't know.

06:42.000 --> 06:48.000
Just one last follow-up from the Ogg Camp thing there. You were asking about the free culture up front.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
I'm just about to post it into the IRS now.

06:52.000 --> 07:00.000
There were these guys there, Pepper Top, and they make Creative Commons sci-fi web comics.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Oh, this is great.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
And I had a good long chat with them. They make really good quality material.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
And the best bit was they went, oh, you're a Marte developer. We use Marte for our entire workflow.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
No way.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
And they were all in the front row of my presentation, all smiling and beaming away.

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
This is great. This is really, really... So are they doing like this with Inkscape and all that?

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
Yeah, the whole thing is open source, top to bottom, and all of the assets are freely available.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
So the other thing I was helping them with was sorting out their hosting,

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
because they need large-scale storage and lots of bandwidth to distribute this stuff.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Geez, I bet. Maybe they should talk to Alan, too.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
And they're the guys that do the comic in Linux Voice as well.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
This is really... See, this is that. That's exactly kind of what I was thinking.

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
And that's fun, because I think as Linux gets, I don't know, boring, but as the desktop gets boring,

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
I've been in LAS trying to shift the discussion not to so much about stats and features about Linux

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
and why Linux is better than Windows and all of that, but more about,

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
okay, well, let's just assume you're on Linux now for a reason, and everybody has their own reason.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Now, what the hell can you do with it?

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
And this is... I would love to get these guys on LAS and talk to them,

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
because I want to showcase in the Linux Action Show more, this is what Linux can enable you to do.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
And if you thought you couldn't do this on Linux before, well, now you can.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
It's hit and miss. I try to put a little bit into each segment, a little bit,

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
but I'd really like to showcase it more.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
I can totally put you in touch, because they're actually going to write an article for the Marte desktop

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
to explain how they're using the Marte desktop and why they've chosen to use it

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
as an essential part of their workflow.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
But the flip side of this is that the Ubuntu Marte project,

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
something that I'm working on at the moment, is precisely what you've just described.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
Once you've got this Linux computer in front of you, what do you use it for?

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
So I'm starting to curate something that looks like an app store, but there's no money involved.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
And it's for people that are familiar with the app store content to have web-installable apps and content.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
So Poppy and I discussed this idea of a trimmed-down version of the Software Center

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
with just those essential app picks that describe if you want a tool to do vector graphics,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
then you click the Inkscape icon.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
Don't tease me. Do not do this to me. Don't do this to me. Come on, guys, don't do this.

09:28.000 --> 09:38.000
The follow-on from that is a content section which links you to Creative Commons, albums, books, comics, art, and all of that stuff.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
Yes, yes, comics, yes, please, please. Oh my, you are blowing my mind right now.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
You know that GIF with the guy with the fireworks in his mind? That's me right now.

09:46.000 --> 09:54.000
I have never understood why we do not have some of that stuff in a Linux store like this. Oh my gosh.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
But it's not a store. It looks like an app store. It's just a way to discover stuff.

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
And every week we'll announce one new thing, so a new application one week, a new album the next week,

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
a book the week after that, some artwork or something like that.

10:10.000 --> 10:18.000
You know, the thing that I use an app store for – we've got to come up with a different term, really – but the thing that I use these sort of app stores for

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
is really the discovery. All right, I've sort of played with my stuff. I kind of want to see if something's new.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
And honestly, for a long time I did use – well, for a while I used the Software Center like that.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
And that is one of the things I find more appealing on iOS than Android.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
Although, don't freak out, because if you want to hear my thoughts on Android, go listen to this week's quarter radio.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
L is awesome. But in iOS, I can pop open that app store, and they do really good at that curation.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
And I just look at the curated ones. I'm like, yeah, that looks good enough. Pop. And I grab it.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
And I used to do that in the Software Center. But it doesn't need to be a quote-unquote app.

10:55.000 --> 11:03.000
It would be awesome if it was a comic book. I was looking at the Monsters, Inc. or one of the comics that you just linked us to, Wimpy.

11:03.000 --> 11:10.000
And I was thinking, I'd like to read this with my son. I would like to be able to go on, download something that – okay, I want to back up.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
So I'm a big believer in you should put your money where your vote is.

11:13.000 --> 11:20.000
And I think sometimes we get all worked up about Netflix on Linux and ripping Blu-ray and all this stuff.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
And in my opinion, it's like what we really need to do is just stop buying it.

11:25.000 --> 11:35.000
It's a bad habit. It has been manufactured to make us want it using a combination of the best abilities of Hollywood to make this stuff,

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
combined with the best marketing in the world, literally in the world.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
And so it is very enticing. And I totally understand that because I like this stuff too.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
But if you really want DRM to start up, you have to stop buying their stuff. Period. End of story.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
And the thing is, is there is a lot of good Creative Commons music.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
There is a lot of good work out there that is free that people are giving away.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
Just like in podcasts where people are downloading TV shows and movies.

12:00.000 --> 12:06.000
And meanwhile, podcast content creators are giving away their content for free that is absolutely legal for you to use that you can redistribute.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
Just like in podcasts, the same thing is true in video series.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
There are people making TV shows online that are completely Creative Commons and free.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
There are people making music and books and audiobooks and comic books.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
We do not do a good job of exposing it. There are websites out there, but they are not very popular.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
And they are often not very well designed either. And their search usually sucks.

12:28.000 --> 12:35.000
So what you are saying right now is you are going to try to solve some of that and put it in a nice application on my Linux desktop?

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
On a website. On a website that is open to a multi-website.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
So how do you trigger like a, would it just be like a downloading of a demo?

12:44.000 --> 12:56.000
It could easily be a contained website within a view and then you download a deb or the content that is easily unpackable.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
It could be a zip file with a bunch of mp3s in it. It does not have to be a deb.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
I just put a link in the chat room to Brad Sucks. He is basically an artist.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Brad Sucks?

13:07.000 --> 13:16.000
Yeah, he is an artist who has a lot, all of his music, he claims it as open source because you can actually erase the tracks if you want to.

13:16.000 --> 13:23.000
And you know, I just take this moment to point out that the Jupiter Broadcasting shows are creative commons, share alike, with attribution.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
Yeah, there you go. Easy. I do not know if people know, but there it is.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
I think Wimpy is being rather conservative saying new content once a week.

13:33.000 --> 13:43.000
I think you could quite easily up the rotation and, you know, have a comic on Monday, an audio file on a Tuesday, an application on a Wednesday.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
You know, you could you could certainly theme each day of the week, even if you only did it for the five working days.

13:47.000 --> 13:57.000
Yeah, and the thing is, is in order to do that, I'm going to have to get some community involvement in order to actually do that.

13:57.000 --> 14:10.000
Is there a way to make, you know, like it seems like in this day and age, you could almost, there should be a way where if something was requested enough or submitted enough or something like that, that it would maybe pop up on a list and then you could approve it or something, right?

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
There seems like there should be a system.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
It could be curated.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah, it can be.

14:13.000 --> 14:27.000
I mean, I've been using the community to give me direction on where the project's going already by holding votes and polls on decisions about what should be default applications, default settings and things of that nature.

14:27.000 --> 14:43.000
And what I'm thinking is using, because the community is growing quite rapidly, is actually asking them, tell me about some of your favorite Creative Commons music, TV, podcasts, books, comics, and actually using them to get the ideas.

14:43.000 --> 14:57.000
But the whole Ubuntu Mate website is all marked down and it's all rendered using a conversion script. So you don't need people that are super techie in order to actually add content to the website.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
So I'm hoping that I'll be able to open that up so that they can actually add the content.

15:03.000 --> 15:09.000
Gosh, you guys are speaking my language right now. This is awesome. This is really freaking exciting.

15:09.000 --> 15:15.000
It's not coming this release though. It's after 14.10, this idea.

15:20.000 --> 15:28.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugs, your weekly Linux talk show that is powered by an inappropriate amount of Snapple Tea. My name is Chris.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
And my name is Matt.

15:29.000 --> 15:35.000
Hey there, Matt. I hope you brought your wine and cheese for this week's episode because there's a little drama in today's show.

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
I seem to be a magnet for that lately. I know how you are about the drama. It's like your favorite thing ever, right?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Oh yeah, I love it.

15:43.000 --> 15:51.000
You keep a little log of all the drama that's going on so you can check back up on it because what you like to do, Matt, is spend a lot of time and energy on it, right?

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah, absolutely. Apparently that's what I do. It seems like I'm drawn into it.

15:56.000 --> 16:05.000
I don't know if we're going to be able to accomplish my goal today, but I want to discuss some of the things that are going on in the Linux community that from the outside might look like we're ripping apart.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
And maybe we could talk a little bit about what we think we could do differently.

16:11.000 --> 16:21.000
And maybe we'll talk a little bit about if this really is a problem from the top as it has recently been put by Mr. Pottering that sometimes the fish rots from the head down.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
Is that really true? Can we blame all of the recent drama on Mr. Torvalds? We'll discuss that as well.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Plus, we've got some news we're going to get to and, as always, some feedback.

16:31.000 --> 16:39.000
So, Matt, we are armed to bear with a huge Mumble Room today. Hey, Mumble Room, how you guys doing? Everybody just say hi. It's going to be nuts for a second. Just say hi.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
Hi. Hello.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Now that's kind of musical. That was almost kind of beautiful.

16:45.000 --> 16:52.000
You guys have been hanging out way too much. You guys harmonize. What the hell?

16:52.000 --> 16:57.000
Alright, so our first email comes in this week from viewer Mark.

16:57.000 --> 17:03.000
And Mark writes in and he says, I had a suggestion for that Mumble Room.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Now, this is totally optional, guys, so we're going to start with this.

17:06.000 --> 17:15.000
This is just kind of putting this out there, but Mark suggests a distro for the community to review. It's called PlayLinux.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
It is a distribution that is entirely designed for gamers. You can find it at play-linux.com.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
He thought it would be good for the unplugged group to go through this one.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
So I checked it out a little bit. I'll pull it up if you're watching the video version here.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
First of all, it has a really interesting website design compared to most Linux distributions.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
It's really well done. To me, it looks like it's directly appealing to folks that have heard about this Linux thing.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
It can play Steam. And right here at the beginning, you get an Ubuntu logo, a game controller logo, and their logo.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
And it makes it pretty simple.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
So Mumble Room, I know not all of you are big gamers. Is this something you'd be interested in trying?

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Does anybody want to step up and say, yeah, I'd take a look at PlayLinux?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Yeah, sure.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Alright.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
My reaction would be this is the dumbest idea ever.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Right. So that's fine. If that's what you think, that's fair.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
I have to agree there, Popeye.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Yeah. So we have Eric and Popeye willing to check it out.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
No, no. I'm willing to say this is the dumbest idea ever.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Oh, don't check it out. I'll just tell you a little bit about it.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
It uses Cinnamon for the desktop.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
It basically looks like it's Mint because it's using MDM, the Mint desktop manager for the login.

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
It comes with Spotify. It comes with their own installer for Skype and a few other of their own tools.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
It looks like they're integrating some of their own tools with it, though.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
So there could be some uniqueness. No? Going once?

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
You know, they had me until I realized they had LibreOffice installed.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Why the hell would you have LibreOffice on a gaming distro?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Oh, ouch, ouch.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
Well, I'm just saying. I was like, okay, I'm feeling it. I'm flowing.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Wait, what now? And they kind of lost me at that point.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I got one thing.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Okay.

18:54.000 --> 19:00.000
For me, this seems like another partition I'm going to have to put on my drive to have another thing to dual boot to.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Why on earth would I want to do that when I'm trying to stop doing that?

19:03.000 --> 19:10.000
I guess, yeah, if you were going to have a dedicated Linux installation for gaming, you might just go Steam OS, right?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Steam is stupidly easy to install.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Right.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Why would you even bother?

19:14.000 --> 19:20.000
And then if you were going to use the installation for much else, you'd probably just go with straight Linux.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
Well, I think it depends on the point in time you're installing Steam and what tool you're using to install it,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
because, I mean, there's certainly been some history there.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
But these days, I would say yes.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Although, I'm not as critical of the idea as you guys are.

19:31.000 --> 19:38.000
I actually think giving folks a really clear path for landing when they're coming to Linux to game is a pretty good idea.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
You know, one of the things we discovered when working with our buddy Chase and getting him to switch over to Linux

19:43.000 --> 19:53.000
was for him, and I still am kind of gobsmacked by this, but for him, the big barrier was there was too many distros,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
and he didn't want to pick the wrong one.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
And to me, and just from my light trolling of Linux underscore gaming on Reddit,

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
it seems like about once a week or so, there's somebody that comes in and says,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
hey, what's the best distro for gaming?

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
And so if there was something we could just say, go get this, it's based on Ubuntu 14.04,

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
it comes pre-installed with a Skype installer and all the stuff you need.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
It has Cinnamon, so it looks a lot like Windows 7.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
You would recommend Ubuntu over Steam OS?

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
Well, if they wanted to do anything else besides game, right?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Like if they wanted to use it as a desktop OS.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
If they wanted to use it as a desktop, why don't they just go straight up Ubuntu?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Well, I mean, yes, obviously.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Or any other distro.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
But I'm talking about people that are going to be trying to discover this on their own.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
They're not going to have the host of the Linux action show to ask what distro to install, right?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
They're going to have to go find out on their own.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
So you're saying that you have someone that's, gaming is their primary focus.

20:47.000 --> 20:51.000
Anything else is basically secondary, but this is basically mostly for gaming.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
Yeah. Plus, I want to also make it clear.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I think some of it's a little smoke and mirrors.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
Like, yeah, this is a distro optimized for gaming.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
So go get it, gamer, because it's optimized.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
When really it's just Linux, right?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
But it's a little bit of marketing.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Yeah, it's a little marketing too.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Because we want to make Linux look like an awesome place to switch to.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
So if we have a distro that's optimized for gaming, that might work.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
They have some cool ideas with having wine and wine tricks and play Linux all installed at the same time, like for you.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
That'd be nice, but I think the distro method is not practical.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
If they just did like a package, you could install all these at once and they did it for you.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
That would be awesome.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
Now Wimpy brings up a good point.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Go ahead, Wimpy.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Oh, right. Hang on. I'll just hit return again.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Yeah, I was curious.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Are you allowed to redistribute Steam?

21:42.000 --> 21:52.000
So if you've created your distribution and you install Steam before it's done its unpacking, you know, downloading, unpacking, are you allowed to redistribute that?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
As I understand it, yes.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Yeah, did they specifically?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
This was asked by all the other distros.

21:57.000 --> 22:07.000
When Steam came out and there was a big brouhaha that it was all about Ubuntu and they would recommend Ubuntu, every other distro got a little bit butthurt.

22:07.000 --> 22:13.000
And they asked Valve if it was OK for them to redistribute Steam and the general answer is yes.

22:13.000 --> 22:18.000
No, actually, I think Valve even updated the EULA to reflect that, didn't they?

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
I'm not talking about redistributing in repositories.

22:21.000 --> 22:27.000
I mean actually a distribution pre-installed with that little downloader installer gizmo.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
You don't need to though. All you need is that you just need the stub and you're done.

22:31.000 --> 22:41.000
Because it doesn't matter when you make the ISO because Valve are going to put out an update between them in the time it takes you to download the ISO.

22:41.000 --> 22:49.000
Most of the time in Arch when I install Steam from the repository, Steam launches and then just does a self-update and then it like pulls down the Ubuntu environment and all that.

22:49.000 --> 22:59.000
I think someone said earlier, why does it have a LibreOffice? It's probably because of the tagline.

22:59.000 --> 23:04.000
That's true and I guess it's something people recognize. Includes Office, I guess it's a checkbox thing.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
Spotify again. So Final Call, is anybody interested in giving this?

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Eric, you seem like you might be interested, right?

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
Do you have a machine to load it on? If you don't want to, you don't have to. It's totally voluntary.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
I can easily use Clonezilla so I've got a partition, no big deal.

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
We should do a segment on that. Alright, so anybody else interested in reviewing this? Anybody?

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
Going once, going twice. Alright Eric, I'll leave it. If you feel like doing it, no pressure.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
But if you feel like doing it and want to come back next week and tell us about it and let us know how it went, I'd be really curious.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
I actually don't think it's that bad of an idea as long as they get it right.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Alright, so FakeMoth wants to get us all fired up.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
Microsoft just isn't the boogeyman it used to be.

23:47.000 --> 23:57.000
How about we tell you a little tale of government corruption and Microsoft buying off folks to do what they do best.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Sell more software and get people hooked.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
But before we get to that, I want to tell you about our first sponsor this week.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
That's the great folks over at Ting. Go to linux.ting.com so that way the Linux Unplugged show gets a little bit of credit for your visit.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
And you get a $25 credit on your Ting account if you have a compatible phone.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
And if you don't have a phone yet, well they'll take $25 off your first phone.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I'll talk about that more here in just a second.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
Linux.ting.com. Everybody go there right now. Linux.ting.com.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
It's my mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider.

24:25.000 --> 24:31.000
And I think after all this time, the thing that really stands out about Ting is really the huge savings has come in paying for what I use.

24:31.000 --> 24:39.000
I'm not at my two-year mark yet, but it is truly unbelievable to see the savings difference by switching to Ting.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
So I have three phones. I have an iPhone 5, I have an HTC One, and a Nexus 5.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
All on my Ting account. And two of the phones get heavy usage.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
One of the phones, well one of them is Rekai. He doesn't get a lot of usage.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
But oh Rekai, I'm just teasing. He's all on the Wi-Fi, that's why.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
Actually Rekai uses it a ton, but he uses it on Wi-Fi.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
This is, by the way, a huge advantage to Ting.

25:01.000 --> 25:07.000
Because if you are at an office place, or at home, where you have Wi-Fi most of the time,

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
why are you paying for data and minutes that you will hardly use?

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
Just in case you might go over? That sounds like a scam to me.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
And that's where Ting is different. You only pay for your usage.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
It's a flat $6 a month for your line. That just gets you the line right there.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
That's unbelievable, just starting there.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
And then it's just your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
Individually, whatever you use, Ting just adds it up at the end of the month.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Whatever bucket you fall into is what you pay.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
So for me, for three lines, for three smartphones, it's like $40 something on average right now.

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
I don't know, I actually, it's literally low enough that I just don't care.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
Like if it was in the hundreds, I absolutely would care.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
And because I'm still looking back from when I had a traditional mobile carrier

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
where I was paying like $140 after taxes a month,

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
the fact that I'm paying $100 less a month, it blows my mind.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
And on top of that, if that wasn't enough, then you have Ting's customer service.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
They have a no-hold customer service if you call them between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on business days.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
You just call them at 1-855-TING-FTW, and a real human being actually answers the phone.

26:11.000 --> 26:18.000
But the best part is, these human beings are like smartphone geeks that Ting has hired because they love smartphones.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
Like these are the people that in their family and friends and community groups, they were the tech person,

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
so Ting hires them to come do their tech support.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
So then you end up talking to somebody who likely knows Android better than you do.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Yeah, I know, I don't mean to offend, but it's very likely.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
I'm talking these are enthusiasts. That's genius.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
But for me, because I'm a busy guy and I usually don't get to this stuff until late at night

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
when everybody's asleep and it's way after business hours,

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
well, they give me the tools to make sure I have control over my account.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
Ting has an awesome dashboard with a great heads-up display that gives you like feel usage

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
so you can see like your minutes and your messages and your megabytes all right there.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
And not only that, but Ting will be like, hey, bro, this was your average last month,

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
and this is kind of where you're trending at right now.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
Here's your highs, here's your lows, this is where we think you might be.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
And it's brilliant. It is absolutely brilliant.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
And right there in the Ting dashboard, I can turn a device on or off.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I love that aspect of Ting.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
So here's what I want you to do. Go to linux.ting.com right now.

27:14.000 --> 27:19.000
Click on that savings calculator. Put your actual cellular usage in there,

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
you know, which you actually use, and click that calculate savings right there.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
I'm just saying you might be surprised at the amount of money you could save.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
You'll likely be able to buy a laptop every two years by switching to Ting.

27:29.000 --> 27:35.000
And right now over on the Ting blog, they have their another Ting contributor's top five app picks.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
Oh, I'll have to tell Ang about MapMyWalk. They have some good ones over. Yeah.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
Yeah. Oh, okay. We see you have somebody a little... Oh, yeah. Okay. All right.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
So go over there. Go to linux.ting.com and check out the blog.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
They have another top five app picks.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
And by the way, if you've been kind of on the fence about switching to Ting,

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
they're moving warehouses, they're getting a bigger facility, and while they move,

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
they're like, we really would rather not move these devices.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
If you would like to buy them, we will sell them really cheap.

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
And so they have a great deal on the notes and even the feature phones.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
It's some incredible savings. And remember, if you go to linux.ting.com,

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
you're going to get a $25 discount.

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
So go check them out right now. And they're also now taking the iPhone 5S and 5C.

28:16.000 --> 28:22.000
So if you've got an extra one of those now, you can move it over to Ting and get a $25 credit.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
linux.ting.com. And a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged Show.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
Okay. So you ready for this Microsoft corruption story, as it were?

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
Jake Moth sends this in. He says, hello, I'm a big fan of Vlas and Techsnap here in Romania.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
You know, the country that has gigabit Ethernet speeds every house for years because our ISPs all use Unix.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
Well, it seems no one is paying attention.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
So this is going to be a long email because he's got to get the word out.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
In fact, he expresses his frustration that nobody's talking about this.

28:54.000 --> 29:00.000
I've been working in the IT field for 10 plus years, and I'm very passionate about technology and open source.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
The problem is I consider myself a moral person.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
And for years, it's sickened me to work in corporate IT sales.

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
I know I'm avoiding this area, but he says it's hell and doing anything else in IT is also hell.

29:14.000 --> 29:23.000
He seems to have a hard time with IT, but he says, I've been watching something from afar that I've been witnessing with my own eyes that is driving me crazy.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
Microsoft is buying out our government. It's a whole food chain. Make no mistake.

29:27.000 --> 29:34.000
The problem started back in 2001 when Romania began buying equipment and licenses for the education department.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
Since then, all other institutions like the police, the Justice Department, the army, everyone,

29:39.000 --> 29:51.000
also then started buying Microsoft licenses at 200 to 300 percent of the market price and more licenses than computers they had to run them.

29:51.000 --> 29:57.000
Hundreds of thousands of licenses, Windows licenses, client access licenses, office licenses, SQL licenses.

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
Simply put, instead of paying less for education and government, or at least for the high volume they were buying,

30:02.000 --> 30:09.000
Romania paid at least double the highest regular price on the market. Why? Simple. Corruption.

30:09.000 --> 30:16.000
Now the USA and the Romanian DNA, which stands for National Agency Against Corruption, I don't know why they don't put the C in there.

30:16.000 --> 30:26.000
I guess they just like DNA as the acronym. They have discovered an offshore account through which the payments have been made to various Romanian officials,

30:26.000 --> 30:33.000
allegedly by Microsoft, because all of them have been tracked back to the US Microsoft headquarters.

30:33.000 --> 30:39.000
Also, Fujitsu and Siemens seem to be in on it, so perhaps that's where the hardware sales are going.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
He says, I'm surprised that the international press doesn't talk much about this.

30:43.000 --> 30:53.000
We're talking about tens of millions of euros lost by the state. Around 30 millions are only on the provable bribes, on the provable ones.

30:53.000 --> 31:01.000
He says, the huge benefits for Microsoft and their local partners, mainly Sevco, are licenses bought even though when it wasn't necessary to do so.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
He says, thanks for the great shows. Keep them going. Best wishes. Fake Moth from Romania.

31:05.000 --> 31:11.000
So anybody surprised by this? And how can open source ever compete with that? How can that ever happen?

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
It's an old hat. It's an old hat. There are more blades overseas though.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
So, Dara Devlin, I'd like to get your European perspective on this.

31:19.000 --> 31:30.000
So, the first thing I'll say is, this is most likely actually something the Romanian government wants to be able to have a justification to increase their actually hardware.

31:30.000 --> 31:36.000
Oh, interesting. We have all these licenses, now let's buy the hardware to use them.

31:36.000 --> 31:43.000
Yes, so it is a process of technology modernization. A lot of governments actually do this.

31:43.000 --> 31:56.000
And then I don't think it will actually be a long term problem because Romania is going through the process of being more integrated with the rest of the European Union.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
The result is there is going to be more tighter controls.

31:59.000 --> 32:06.000
So, get that money. Yes, you're doing that, but also notice some of this money is not necessarily coming only from Romania.

32:06.000 --> 32:12.000
It's coming from all European services, but eventually it will kind of standardize and put in equal footing.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
So, we've seen this in the past and things eventually worked out.

32:16.000 --> 32:24.000
So, it's kind of like they're taking advantage of the situation while they can, but in the end it will all wash out?

32:24.000 --> 32:34.000
Yes, I think it's unavoidable because people not only get tired, it's also that time that Microsoft no longer has the play it had.

32:34.000 --> 32:41.000
Yeah, that's very true and they really no longer have a lot of the same arguments they had.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
The big one used to be office interoperability.

32:44.000 --> 32:54.000
It was unquestionable that if you were in, this is just from my experience in contracting in the Seattle area, so this may be a little skewed, but in my recollection,

32:54.000 --> 33:04.000
when you were a business there was an assumed cost with every PC, Mac or Windows that you would have to buy Office because you had to be interoperable.

33:04.000 --> 33:11.000
That's no longer really the case with LibreOffice's converters working very well and Google Docs and Office 365 even.

33:11.000 --> 33:18.000
Just that right there has fundamentally undermined the relevancy because it changes the conversation from unquestionable,

33:18.000 --> 33:25.000
it's associated with the cost of buying a new PC, to it just changes the dialogue to do we really need this?

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
I don't know if we need this for this station.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
That right there is huge and it's just going to continue.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Of course, Windows 10 will turn it all around, I'm sure.

33:34.000 --> 33:46.000
Bernardo writes in and I didn't roll this story in because I figured everybody's going to think Chris is an Arch fanboy,

33:46.000 --> 33:55.000
so I avoided even talking about this, plus statistics and all of that, but Bernardo writes in and just points it out and wonders if it's a trend.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
He says, hello Chris, hello Matt.

33:57.000 --> 34:08.000
You probably already noticed this, but I read an article on Ferronix in which it says that Arch Linux is about to overtake Ubuntu's first position in the benchmark usage,

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
so i.e. distributions that are running the open benchmark software.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
Right now, Ubuntu has been dominant.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Now here is the interesting thing though.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
This, who knows, right?

34:19.000 --> 34:24.000
But if you look at this chart, that's actually kind of telling in a sense.

34:24.000 --> 34:36.000
For those of you not watching the video version, it is unmistakable that as the Ubuntu decline has been in there, the Arch is increased.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
Now, what do you think we are to take from this?

34:39.000 --> 34:45.000
Is it perhaps folks who are benchmarking their machines have more custom builds so they've sort of migrated to Arch?

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
See, I would disagree with that to an extent, but that seems like it's a potential answer.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
Matt, do you have any theories right off the top of your head on this?

34:53.000 --> 35:01.000
Not really. It's one of those things I would want to watch more and dive deeper into before I start inserting myself on that, but it's definitely something to keep an eye on.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
Yeah, what I wonder is if it really is indicative of anything.

35:05.000 --> 35:12.000
I think the only way you could say it is if you saw several other kinds of trends where other sites and other things are observing the same thing.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
I think for benchmarks in particular, that's a hard one.

35:16.000 --> 35:23.000
That seems like something that particularly Arch folks, because you're going to have a lot of folks that are building a custom rig, right?

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
And then they want to get the most out of that. They're going to want the latest kernel and all of that stuff.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
So it seems like they would skew more towards Arch.

35:29.000 --> 35:39.000
Now, that kind of supports my theory that perhaps Arch is becoming the new distro of the more advanced Linux user, the more long-term experienced Linux user.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.000
I don't know. Anybody else have any other thoughts on this?

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
No? All right. All right. Okay, go ahead, Matt. Give it to Matt, and then we'll go to Wimpy next.

35:49.000 --> 35:56.000
Just real quick, I was going to tell you that if you stop and think about it, benchmarking is a lot like trying to measure a river with a ruler or a yardstick.

35:56.000 --> 36:03.000
Theoretically, you can do it, but you might not always get the most accurate results, especially depending on which end of the river you happen to be measuring from.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
So there's a lot of truth to that, and I think we're kind of looking at the same thing.

36:07.000 --> 36:13.000
It's one of these things to where it can become an absolute thing real quick, and I'm not real clear that we have all the details yet.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
Yeah, but that sounds like an Alaskanism. I like that, Matt.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Oh, absolutely.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
Wimpy, you were going to make a point, and then I'll go to Poppy next.

36:21.000 --> 36:29.000
Yeah, I was just going to say that if you were into doing benchmarks, then Arch Linux is a sensible platform to run your benchmarks on because you've always got the latest stuff.

36:29.000 --> 36:35.000
You've got the latest kernel, the latest file system user space, the latest drivers, the latest X.

36:35.000 --> 36:45.000
So if you want to see what's changing and what's improving, then doing it on Arch would be the platform to use because it's low barrier of entry to actually get the latest stuff.

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
Okay, all right. That seems like a pretty plausible explanation. Poppy, do you have any thoughts?

36:50.000 --> 37:05.000
I can imagine that there's certainly some Ubuntu users who run benchmarks on their system, but I would imagine the typical Arch Linux user is the kind of person also who would run benchmarks.

37:05.000 --> 37:20.000
I don't know whether they've got something to prove or whether they're measuring something. But I would imagine that there is a significant number of Ubuntu users who don't measure their benchmarks.

37:20.000 --> 37:26.000
It's interesting though, right? It kind of depends on who you're coming from.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
It's a self-selecting audience.

37:28.000 --> 37:37.000
Well, yes, it is. You're right. In the grand scheme, yeah. Because really though, there is value in benchmarking on Ubuntu if you're trying to see what the average Linux consumer, quote-unquote, is going to experience.

37:37.000 --> 37:46.000
But Zerolog, he wants to come in and say, you guys are all wrong. Arch isn't an advanced user's distro. So perhaps Zerolog is our theory bogus?

37:46.000 --> 37:54.000
Well, the thing is, we always make Arch out to be this advanced distro for people who have experience in Unix systems.

37:54.000 --> 38:00.000
But really, it's not really an advanced distro as much as it is a distro for somebody who wants to learn or really knows about their system.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Or wants an easy button for new software.

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
Some people want the just works and other people want to tinker with stuff.

38:06.000 --> 38:14.000
So here's where Arch is actually, in a lot of ways, for lazy noobs. The AUR. Okay, let's not kid ourselves.

38:14.000 --> 38:21.000
What the AUR is all about is getting the latest software without having to download the tar.gz, go in there, make it, make install, right?

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
Let's be honest. That's what the AUR is about. It's about making it super easy to get the software I want because I want it right now.

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
Now, where you need to be an advanced user to use Arch is these burnout stories we hear about.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
And so this is our next topic, actually.

38:35.000 --> 38:42.000
Gabriel3 wrote on the subreddit, has anyone else left Arch for another distro? And which is your after Arch distro?

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
Because he says he took the Arch challenge and after that, he burned out and switched to OpenSUSE.

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
And his problem has been not in building software and installing it, because that's easy under Arch.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
His problem has been keeping it running.

38:54.000 --> 39:01.000
That seems to be where maybe expertise and past experience play a key role in using Arch.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
And that does seem like the type of user who also would be benchmarking.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
So I kind of agree with this theory overall.

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
I don't think it indicates any kind of usage trend other than maybe more advanced users are using Arch more than they used to.

39:11.000 --> 39:19.000
And the fact that the two lines are kind of, I mean, I think it might suggest that's a possibility, but I don't think it means it.

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
So here's what he wrote. I want to get into Gabriel's post, and let's kick this around.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
He says, hi guys, I just want to share with you, and this wonderful community, what happened.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
He said, three months ago I moved to Arch.

39:30.000 --> 39:36.000
The beginner's guide was great, and he moved around from MATE to XFCE to GNOME, and then eventually back to MATE.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
He tried out KDE and the Plasma desktop for a little while.

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
And so then eventually, once he decided he liked Plasma, he moved over to OpenSUSE 13.1,

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
because in the long run he had to keep fiddling to keep his Arch running.

39:50.000 --> 39:57.000
He says, I was willing to fix small issues, but it just got annoying after a while, so I switched to OpenSUSE.

39:57.000 --> 40:07.000
And this is kind of my point, is like you can have somebody go download Antigrowth or any of the other Arch derivatives,

40:07.000 --> 40:14.000
but if Arch is hard to maintain and hard to keep running, then it probably is for more advanced people.

40:14.000 --> 40:23.000
And the thing is, and I don't know why this is, because I'm not like some sort of Jedi here,

40:23.000 --> 40:31.000
but I have three or four Arch installations in this building that are at least six months old.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
Maybe some of them are a little younger than that. Some of them are over a year old now.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
And none of them are ever having problems.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
And I think part of it is just switching around the desktop.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
And I wondered, is this just a unique experience for me?

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
And I read through the comments, and I actually see people in here commenting saying,

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
I've been using the same install for seven years.

40:52.000 --> 40:58.000
This guy says he's been using the same install. He's even moved it between motherboards.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
But then other folks are saying, yeah, I've had the same problem.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
So, I don't, Poby, go. What is this? What's going on here?

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
Sorry, you were just saying you'd never have problems on Arch.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Well, I never knew problems that would make me want to switch.

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
And I have a low threshold for that kind of thing. I mean, I have...

41:15.000 --> 41:23.000
I remember an episode of this show not that long ago where you were ranting about how stuff was broken in the studio.

41:23.000 --> 41:29.000
Yeah, but I don't think that was Arch's fault. I don't think. I don't remember.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Those were mostly hardware failures, as I recall.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Huh?

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
I detect some Stockholm syndrome.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Well, maybe. And that's what I'm wondering.

41:35.000 --> 41:41.000
I mean, so, like, here's why I think... here's where I'm coming from.

41:41.000 --> 41:48.000
You know, I really, if something gives me much trouble, I'm more of a nuke and pave than I am a troubleshooter.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
Because I just have a lot of stuff to do.

41:51.000 --> 41:58.000
And I've never... my threshold is for if it's broken is, have I ever gotten to the point where I just want to format and reload the installation?

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
And none of my Arch systems have gotten to that point.

42:01.000 --> 42:06.000
I had issues with some kernel modules that, you know, would break after a new kernel.

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
But then once I figured out, oh yeah, dummy, use DKMS, like, that hasn't been a problem.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
Like, VirtualBox has never broken since. And that was, like, you know, a year ago now.

42:13.000 --> 42:18.000
The things I more struggle with are, like, you know, a gnome update that breaks extensions.

42:18.000 --> 42:25.000
Or the fact that ButterFS is a bastard and it's using up a ton of my drive for metadata and whatever the hell else.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
And those kinds of problems. But I don't really have a problem with Arch itself.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
I'm not trying to make this some big Arch promotion here.

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
Well, technically you could argue that some of those are Arch problems themselves.

42:36.000 --> 42:41.000
Because you're getting bleeding edge crap, like, straight from the hose.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
But I could have the same...

42:42.000 --> 42:47.000
You know, you wouldn't get that from Ubuntu from the past, 10.04 or 12.04.

42:47.000 --> 42:54.000
You wouldn't get it from Debian stable. You wouldn't get it from Suzo, you know, 12 or whatever is their stable version.

42:54.000 --> 43:02.000
I think you're ascribing the brokenness to some upstream package.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
Whether it's ButterFS or whatever.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
When in fact it's actually a byproduct of you running bleeding edge stuff.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
Exactly.

43:10.000 --> 43:17.000
No, I think that's the Arch. I think that is the Arch contract in a nutshell right there.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
That's it. You just nailed it.

43:18.000 --> 43:25.000
And the advantage that something like OpenSUSE has or something like that is it's not going to change very much.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Or, you know, 14.04 or whatever.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Unless you're on factory.

43:29.000 --> 43:34.000
Right. But I would. You see, I guess that's my core point is I'm not going to run any of those things, right?

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
Like today, if I was going to install Fedora, I wouldn't be installing Fedora stable.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
I would install the latest build that they're working on right now.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
If I went to OpenSUSE, I would go rolling.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
I would use Ubuntu 14.10. I would use Debian testing.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
I would not use any of those stable things. None of them.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
None of them are current enough at all.

43:51.000 --> 43:57.000
So since if you accept that, if that is your outlook as well, and I'm not saying it should be,

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
but if that is in fact is probably not a healthy one, you might want to consider it, but it's mine.

44:01.000 --> 44:10.000
And so for me, if I accept that fact, then out of all of my choices, Arch seems to be the one that's best at delivering that.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
But that's great.

44:11.000 --> 44:19.000
I think it's fabulous that Arch serves a market that is out there of people who want the absolute latest bleeding edge.

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
But you've got to be able to cope with the brokenness when it happens.

44:23.000 --> 44:29.000
And it does happen. You're deluding yourself if you think there's no brokenness at all.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
No, I agree.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
Because that happens with every disk, Ubuntu included.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
You know what it is? I'm a bit astonished it doesn't happen a hell of a lot more, to be honest with you.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
Really, because like it probably happens every, you know, I don't even know, really.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
But like I update all the freaking time you think it would happen more often.

44:44.000 --> 44:52.000
So my point is, is perhaps what this chart does show us is there's a lot more people out there thinking the way I'm thinking over time.

44:52.000 --> 44:58.000
It doesn't mean everybody is, but it probably means the segment of type of people that do benchmarks are kind of thinking more the way I'm thinking.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
That's I think really what it shows us potentially.

45:01.000 --> 45:11.000
I find it striking how on, back in May of 2014 this year, how they start to mirror each other, Ubuntu and Arch.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Yeah, right, exactly, yes.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
It's really weird.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
That was kind of the interesting thing.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
But anyways, we'll have a link in the show, that's enough.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
That's enough on that. It was a good email.

45:18.000 --> 45:23.000
And it was something I wanted to talk about, but I didn't let myself talk about it because I was like, oh, Chris is a fanboy.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
But when somebody emailed in, they gave me an excuse to bring it up.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Hey, Chris.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Yeah.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
You know, Arch is for experienced users.

45:31.000 --> 45:40.000
It has become a lot easier in the past few years than it has been in the past, but it is for advanced users or at least someone who isn't scared to get a little bit dirty.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
We never recommended it before.

45:42.000 --> 45:48.000
It was more of a try it out, dip your toe in the water, see if you like it, then determine whether or not it floats your boat.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
Otherwise, it might not work.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Seuss might just fit his bill.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Right, right.

45:55.000 --> 46:00.000
And thank goodness, too, because there's a lot of hard work going into that distribution.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
So, I'm glad there's people out there that it's filling a market need for.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Same with all the other ones.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
I think we're about to get into all the drama stuff.

46:08.000 --> 46:14.000
And I think it's important to keep in mind that if that's what pulls your chain, that's totally fine.

46:14.000 --> 46:18.000
There's really absolutely not even a little bit anything wrong with that.

46:18.000 --> 46:33.000
And we need to keep in mind, as we're about to get into all this stuff, that at the end of the day, what we are all fighting over, all this stupid hairless monkeys are fighting over is things that flip bits on either magnetic storage or solid state storage.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Okay?

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
And it's really not that big of a deal.

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
So, let's keep that in mind as we get into some of the drama that is going on in the Linux community.

46:42.000 --> 46:47.000
And I think just even that little distro discussion there reminds us that there's some strong feelings and all ends.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
But at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter.

46:50.000 --> 46:58.000
Let's keep all of this in perspective as we get into some of this drama stuff, because I don't want this to get out of hand.

46:58.000 --> 47:05.000
But first, before we transition to that, since I think that's going to be kind of an in-depth topic, I want to talk about DigitalOcean.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Go over to DigitalOcean right now, won't you?

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
Because it is awesome.

47:08.000 --> 47:14.000
It is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.000
And you could probably get started in about 55 seconds or so.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
I've gotten reports of 12 seconds.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
33 seconds came in today.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
It's nuts.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
The reason why is DigitalOcean's infrastructure is awesome.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
They have got tier one bandwidth.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
They have got SSDs throughout.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
They've got some of the best hardware.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Check out their Instagram feed.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
They're just DigitalOcean on Instagram to see some of their data center pictures.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
It's awesome.

47:37.000 --> 47:42.000
So, you can get started in about 55 seconds, and it's going to cost you $5 a month for 512 megs of RAM.

47:42.000 --> 47:47.000
A 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
That's an amazing value.

47:48.000 --> 47:54.000
A terabyte of transfer alone for $5 is incredible, but you also get the SSD drive, and they're super fast CPUs.

47:54.000 --> 48:01.000
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and in London, a brand new one in London, actually.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
It's gorgeous.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
And their interface, it's super simple and intuitive.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
The control panel is amazing.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
It's kind of remarkable in a sense.

48:09.000 --> 48:16.000
And they have this ability for you to take all of the functionality in the dashboard that you might want to automate.

48:16.000 --> 48:21.000
Maybe you want to write a shell script for it, or you want to snap it into your existing management infrastructure.

48:21.000 --> 48:28.000
Because you could also consider DigitalOcean as a way to offload when you have to really meet capacity, when something big is about to go on.

48:28.000 --> 48:33.000
Your project is about to launch something, a new version is about to come out, an announcement, something like that.

48:33.000 --> 48:38.000
You can, with their straightforward API, you can integrate DigitalOcean right into your solution.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Spin up the droplets as you need them.

48:40.000 --> 48:46.000
And their management interface makes it so simple to take snapshots, so that way you can make sure you have a good backup before you make a major change.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
They have DNS management baked right in.

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
One-click installations for things like GitLab, WordPress, the entire LAMP stack.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
And of course, DigitalOcean's all about Docker.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
They're all about KVM.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
They're all about Linux.

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
And they're also letting you experiment with CoreOS, directly from the CoreOS project as well.

49:00.000 --> 49:07.000
I've got several Ubuntu LTS systems up on CoreOS, one of them running my own cloud, which I sync all of my mobile devices to now.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
And it's, for me, $5 a month is a no-brainer.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
But here's the best part.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
We can get you a $10 discount.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
So that way, you can try out DigitalOcean for two months for absolutely free.

49:18.000 --> 49:23.000
Now, we're in transition this week, so you can use the promo code unplugseptember or unpluggoctober.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
That'll give you a $10 credit.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Try it out.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
Try the $5 rig, or you can go get yourself a fancier rig.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Just give it a shot and see what you think.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
I think you'll be pretty damn impressed.

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
Go over to digitalocean.com and use the promo code unpluggoctober when you check out.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
And a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
And by the way, they also have guides up for the shell shock vulnerability.

49:45.000 --> 49:53.000
And next week, I'm going to tell you more about how you can contribute to DigitalOcean's tutorial community and actually make a little money too, which is really awesome.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
DigitalOcean.com.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Unplugged October.

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
And that really is something you've got to check out.

50:00.000 --> 50:06.000
I am amazed at what they can do now with DigitalOcean, especially somebody who's to deploy that stuff for clients.

50:06.000 --> 50:14.000
And that's something else you might want to consider is if you do have clients that need a website or some backend infrastructure for something they're doing or they just want to do offsite backups,

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
you could spin up a DigitalOcean droplet for them and even manage it for them.

50:17.000 --> 50:22.000
At $5 a month, there's probably a little profit to be made in there.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Okay.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
All right.

50:24.000 --> 50:32.000
So this week has been pretty rocky in the Linux community.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
And I'm not going to lie, it's pretty disappointing to watch it go down.

50:35.000 --> 50:42.000
Eric and I were sort of commiserating about this on the Tech Talk Today pre-show that we almost are kind of sick to our stomach in a sense.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
Right, Eric?

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
Yeah.

50:44.000 --> 50:49.000
I'm just face palming at the entire thing.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
It's sad.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
It's sad to watch a community blow up like this.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
So there's several things that are going on.

50:55.000 --> 51:05.000
I think the one that's created the most waves this week and the one that's really gotten a lot of response is Lenart Pottering went to Google Plus and made a post.

51:05.000 --> 51:08.000
And I won't read the whole thing.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
I'll have it linked in the show notes if you want to read it, but I'll read a little bit of it.

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
He says, much of the open source community tries to advertise the community as one happy place to the outside.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
I think maybe you could contribute a little blame to the Linux Action Show and Linux Unplugged for that.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
We do try to highlight the best things about the community.

51:23.000 --> 51:28.000
And sometimes, well, in this show, we go more in depth on some of the more unseen elements.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
But in Linux Action Show, it's more of a showcase about what rocks.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
Right.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
So I take some of that blame on here.

51:34.000 --> 51:41.000
He says, where contributions are valued only by their technical quality and everybody meets at conferences for beers.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
I think sometimes we do perpetuate that theory, too.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
But he says it's not like that.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
In fact, it's quite a sick place to be in.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
He says, I don't usually talk about this much.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
So he says, I figure people are not very aware of this.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
But the open source community is full of assholes.

51:55.000 --> 52:01.000
And I probably, you know, I should just stop right there for a second.

52:01.000 --> 52:06.000
You know, he goes on in his post to sort of say that it's kind of unbelievable.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
He's all the crap that slinged him.

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
Now, for those of you not familiar, Leonard was sort of the lead advocate behind SystemD.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
He's on the development team.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
He was the same for Pulse Audio and a lot of other things.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
And he's had a very vocal voice in the past.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
He's probably been one of the people slinging mud a little bit.

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
And he kind of comes on here and says that it's getting out of control these days.

52:27.000 --> 52:34.000
He even mentions that there has been an effort online to collect Bitcoin to hire a hit man to kill him.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
Oh, my God.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Yeah.

52:36.000 --> 52:46.000
And he goes on to say that perhaps some of the blame should be lied at the feet of Linus Torvalds because Linus sets the tone for the community in his verbose sort of way.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
And his direct way.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
He's setting a tone for how dialogue should go to get things done.

52:51.000 --> 52:55.000
And he says he's not opposed to the use of the F word, but he's opposed to the way it's being used.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
And his words are that a fish rots from the head down.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
And so this is a tone that's being put out there.

53:01.000 --> 53:09.000
In fact, even though when I read Leonard's post, I did not feel like he was putting it on the feet of Linus.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
But it is how now it is being picked up.

53:12.000 --> 53:17.000
ZDNet, Matt, your buddy, Stephen Jay over there has his headline,

53:17.000 --> 53:23.000
Lenart Pottering's Linus Torvalds Rant.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
And Lenart did address the mailing list and whatnot.

53:26.000 --> 53:33.000
So, Poppy, I want to open with you because you and I had a pretty good discussion about this sort of off there, quote unquote.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
Where should we start?

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
What holes am I missing in the filling in the story right now?

53:38.000 --> 53:47.000
Well, first of all, the the hitman argument seems to be a single comment from a guy on a random dude on IRC somewhere.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
OK, OK.

53:49.000 --> 53:55.000
And so you could take that as some weirdo on IRC.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
We get a lot of weirdos on IRC all over the place.

53:59.000 --> 54:03.000
The second thing I would say is Lenart is an incredibly clever guy.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
He has created some amazing software.

54:05.000 --> 54:10.000
Both like System D and then before that, Pulse Audio.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
I love Pulse Audio.

54:11.000 --> 54:16.000
I didn't love it when it first was shipped in Ubuntu and now I do.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
I think it's fantastic.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
I just you know what?

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
I'm using Mumble right now.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
I've watched YouTube videos.

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
I use Skype and it just works.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
It's fabulous.

54:27.000 --> 54:34.000
And before that, he helped develop Avahi on Linux, the zero conf stuff.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
The guy is an accomplished developer.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
You know, he does good stuff for the Linux community.

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
He gets way more flack than I think he deserves.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
Yes, sometimes he could be a bit of a dick.

54:47.000 --> 54:54.000
And in the past, when he was younger, he was somewhat abrasive and people find it difficult to work with him.

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
But then when I was younger, I was a bit of a dick.

54:58.000 --> 55:04.000
And I was probably someone who was somewhat abrasive and hard to work with.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
I think, you know, he's gone past that.

55:07.000 --> 55:23.000
And I think, you know, given the body of work he's made and the effort that he's done to make the free software desktop a better environment for users, I think the guy should be cut a bit of slack.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Okay.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
All right.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Now, Derek Dillon, I want to give you a chance to chime in.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
I just like to ask Leonard if he's listening.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
You are a public figure and that comes with a price tag.

55:33.000 --> 55:39.000
And it's a public figure within the niche, but it's still a public figure for all that matters.

55:39.000 --> 55:50.000
And yes, you may have legitimacy on some of your complaints, but at that point is like not everyone that is addressing you is always a community member.

55:50.000 --> 55:58.000
And we deal with things like that in kind of any career, as long as you happen to be in a spotlight.

55:58.000 --> 56:04.000
He has done great things, like Papa said, and he should take everything with a grain of salt.

56:04.000 --> 56:11.000
Learn how to get away of the things that lead them to that kind of behavior.

56:11.000 --> 56:22.000
And now just a quick comment on what you said, I wouldn't take any blame on showing the positive side because the same way there's people that show the negative side, someone needs to show what is actually good about it.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
We happen to have a great group in here a lot of times and we enjoy it.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
So should we not talk about it?

56:28.000 --> 56:45.000
Well, you know, I'll take devil's advocate here and I'll defend Lenard in that specifically the discussions around System D in this show have gotten more hate mail in my inbox than pretty much any other topic we have ever discussed.

56:45.000 --> 57:00.000
And I'm surprised because it seems so over the level of anger, not always, oftentimes there's very rational emails too that are just really good emails.

57:00.000 --> 57:07.000
But there are some that just seem so angry about it that I don't quite, it almost seems disconnected from the reality of the situation.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
And that's just in my coverage of it.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
I'm not one of the guys that created it.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
So I can only imagine the volume and amount he's getting.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
And so I do have some sympathy for that.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
And I think I can understand a little bit how it could be wearing.

57:22.000 --> 57:32.000
And to be honest with you, it has crossed my mind if it was taking a toll on him based on the amount that I was getting long before he made this post.

57:32.000 --> 57:40.000
And it has also crossed my mind how kind of impressed I am that he's continued on under what I assume has been heavy criticism.

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
Now this sort of confirms that.

57:43.000 --> 57:50.000
But I think out of all the things he's done, maybe that might be something I respect him the most for, just having a slight understanding of probably what he's under.

57:50.000 --> 57:56.000
Now that said, it's something that he's also participated in.

57:56.000 --> 58:03.000
And I liked the way that Aaron Saigo said there's four paths for this kind of the way communities can go.

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
And he said there are many people who just simply don't interact with the community at all.

58:06.000 --> 58:10.000
They just write code, they put out useful technology, and that's kind of it.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
They interact as little as possible.

58:12.000 --> 58:19.000
Some communities have adopted the stance that the most important thing is the creation of technology for everyone to be nice to each other at all times or else.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
That's another path.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
It's usually motivated by the right intentions.

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
But it can sort of steal the focus away.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Everybody has to be nice. Everybody be nice. Everybody be nice.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
And then there's the technology co-creation path.

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
And this is the one that resonated with me.

58:31.000 --> 58:36.000
He says there is a healthy path where people focus on technology creation first and foremost.

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
And the one would do well as to get as many free software communities on.

58:41.000 --> 58:47.000
In these kinds of environments, social interactions are something that happens as a happy byproduct of making great technology together.

58:47.000 --> 58:53.000
Now, I want to take that sentence and I want to read it to you again, but I want to use different words.

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
Instead of technology, let's use the word podcasts.

58:57.000 --> 59:05.000
Okay, so he says here, this is a healthy path where people can focus on the podcasts first and foremost, where the content matters.

59:05.000 --> 59:11.000
In these kinds of environments, social interactions are something that happens as a happy byproduct of making a great show together.

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
And that is sort of where the Jupiter Broadcasting Community comes from.

59:15.000 --> 59:20.000
A lot of us have become friends as a result of working on the content.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
The content comes first. The show comes first.

59:23.000 --> 59:33.000
And within that paradigm, if I yell at Eric, or I yell at Q5, or they yell at me, it's because we want to make a better show together.

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
It's not because it's an ego thing. It's not our personalities combating.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
It's because we both, first and foremost, care more about the show.

59:40.000 --> 59:46.000
And so there's a mutual respect that is shared between us that we're really just trying to make the product better.

59:46.000 --> 59:54.000
And sometimes that requires talking a little tough because when it's a creative thing, just like software, it can very much be a creative process.

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
There's a lot of passion involved. That's the nature of it.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And unfortunately, you can't have it both ways.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:09.000
If you want to make something great, you want to make something better than everybody else is making, then it takes that kind of personal commitment where you're really all in.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
And when you're all in on something like that, you go to the mat for it and you fight for it.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And sometimes that causes controversy.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:27.000
But if the end product is the goal at the end of the day, then there's sort of, I wish I had a better term, but an adult detached perspective you can take

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:37.000
where you can have a robust, sometimes hard conversation, and then 10-15 minutes, everything's okay, and now you're back to working on the product again.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
And that, I think, is bared out in our community right here.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I kind of 50% agree with you because I spent the weekend when I was at a conference, I spent probably about 45 minutes arguing with Stuart Langridge about something.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Admittedly, I was like 10 pints under, and so was he.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
That's the best time, apparently.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:15.000
But at the end of it, we have a conversation and it's robust, but I think there's a difference between that and then someone barking orders at someone.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I'm going to point this at you directly, Chris.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:38.000
There's been a couple of occasions on Mumble where you've been quite abrasive to people here as a result of you feeling like, the perception is that you're feeling that the input is not warranted, not wanted.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:49.000
And what you've just explained is that the creative process is king, that the content is king, that actually what matters is what you get out at the end.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Hang the fact that you're kicking people along the way, and I don't think that's the right way to do it.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I do see what you're saying there, and I wouldn't be one of those things where the conversation ends completely.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
They could continue to advocate their case and my mind could be changed, that happens all the time.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:18.000
But I think sometimes, specifically for content creation, maybe not software creation, I don't know, I don't have as much experience there,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:27.000
but there eventually has to be somebody who says, this is how we're doing it, and we're doing it this way because I know the best about this, because this is my area.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And this is kind of why sometimes I see how Linus operates and I think, yes, he is setting a tone that is not healthy.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
At the same time, what the hell is he going to do?

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:43.000
This is the reality of the environment he's in and these are the people that he needs to motivate.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And I see that as well with Mark Shuttleworth, who has his opinions on the direction of Ubuntu.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.000
And there are people who are contributing their spare time in the same way there are people contributing their spare time to help you out with Jupiter.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And there are people who are helping Lenna out with System D or whatever.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:08.000
There's always this pool of people who are sometimes on a bit of a knife edge.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
You push them too far, you're going to push them over and they're going to stop contributing and they're going to walk away.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:21.000
And hold that thought, because that's our next, that's sort of where we're going to get to in the gaming on Linux stuff.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
So I think you're going in the right direction, but hold on, you're going there too soon.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Eric, I want to give you a chance, just sort of somebody who's been in the process where we've been working things out to kind of chime in.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
And you can also throw me under the bus if you want.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Well, what I wanted to talk about was how much you and I and you and Q5 and Q5 and me and Rikai and whatnot, everybody who's a part of the crew has had a lot of disagreements with each other about a lot of different things.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
It shows up all the time.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000
At the end of the day, we are going towards a common goal and it has to produce good content.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And I think we are constantly getting there.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Do you think though that, see this is where I'm trying to get to, I guess at the end of the day, the fundamental question is, is there a place for where you just sometimes have to come in and say, no, we're doing it this way.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Everybody F off.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Well, yeah, and that's where you come in because you're the guy in charge of the show.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000
So when you do that, we have, it's basically, it's your baby.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
We're just here to help you take care of it.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Well, okay.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
So, okay, we'll go back to that.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
First, I want to give Heaven's a chance to go and then we'll go to Daredevil.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
So go ahead, Heaven's Revenge.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Well, in our community, there is, there tends to be a lot of extremist opinions.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
One that we don't usually knock on too much because we love him so much is RMS.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
He is very extremist, but we love his opinion.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
You know, I was going to point that out.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Is he also, I mean, we're kind of dogging on Linus here, but let's be honest, RMS is system things, right?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.000
And you know, they're needed in a way, but I like to compare it like this.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
We have captains in our community.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
They are the figureheads or the people that kind of give us direction.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
There's one important word that will, that explains this.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
It's called the mutiny.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:16.000
When people don't like the direction of the captain, like you, Chris, if you are the captain of the Jupiter Broadcasting Network, there's the captain of certain projects.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:28.000
When people don't like the way the direction is going, they will mutiny and they will be very violent and try to do everything they can to try and make that problem not a problem within their minds.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
And this, it gets visceral.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Whoa.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Oh man.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Are you thinking about the twit stuff that's going on right now?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Is that kind of what you're referring to?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
No.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Okay.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
So I'll get to that in a second.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Daredevil.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
That's a big, good point.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Okay, so I'm going to mention this right now is this is an interesting thing about community.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
And this is something that businesses are not really equipped well to understand and handle.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And I won't go, I don't want to make this a J.B. twit thing, but twits having major problems with their community right now.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And so much so that their community has organized a blog with several contributors and a separate chat room.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.000
And they are really organizing to go after twit in a very organized troll fashion.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And it's really spinning out of control.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:19.000
And I'm kind of amazed at the amount of energy that is being spent to go after something that these people once cherished.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And it's exactly to a T what you just said, Heaven.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
So we're watching this right now happen to the twit network.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
And I like at one time, you know, I feel bad for them.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:36.000
But I also see how they are not managing the situation and not respecting the community and sort of adding fuel to this fire.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
And so it's a really interesting thing to have sort of spin out of control.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Daredevilin, I want to give you a chance to chime in.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Recently there was an article that actually was posted on Reddit about MySQL trademark issues.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:57.000
And one of the actually points that was very well made is that there are open source products and there are open source projects.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
And there are differences on how they are handled.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:17.000
So I think Lenard in this situation is kind of a hybrid of it because he's working for Red Hat, which definitely creates things like System D, which are more of an open source product coming out of Red Hat.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Sure.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And that itself just makes the community more impulsive, like Heaven was pointing out, towards trying to make it a project so they are sure if it's going to affect their distribution, they will have a say on it.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And there is going to be some consensus.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
So it becomes a project rather than a product.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And I think that is really just something that you cannot avoid if you're in a position like Lenard is.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
He has made great things and that's called attention.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
I don't think particularly that's a bad thing.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:59.000
So is your basic argument that if you want to be successful on the internet, you have to have a super thick skin and prepare to have just the worst stuff ever said about you and to you?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
To a degree, yes.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I mean, society has always been like this.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I can accept that as an answer.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I mean, I don't think you're necessarily wrong, but I want to transition to something that's a little more recent to kind of show you, we're kind of talking about this in the abstract.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I want to kind of narrow our focus a little bit and talk about what's going on with a couple of friends of this show, the Linux game cast and gamingonlinux.com, both of whom I just gave plugs to in this Sunday's Linux action show, thinking kumbaya, everybody loves each other.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:48.000
And the reason why I don't, you know, we don't need to get into the specifics of the drama, but what I want to get to is I'm building a case to why this stuff actually matters and how it actually impacts not just Linux, but adoption of Linux and the way the outside community perceives us.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:59.000
And I think this current example that we have today clearly lays it all out there and it shows us the real world cost of this because right now we're talking about in sort of the abstract and for Lenard and et cetera, et cetera.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
So that's kind of where I want to take this.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
But before we get to that, as you might expect, we have one more sponsor to get to.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
And it's one that I think you definitely want going to want to check out.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:18.000
And they have a brand new website to Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash to unplug to get a 33 percent discount on tuition.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Linux Academy has a brand new website and Matt, this website is looking slick.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:30.000
They've really done a great job and they're adding more courses to it's not just that it's like it's amazing how much how hard these guys are working these days.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
And that's it's really awesome because it's Linux enthusiasts that came together with designers and educators.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
And it's really that symbiotic relationship that's paying off now and you can go check it out.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
So what is Linux Academy?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Check this out.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Think about a repository of knowledge for managing anything you might want to know from Linux to AWS, OpenStack or if you want to get into DevOps, they've got courses on all of it.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Step by step video courses, downloadable comprehensive study guides for you to read offline.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
And as your courseware requires it, it comes with its own server.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
They spin up a server on demand.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
You can choose from seven plus Linux distributions.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Then they automatically adjust the courseware so it matches that Linux distribution.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:19.000
And I cannot underscore this new feature enough because this is oh man, if I if I was kind of maybe wanting to sort of step out or if I was curious about what other technologies I could get into

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:29.000
or if I just had gotten thrown into a major project and I needed to know how to deploy GitLab or manage OpenStack or integrate AWS, this would be my salvation.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000
They have a new system called Learning Plans.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Learning Plans allow the user to select your daily availability.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Based on your availability, the study plan is automatically generating and it gives you lessons and quizzes and labs.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
It'll send you reminders when those are due.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
You can retest yourself and you can continually sort of adjust based on your availability.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.000
You know, go take some Chef Fundamentals, Puppet, CentOS 7, Ubuntu, OpenStack.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:02.000
You can do a scenario based lab too where you actually implement something on AWS or deploy a server and get it up and running.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
They have so many cool things up and coming too.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And once you become a Linux Academy subscriber, you just get all the stuff.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000
You can just keep going, use all just keep learning, keep trying out new things and try out the new courseware.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
They're also constantly integrating live streams and Q&As with the educators.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Head over to linuxacademy.com slash dumpbug, get the 33% discount.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Go learn about the Heartbleed bug.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
They've got a whole course up about that right now.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Backing up with R-Sync, seriously something you might want to consider.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Setting up a remote GUI desktop, they've got courses on that.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Working with NGINX, Nagios, oh my gosh.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Nagios is such an awesome tool if you're in an enterprise or even a small business and you're not doing monitoring, go take the Nagios course.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
It's worth it right there.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Linuxacademy.com slash unplug and a huge thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Okay, so to bring the drama home and talk about what's going on now.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
We've had Liam on the show.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000
The gaming on Linux, he's Liam, right? That's his name?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
That's right, that's right.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Yeah, he's been on the show before and gave him a plug on Sunday.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Today, this morning, he says, I'm moving on from gaming on Linux.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I'm quitting.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I'm no longer going to write here again.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And he lays the blame square on another podcaster.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
And I did some digging into this and it appears there's been some barbs back and forth.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Essentially, what it boiled down to is just for those of you who care.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:31.000
A game developer contacted LGC, Linux Gamecast Weekly, said, hey, would you like to review our stuff?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Who knows what happened?

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Maybe they gave him a bad review, whatever.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:45.000
You know, a lot of times these developers are essentially expecting the blogger or the podcaster to be so excited that they're being contacted by the developer and that they got free keys.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
They almost expect a good review.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:54.000
And very likely, knowing the LGC guys, if they didn't like the game, they were pretty honest about it.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Yeah, usually they are.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000
And what I gather is the developer wasn't super happy about that.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:08.000
And so Liam tweeted at him or something like that and said, well, you know, if you're not happy with your review, maybe you should consider reaching out to other media outlets.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
The LGC crew are kind of known for being rough or something like to that extent, right?

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Which then started a series of back and forths and name calling and things like that, which eventually led to Liam posting a resignation.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
I think this is something that's happened before.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Drama, drama, drama.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Here is the practical outcome that is likely going to affect Linux.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
We have two problems now.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Number one, gaming on Linux will continue on.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
It's community funded.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
They're funded until December, according to comments from him.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
But likely less content, right?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Because he was the chief editor, the number one contributor.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Here's why that matters.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:58.000
If you're a game shop and you're releasing your game for Linux, it is really hard to figure out who the hell you're supposed to talk to, to generate some buzz, to get some reviews, to inform the community that your game's there.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Because there's a lot of games that come out that nobody even knows about.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.000
And so what gamingonlinux.com became was sort of that first stop.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Because it's something that these development shops who have been living in the Windows or console ecosystem their entire existence can wrap their brain around.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
They understand what the site's about.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
It's in the name.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000
They see they have lots of reviews.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
They have decent traffic, decent enough, whatever it is, I have no idea.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And they can grok it.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
And that is sort of to them, it's their on-ramp.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:36.000
There's other outlets, but I got to tell you, from my own personal experience dealing with these people, they have no clue what the hell they're doing.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
They have no clue how to do this.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
They are completely at a loss.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
They are desperate to have a way to do this.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Because this is really established in all the commercial gaming platforms.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:55.000
They, I get emails constantly with keys where they're just asking us to review the game because they're desperate to get attention.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
They don't have any idea how to do it.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:04.000
And the problem is, is now one of the obvious and clear paths for them to do that is going to decline.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
And all of us will suffer to some small degree because of it.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:15.000
The result is because of bickering between two people who are essentially fighting over the same tiny market share,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
even though really they are sort of co-complementary because one's a blog and one's a podcast.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.000
But because, you know, they had to measure each other's dicks constantly, now everyone suffers.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Instead of treating each other like human beings, instead of just staying on their own respective lawns and focusing on their content,

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:39.000
they had to focus on the ego and the argument and the pride of it all.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And now, one of the key resources for developers looking to announce their game for Linux users could decline because of it.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
It's kind of disappointing.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:57.000
So this stupid drama that none of us can stand, that none of us want to really pay attention to, does actually have some kind of impact.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Who knows how bad, but it has some.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
It's kind of disappointing.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:11.000
And, you know, if you guys want to read into it, you can read the links in the show notes.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
I don't really feel like getting into the nitty details.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
But all right, let's start taking mumble room comments.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Go ahead, Daredevil, and I'll open it to you first.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
So the first tip is go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Ask Chris to review the game.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
The second tip is join the IRC.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
It's also available on the site.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
You can watch it there.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.000
And there's a lot of people that will do the work either freely or even if you pay them the beer,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
they will gladly help you get in the process then.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
There you go.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Okay, there you go.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Good tip.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Great tip.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Matt, I think you said it best in the subreddit.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Come on now.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
What is the matter with us, Matt?

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
I mean, this seems like we need a little common sense.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Well, so I mean, regardless of who peed and who's Cheerios,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
because at the end of the day, it really doesn't make any difference.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000
You know, as far as like how the reactionary stuff's gone back and forth and whatnot, you know,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
both parties involved need to just kind of take a step back and be like, honestly, this isn't really worth it.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Now, as far as him wanting to leave the work he's been doing, you know,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I think that's concerning because I think he's done some good work and I think that's unfortunate.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And I also would point out then to anyone that produces content, you better have a thick skin.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
You know, if disagreements come up, you really ought to.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000
And I posted some examples of some public rippings that I've gotten in that subreddit.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
One of them was very public.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And, you know, and you learn from those experiences.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000
And so in this particular case, regardless of who was right or wrong, you know,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
let this be a lesson to everyone that, you know, words certainly matter,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
but at the same time, you can't control other people's behavior.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
You just can't. You have to really decide on how you're going to react to it.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000
It is, at the end of the day, it is your choice on how you process it and how it affects you.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Because it really is just some other hairless monkey at the other end of that wire that's saying what they think.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000
And it really doesn't matter. And you can make it matter. You can choose to make it matter.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:15.000
But I think, I don't know, I guess what I worry about is that I don't want to get lumped in with this drama.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I don't want it to come across the whole community looks like that.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Poppy, what are your thoughts on that?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I agree. I play games and I use Linux.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
So I'm a Linux gamer, you would think.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:37.000
But I think, you know, the short answer is I think Liam overreacts.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
And I think the other guys are dicks, in short.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000
And I think probably they best avoid each other.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:52.000
It feels very similar to playground shenanigans where, oh, he said this and she said that.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
And it's just, you know, separate them out.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
So how do we actually practically do that, though?

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Why would we? It's nothing to do with us. It's one dick online calling someone else.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
But if it has ramifications for the entire community.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
If you let it, yeah.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:18.000
OK, one other thing, Lenore, if you remember when you were a dick and we put up with you, then just put up with someone new.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Yeah, I guess that's the thing.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I'm not a fan of the grow a thick skin argument.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:31.000
I think, yes, you need to be able to avoid whatever mechanism you need to use.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
You need to avoid abuse.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Now, whether that means blocking people on Twitter, putting people in a kill file or whatever that means.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Yes, do that.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:50.000
But equally, you should be able to do your job, whatever that job is, whether it's making a video podcast or writing articles about gaming online.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:56.000
You should be able to do that without fear that some lunatic on the Internet is going to start giving you abuse.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000
And you shouldn't let them give you abuse. You should do whatever you need to do to block that.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
And I will go ahead.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000
I was going to say in the past, I've had bodily harm threats before.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
You know, like I said, there's a certain tier of things that you have to take it.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
The first attempt, obviously, to try and work it out.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000
If it can be worked out, which I'm in the process of actually working it out with the individual, you know, is involved in this.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
That's great. You know, that's awesome.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Now, going forward, if someone is just making it their mission in life to just troll you, essentially, I mean, even to the point of it being abusive.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000
At that point, you do need to take a step to do everything you can to block them out.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
But it's about it's not about right and wrong. It's about effective behavior.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000
If you're cornered in a schoolyard and this kid's going to kick your butt, you got a couple choices.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000
One, you can try and beeline and hope he doesn't tackle you.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Or you can pop him in the nose and then go on with your life.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I choose the latter. And so that doesn't mean it's right for everybody.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
And it certainly doesn't mean that, you know, responding in kind is the right approach.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
I think that's not the message to be taken there.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:00.000
But it's a matter of what is the most effective behavior that's going to get you a result to where you can resolve this, whatever that may be.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Right. It's unique. Yeah. Yeah.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Yeah, I think it's unique.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.000
In this particular instance, someone, whoever it may be, needs to just stop and walk away.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
You can't have an argument without two people.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I have a couple of closing thoughts.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.000
But one thing that I wanted to ask Wimpy about is, I'm worried about Wimpy things about this.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Because I was in the, like I mentioned earlier, the Linux underscore gaming subreddit.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And I saw a post in there from a Windows user.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
And he said, you know, I was just thinking about switching over to Linux.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
But I was just browsing the various subreddits.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I'm seeing a lot of drama. Am I in for a bad ride when I switch over?

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:40.000
And Wimpy, do you think that this is something that we need to worry about as a public perception of all this infighting?

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Yeah, I think we, in quotes, look silly to the tech world at large.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:58.000
And unfortunately, it isn't the luminaries in the open source community that are making us look silly.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:05.000
It's the vocal majority who are slinging the mud and making the noise.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Who are discrediting Linux as a platform.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.000
And they're saving Apple and Microsoft a job because they don't need to discredit us.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Because we're doing it to ourselves.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
It's a good thing they need the technology we make so damn badly.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000
And anyone that tells me a Mac person doesn't, I got a Maclope article I'll have you read sometime.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Because I will tell you Mac people are quite verbal.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Not all of us are like this.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
No, not all of us.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000
And I had it coming in that instance. But just pointing out, they're very vocal.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Well, I kind of want to wrap on this closing thought here.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
And then we'll put this topic to bed, hopefully.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
I think one of the things that keeps coming up in all of these threads.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000
I've seen it now in essentially every comment thread about this and in some of these blog posts.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
It's the Linus angle.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
You know, let's blame Linus.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Boy that is, yeah, I can see the pretty valid argument there.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And I don't want to discredit some pretty smart people on our subreddit that are arguing that case.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I think there is some merit to that.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:20.000
But, you know, I was recently reminded that you can have the worst influence growing up or whatever it is.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
You know, in your work environment, in your community.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:29.000
At the end of that though, you are the one making the decision.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Not Linus.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
It's not Linus that's making you use the F word and yell at somebody.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Just because you're choosing to excuse your behavior because you saw him do it, doesn't mean it's his fault.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
It's your fault.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And when you are going on the internet and you're yelling at people for the bits they are flipping on some spinning magnetic platter,

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
remember it's your choice to do it.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Not Linus's choice.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Not Lenart's choice.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
It's you.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
And it really is something you need to consider.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:03.000
And blaming Linus while cathartic and also a great scapegoat at the end of the day is crap.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
It's you.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
So you have to stop it.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
It's each one of us.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
It's every one of us.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
We all have to be cognizant of it.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
And at the same time, we need to grow up a little bit.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Maybe stop arguing on the internet.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And maybe have a little bit of a thicker skin.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000
And it's really kind of a balanced approach to all of those things.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
It's not one or the other.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:29.000
It's all of those things balanced together that make interacting with other hairless monkeys through a wire manageable.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000
And, you know, I go back to this is why we need to get together in meat space more often.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
It changes the dynamic.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
It changes everything.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
It changes the way we treat each other.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
It deepens the connection.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Well, especially if the guy you're messing with turns out to be 6'4 and 200-some pounds, you know,

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
and you're just a little dude sitting in front of a keyboard.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
All of a sudden you're not so tough.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
You know, and that changes the equation pretty quickly.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000
And I want to also just a quick plug before we get out of here.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.000
This is the last week to take a simple System D survey that Producer Q5 has put together.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
And he says he'll be sharing the results in about a week.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
So you can go to systemdsurvey.com.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000
And we're just trying to, or he, he's just trying to get a little background info about either one.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Either side of the fence.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
It doesn't matter.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
It's just kind of a general survey.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Systemdsurvey.com.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
If you're a user or a hater, you can go take the survey.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Just kind of curious to see where the results land, and I'm sure we'll talk about them in next week's Unplugged.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
So, Matt, I think that's everything we have.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
So we just kind of have like a couple essentials to let people know about.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Number one, you might have noticed this is kind of a community-driven show.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000
We're pretty proud of that.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
And we'd like you to be involved with it.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
You can go over to jblive.tv.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
We do it on a Tuesday at 2 p.m. Pacific.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
If you don't know what that is in your time, because I know, I know it's crazy.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Just go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
The robots will convert it for you.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
But more importantly, I'd like to ask you to engage.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Specifically, in the subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
We'll have a link in there for this episode where you can give us feedback.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
I'd like to hear your thoughts on all of this.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.000
This is definitely one of those episodes where everybody should try to treat each other a little bit better in that thread.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000
And let's just have a really good conversation.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:08.000
And, you know, the Linux Action Show subreddit, while it can get heated, is, as far as, you know, online communities goes, is really one of the greatest.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
It is filled with some of the smartest people that really have great conversations.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
And, yeah, sometimes it gets rough.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
And, hey, I've been at the end of that gun before.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
But it really is a great community.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000
linuxactionshow.reddit.com and jblive.tv for the live show.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:29.000
And, really, last but not least, go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact and choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Send us your feedback.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000
It's a big part of this show.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
If you can't be in the Mamba Room or you don't use Reddit, that's still a great way to contribute.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Just go over there, jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000
All right, Matt.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Well, have a great week.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000
All right, you too.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I'll see you then.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
All right, everyone.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000
You don't even have to think about it.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Put in your favorite podcast catcher.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Why not?

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000
All right, everyone.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
See you right back here next week.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000
I'll see you next week.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.000
All right.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
All right.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Little post-show time.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Okay.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
So I had, I don't know.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I can't remember.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Mumbler, do you remember what the hell I wanted to talk about in the post-show?

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
I don't even recall now.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I think it was something to do with you getting the snip, wasn't it?

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
No, we talked about that.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Should we put that in here?

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000
I don't know if we want to put that in the release version.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I don't think we do.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000
No, it was something else, but now I've totally forgotten what it was.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Dang it.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
I had something.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Yeah, go ahead.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
The community.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Italy court actually ruled in favor of consumers in the case of Microsoft Windows X.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:28.000
So coming pre-installed, and it's now mandatory that computer sellers in Italy to sell without

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.000
the user does not want to refund them the Windows license price.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000
So do you suppose, okay, let's go to JBtitles.com.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
By the way, great news.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
That's great.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I just got to get titles.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
JBtitles.com.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Right now, Linux soap opera is way, way, way, way up there, but I'm kind of leaning towards

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Don't Feed the Trolls, even though it's number third in the list, but Don't Feed the Trolls

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
seems like the actual message.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Yeah, it really does.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Hey, Chris.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Yeah.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:01.000
At some point in time, do you think we could have like the most pop tart or rainbow shitting

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:08.000
tart cat eating positive show over instead of all this negative kill each other stabbing

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
each other.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
That's what it was.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000
That's what it was.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
That's what it was.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I know.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Maybe Chris is not honest.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Yeah.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
I know.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
No, come on.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000
I'm not the one making the drama.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Come on.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
It's not mine.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
I know, but there's these little specific things that rape people up the ass so hard

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000
and it fucks up the rest of our view.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
We need that beauty that we see.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
It's like a jewel.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Oh, you're being rude to yourself.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
No.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Okay.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
You reminded me of my post-show topic though.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
All right.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Everybody go to JBtitles.com and vote.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.200
You still have a chance to bang suggest to, but okay, here's what it was.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:44.480
This is totally hippy dippy, but give it some serious consideration.

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:45.480
Okay.

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:50.200
What if, and the only reason I mentioned this is because I hate using this card because

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:53.680
it sounds like such a douche bag thing to say, but I've honestly been doing this for

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:59.440
a while and I've kind of noticed a trend and the trend is when the media is really hyping

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:03.320
something scary, like, oh, I don't know, ISIS and Ebola.

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:08.960
It feels like everybody is really stressed the hell out and it comes out and like people

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:11.720
are taking things way more seriously than they should.

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:15.320
Maybe they hyper-focus on something to distract them from the boogeyman that's being constantly

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:19.480
fear porn pushed down their mouth hole and their ear holes and in their face and that

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:24.160
maybe this constant Ebola outbreak, ISIS taking over the East, going to war, going

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:28.820
back into Iraq, constant boom, boom, boom slamming us over the head with fear is causing

01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:32.920
us to kind of treat each other kind of like shit because we're all stressed out in the

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:33.920
background.

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:34.920
It's like a background anxiety.

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.000
Maybe we're not even fully realizing it.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.640
It's like this background thing that's stressing us out because it's this bad thing and you

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:40.860
could be on either side, right?

01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:44.960
You could actually be buying all of this ISIS propaganda and think that they're the boogeyman

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:49.260
or you could be really mad at your government for going back into Iraq for the fourth time

01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:50.600
and be really stressed out about that.

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:53.920
Like you could be on either end of the political spectrum and it could still be bothering the

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:57.960
hell out of you, but maybe you're internalizing it and focusing down on the technology to

01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.400
distract yourself from it.

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:02.800
And so you're taking all of these technology matters really super seriously, even though

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:05.820
really at the end of the day, you're trying to avoid the actual really scary thing that's

01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:08.320
going on in the real world.

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:09.320
That's a nice idea.

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:16.040
I'd counter that with, I've just spent the weekend with 300 random people who I've mostly

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:23.100
never met before and they were all super positive and really friendly and the world's troubles

01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:25.480
didn't crop up in conversation.

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:28.920
But that's like that happens when you get together as a group.

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:30.240
It becomes different.

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.680
But then maybe when you're back at your house, and again, and the thing about the internet

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:35.160
is it doesn't take all of us.

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:40.080
It just takes a few of us in the right spot to be bothered by it to cause a big dustup.

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:42.520
And I'm not even saying it's like it's pushing us.

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:46.760
It's just sort of like this background agitation that just sort of makes us a little more on

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:47.760
edge normally.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:52.360
A lot of people don't even remember that people behind the keyboard are people too.

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:54.240
I remember someone here said this before.

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:57.440
It might've been poppy or wimpy, but they're humans too.

01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:01.800
And they've got, you know, they care sometimes about what you have to say.

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:06.400
That's my biggest pet peeve is that people don't understand at the end of the day, we're

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:12.320
all people behind that monitor, behind the keyboard, and you have to, even some people

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:15.200
have a problem where they can't associate that.

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:16.200
And it's a thing.

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:19.040
And we all put our pants on one leg at a time.

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.040
Right?

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:21.040
Exactly.

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.040
Everybody poops.

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:26.800
Everybody's happy at like all these conferences and, you know, beers, handshaking, pats on

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:27.800
the back.

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:30.280
But when we get behind the keyboard, it's shank or be shanked.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.280
We're assholes.

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.280
Always.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.280
Yeah.

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:36.560
First time I met Leonard Pottering was at an Ubuntu developer summit when we invited

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:37.560
him along.

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:38.560
I think it was in Prague.

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:43.520
And I remember sitting around having beer with him and everything was cool.

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:46.480
It was all fine.

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:52.640
But you know, behind a keyboard, on both sides of the fence, everyone gets a little bit more

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.640
grumpy.

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:54.640
Yeah.

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:55.640
Yep.

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:59.160
And I think, you know, when Leonard said we all like to talk like it's roses and sunshine,

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:02.300
what we like to talk about is not something that's manufactured.

01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:03.300
It's real.

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:05.900
But there's just, like everything, a gray area.

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:10.080
And we like to talk about the happy spectrum more than we talk about the bad spectrum.

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:13.520
And so I don't know, maybe this show has gotten negative recently.

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:17.520
But at the same time, it feels like there is a little self-analysis that needs to be

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:19.720
done here to shore up a few things.

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:23.440
And I don't know if we're helping the dialogue at all, but it's making me feel better.

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:26.280
Well, a lot of people hate change too.

01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:30.480
And especially since Leonard is causing a whole lot of change in our ecosystem, a lot

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:32.600
of hate is going to be poured onto the guy.

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:38.040
So first of all, I completely agree with heavens that we need a bit more positivity in the

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.040
show.

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:40.720
I think that that's a good idea.

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:46.200
On that point about Leonard is causing change, no, Leonard isn't causing change.

01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:48.720
We need to separate the man from the software here.

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:50.480
Leonard is a software developer.

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:55.080
It's system D that is holding change in the Linux community.

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:59.280
And that's what people should actually be angry about if that's how they feel about

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.280
it.

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:02.640
It's system D that they should be debating and challenging.

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:07.440
It is not hurling mud and insults and abuse at one of the developers.

01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:08.440
Okay.

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:13.920
Well, all I would say is that when one of the developers goes and happens to treat other

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:18.800
people's poorly, even if it isn't really his fault because he's responding poorly after

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:23.920
he's been treated badly by someone else, that doesn't do anything but continue the awful

01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:24.920
cycle.

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:28.880
Yeah, your point's well taken.

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:34.040
I kind of wanted to go back to the positivity thing because I think it's good to get your

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.040
guys' input on this.

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:36.720
So I agree.

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:44.920
And you know, really what it is, is the thing is, is what really works best for a discussion

01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:48.960
show like this is topics that people can have an opinion on.

01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.160
And sometimes that's some of the negative stuff, right?

01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:55.560
Because if it's just specs and features, there's not really a lot of space in there for you

01:34:55.560 --> 01:35:00.040
guys to chime in with your opinions and for us to sort stuff out.

01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:05.100
So some of your shows benefit from, you know, I'm not trying to pull the curtain away and

01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:10.160
show the Wizard of Oz, but some of your bookshows benefit from you being a grumpy old bastard

01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:13.080
and the rest of us coming in here and, you know.

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.080
I'm not that grumpy.

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.080
I really am not a grumpy person.

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:16.080
Yeah, yeah, you are.

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.080
As long as there's bacon, he's fine.

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.040
Otherwise, I'm a crook.

01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:26.320
At the weekend, I had three or four people come up to me in person and say, do you know

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.320
what?

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:28.320
It was good that you were on...

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:29.320
Unplugged.

01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:30.320
Keep it crystalline.

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.320
Yeah, I know, right?

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:32.320
Yeah, exactly.

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.320
I've had a few people say that.

01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:34.320
I guess.

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:37.160
But I'm not trying to get, you know, the...

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:40.320
I think sometimes people forget I'm in the business of having an opinion.

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.320
Sure.

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.320
Gotta pass the piece tight around a little.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.320
And I'm not complaining.

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.320
No, no, no.

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:45.320
I think it's great fun that we can...

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:46.320
And I know...

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:47.320
I have a good...

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:48.320
We have a good audience.

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:49.320
Yeah, exactly.

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:50.320
It's good fun.

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.320
It's a lot of fun.

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:55.560
And so I'm all about being more positive, but we have to, if we're going to do that,

01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:56.560
we have to find...

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:59.440
It has to be something where everybody can have a good chance to get in and dig in on

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:00.440
it.

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.440
And the other thing is...

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:03.840
It can't be Lego movie.

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:04.840
Everything is awesome.

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:05.840
Right.

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:06.840
Right.

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:07.840
Exactly.

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:11.320
And on top of that, a lot of it is just driven by, you know, what the hell's going on.

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:13.840
And unfortunately, it seems like it's been kind of shitty recently.

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:14.840
Yeah.

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:17.840
A lot of the newsworthy stuff tends to be negative anyway.

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:18.840
Right.

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:19.840
Because like...

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.920
So a couple of weeks ago, it was Debian moving away from XFCE.

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:25.200
So we talked about the XFCE project, which I think a lot of people are getting some of

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.600
that negativity from.

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:30.800
Also, you know, it's been pointed out to me that sometimes people just sort of prescribe

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:32.720
any opinion mentioned in the show.

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:35.200
They sort of assign it to me.

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:38.200
They say, you know, it's Chris's opinion, or Chris thinks this, or Chris is being very

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.200
negative.

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:43.720
Well, when you start getting a little bit shouty, then I can see why.

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:44.720
Yeah.

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:45.720
And I understand.

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:50.080
I can agree with that because I've put opinions out there and it got attributed to Chris.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:51.080
I'm like, what the...

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.080
I mean, seriously, guys.

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:54.080
My opinions are my own.

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:56.080
They are not the opinions of Chris.

01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:02.320
There's actually one subreddit comment where someone said what I said was Chris's comment.

01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:05.320
And I was like, no, let me explain what I actually said.

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.320
Right.

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.880
And that is more common than you'd think.

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:11.200
And I think what it is is people are sort of in passing, you know, maybe they're doing

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.200
something else.

01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:13.480
Some people are doing something else while they're listening.

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:17.720
And so they don't remember exactly who said it, but they remember it was in that show.

01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:19.800
And then when they, maybe when they think of the show, they think of me or something

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:20.800
like that.

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:23.280
So, but again, I am actually not disagreeing.

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:29.080
I am negative because I am, I think what it is, is I'm disappointed.

01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:32.540
I'm disappointed in the behavior of our community, right?

01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:33.540
That's what it is.

01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:36.000
And I know, but really, shouldn't I be?

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.080
Like, isn't there a lot to be disappointed in with, like, look at all the stuff we just

01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:40.080
talked about this week.

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.080
Look at all this silly.

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:44.200
I mean, I mean, I feel bad for the people that are involved because to them it's not

01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:45.200
silly.

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:48.800
But to those of us on the outside, actually the positive stuff, look at how much free

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:54.240
software is made all day, every day, but where's the discussion there?

01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.400
Well, yeah, exactly.

01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:58.080
It doesn't, it doesn't generate clicks.

01:37:58.080 --> 01:37:59.080
It doesn't generate.

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:00.080
No, it's not about that.

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.080
It's not.

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:02.080
No, no, it's not about that.

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:08.520
It's really about, I think it's really about finding something we can chew on and you know,

01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:13.680
something that is, okay, so I'll tell you how, I'll tell you a little bit how I picked

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.920
topics for this show because this show is sort of unscripted.

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:21.680
But what I do is I look at what I think a lot of people seem to be thinking about in

01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:23.520
the Linux community this week.

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:28.080
What's essentially right there in a bullet point, how Linux Unplugged is put together.

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.080
What are people thinking about?

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:30.080
Right, I'm not complaining.

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:31.080
No, no, I know, I know, I know.

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:34.000
No, I'm just kind of, cause I'm just for everybody's information.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.720
And so a lot of times, you know, it is, it is stuff that isn't super positive because

01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:39.360
it's something we're struggling with.

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:44.720
And so this is sort of a forum to sort of, a lot of times we walk away trying to, you

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:49.000
know, kind of put it all into perspective.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.040
And unfortunately that does mean sometimes we deal with stuff that is not of the, of

01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.520
the everything is awesome nature.

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:59.880
Now that said, I do try to counterbalance some of that in last, right?

01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.600
Last is more of a showcase.

01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:02.600
Last is the news.

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:03.600
This is what happened this week.

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.040
These are awesome app picks.

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.760
This is something we're spotlighting.

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:08.280
This is how you do something.

01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.240
This is what the community wants to know, right?

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.240
That's awesome.

01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:12.240
1410 is.

01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:13.240
Yeah.

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:16.120
Well, it does happen because the news is, I know it does happen.

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:17.120
It does.

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:18.120
The news again is opinion.

01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:19.120
It does happen.

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:24.000
But the majority focus of last is I would call a showcase where unplugged is more, it's

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.040
more of Linux users grappling with what Linux users are thinking and caring about.

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:34.400
And it's good fun, but it is, but it's reflective of what's going on in our community.

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:35.400
Right.

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:39.680
And you, you, you present, you know, multiple points of view and you give people in the

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:40.680
mumble.

01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.480
Well, no, I'm not trying to get you to do that.

01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:43.600
I'm not trying to get you to do that.

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:47.680
What am I, what I'm trying to just say is like, I'm not going out of my way to find

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:48.680
negative stuff.

01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:49.680
I'm not saying you're trying to.

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:50.680
I'm saying it does.

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:51.680
It's a matter of fact.

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:53.480
But then do we just ignore it though?

01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:54.760
Like that's how that's tough too.

01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:56.320
And that's almost seems disingenuous.

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:57.320
Sure.

01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:01.720
You know, that's where I struggled because like, if we didn't talk about this and I,

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:03.240
you know, Eric can attest to this.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:06.480
I was saying this morning on the tech talk today pre-show, I really didn't want to talk

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:07.480
about this today.

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:10.240
Like this isn't what I wanted our episode to be about.

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:13.560
So, so I found this, sorry.

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:20.240
I was just going to say, so I've found, I've found that when you go in, you start looking

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:24.580
at them and talk about super technical things because a lot of people just aren't cynical

01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:27.580
and they aren't watching the show to hear super technical things.

01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:31.720
So the things that you have talked about are the things that are kind of more on the things

01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:35.040
that they're really taught, you know, something you want to talk about and things that are

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.480
very polarizing.

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:39.880
And these are the things that will make you say, I hate this or I love this.

01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:40.880
Right.

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:47.000
And also I look for, I look in our subreddit where there's a good, like good debates on

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
both sides.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.720
Like somebody's making a good case for one side and some, and I'm like, oh, okay.

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:53.520
So there's obviously a spectrum of discussion to be had here.

01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:57.120
And a lot of times, you know, with the good stuff, it's just good and there's really nothing

01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:01.760
much to say, but I do, but I guess bullet point though, that I want to walk away from

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:05.920
this whole chat is I'm totally down to like focusing more on the positive stuff.

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:10.120
And to that end, we've had discussions about maybe working in some more of the maker type

01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:14.560
stuff and some of the cool creations into this show and then graduating in the last

01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.720
if it really seems to take traction and stuff like that.

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:21.540
So we've had some discussions internally about how to sort of introduce more of this is what's

01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:23.720
awesomely happening and let's talk about that.

01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:27.680
But that for a particular talk show format is a little trickier than you might think,

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:28.680
I think.

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:29.680
Right.

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:32.640
And I think it's good that you have multiple points of view.

01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:38.880
I think the whole this runs Linux, you know, kind of thing is brilliant because it's a

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:43.440
voyage of discovery for all of us finding out all these machines that are randomly positioned

01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:46.600
around the world running Linux.

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:52.600
But then you also need the counterpoint to that, which is, you know, the this German

01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:58.760
guy has decided that his city should not be running Linux or and let's discuss that or,

01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.720
you know, these people are being assholes.

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:01.720
Let's discuss that.

01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:05.920
And I think a lot of times I think a lot of times we come away debunking some stuff not

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:10.600
like the full on meaning of it, but like we walked away from that specifically the Germany

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:13.360
thing, you know, kind of debunking what was happening there and really, hey, it's not

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.360
that big of a deal.

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.480
The press is just kind of having some fun with this.

01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:17.480
Yeah.

01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:22.160
And I don't see that covering that stuff and discussing it as a negative thing at all.

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:25.960
I see that as a positive aspect in talking about positive things.

01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:28.240
We turned that story on its head.

01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:33.440
But I was I was almost certain that this is what would be discussed on today's show because

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:36.720
it's played so heavily all over the the Internet.

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:37.720
Right.

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:39.800
You've been to the essential formula here.

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:40.800
Yeah.

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:49.040
But I was I was unsure if it was a good idea to go with it, though, because I I mean, Steve

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:55.360
or Nichols really a shameful article that he posted because he basically just used the

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:58.680
names of the personalities and two other words.

01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:00.880
And it was just horrible click.

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:03.520
It's one of his worst in a long time.

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:06.200
And yeah, I was really disappointed when I saw it.

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:07.200
Yes.

01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:12.440
But also I was concerned that because this show has a platform, that this would just

01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:18.240
further the the dragging, you know, the Linux community through the mud.

01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:25.760
And I'm well, you know, I was really worried about when we started or when the topic was

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:30.240
announced because, you know, Chris, I would say that, you know, the Jupiter Broadcasting

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:35.520
and Linux Action Show and Linux Unplugged are the most popular Linux shows around.

01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:40.640
And remember, they are we have a hive mind when it comes to our open source things.

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:47.360
So when you kind of get negative, everybody gets negative because you have so much power

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:50.200
in a way, you know, with power comes responsibility here.

01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:52.080
You tell me I'm Spiderman up in this business.

01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:53.080
I don't think so.

01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:57.400
I always wanted to say that, but it does look how I ended, honestly, but go back to how

01:43:57.400 --> 01:44:01.280
I ended Linux Unplugged here is it's, you know, it doesn't, you know, it's it's individually

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:02.280
our choices.

01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:03.280
Yeah.

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:04.880
Whenever we get negative, everyone will.

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:09.560
And when everyone kind of has a good time, the whole group, I'm not sure that's the case.

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:15.200
I think I think Chris does have does have quite a platform here, but I don't think I

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:17.560
don't think we have the hive mind that heavens was saying.

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:18.960
I don't think plenty.

01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:24.360
I don't think everyone thinks, oh, Chris says, you know, he's not happy.

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:30.800
I think maybe we're a lot of people who who will react the other way to whatever Chris

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:31.800
says.

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:32.800
We're conflating two things.

01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:37.060
So like sometimes in the mumble room, we'll get into a collective groove and kind of into

01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:39.000
a line of thinking.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.020
But that but have no illusion.

01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:47.560
People listening are not in that same collective groove at all in some cases, and they will

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.400
very much make their voice heard.

01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:51.040
So it's pissed off.

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:52.040
Yeah.

01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:55.000
I think we do a decent job of generally trying to stay out of that group.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.300
But it does happen sometimes because, you know, points build upon each other and people

01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:00.000
start going, yeah, you know, that can happen.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000
So it's.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Yeah.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Even last week.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.880
I mean, obviously, we don't always stick to what Chris says, because even last week,

01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:09.800
me and Popey were arguing against what he was saying in the show.

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:11.680
So that's what we're here for.

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.680
Yeah.

01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:13.680
I mean, hmm.

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:14.680
Yeah.

01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:15.680
I so anyways.

01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:17.800
So you're not bitter about that, are you?

01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:18.920
Observations are taken.

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:25.300
And I think, you know, hopefully, hopefully the community is I hope people listening understand

01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:28.200
that it's not that we're trying to focus on the bad aspects.

01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:30.040
We're kind of it's this is therapy.

01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:31.040
We're trying to work.

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:33.800
These are things Linux users are thinking about and we're trying to work through it.

01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:38.400
And I hope more often than not, and I'm sure it doesn't happen all the time, but I hope

01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:42.880
more than more, more times, I hope on average, we get it right.

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:47.320
I hope on average, we we walk away feeling a little bit better, having a better understanding

01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:51.800
and maybe changing the discussion a little bit for the better.
