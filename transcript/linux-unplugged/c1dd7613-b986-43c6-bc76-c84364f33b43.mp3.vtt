00:00.000 --> 00:09.240
Breaking news, tweet coming into the show from Richard Brown, Chairman Richard Brown.

00:09.240 --> 00:13.360
OpenSUSE has solved all of ButterFS's issues.

00:13.360 --> 00:17.160
This started on a tweet thread coming at me, a tweet, I'm not going to be using ButterFS

00:17.160 --> 00:18.160
on my system.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.000
I've had some issues with it.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.860
And OpenSUSE has responded with a blog post where Richard writes, ever wondered how to

00:24.860 --> 00:29.160
manually set up ButterFS root file systems the same way we do in OpenSUSE?

00:29.160 --> 00:33.920
For all of you other distributions that are getting ButterFS wrong, you're simply just

00:33.920 --> 00:36.720
setting it up wrong.

00:36.720 --> 00:43.260
Like the words of the deceased Steve Jobs, you're holding your ButterFS wrong.

00:43.260 --> 00:48.040
And one of our listeners tweets back, I'm still concerned about file system issues,

00:48.040 --> 00:49.040
free space issues.

00:49.040 --> 00:52.360
I just don't think ButterFS has a place on production desktops.

00:52.360 --> 00:56.280
Richard Brown responds.

00:56.280 --> 00:59.520
Thank you for your feedback.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.880
But those issues have been long addressed.

01:02.880 --> 01:03.960
There you have it, everybody.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.800
There you have it right now.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.600
This is CNN Breaking News.

01:08.600 --> 01:13.880
Live from OpenSUSE, confirmed all of ButterFS's issues have been resolved.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.560
Format ZFS and install ButterFS.

01:16.560 --> 01:17.560
Have at it, kids.

01:17.560 --> 01:20.280
Can I imagine I jumped from OpenSUSE?

01:20.280 --> 01:23.200
No, really, you are our OpenSUSE guy.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.200
What are you talking about?

01:24.200 --> 01:25.760
Now all we have is Gabriel.

01:25.760 --> 01:26.760
What are you talking about?

01:26.760 --> 01:28.880
You are our OpenSUSE guy, Eric.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.080
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

01:33.080 --> 01:36.320
It has problems with audio production.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.320
Oh, really?

01:37.320 --> 01:38.320
What kind of problems?

01:38.320 --> 01:40.120
There's just not enough software availability.

01:40.120 --> 01:43.840
Software fails to compile on it that would normally compile, like say on Fedora, which

01:43.840 --> 01:46.840
is why I jumped to the Fedora Jam remix.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.080
Oh, hold on, I think Mr. Payne's at the door.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.080
Continue on.

01:51.080 --> 01:55.880
I thought that the build service was a solution for that, though.

01:55.880 --> 02:00.480
The build service is a solution for that, but the problem is getting the spec files

02:00.480 --> 02:01.480
to go.

02:01.480 --> 02:08.160
It just ended up being a hassle, whereas it was all available on Fedora already.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.560
I don't have to go through that hassle.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.680
I can just set up a system and boom, done.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.680
Really?

02:12.680 --> 02:15.120
All of a sudden, I have a Linux box able to help me with my audio production.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.760
I'm going to check that out.

02:16.760 --> 02:25.720
I got to say, if Fedora is easier, then it must be pretty bad over there.

02:25.720 --> 02:31.080
It follows my old rule of shades of niche, and it goes a little something like this,

02:31.080 --> 02:32.080
my friends.

02:32.080 --> 02:35.840
The closer you are to Windows, the better time you're going to have as far as application

02:35.840 --> 02:38.680
compatibility, support, performance, and reliability.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.920
This is not an argument to run Windows because the platform is trash, but the closer you

02:41.920 --> 02:44.960
are to Windows, the better your chances are going to be.

02:44.960 --> 02:48.560
Now then your next step out, your next niche step out is Mac OS.

02:48.560 --> 02:51.700
Mac OS, you could say the same thing, a little bit more application compatibility, but not

02:51.700 --> 02:53.200
create as good as Windows.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.040
More people writing software for the Mac, but not as much as Windows.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.600
Then you go another step out, and that's Linux.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.480
Really that's Ubuntu.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.760
Ubuntu has the next, the third niche out is Ubuntu.

03:03.760 --> 03:07.000
Now if you want to go a fourth step out, now you're looking at Fedora, you're looking

03:07.000 --> 03:12.840
at Arch, you're looking at general Linux, and then there is yet another step out, and

03:12.840 --> 03:14.360
that is OpenSUSE.

03:14.360 --> 03:18.440
These weird Germans who have a very particular way of building things, they got to have their

03:18.440 --> 03:22.400
own build system, they got to have their own boot splash, oh wait, no they don't, that's

03:22.400 --> 03:23.400
dead.

03:23.400 --> 03:29.000
And then there is yet a fifth dimension, and that is FreeBSD.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.480
And that is really out on the fringes.

03:31.480 --> 03:36.480
The least amount of desktop application compatibility, the least amount of industry desktop support,

03:36.480 --> 03:38.400
and that's where you live on FreeBSD.

03:38.400 --> 03:43.240
And you just got to pick which flavor of niche is right for you.

03:43.240 --> 03:48.320
You know something, I did try Ubuntu Studio, and just raw Ubuntu, and it didn't hold a

03:48.320 --> 03:49.960
candle to Fedora Jam.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.760
Fedora Jam?

03:51.760 --> 03:52.760
Yeah.

03:52.760 --> 03:53.760
It didn't hold a candle.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.760
You got to try it, Wes.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.480
What do you think, Wes?

03:57.480 --> 03:58.480
Fedora Jam.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.480
Tasty jam.

03:59.480 --> 04:00.480
I do like jam.

04:00.480 --> 04:01.480
Yeah, me too.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.520
Mmm, spread it all over.

04:03.520 --> 04:20.880
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 233 for January 23rd, 2018.

04:20.880 --> 04:25.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux podcast is downloading distros and preparing

04:25.000 --> 04:27.720
for a canonical invasion.

04:27.720 --> 04:28.720
My name is Chris.

04:28.720 --> 04:29.720
My name is Wes.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.720
Hello, Wes.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.720
Glad to have you back.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.280
I hope you're feeling much better.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.280
Much better.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.280
Ready for Linux.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.680
Yeah, well, we have a lot of Linux to get into, sir.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.880
An old friend is back in the news.

04:40.880 --> 04:44.720
The lady tube that is here to save us all, the lady tube that represents freedom, the

04:44.720 --> 04:48.440
original lady tube is back with an update.

04:48.440 --> 04:55.880
Then we'll get into a few, a smattering, a batch, a corner, if you will, of Ubuntu and

04:55.880 --> 05:01.880
Gnome 3 news, as well as Firefox news, which damn, if it's not time to switch to Firefox

05:01.880 --> 05:06.600
is definitely going to be after this week's episode, two, count them one, count them two

05:06.600 --> 05:11.800
different app picks this week, including one that Wes found that's so damn cool, we almost

05:11.800 --> 05:13.560
saved it for an entirely different show.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.320
We'll tell you about that.

05:15.320 --> 05:21.200
And then a critical tool that we use on this network, a lot of streamers use it, it's crushing

05:21.200 --> 05:25.000
the proprietary competition, has gotten a major update this week.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.120
We'll tell you about the new OBS Studio and why it may just wipe your bottom.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.760
Stay tuned for that.

05:32.760 --> 05:37.800
And then later on in the show, rumor has it, the Mate project just got a little bit better

05:37.800 --> 05:44.640
looking and one of the original Linux news sources has been around for 20 years.

05:44.640 --> 05:51.040
We'll celebrate 20 years of LWN at the end of the show and then we'll end it with a question.

05:51.040 --> 05:55.560
Is native Linux app development in decline and why is that?

05:55.560 --> 05:58.520
What caused the state of app development?

05:58.520 --> 06:00.720
And I can tell you as somebody who used to do weekly app picks.

06:00.720 --> 06:01.720
The answer is yes.

06:01.720 --> 06:02.720
So we'll talk about that more.

06:02.720 --> 06:06.280
But first we've got to bring in our virtual lug time appropriate greetings, mumble, rooooooooooooh.

06:06.280 --> 06:07.280
Hello.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.280
Hello.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.280
Oh, hi there.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.280
Hello.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.280
Hey guys.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.280
There's a lot of people.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.280
Did you hear all those people?

06:13.280 --> 06:14.280
There's a lot of people.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.280
I sure did.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.280
That's a little weird.

06:16.280 --> 06:17.280
This will be a good episode.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.600
They're all just right there in my ears.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.520
So we've all been wondering, what about Mycroft?

06:21.520 --> 06:22.520
Right?

06:22.520 --> 06:24.880
Haven't we all been kind of like, hey, what about Mycroft?

06:24.880 --> 06:25.880
Yeah.

06:25.880 --> 06:30.960
So obviously the solution is another crowd funder introducing mark two.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.720
Mycroft has announced specs for a new voice assistant.

06:33.720 --> 06:34.840
They've been building towards this.

06:34.840 --> 06:39.920
They recently did a blog post about the lessons they learned from their previous crowd funders.

06:39.920 --> 06:43.960
So they kind of been setting the groundwork for this.

06:43.960 --> 06:49.000
And they've been sort of giving everybody a reminder of why open source is better for

06:49.000 --> 06:52.600
privacy and it's better for these kinds of devices inherently.

06:52.600 --> 07:00.360
And today they're announcing the new Mycroft mark two, which will be more like a speaker

07:00.360 --> 07:05.380
tube, an upright standing tube that has a very large touch screen.

07:05.380 --> 07:07.580
I believe it's touch screen on the front of it.

07:07.580 --> 07:08.720
It's an informational screen.

07:08.720 --> 07:13.160
So who wants to just get a whole jumble of words when you can get a display?

07:13.160 --> 07:16.800
And they're going to be launching this on, I think it's called thunderclap, if I recall

07:16.800 --> 07:17.800
it.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.480
Yeah, thunderclap is where they're going.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.220
And I think it's happening the Thursday of this recording.

07:23.220 --> 07:26.040
So depending on when you're listening, it could be happening right now.

07:26.040 --> 07:29.760
And it's a brand new version of Mycroft that is more competitive.

07:29.760 --> 07:34.400
It's more in the line of the big, large super speaker that you're seeing with Apple's HomePod

07:34.400 --> 07:36.080
and the Google Macs.

07:36.080 --> 07:41.240
And it's also more in line with the Google show, or I'm sorry, the Echo show or the

07:41.240 --> 07:43.320
Echo spot, which all have screens on them.

07:43.320 --> 07:47.360
And then they have what they call hero cards that display information along with the verbal

07:47.360 --> 07:48.360
request.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.360
Mycroft, you're my hero.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.160
What do you think, Wes, is this it?

07:51.160 --> 07:54.720
Is this going to crack that nut?

07:54.720 --> 07:57.200
It's at least further along the way.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.520
It's if they can make it look that good.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.520
I'm intrigued.

08:00.520 --> 08:04.180
You know, really, of course, what it comes down to is like, what's the level of voice

08:04.180 --> 08:05.180
interaction?

08:05.180 --> 08:06.180
How painless is it?

08:06.180 --> 08:10.200
And it can it meet, you know, what the other large vendors are doing that time will have

08:10.200 --> 08:11.200
to tell.

08:11.200 --> 08:16.200
If anybody in the Mumble Room has any thoughts at this stage, you're welcome to jump in.

08:16.200 --> 08:19.880
And I see, JJ, you have something you thought might be worth mentioning.

08:19.880 --> 08:20.880
Go ahead.

08:20.880 --> 08:26.200
Yeah, I guess this sort of interest in me pursuing a little bit of open source, Linux

08:26.200 --> 08:32.120
especially, I'm sort of interested in what Mycroft has to offer in terms of competition

08:32.120 --> 08:38.720
and in terms of an alternative to the data sucking lady tubes that we know, well, thanks

08:38.720 --> 08:39.720
for the term.

08:39.720 --> 08:46.720
Lady tubes that we know such as Google and the credit Amazon word that I'm not supposed

08:46.720 --> 08:47.720
to mention.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.720
She who must not be named.

08:48.720 --> 08:49.720
Don't trigger.

08:49.720 --> 08:50.720
Don't trigger.

08:50.720 --> 08:51.720
Yeah.

08:51.720 --> 08:52.720
OK.

08:52.720 --> 08:53.720
Beard, talk me down.

08:53.720 --> 08:54.720
What do you think?

08:54.720 --> 08:57.000
Or maybe you think maybe you'll agree with me.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.440
I think desktop Linux, the year of desktop Linux has a better shot than this does as

09:03.440 --> 09:05.680
a as a product.

09:05.680 --> 09:11.320
I think that the Libra five has a better chance of selling five million devices than this

09:11.320 --> 09:13.080
does as a product.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.460
In other words, I think it's a long shot.

09:15.460 --> 09:17.160
Can you walk me back from that position?

09:17.160 --> 09:18.160
No, I agree.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.160
Yeah.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.160
OK.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.560
Another another poignant argument.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.560
What do you think, Wimby?

09:23.560 --> 09:26.480
Can you walk me back from that argument?

09:26.480 --> 09:27.480
Probably not.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.240
What about the slow burn effect of open source?

09:29.240 --> 09:33.160
What about that long, slow and steady approach?

09:33.160 --> 09:40.760
So Microsoft released a video recently of it being adapted for use in a car.

09:40.760 --> 09:45.340
And I imagine that that was some kind of prototype that they were doing as a proof of concept.

09:45.340 --> 09:52.660
But maybe the success of Microsoft isn't consumer sales, but integration into other equipment

09:52.660 --> 09:53.660
and devices.

09:53.660 --> 09:54.660
Right.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.080
That is definitely what I was thinking in the past.

09:56.080 --> 10:01.920
And then this year, CES happened and Amazon's Echo is literally built into everything from

10:01.920 --> 10:07.800
light switches to toilets, literally, microwave ovens, toaster ovens.

10:07.800 --> 10:11.160
You know how we all joke about Linux running on toasters?

10:11.160 --> 10:15.840
The Echo software is literally running on toasters now.

10:15.840 --> 10:20.360
On user error this week, we're going to talk about a flex home that is a prefabbed home

10:20.360 --> 10:22.800
that is everything built in is smart.

10:22.800 --> 10:27.080
Every light, every blind, your heater, your water, everything is like one of these quote

10:27.080 --> 10:28.760
unquote smart devices.

10:28.760 --> 10:33.280
And the home just pre-ships with an Amazon Echo to control it all.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.880
I think that ship sailed too, unfortunately.

10:35.880 --> 10:41.760
Yeah, I think it is hard that they can't even just be as good as the competition.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.440
They really need something to separate out.

10:44.440 --> 10:48.000
And I don't think privacy is enough for a large enough audience.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.600
On-premises support would be a pretty big product differentiator.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.600
So if you could run the Mycroft service on-premises.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.600
Yeah, right.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.600
Yeah.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.600
I mean, I'm-

10:56.600 --> 10:57.600
Compatibility and patchability.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.600
Yeah.

10:58.600 --> 11:05.360
Part of me is so sort of bummed about it, but then part of me is like this idealistic,

11:05.360 --> 11:06.360
hopeful person.

11:06.360 --> 11:10.640
So the same part of me that really wants the Librem 5 to succeed, wants this to succeed.

11:10.640 --> 11:17.240
All right, well, let's talk about how Didroxx is solely making me fall back in love with

11:17.240 --> 11:23.040
Gnome and is helping bring rational discussion to what otherwise is just a bunch of clickbait.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.040
Yeah, let's please.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.360
So the new version of Gnome is Nye.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.880
And of course, it'll be arriving in all of our favorite distributions soon.

11:29.880 --> 11:35.960
And the big controversial change, which we've given some mention to, is the removal of desktop

11:35.960 --> 11:36.960
icons.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.960
So we're going to do a smattering of Gnome news here.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.640
And we'll start with this, a smattering.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.840
We did some smattering of plasma news last week.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.840
Now it's a smattering of Gnome news this week.

11:44.840 --> 11:51.800
So in 1804, you've probably heard by now that Canonical has made the choice to ship an older

11:51.800 --> 11:57.600
version of Nautilus in their 1804 desktop.

11:57.600 --> 12:04.440
The number one comment I've seen is, and I quote, oh, here we go again.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.480
I can't even believe how many times I've seen.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.600
Oh, here we go again.

12:09.600 --> 12:15.720
Here goes Canonical, crazy ass Canonical, not happy with the upstream Gnome arrogance.

12:15.720 --> 12:19.980
And so they're running off and forking their Gnome desktop all over again.

12:19.980 --> 12:27.680
This has been the common response to the announcement that Canonical would simply be shipping one

12:27.680 --> 12:30.160
version behind of the file manager.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.160
So what's going on here?

12:31.160 --> 12:33.160
Why is Gnome dropping icons?

12:33.160 --> 12:34.560
Is it because they hate users?

12:34.560 --> 12:38.820
Or is there something else more sophisticated and complex happening?

12:38.820 --> 12:43.640
And Didrocks just has this great post that really kind of explains it all.

12:43.640 --> 12:52.040
And Didrocks is a great sort of nonpartisan position to cover this because he's been maintaining

12:52.040 --> 12:56.440
code as part of Unity for years that dealt with this very code path.

12:56.440 --> 13:00.640
So he has hands-on experience with the very feature that's being deprecated.

13:00.640 --> 13:05.560
And he's the guy that for some reason, which we'll get to, is going through all the hassle

13:05.560 --> 13:09.240
of backboarding the old version of files to Ubuntu.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.240
So how did we get here?

13:10.240 --> 13:17.880
And why is Gnome removing icons off of the desktop at the very time when Plasma is switching

13:17.880 --> 13:20.320
to icons on the desktop by default?

13:20.320 --> 13:21.320
How did we get here?

13:21.320 --> 13:22.320
What?

13:22.320 --> 13:23.320
What happened?

13:23.320 --> 13:27.880
Well, you've got to understand the background.

13:27.880 --> 13:34.620
There has been a lot of discussion for years about these icons on the desktop.

13:34.620 --> 13:36.880
So they're not really put there by Gnome 3 Shell.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.920
They're put there by the Nautilus file manager.

13:38.920 --> 13:43.640
And they use this really interesting X layering to be on the bottom layer.

13:43.640 --> 13:49.640
But it's this really weird thing that Didrocks goes into more in his blog post.

13:49.640 --> 13:52.320
But it's making me shiver just right now.

13:52.320 --> 13:56.600
It is one of those moments where you realize this has been kind of this hacky thing that

13:56.600 --> 14:00.700
they've been dragging along for like three years that they've been trying to come up

14:00.700 --> 14:04.360
with a way to kill this feature.

14:04.360 --> 14:08.560
And it has been a controversial discussion for over three years.

14:08.560 --> 14:12.960
And it has been also one of these features that they have been openly discussing.

14:12.960 --> 14:17.360
You can find a recent blog post on Planet Gnome back in December where they sort of

14:17.360 --> 14:21.680
outline their thinking on all of this and why this might be coming.

14:21.680 --> 14:26.460
And on top of that, by reading this post, you discover that the Gnome folks also gave

14:26.460 --> 14:31.200
a heads up to Didrocks and said, hey, we're thinking about making this change.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.000
What do you guys think?

14:33.000 --> 14:37.560
And it did put Canonical in a bit of an awkward position because they kind of were left with

14:37.560 --> 14:42.680
three sort of mediocre choices.

14:42.680 --> 14:48.400
They could stick with Nautilus 3.26, the current version, and keep icon support.

14:48.400 --> 14:55.440
They could ship Nautilus 328 and also ship Nemo desktop to support desktop icons.

14:55.440 --> 15:00.080
But then they're shipping one file manager and part of Nemo, which is a fork of that

15:00.080 --> 15:01.660
file manager.

15:01.660 --> 15:07.400
Or they could ship Nautilus 328 and use a brand new extension that's in the works to

15:07.400 --> 15:10.060
draw the icons on the desktop.

15:10.060 --> 15:15.280
The issue there being that the mechanism that that extension uses isn't even finalized

15:15.280 --> 15:17.160
in GTK yet.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.160
And it hasn't been tested.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.560
Ooh, on an LTS.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.200
And Canonical shipping an LTS.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.200
Exactly.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.520
So they're in a position where we've got to ship an LTS.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.600
We want to do the most rational thing.

15:26.600 --> 15:30.920
And we don't want to remove icons on the desktop that's going to be around for five years.

15:30.920 --> 15:36.240
And so when you stack all the bad choices up, the best choice is to just ship Nautilus

15:36.240 --> 15:38.040
3.26.

15:38.040 --> 15:41.720
And that was also the suggestion of the GNOME project.

15:41.720 --> 15:42.720
Is that right?

15:42.720 --> 15:43.720
Which is an interesting point.

15:43.720 --> 15:48.520
And to that end, didrocks includes sort of like a sub blog from one of the GNOME developers

15:48.520 --> 15:50.680
explaining the rationale on this.

15:50.680 --> 15:55.040
And anytime you can kind of reduce variabilities, then it's easier to test those code paths.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.960
It's easier to ensure reliability.

15:56.960 --> 16:02.920
And whenever you start forking big things, like say they were bringing on Nautilus 328

16:02.920 --> 16:07.440
and also that GNOME Shell extension, those are all new things that they would have to

16:07.440 --> 16:14.480
be testing against, which would probably not be a good idea for the LTS.

16:14.480 --> 16:19.560
But I guess the long term answer, if you want icons, is this extension that they're working

16:19.560 --> 16:20.560
on.

16:20.560 --> 16:23.560
So there's hope yet for you desktop lovers out there.

16:23.560 --> 16:24.920
I guess.

16:24.920 --> 16:28.760
The whole post is a fascinating read because didrocks goes into how he got this working

16:28.760 --> 16:34.000
on Unity over the years and some of the little tricks that he did to position the icons correctly

16:34.000 --> 16:35.800
to sort of sense where they should be.

16:35.800 --> 16:40.960
And you really, reading it between the lines, the message I get is, man, X11 is just a big

16:40.960 --> 16:41.960
cluster.

16:41.960 --> 16:42.960
I hate touching this.

16:42.960 --> 16:43.960
It's really a mess.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.380
And then it's like, oh, yeah, that's why we got to go to Wayland.

16:46.380 --> 16:50.600
Some of the stuff you read, you go, oh, geez, God, that's, yeah, get rid of the icons.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.560
I can't believe they're doing that hack to show my icons on the desktop.

16:54.560 --> 16:58.600
Oh, and by the way, this code path hasn't been maintained for, I mean, it's been maintained,

16:58.600 --> 17:01.520
but it really hasn't been modified for like three years.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.000
It's just time to go.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.080
And you know what?

17:05.080 --> 17:08.480
I got to say this post by didrocks changed my position on this.

17:08.480 --> 17:11.040
I was a little skeptical, like, oh, really guys?

17:11.040 --> 17:13.520
You just, it's like you just constantly are shooting down work.

17:13.520 --> 17:18.240
But then going through this, it's like, oh, they just, why was it implemented via Nautilus

17:18.240 --> 17:19.240
in the first place?

17:19.240 --> 17:22.080
Why isn't just a fundamental function of gnome shell?

17:22.080 --> 17:29.880
And that because Nautilus was the shell, you know, previously in gnome 2, Nautilus was

17:29.880 --> 17:35.760
the shell in the same way that today in Marte, Kaja is the shell.

17:35.760 --> 17:40.600
And Kaja has the option to.

17:40.600 --> 17:41.600
Go ahead Kaja.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.200
It's far more useful where it would be.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.640
So what do you say?

17:44.640 --> 17:48.800
So heavens, your argument is, is yeah, but now Nautilus is less useful and Kaja and Nemo

17:48.800 --> 17:49.800
are more useful.

17:49.800 --> 17:54.840
Well, when you're running a program, what screen space is being used, it kind of overwrites

17:54.840 --> 17:55.840
the desktop.

17:55.840 --> 18:02.680
The dock can only slide out and be visible whenever you want it to be or always visible.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.360
That's more persistent than a desktop icon.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.880
Yeah, fair enough.

18:07.880 --> 18:11.600
Wimpy sitting there with a Mate desktop in front of you right now.

18:11.600 --> 18:17.280
What are your thoughts on this on this fundamental discussion of the code path to maintain desktop

18:17.280 --> 18:18.800
icons is antiquated.

18:18.800 --> 18:22.440
It's not maintained, it's sort of been a hack for a long time, and it's an X11 hack on top

18:22.440 --> 18:23.440
of that.

18:23.440 --> 18:28.440
But yet it's a feature users want who I'd be curious to know what your thinking is on

18:28.440 --> 18:29.440
this.

18:29.440 --> 18:34.760
Yeah, I mean, I'd agree with all of the comments about it being, you know, legacy code and

18:34.760 --> 18:35.760
what have you.

18:35.760 --> 18:42.760
We've, we've really struggled to maintain all of the desktop interaction features that

18:42.760 --> 18:49.880
exist within Mate and Kaja as we've migrated to GTK 3.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.480
And it's hard work, and there are things that could be improved, and that's even harder

18:53.480 --> 18:55.120
to resolve.

18:55.120 --> 19:01.360
I think one of the fallouts of this is that longer term, you know, these APIs to do this

19:01.360 --> 19:05.400
are deprecated now, and they're going to be going away in GTK 4.

19:05.400 --> 19:11.040
So the likes of the Mate desktop and XFCE and the others that are doing the traditional

19:11.040 --> 19:14.720
desktop metaphor, because after all, you can't call it a desktop if it doesn't have any icons

19:14.720 --> 19:18.280
on it anymore, because the metaphor is broken at that point.

19:18.280 --> 19:24.080
So it's just, you know, a shell, you know, you can't claim it a desktop because it isn't.

19:24.080 --> 19:29.160
But one of the things we've been discussing in the Mate project is perhaps we need to

19:29.160 --> 19:37.000
create a library lib desktop, which is a whole cloth implementation in order to broker this

19:37.000 --> 19:42.880
kind of, you know, interaction if that's the route that we decide to go.

19:42.880 --> 19:48.600
Whilst we're on GTK 3, we can stay the course with the improvements that we've made.

19:48.600 --> 19:54.320
But when GTK 4 comes along, we'll have to review, you know, what our plans are.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.320
Wow.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.320
Wow.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.600
Wow, that is a lot for me to take in.

19:59.600 --> 20:03.720
So the possibility of having to implement your own desktop, something that feels like

20:03.720 --> 20:09.240
it should be a first class baked in citizen of the core desktop experience, if that's

20:09.240 --> 20:13.120
something you want, that's a really, that's a tough road to hoe.

20:13.120 --> 20:20.000
And I have to say, on systems where I have desktop icons, I just make a mess.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.560
I just make a mess.

20:21.560 --> 20:23.800
Yeah, I don't have any systems that have them anymore.

20:23.800 --> 20:24.800
Really?

20:24.800 --> 20:28.240
And then systems where I don't have them, I just make a folder structure that's also

20:28.240 --> 20:29.240
been a mess.

20:29.240 --> 20:31.160
But it's a folder structure within my home directory.

20:31.160 --> 20:38.360
I just, it's weird because I'm working on this project where most of our users are really

20:38.360 --> 20:41.560
interested in keeping that desktop.

20:41.560 --> 20:46.760
You know, if you look at a lot of Marte users desktop, it's just full of icons.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.760
Now I've never done that.

20:48.760 --> 20:54.840
I have a directory I create in my home directory called cruft and anything transient just ends

20:54.840 --> 20:57.880
up in there and periodically I have to go through and sort it out.

20:57.880 --> 21:01.840
A lot of people use their desktop as that space for cruft.

21:01.840 --> 21:08.760
So personally, I wouldn't miss icons on the desktop because that isn't part of my workflow.

21:08.760 --> 21:15.120
The problem is, is we have to be mindful of the workflow of all of our users and a significant

21:15.120 --> 21:19.960
number of them value that feature because it's in their muscle memory.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.000
That's how they've been doing it for years and years.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
You know, my mom, who is a graphic artist on the computer, she very much uses the drag

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
and drop paradigm.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.920
So she'll drag an image from an application to the desktop and from her desktop to another

21:31.920 --> 21:32.920
application.

21:32.920 --> 21:36.960
And the desktop is sort of like this intermediary holding bin where she can then drag it to

21:36.960 --> 21:37.960
another icon on her dock.

21:37.960 --> 21:41.240
I mean, it seems like for some users, the desktop is how they interface with the computer,

21:41.240 --> 21:42.240
right?

21:42.240 --> 21:43.240
That's how they conceptualize it.

21:43.240 --> 21:44.240
Right.

21:44.240 --> 21:45.240
To not have icons that they have on the other platforms.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.240
Yeah.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.240
Yeah.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.240
Yeah.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.000
And then for me, it's like, I'll use it if I have it and it's always a mess.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.800
And then I, if I don't have it, I just make, I make like a cruft folder like Wimpy does.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.440
Although I don't have such a clever name for it.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.600
I'm going to, I'm going to start using that.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.800
I'm going to steal that.

21:57.800 --> 22:03.040
Speaking of stealing, Gnome Photos is stealing a few features from Darktable and I'm all

22:03.040 --> 22:04.040
about it.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.040
I think this is a great idea.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.400
Talk about a nice open source Kumbaya.

22:07.400 --> 22:11.520
This is not a huge story, but Gnome Photos in the next version is getting nice.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.480
And while we're talking about new Gnome stuff, why not?

22:13.480 --> 22:17.160
They're implementing shadows and highlights from Darktable into Gnome Photos.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.160
Oh, that's awesome.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.160
Isn't that great?

22:19.160 --> 22:20.160
Yeah.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.220
It's just a super, super great idea.

22:21.220 --> 22:25.240
New crop features, new scaling features, new easy way to kind of get like a grid on there

22:25.240 --> 22:27.500
when you're trying to get a nice photo.

22:27.500 --> 22:31.840
Basically what I'm telling you is if you just need a nice program to sort photos and make

22:31.840 --> 22:36.440
them a little bit better, maybe increase exposure, contrast, highlights, and crop them a little

22:36.440 --> 22:39.300
bit, you know, that you shot on your phone, this is it.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.300
It's getting there now.

22:40.300 --> 22:42.440
And Gnome Photos is making steady progress.

22:42.440 --> 22:45.520
So I'm excited to see that progress.

22:45.520 --> 22:48.640
It's really kind of getting to that point where I don't need much more than a file manager.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.960
So this is just about it.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.440
Those final touches, you know, before I consider it done.

22:53.440 --> 23:01.800
And then last but not least, while we're in the Gnome news segment, Firefox is, so 58

23:01.800 --> 23:02.800
is next.

23:02.800 --> 23:06.760
Firefox 58 will be out on tomorrow if all goes as planned, I think.

23:06.760 --> 23:07.760
Yeah.

23:07.760 --> 23:08.760
No, today even.

23:08.760 --> 23:09.760
Is it out today?

23:09.760 --> 23:10.760
I can't remember if it's out today or tomorrow.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.680
Looks like they're planning to put it in the release channel today.

23:12.680 --> 23:13.680
Okay.

23:13.680 --> 23:14.680
Yeah.

23:14.680 --> 23:15.680
Okay.

23:15.680 --> 23:16.680
So it's coming out.

23:16.680 --> 23:17.680
Yeah.

23:17.680 --> 23:18.680
So new version of Firefox is coming out.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.280
Now that's not specifically Gnome, but I guess while we're talking about it, I'll tell you

23:20.280 --> 23:25.320
what's new is a whole new way of handling user profiles, which means it's going to do

23:25.320 --> 23:30.320
a user profile migration and it will, your user profile will not be compatible with older

23:30.320 --> 23:31.920
versions of Firefox.

23:31.920 --> 23:39.160
So heads up if you use portable Firefox or somebody get on the phone with Joe Ressington.

23:39.160 --> 23:44.420
There's also the improvements to the web extensions API and they're making some claims with hard

23:44.420 --> 23:46.380
numbers about performance.

23:46.380 --> 23:52.800
They say they have improved off main thread painting in Firefox and that the rendering

23:52.800 --> 23:59.760
time is improved noticeably, 30% improvement for Firefox 58 when compared to Firefox 57

23:59.760 --> 24:03.760
and JavaScript bytecode cache is reduced by quite a bit from like having to start when

24:03.760 --> 24:08.960
you start navigation to the when the event is fired via JavaScript, there has been on

24:08.960 --> 24:11.140
average a 43 millisecond reduction.

24:11.140 --> 24:14.960
They're actually giving out a hard number there, 43 millisecond reduction in Firefox

24:14.960 --> 24:19.800
58 as well as improvements to the screenshotting tool, which I've actually begun using a bit

24:19.800 --> 24:20.900
more.

24:20.900 --> 24:25.120
Some fixes for audio playback on those windows desktops, not familiar with that, that sounds

24:25.120 --> 24:29.120
like something that's in my house and as well as other nice things.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.880
But that's Firefox 58, which comes out like about now.

24:31.880 --> 24:32.880
That's interesting.

24:32.880 --> 24:33.880
Hit download right now.

24:33.880 --> 24:34.880
58 go get it.

24:34.880 --> 24:35.880
Really?

24:35.880 --> 24:36.880
Yeah.

24:36.880 --> 24:37.880
Go get it guys.

24:37.880 --> 24:38.880
Everybody go.

24:38.880 --> 24:39.880
I'm getting it right now.

24:39.880 --> 24:40.880
But that isn't Gnome related.

24:40.880 --> 24:41.880
What is Gnome related?

24:41.880 --> 24:43.480
It's Firefox 59.

24:43.480 --> 24:45.000
Always looking at the next version, aren't we?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
We're always looking.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Oh yeah.

24:47.000 --> 24:53.000
And if you follow the bug tracker, it looks like all of the blocking bugs to convert Firefox

24:53.000 --> 24:57.360
to GTK 3 and GTK 3 only have been cleared.

24:57.360 --> 25:00.640
All of the blocking bugs have been cleared.

25:00.640 --> 25:06.540
And with that marked now as resolved, the migration to move Firefox to GTK 3 has been

25:06.540 --> 25:08.440
marked as completed.

25:08.440 --> 25:15.240
And if all lines up, Firefox 59 will be the first version of Firefox that is solely 100%

25:15.240 --> 25:21.880
GTK 3, which I believe leaves GIMP as the last Gnome application, the major Gnome application,

25:21.880 --> 25:25.600
big Gnome application that has not moved to GTK 3.

25:25.600 --> 25:30.800
Ironic considering that GIMP is the father of the GTK toolkit.

25:30.800 --> 25:31.800
Right?

25:31.800 --> 25:32.800
It is, isn't it?

25:32.800 --> 25:33.800
It is.

25:33.800 --> 25:38.160
But it also strikes me as if you're a Linux user, Firefox is currently catering to you

25:38.160 --> 25:39.160
right now.

25:39.160 --> 25:44.480
Both 58 and 59 have a lot of nice improvements that are specific to Linux users.

25:44.480 --> 25:47.120
It's never been a better time to be a Firefox user.

25:47.120 --> 25:50.400
I'm really looking forward to these new profiles.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.320
I'm hoping that that could be...

25:52.320 --> 25:56.880
It's really difficult to get unwedded from the profiles in Chrome and Chromium, and I'm

25:56.880 --> 25:58.680
hoping that this is gonna be it.

25:58.680 --> 25:59.680
Yeah.

25:59.680 --> 26:00.680
I hope so too.

26:00.680 --> 26:03.000
I am waiting with anticipation.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.200
I'm all in now on Firefox.

26:05.200 --> 26:09.280
The computer I'm sitting at right now is my last computer using Chrome.

26:09.280 --> 26:13.840
And I think it's just mostly because of workflow on air, but that could even get changed soon

26:13.840 --> 26:14.840
too.

26:14.840 --> 26:15.840
That's just so great.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.800
It's so great and it's so nice to have them, at least to me...

26:18.800 --> 26:19.800
Firefox reticules.

26:19.800 --> 26:20.800
Yeah.

26:20.800 --> 26:24.920
It feels like they're back in a way and that they're focusing on Linux users and GTK 3

26:24.920 --> 26:26.840
means we're probably gonna see all kinds of cool stuff.

26:26.840 --> 26:30.880
It's also just nice to have some more, I mean, we're in an era kind of right now with that

26:30.880 --> 26:34.780
and with Brave and other browsers that there's a lot more competition going on and hopefully

26:34.780 --> 26:35.780
that's good for us.

26:35.780 --> 26:36.780
Mm-hmm.

26:36.780 --> 26:37.780
It does seem to be.

26:37.780 --> 26:38.780
It does seem to be.

26:38.780 --> 26:41.440
Speaking of competition, Ting is bringing the competition to the mobile market in a

26:41.440 --> 26:43.060
huge, huge way.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.280
It's just pay for what you use wireless.

26:45.280 --> 26:46.280
That's...

26:46.280 --> 26:47.400
Oh, man.

26:47.400 --> 26:48.400
That would just totally...

26:48.400 --> 26:54.200
If the wireless industry had to restart today, had to restart right now, say right this moment,

26:54.200 --> 26:55.920
Ting would run the table.

26:55.920 --> 27:00.380
You just pay for what you use, a fair price for how much you talk, text and data you use.

27:00.380 --> 27:01.920
And it's just $6 for your line.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.120
You want one line, it's $6.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.120
You want two lines, it's $12.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.240
You see what I'm saying here?

27:05.240 --> 27:09.200
Uncle Sam takes his tax, you know, in your local area like he do, Wes.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.200
We sure do.

27:10.200 --> 27:11.200
He do.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.200
He takes that cut.

27:12.200 --> 27:16.880
But then you just pay for what you use, nationwide coverage, no contracts, no quote-unquote agreements,

27:16.880 --> 27:18.440
and a dashboard for days.

27:18.440 --> 27:22.760
One of my favorite things about Ting is their GSM and CDMA network.

27:22.760 --> 27:23.840
Why do I like that?

27:23.840 --> 27:26.320
Because when I'm traveling, I pick whichever one works better for me.

27:26.320 --> 27:30.400
And even realistically, in different spots in Washington, there's just sometimes I'm

27:30.400 --> 27:34.460
in a terrain with the trees and the hills where CDMA works better.

27:34.460 --> 27:37.280
And sometimes I'm in a place where GSM just totally rocks.

27:37.280 --> 27:40.120
Like here at the studio, I'm always on the GSM network.

27:40.120 --> 27:43.280
And I love the flexibility because I have a couple of different MiFi devices, and at

27:43.280 --> 27:47.720
just $6 a month, it's no big deal if I don't use Ting that much that month on that particular

27:47.720 --> 27:48.720
MiFi.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.200
That's a really flexible way to work.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.700
Plus, during Linux Fest Northwest, we'll spin up an extra couple of lines, hand out some

27:53.700 --> 27:57.100
cheapo phones, and stay in contact.

27:57.100 --> 27:58.800
It's great for small businesses.

27:58.800 --> 28:03.040
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.880
Linux.ting.com is where you go.

28:05.880 --> 28:06.880
Linux.ting.com.

28:06.880 --> 28:13.880
Go there, take $25 off a phone, or bring a device and get $25 in service credit.

28:13.880 --> 28:15.960
Linux.ting.com.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.680
So I'm a big fan of different launchers.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.640
I've tried Synapse throughout the years.

28:20.640 --> 28:23.280
I've tried Noom Do.

28:23.280 --> 28:27.280
I've been using the launcher built into Unity quite a bit.

28:27.280 --> 28:33.040
Wimpy was recently talking to me about some different launchers on Mate with Brisk, got

28:33.040 --> 28:35.600
my interest peaked there.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.760
So I just wanted to give a shout out to an application launcher for Linux that I've come

28:38.760 --> 28:41.640
across recently that's scratching that itch.

28:41.640 --> 28:42.880
It's fast.

28:42.880 --> 28:46.040
It works sort of like all typical launchers do work.

28:46.040 --> 28:47.040
It's pretty quick.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.720
It supports fuzzy search.

28:48.720 --> 28:52.200
It has shortcuts and different extensions that you can load.

28:52.200 --> 28:56.840
It can also browse directories, which is pretty nice for me because I have scripts in a bin

28:56.840 --> 29:00.520
directory, in my home directory, so I can do tilde slash bin in the name of the script

29:00.520 --> 29:01.960
and it just executes it.

29:01.960 --> 29:04.480
It does, you know, like rough math in the launcher.

29:04.480 --> 29:05.480
It's great.

29:05.480 --> 29:06.480
It's called...

29:06.480 --> 29:07.480
It's even got emoji support.

29:07.480 --> 29:08.480
Look at that.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.480
I know.

29:09.480 --> 29:10.480
That's how you know it's modern, right?

29:10.480 --> 29:14.160
It's called uLauncher at uLauncher.io.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.200
And it's wonderful.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.200
It's great.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.200
It's fast.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.680
And it loads pretty easily.

29:18.680 --> 29:22.000
And once you put it on your system, you can use that to start up all the damn applications.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.400
They got an AUR available.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.000
They got a Fedora package available.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.080
They got a SUSE package available.

29:27.080 --> 29:30.040
And they got a PPA for Ubuntu, which is pretty great.

29:30.040 --> 29:31.040
And the project's...

29:31.040 --> 29:32.040
It's kind of new.

29:32.040 --> 29:33.040
It's up on Patreon.

29:33.040 --> 29:38.120
They're taking that as well as Bitcoin, but they also have the extension plugin, which

29:38.120 --> 29:39.120
is great.

29:39.120 --> 29:43.300
So you can, speaking of Bitcoin, have a Bitcoin plugin type BTC in the launcher and it comes

29:43.300 --> 29:48.400
back with the price or can do Bitcoin conversions for you in your launcher.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.240
Welcome to 2018, right?

29:50.240 --> 29:51.560
There's a key pass plugin.

29:51.560 --> 29:52.560
Really?

29:52.560 --> 29:53.560
Mm-hmm.

29:53.560 --> 29:54.560
I'll just say that.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.560
There's a key pass plugin.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.560
There's an open in browser.

29:56.560 --> 30:01.360
So you can say hgoogle.com and it'll launch in the right browser.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.600
It'll support your Chrome bookmarks or your Firefox bookmark.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.600
It supports logging out of the desktop if you want.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.560
So they got some specific extensions for Cinnamon.

30:09.560 --> 30:13.040
And one thing that's actually pretty handy that I think I'm gonna load this on my lady's

30:13.040 --> 30:16.680
computer for is it has a timer built in, which she uses a lot for work.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.860
Like, set a timer for 15 minutes.

30:18.860 --> 30:19.860
That's great.

30:19.860 --> 30:23.240
And it's just built right in the launcher, I mean, once you install the extension.

30:23.240 --> 30:27.440
So anyways, this is one of my favorite finds recently.

30:27.440 --> 30:31.240
I don't think we've talked about it before.

30:31.240 --> 30:32.240
Boy is it great.

30:32.240 --> 30:37.160
uLauncher.io and it's probably in your local repo right there.

30:37.160 --> 30:41.360
Wimpy, did you want to give any mention for the Brisk launcher stuff that you and I were

30:41.360 --> 30:43.680
chatting about recently off air?

30:43.680 --> 30:45.440
Yeah, sure.

30:45.440 --> 30:51.920
So there is a new feature coming in the next version of Brisk menu, which enables you to

30:51.920 --> 31:00.360
change the way that it's displayed to present a dash style launcher rather than the pop

31:00.360 --> 31:01.960
down menu.

31:01.960 --> 31:09.520
So we're running a patched version of that in our dev branch for Ubuntu Mate at the moment.

31:09.520 --> 31:16.200
And when you enable the mutiny layout now on Ubuntu Mate 1804, it tweaks the various

31:16.200 --> 31:17.360
magic settings.

31:17.360 --> 31:24.760
So then when you hit the super key, you get this dash, which is full screen, large icons,

31:24.760 --> 31:30.940
text search, category buttons to touch, and the whole thing is touch capable.

31:30.940 --> 31:37.600
So that will be landing in Ubuntu Mate 1804, which is good because it's one of those little

31:37.600 --> 31:42.480
details that I knew we would get to and I knew everyone would point out was missing

31:42.480 --> 31:45.160
in 17.10 and they did.

31:45.160 --> 31:46.720
Now it's in there for the 1804.

31:46.720 --> 31:47.720
That's great.

31:47.720 --> 31:48.720
Yeah, it's getting there.

31:48.720 --> 31:49.720
Yeah.

31:49.720 --> 31:50.720
Got one bug to fix and then that's good to go.

31:50.720 --> 31:53.040
I love Brisk as it's a great project.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.360
So really cool to see that.

31:54.360 --> 31:55.360
Yeah.

31:55.360 --> 31:58.520
And that was another great collaboration, you know, with the Brisk team.

31:58.520 --> 32:05.420
There's a developer in Solus called Stefan and we offered a bounty for the work and he

32:05.420 --> 32:07.760
did the work and Ubuntu Mate funded it.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.320
So that's really great.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.320
That is.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.280
So there's this next application I wanted to feature today.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.280
Wes found it.

32:15.280 --> 32:19.360
He almost sat on it just to talk about it exclusively in the new TechSnap program because

32:19.360 --> 32:21.480
that's where all our best stuff is now.

32:21.480 --> 32:22.480
I'm kidding.

32:22.480 --> 32:23.920
But I did really enjoy last week's episode.

32:23.920 --> 32:24.920
That was good.

32:24.920 --> 32:28.080
Wes gave us an introduction to configuration management.

32:28.080 --> 32:33.960
And this application is an advanced user interface to manage...

32:33.960 --> 32:35.880
It's like a dashboard really.

32:35.880 --> 32:36.880
To manage...

32:36.880 --> 32:39.960
You know how we love dashboards here in the Linux Unplugged program?

32:39.960 --> 32:40.960
Dashboards for days.

32:40.960 --> 32:41.960
Days!

32:41.960 --> 32:47.320
It's the advanced dashboard for quick managing and inspecting of containers and images for

32:47.320 --> 32:49.360
Docker.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.880
And it's all on the command line.

32:50.880 --> 32:54.320
It's totally Ncurses based, which is the part I love about it.

32:54.320 --> 32:57.360
Because like when you say dashboard, you're probably thinking like a web page.

32:57.360 --> 32:58.360
Sure.

32:58.360 --> 32:59.360
Ha!

32:59.360 --> 33:00.360
Got you.

33:00.360 --> 33:01.360
No, it is an Ncurses application.

33:01.360 --> 33:02.360
It shows you you're running...

33:02.360 --> 33:07.520
It shows you you're running Docker containers, your overall system utilization.

33:07.520 --> 33:08.520
Picture it.

33:08.520 --> 33:09.520
Sicily 1987.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.120
You SSH into your server.

33:11.120 --> 33:14.160
You bring this up and you have a full overview of everything that's going on.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.680
I can't tell you how useful this is going to be for me on my DigitalOcean droplets.

33:17.680 --> 33:18.680
Yeah.

33:18.680 --> 33:21.480
It seems like something that will find its way to Tmux session near me.

33:21.480 --> 33:22.480
Exactly.

33:22.480 --> 33:24.840
It's exactly what I'm going to do with it.

33:24.840 --> 33:32.200
And I have been experimenting with different click and run type setups for Docker.

33:32.200 --> 33:33.480
Just totally like...

33:33.480 --> 33:34.480
I forget what the...

33:34.480 --> 33:38.360
I covered it in Coder Radio months ago, but there is an application...

33:38.360 --> 33:41.800
I think I might've talked about it in this show too, that will search the Docker directory,

33:41.800 --> 33:45.400
pull it down, set it all up, and you just click that one thing.

33:45.400 --> 33:46.560
Oh yeah.

33:46.560 --> 33:51.080
This is sort of more like inspecting the existing Docker stuff that you have set up.

33:51.080 --> 33:53.480
It doesn't quite do that part of it.

33:53.480 --> 33:54.600
But it's...

33:54.600 --> 33:55.880
I don't know.

33:55.880 --> 33:59.560
There's something broken about me about Ncurses user interfaces.

33:59.560 --> 34:05.320
When they're done right, I will take an Ncurses user interface in my terminal over a really

34:05.320 --> 34:08.200
well done graphical interface any day of the week.

34:08.200 --> 34:09.200
Same.

34:09.200 --> 34:10.200
Yeah.

34:10.200 --> 34:12.520
Even if I'm on graphical desktop, I'll just run it in a terminal window.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.480
I just prefer the flexibility.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.920
I can reshape them to the size I want.

34:16.920 --> 34:18.680
There's lots of context switching too.

34:18.680 --> 34:23.560
Even though I have a web browser open, I have to go shift my attention.

34:23.560 --> 34:28.200
And then this last one here for this week is something that the beard slotted in at

34:28.200 --> 34:29.560
the last minute.

34:29.560 --> 34:35.480
It's the new version of OBS Studio, OBS Studios, I like to say.

34:35.480 --> 34:40.760
version 21 is out and it's huge.

34:40.760 --> 34:42.160
It is...

34:42.160 --> 34:49.080
If I was Telestream and I was making the Wirecast product, I would be extremely nervous about

34:49.080 --> 34:52.800
this little ankle biter called OBS Studio.

34:52.800 --> 34:58.800
It's extremely competitive now and they've just introduced Lua and Python scripting support,

34:58.800 --> 35:04.000
which the ramifications of that are going to be huge because you can set up control

35:04.000 --> 35:08.240
devices and you're going to be able to set off entire actions now with this.

35:08.240 --> 35:11.600
And the fact that they're supporting both Lua and Python is pretty great.

35:11.600 --> 35:15.600
They've included some examples like countdowns and all this kind of stuff.

35:15.600 --> 35:20.120
But in the background now, they're getting to the point where they're adding really high

35:20.120 --> 35:28.840
end professional, like I used to pay $2,000 to get access to these kinds of features.

35:28.840 --> 35:31.580
They're adding 7.1 surround sound support.

35:31.580 --> 35:33.800
They're adding higher bit rate support.

35:33.800 --> 35:38.720
They've revamped the audio meters so that way they break out individual sources and

35:38.720 --> 35:39.720
microphones.

35:39.720 --> 35:44.120
They're also supporting microphone multi-sources.

35:44.120 --> 35:46.520
It's really professional grade.

35:46.520 --> 35:47.520
What do you think, Beard?

35:47.520 --> 35:50.840
Is there one feature on this list that we really need to have?

35:50.840 --> 35:55.320
It's almost to be worth the hassle of upgrading the Archbox?

35:55.320 --> 36:01.000
I think that you would mostly like the side chain ducking.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Oh yeah?

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Yeah.

36:03.000 --> 36:11.240
That basically allows you to automatically lower the level of one input based on the

36:11.240 --> 36:12.800
level of another input.

36:12.800 --> 36:13.800
Yeah.

36:13.800 --> 36:17.280
And you can see how that would be useful for like audio clips or maybe even the Mumble

36:17.280 --> 36:18.280
Room.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.280
That's how they do it in radio, right?

36:19.280 --> 36:23.560
The caller automatically gets ducked when the host starts speaking.

36:23.560 --> 36:24.560
It's nice.

36:24.560 --> 36:30.840
I had been staring at the OBS interface now for a year because it's how we record all

36:30.840 --> 36:32.080
our shows and how we live stream.

36:32.080 --> 36:35.120
So this is a really critical piece of software for us.

36:35.120 --> 36:38.920
And I've been wondering how they're going to improve the audio meter interface.

36:38.920 --> 36:43.040
I don't know if I love this, but it's better than what I expected.

36:43.040 --> 36:46.860
Here's the feature I'm actually the most interested in.

36:46.860 --> 36:48.520
The preview mode now.

36:48.520 --> 36:54.600
So in the studio, we have a dedicated 1080p monitor that is just a preview output from

36:54.600 --> 36:55.600
OBS.

36:55.600 --> 36:56.600
Wes and I look at it all the time.

36:56.600 --> 36:57.600
All the time.

36:57.600 --> 37:01.000
It shows us whatever's on the live stream on a dedicated monitor.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.800
It's extremely useful.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.320
Yes, absolutely.

37:04.320 --> 37:08.560
And now they're adding the ability to have eight scenes on that screen ahead of time.

37:08.560 --> 37:15.720
So I can have all of the shots, like a director's room, all of the shots on that screen.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.400
And then I know which one to go to.

37:17.400 --> 37:21.680
Well, you and I have some ideas about where to take this show post 250 that involve multi

37:21.680 --> 37:27.040
camera setups and you'd be on camera, I'd have a camera, we'd have a screen camera.

37:27.040 --> 37:32.200
They're adding the very features we might just need to take the show to the next level.

37:32.200 --> 37:35.800
Multi-track recording, multi-camera preview.

37:35.800 --> 37:40.860
This is the kind of thing where this free open source project is coming along and adding

37:40.860 --> 37:46.560
stuff that costs tens of thousands of dollars all told, and they're just doing it for free.

37:46.560 --> 37:49.720
And at the same time, we have these ambitions and goals where we want to go with the network

37:49.720 --> 37:52.760
and with the show specifically, and it's just lining up perfectly.

37:52.760 --> 37:55.440
So it's pretty exciting.

37:55.440 --> 37:59.320
There's other things that I really appreciate in here, and I hope I'm not going too far

37:59.320 --> 38:03.000
off in the weeds, but having managed these systems for like a decade, there's like a

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
couple-

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
It's pretty important to day-to-day operations.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.540
There's just like a few little things too that have bugged me for so long.

38:08.540 --> 38:13.120
Per scene transition overrides, which allow you to select a specific transition to use

38:13.120 --> 38:15.680
for a specific scene.

38:15.680 --> 38:19.280
Sometimes I want a slow fade, sometimes I want a hard cut.

38:19.280 --> 38:23.200
That sounds like a small thing, but when I want it, I really want it and I want it how

38:23.200 --> 38:25.240
I want it because it's really important.

38:25.240 --> 38:29.080
If I'm transitioning to like our standby screen, I like a nice slow fade out.

38:29.080 --> 38:33.360
If I'm transitioning from this to our chat room, I want a quicker fade, and it actually

38:33.360 --> 38:34.600
kind of bothers me right now.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.800
I can't quite get what I want.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.160
It's not quite there.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.640
It's driven me crazy, and they're fixing that.

38:40.640 --> 38:45.800
They've also bumped up the developer documentation, made some fixes for those of you that are

38:45.800 --> 38:48.760
stuck on Windows and Mac OS, like now they're using a dark theme.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.680
I didn't realize that Mac and Windows users didn't have a dark theme because if we're

38:52.680 --> 38:57.840
using a GTK, everything's dark and we have everything set to dark on our GNOME desktop,

38:57.840 --> 38:58.840
so it's always been dark.

38:58.840 --> 38:59.840
Oh, no, no.

38:59.840 --> 39:00.840
They already had a dark theme.

39:00.840 --> 39:03.540
They just added a new theme in addition to that one.

39:03.540 --> 39:04.920
And now it's default, right?

39:04.920 --> 39:09.160
And they've also changed the default too, which I just didn't realize that OBS had themes

39:09.160 --> 39:12.840
because it's always just matched whatever my GTK theme is.

39:12.840 --> 39:18.160
There's also one small like little audio bug fix for audio monitoring on Linux and some

39:18.160 --> 39:23.000
fixes for AMD users with AMD GPUs.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
Go ahead.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Oh, just one last thing.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
They've reduced that.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.720
I was telling you about the preview pane, the 8 preview pane.

39:27.720 --> 39:31.160
They've reduced the CPU usage by about 8% on that, which is pretty significant.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.920
Anyways, Barret, go ahead.

39:32.920 --> 39:37.400
I think you're actually going to love the new audio meters.

39:37.400 --> 39:42.600
This is probably the best implementation of an audio meter I've seen in any program ever.

39:42.600 --> 39:46.880
Yeah, it is nice, and they have different options for like monitoring the peaks and

39:46.880 --> 39:47.880
keeping track of them.

39:47.880 --> 39:48.880
Yes.

39:48.880 --> 39:52.320
And I would say that's an area where they've been particularly weak in the past.

39:52.320 --> 39:56.360
I'm going to talk about it on User Air 43.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.840
So tune into this week's User Air that will come out later in this week.

39:58.840 --> 40:02.760
I have a new podcast studio I'm building, and it's going to be tighter, and it's going

40:02.760 --> 40:05.020
to be more confined than ever.

40:05.020 --> 40:09.680
And so the fact that OBS is doing more might make it a good candidate for that setup, and

40:09.680 --> 40:12.500
I'll talk about that in the near future.

40:12.500 --> 40:15.160
But that's a good batch of open source updates this week.

40:15.160 --> 40:21.760
A really solid launcher, a great update on OBS, the Mate desktop is getting better than

40:21.760 --> 40:22.760
ever.

40:22.760 --> 40:26.280
Wimpy, are you up for talking a little more about some of the things in Mate, some of

40:26.280 --> 40:27.280
the other things we talked about?

40:27.280 --> 40:28.280
Yep.

40:28.280 --> 40:29.280
Can do that.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.280
All right.

40:30.280 --> 40:31.280
Hold on to that.

40:31.280 --> 40:32.280
We'll do that soon.

40:32.280 --> 40:38.040
There's some other really good stuff coming, as well as 20 years of LWN and why I really

40:38.040 --> 40:40.460
believe they're doing journalism right.

40:40.460 --> 40:43.160
And then we got to talk about that application problem.

40:43.160 --> 40:44.160
Everything's Electron.

40:44.160 --> 40:47.320
It's all Electron these days, and we've talked about that before.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.520
But there's another shift.

40:48.520 --> 40:53.840
And darn if Joey over at OMG Ubuntu didn't just put it into perfect terms.

40:53.840 --> 40:55.320
So we'll talk about that as well.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.320
Lots more to come up.

40:56.320 --> 40:59.720
So let's take a moment and thank DigitalOcean for sponsoring this week's episode of the

40:59.720 --> 41:00.720
Unplugged program.

41:00.720 --> 41:06.200
Go to DigitalOcean, create an account, start up, and then use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

41:06.200 --> 41:10.480
Deploy entire application stacks or just machines in less than 55 seconds.

41:10.480 --> 41:11.880
Everything is SSD-based.

41:11.880 --> 41:15.360
If you're doing something that's $5 a month all the way up to the systems that have hundreds

41:15.360 --> 41:20.840
of gigs of RAM and lots of CPU and tons of transfer, they're all secure and reliable.

41:20.840 --> 41:26.760
They have built-in, baked-in monitoring and metrics right into the system.

41:26.760 --> 41:28.720
They've got load balancing as a service.

41:28.720 --> 41:32.760
And then you'll also notice, and sometimes it's not even self-evident, but you'll also

41:32.760 --> 41:34.240
notice like firewall features.

41:34.240 --> 41:38.880
Oh, that seems like a good idea, except for their DigitalOcean firewalls, their quote-unquote

41:38.880 --> 41:40.200
cloud firewalls.

41:40.200 --> 41:41.700
What makes it a cloud firewall?

41:41.700 --> 41:43.480
You don't have to touch IP tables.

41:43.480 --> 41:44.760
It's at the network level, too.

41:44.760 --> 41:45.760
Yeah, also that part.

41:45.760 --> 41:46.760
Both of those things.

41:46.760 --> 41:48.760
That's not what I'm excited about.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.340
No kidding, right?

41:50.340 --> 41:53.280
There's two different things there that are really great.

41:53.280 --> 41:55.160
They're both true.

41:55.160 --> 41:58.000
They set it up at the network level so it never even hits the machine.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
That's the number one thing I like.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.700
And the number two thing is you don't got to screw around with IP tables.

42:02.700 --> 42:05.720
You can deploy an entire stack or just the base system.

42:05.720 --> 42:09.840
We were just recently playing around with a new way to do VoIP communications where

42:09.840 --> 42:13.640
you have this one central server that sort of proxies the connection.

42:13.640 --> 42:17.280
And once the connections are set up, it's a WebRTC direct point-to-point.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.160
I didn't need a very fast server.

42:19.160 --> 42:25.240
So in about a minute, I spun up the $5 a month droplet, which with their new pricing is better

42:25.240 --> 42:26.400
than ever.

42:26.400 --> 42:29.360
And if you use our promo code, you could try it out two months for free.

42:29.360 --> 42:32.960
I was able to try it out, see if this thing worked right, and then I destroyed the droplet

42:32.960 --> 42:34.300
10 minutes later.

42:34.300 --> 42:38.600
This kind of flexible aspect of DigitalOcean means that sometimes I use a machine for half

42:38.600 --> 42:42.920
a day, and sometimes a machine has been in production for four years.

42:42.920 --> 42:48.240
My oldest box is an Arch machine on DigitalOcean that's over four years old, and I still use

42:48.240 --> 42:49.320
it to this day.

42:49.320 --> 42:53.240
They have great reliability, great performance, and great pricing.

42:53.240 --> 42:58.760
Go to DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, get started, create your account,

42:58.760 --> 43:00.000
and see what's possible.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.920
And then when you're ready to go to the next level, they have fantastic documentation,

43:02.920 --> 43:09.880
a straightforward API, and lots of open source code built around the DigitalOcean infrastructure.

43:09.880 --> 43:13.480
DigitalOcean.com, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the show, and thanks to you

43:13.480 --> 43:17.120
guys for continuing to use that promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

43:17.120 --> 43:23.800
It keeps this show going, and by goodness, we may just make it to episode 250, and maybe

43:23.800 --> 43:27.200
even 300, because you guys keep supporting our sponsors.

43:27.200 --> 43:31.360
DigitalOcean.com, promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

43:31.360 --> 43:36.780
You know, Wimpy, I was looking back at the Linux Unplugged Archive, and if you fast forward

43:36.780 --> 43:41.680
just a couple of weeks, it was almost a year ago that you and I were talking about you

43:41.680 --> 43:48.160
loading up Ubuntu Mate on your XPS 15 and getting high DPI support.

43:48.160 --> 43:51.800
In fact, I even found the post that I used during the show to show on the live stream

43:51.800 --> 43:53.800
while you and I were talking about this.

43:53.800 --> 43:58.600
So the fact that today you and I were having a conversation where even more is happening

43:58.600 --> 44:03.800
really shows how you've been like a dog with a bone on this particular issue.

44:03.800 --> 44:12.520
Yes, although I have little credit to claim in this story, but the news is today we've

44:12.520 --> 44:20.560
landed the last of the patches to fully implement high DPI support in the Maltay desktop.

44:20.560 --> 44:21.560
And yeah, I've been-

44:21.560 --> 44:22.560
Thank you, God.

44:22.560 --> 44:30.360
I'm sorry to interrupt you, Wimpy, but I have been trying like crazy to get Maltay working

44:30.360 --> 44:32.800
on a Macbook 15 inch from 2013.

44:32.800 --> 44:38.240
It is a high DPI display as well, and I swear I am so thankful for you guys to do that because

44:38.240 --> 44:45.400
I got to tell you, I have been wanting to try out Mate on my Mac, and I got to be honest,

44:45.400 --> 44:48.480
OS X is just killing me to the core.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.940
With the DPI support, yeah.

44:49.940 --> 44:50.940
It's just way better.

44:50.940 --> 44:56.600
I mean, every desktop I've tried, XFC, Stock Gnome, everything, it was just a freaking

44:56.600 --> 44:57.600
nightmare.

44:57.600 --> 45:02.400
Maltay got close, and I tried it on a few, and it definitely was usable, but it felt

45:02.400 --> 45:04.000
like there was a pretty big gap.

45:04.000 --> 45:11.480
Yes, the screen size, yeah, because I tell you, the Mac has a beautiful right now display,

45:11.480 --> 45:17.560
but Mac OS is just going to be a pitter because I hate it, and I have wanted to just dump

45:17.560 --> 45:22.920
this thing for months, but I couldn't find the right desktop to do it for Linux, and

45:22.920 --> 45:30.080
I love Mate, I love Gnome 2's interface, but Maltay being more modern, and I would love

45:30.080 --> 45:34.620
to run Mate on a Mac, but hopefully this will fix that niche.

45:34.620 --> 45:36.960
So what's going on, Moby?

45:36.960 --> 45:43.200
So the changes that have landed are to really smooth those rough edges that you would have

45:43.200 --> 45:44.200
seen.

45:44.200 --> 45:50.560
I put some patches in about four or five months ago that kind of helped make it work a little

45:50.560 --> 45:54.800
bit better, but frankly, it wasn't finished.

45:54.800 --> 46:00.200
But there's a guy in the community, Victor, his name is, we found him through Solus.

46:00.200 --> 46:06.920
He actually did the work on the super key and modify key capabilities in Maltay and

46:06.920 --> 46:11.640
Brisk and a bunch of other places that made all of that super key and HUD stuff work,

46:11.640 --> 46:14.900
you know, that you can use those keys as actions now.

46:14.900 --> 46:19.160
And I approached him a little while ago and said, did he fancy, you know, tackling the

46:19.160 --> 46:22.440
last of the issues with high DPI?

46:22.440 --> 46:30.600
And he dumped a load of patches last night, and I've been testing them this evening, and

46:30.600 --> 46:34.920
we are dangerously, dangerously close now to having a really good implementation of

46:34.920 --> 46:35.920
high DPI.

46:35.920 --> 46:41.960
So now that, so that I fully understand, I mean, what was missing from the high DPI support

46:41.960 --> 46:43.760
as it stands now?

46:43.760 --> 46:49.120
So previously, for example, the panel, you know, the little panels at the top and the

46:49.120 --> 46:53.840
side, I got those so they actually fitted to the screen, but we were having to force

46:53.840 --> 46:59.640
those to use one to one scaling to actually appear on the screen in the right place, which

46:59.640 --> 47:04.120
meant that they appeared in the right place and the things that were in them were rendered

47:04.120 --> 47:10.800
correctly, but if you right clicked on the context menus, they were all absolutely minuscule.

47:10.800 --> 47:14.760
And the same was true for the window manager, and a bunch of other places where things just

47:14.760 --> 47:16.400
weren't right.

47:16.400 --> 47:22.800
And things like when you sized the panels, when you change the size, before that was

47:22.800 --> 47:26.980
literally happening one pixel at a time, and although you're going up in increments that

47:26.980 --> 47:32.800
look like you're adjusting it to 23, 24, 25 pixels behind the scenes, maths is happening,

47:32.800 --> 47:36.720
and it's actually adjusting that scale for the high DPI screen.

47:36.720 --> 47:42.200
So the big changes is that before you used to have to go and configure a bunch of different

47:42.200 --> 47:47.920
things in about seven different places in order to enable this, and it wasn't quite

47:47.920 --> 47:48.920
right.

47:48.920 --> 47:54.500
Now, there's a single option, it's in Marte tweak, it's under high DPI, enable high DPI,

47:54.500 --> 48:01.160
you tick that box, you log out, log in, and everything is then high DPI enabled.

48:01.160 --> 48:04.760
Well shoot, that is a big improvement.

48:04.760 --> 48:05.880
It sure is.

48:05.880 --> 48:09.200
That's no small thing there.

48:09.200 --> 48:12.080
What does it look like from a user standpoint?

48:12.080 --> 48:15.280
What am I going to do now to get this?

48:15.280 --> 48:23.780
Well from Ubuntu Marte's point of view, this is going to be in 1804, and I'm hoping we

48:23.780 --> 48:29.400
may be able to squeeze a preview in for Alpha 2.

48:29.400 --> 48:33.960
There may be a couple of rough edges there, but it's very, very close now, but hopefully

48:33.960 --> 48:36.360
get that in for Alpha 2.

48:36.360 --> 48:44.480
For Marte itself, Marte desktop, we're very close to releasing Marte 1.20, and I'm trying

48:44.480 --> 48:51.400
to work as fast as possible in the evenings to test and figure out where the remaining

48:51.400 --> 48:57.520
issues are on this to try and land this in time for Marte 1.20, so that it's actually

48:57.520 --> 48:59.120
a feature of Marte 1.20.

48:59.120 --> 49:00.280
That would be wonderful.

49:00.280 --> 49:06.680
So I guess the part I'm still not totally clear on is, so if I go into Marte Tweak and

49:06.680 --> 49:14.680
I turn this on, am I at that same time also switching out from Marco?

49:14.680 --> 49:17.080
Is that not an issue as well with high DPI support?

49:17.080 --> 49:19.760
Right, so at the moment that is happening, yes.

49:19.760 --> 49:28.400
So at the moment when you enable high DPI, it also turns on Compiz as the window manager.

49:28.400 --> 49:33.960
So that's where we get the scaling of the window controls from, because we haven't actually

49:33.960 --> 49:35.680
done that work in Marco yet.

49:35.680 --> 49:36.680
But Compiz has.

49:36.680 --> 49:37.680
Compiz has done that work.

49:37.680 --> 49:39.660
But Compiz has done that for a long, long time.

49:39.660 --> 49:45.120
So we can cut some corners in Ubuntu Marte by utilizing Compiz, and that's a fair assumption

49:45.120 --> 49:51.360
because the set of people that have UHD displays and a computer not capable of running Compiz

49:51.360 --> 49:52.360
is zero.

49:52.360 --> 49:53.360
Yeah.

49:53.360 --> 49:54.360
No kidding.

49:54.360 --> 49:55.360
No kidding.

49:55.360 --> 49:59.400
It actually would be something I would almost want to turn on anyways if I was using it.

49:59.400 --> 50:03.640
So this is really, really close.

50:03.640 --> 50:07.480
But I know from our discussion, it seems like the piece that might still be missing is auto

50:07.480 --> 50:09.680
detection of the high DPI display.

50:09.680 --> 50:12.600
That's still a tougher nut to crack.

50:12.600 --> 50:14.880
It's not a tough nut to crack.

50:14.880 --> 50:21.200
It's just like choosing your battles, and we've decided to just get the thing working,

50:21.200 --> 50:27.220
and then we can revisit how that's handled in terms of dynamically detecting that you

50:27.220 --> 50:29.580
are on a high DPI display.

50:29.580 --> 50:30.840
It's halfway there.

50:30.840 --> 50:36.540
The Greta determines if you're on a high DPI display and auto scales.

50:36.540 --> 50:40.940
Then you log in, and you get an unscaled desktop, and you have to go and press a button.

50:40.940 --> 50:44.240
So it's not perfect, but it's way, way better than this.

50:44.240 --> 50:46.560
Can I ask you a crazy question?

50:46.560 --> 50:47.640
Sure.

50:47.640 --> 50:52.520
And this is probably the wrong place to do it, but what about as sort of a front and

50:52.520 --> 50:55.800
center option in the Amate welcome screen, where it says-

50:55.800 --> 50:56.800
Yeah.

50:56.800 --> 50:57.800
Absolutely.

50:57.800 --> 50:58.800
Yeah.

50:58.800 --> 50:59.800
You're already thinking that?

50:59.800 --> 51:00.800
Yeah, yeah.

51:00.800 --> 51:01.800
Yeah.

51:01.800 --> 51:08.480
I think we can do the detection in welcome very quickly, as in implement it very quickly,

51:08.480 --> 51:13.160
and detect that and actually present that as a, we see you've got a high resolution

51:13.160 --> 51:19.720
screen which you'd like to enable high DPI, and then have that flip switched automatically,

51:19.720 --> 51:22.680
and then they can log out, log back in, so it will smooth the edges.

51:22.680 --> 51:23.800
So that could be the route.

51:23.800 --> 51:26.160
That could be the route you end up taking.

51:26.160 --> 51:28.440
Yes, it's an option.

51:28.440 --> 51:32.280
The option to actually do this dynamically is still not off the table.

51:32.280 --> 51:34.180
It's all a matter of time.

51:34.180 --> 51:38.480
We've got to choose what we can do in the time remaining, and at the moment, there are

51:38.480 --> 51:42.600
some other little rough edges that are more important than one fix.

51:42.600 --> 51:48.840
You know, today on Marks PS15, I've been running Ubuntu Marte with scaling.

51:48.840 --> 51:56.120
I opened every shipped by default application widget and window, and everything is scaled,

51:56.120 --> 51:58.120
including things like Qt applications.

51:58.120 --> 52:03.200
So we're passing through all the necessary scaling information from our environment to

52:03.200 --> 52:04.400
the Qt application.

52:04.400 --> 52:10.360
So for example, VLC is all nicely scaled, which is a Qt application that we ship by

52:10.360 --> 52:11.360
default.

52:11.360 --> 52:15.280
And then you install Electron applications, and we push all that information through to

52:15.280 --> 52:16.280
Electron as well.

52:16.280 --> 52:17.720
So they're all scaled appropriately.

52:17.720 --> 52:18.720
Shoot.

52:18.720 --> 52:23.600
This is like full grown, all grown up, real high DPI support here.

52:23.600 --> 52:31.000
And those of you that are familiar with GNOME 2 or Marte will or may remember that in the

52:31.000 --> 52:33.680
appearance control panel, there was a fonts tab.

52:33.680 --> 52:39.300
And one of the things you could do in the fonts tab was change the DPI of the fonts.

52:39.300 --> 52:42.240
And that was like the OG, you know, high DPI option.

52:42.240 --> 52:45.200
You turn that up, yeah.

52:45.200 --> 52:48.360
So that was that was how it used to be in the good old battle days.

52:48.360 --> 52:53.480
Now, originally, I envisaged that we would just lose that feature and that we would do

52:53.480 --> 52:59.880
the font scaling, you know, bound to the integer scaling of the screen.

52:59.880 --> 53:01.920
But Victor has retained that.

53:01.920 --> 53:08.760
And this has a really nice side effect in that we're keeping the font scaling separated

53:08.760 --> 53:14.000
and it automatically adjusts the font scaling.

53:14.000 --> 53:20.960
And when that happens for GTK2 applications, which have no high DPI scaling support whatsoever,

53:20.960 --> 53:26.960
other than the font scaling, they get a font scale that is accurate to the screen.

53:26.960 --> 53:32.560
So while GTK2 applications aren't going to look great, by default, they look the best

53:32.560 --> 53:37.000
they can be on a high DPI display by bumping those fonts out to the right sizes.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Wow.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.440
Is any other desktop doing that?

53:40.440 --> 53:41.440
I don't know.

53:41.440 --> 53:45.840
I haven't looked that carefully because I don't know how many of them had or retained

53:45.840 --> 53:48.800
that feature to adjust the font DPI.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.760
That is great.

53:50.760 --> 53:54.680
It's going to be the premier GIMP workstation.

53:54.680 --> 53:58.680
You can get icon sets for GIMP, which are like oversized.

53:58.680 --> 54:02.360
And when they're on high DPI, it actually makes GIMP usable.

54:02.360 --> 54:11.360
This is so cool, Wimpy, and you know, it has to be mentioned that this was the butt of

54:11.360 --> 54:12.360
so many jokes.

54:12.360 --> 54:16.280
Oh, you're going to take that Gnome 2 thing, that old busted paradigm, which for those

54:16.280 --> 54:22.480
of us who loved it, like myself, was an insult because it was passing judgment on how I like

54:22.480 --> 54:24.060
to use computers.

54:24.060 --> 54:28.360
Somebody was telling me, a lot of somebodies were telling me, that the way I like to use

54:28.360 --> 54:33.660
computers was old, and it was part of a bygone era, and that the future was touch, the future

54:33.660 --> 54:39.120
was mobile, the future was a total redesign of the desktop paradigm.

54:39.120 --> 54:45.480
And then this crazy ass Mate project came along and forked GTK2-based Gnome 2 and was

54:45.480 --> 54:50.480
this total stick in the mud, not going to go anywhere desktop.

54:50.480 --> 54:51.480
Look at this.

54:51.480 --> 54:55.480
This is the butt of all jokes here of desktop Linux.

54:55.480 --> 55:00.620
And fast forward to frickin' 2018, and it sounds like one of the most complete high

55:00.620 --> 55:09.640
DPI implementations that, I mean, it's just, there's few other desktops, really.

55:09.640 --> 55:17.100
There's Gnome 3, the Pantheon desktop, even Plasma, well, yeah, I mean, as somebody who

55:17.100 --> 55:23.080
used the most current Plasma on a high DPI display, it takes two or three or four settings

55:23.080 --> 55:25.680
changes to get it accurate, to get it right.

55:25.680 --> 55:26.680
Oh, right, okay.

55:26.680 --> 55:27.680
Yeah.

55:27.680 --> 55:29.520
I wouldn't know, but that's interesting to hear.

55:29.520 --> 55:31.680
I think you're in the lead there.

55:31.680 --> 55:36.800
I mean, you're not elementary OS and maybe not Gnome 3, but you're pretty damn close

55:36.800 --> 55:37.800
now.

55:37.800 --> 55:41.160
And this is supposed to be the joke desktop, don't you know that?

55:41.160 --> 55:42.800
I had heard, yeah.

55:42.800 --> 55:49.520
I think this is probably something that the other desktop environment developers can learn

55:49.520 --> 55:50.520
from.

55:50.520 --> 55:51.520
Yeah.

55:51.520 --> 55:54.160
Real quick question though.

55:54.160 --> 55:55.160
Go ahead.

55:55.160 --> 56:02.200
So would this lead to any sort of feature toward a window management as in like having

56:02.200 --> 56:08.980
four, like a quadrant style windows in some way, shape or form?

56:08.980 --> 56:10.600
Interesting that you should ask that question.

56:10.600 --> 56:16.160
So one of the other features of Marco, the default window manager for Mate is that we've

56:16.160 --> 56:22.240
fully implemented quadrant and top and bottom panel tiling that has actually been there

56:22.240 --> 56:26.160
for a long, long time, but it was only activateable through key bindings.

56:26.160 --> 56:30.420
But now if you drag to the corners and the tops and the bottoms, it will snap to those

56:30.420 --> 56:35.840
locations and not just do side by side tiling now.

56:35.840 --> 56:36.840
So that's in.

56:36.840 --> 56:37.840
That's nice.

56:37.840 --> 56:38.840
That's nice.

56:38.840 --> 56:39.840
Yeah.

56:39.840 --> 56:41.920
And GLX acceleration for Marco.

56:41.920 --> 56:47.040
And I'm hoping there's another couple of patches for Kaja that make that a bit more interesting

56:47.040 --> 56:48.040
as well.

56:48.040 --> 56:49.040
Oh, how so?

56:49.040 --> 56:54.160
But, well, I'm looking at trying to land tracker support for Mate 120.

56:54.160 --> 56:55.160
For search?

56:55.160 --> 56:56.160
Yeah.

56:56.160 --> 56:57.160
Yeah.

56:57.160 --> 56:58.160
For desktop search.

56:58.160 --> 56:59.160
Yeah.

56:59.160 --> 57:00.160
Yeah.

57:00.160 --> 57:02.680
Because at the moment that's the old, old desktop search and it's slow.

57:02.680 --> 57:07.400
And there are the tracker implementation is much improved in recent years, so that's looking

57:07.400 --> 57:08.400
quite interesting.

57:08.400 --> 57:10.960
Is that what files, is that what files uses?

57:10.960 --> 57:11.960
Yes.

57:11.960 --> 57:12.960
It does.

57:12.960 --> 57:13.960
Yes.

57:13.960 --> 57:14.960
Okay.

57:14.960 --> 57:15.960
That's all.

57:15.960 --> 57:20.160
And then other changes that we've made in Ubuntu Mate just over the weekend is that

57:20.160 --> 57:23.240
indicators are now enabled by default in all layouts.

57:23.240 --> 57:25.240
So it's indicators all the way.

57:25.240 --> 57:26.240
That's awesome.

57:26.240 --> 57:27.240
Yeah.

57:27.240 --> 57:30.960
And that's, there's another project I'll speak about another day because I don't want to

57:30.960 --> 57:34.000
go on too long, that dovetails with that.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.920
And then the other change we've made in the traditional layout.

57:36.920 --> 57:42.540
So this is the OG GNOME 2 panel layout.

57:42.540 --> 57:47.160
One change we've made is if you remember, it's applications places system.

57:47.160 --> 57:54.840
It now reads menu places system and the menu is brisk menu with super key support, but

57:54.840 --> 57:57.400
retains the places and system piece that people like.

57:57.400 --> 58:04.160
So you still get that traditional UI, but you get the benefit of super key for those

58:04.160 --> 58:06.120
people that like to mash the super key.

58:06.120 --> 58:10.720
Boy, you are making my life so much harder, you bastard right now.

58:10.720 --> 58:12.640
I can't even with this.

58:12.640 --> 58:15.840
The Mate desktop is so appealing.

58:15.840 --> 58:20.800
When I went through this whole rash of switching from Arch to Ubuntu, I went Unity on almost

58:20.800 --> 58:21.800
all of the things.

58:21.800 --> 58:23.400
You were the Unity guy.

58:23.400 --> 58:28.080
Except for two computers, my workstation in my office upstairs and the machines that I,

58:28.080 --> 58:30.840
actually it's three because one's a VPS, that I asked to go into.

58:30.840 --> 58:31.840
That doesn't count.

58:31.840 --> 58:32.840
No.

58:32.840 --> 58:39.360
But out of all of them now, here we are several months into it, they have been my go-to workstations.

58:39.360 --> 58:41.760
They have been so solid wimpy.

58:41.760 --> 58:47.200
I am such a fan of the project having, I'm almost what, five months, four months into

58:47.200 --> 58:48.200
using them.

58:48.200 --> 58:49.720
It's just been so great.

58:49.720 --> 58:55.600
So huge, huge thank you specifically for Ubuntu Mate because that's what I'm using.

58:55.600 --> 58:59.440
But the great thing is, I mean, has there been anything we've discussed that isn't available

58:59.440 --> 59:02.920
upstream to the Mate project itself for all distros?

59:02.920 --> 59:05.640
No, everything's upstream.

59:05.640 --> 59:12.200
It's down to the different distro maintainers as to how they want to implement Mate itself.

59:12.200 --> 59:19.520
The one conversation that we've had today is that we've landed the turn on high DPI

59:19.520 --> 59:28.280
in Mate tweak, which although is cross desktop, but cross distro, it sits in the Ubuntu Mate

59:28.280 --> 59:30.400
hub organization.

59:30.400 --> 59:36.120
So we've been talking about moving that to the Mate project and actually making it a

59:36.120 --> 59:42.640
full Mate thing because that's now got a feature that other distro maintainers will likely

59:42.640 --> 59:43.640
want.

59:43.640 --> 59:46.520
But Mate tweak is used quite widely now anyway.

59:46.520 --> 59:54.640
I'm just struck by the fact that before 1804 has arrived, before the big Ubuntu Mate LTS

59:54.640 --> 01:00:01.160
has arrived, even with the Ubuntu Mate 1710 release, you've managed to take what was the

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:08.000
butt of a joke and turn it into a desktop that is one of my favorites.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.560
And with these improvements, it just sounds like it's going to be even freaking better.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.960
Yeah, high DPI support, desktop icons.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.160
It's you and a lot of folks.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:21.200
I mean, I don't want to discount the work, but I know that there's a driving force behind

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.440
a lot of this and that driving force is you.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.440
Yeah, there is.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:30.680
And for a lot of this, I'm a mouthpiece, you know, the Mate team, I play a relatively small

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.680
part in.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:36.680
I turn up and do this sort of thing from time to time and I test bugs and triage bugs and

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.680
raise bugs.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:43.000
I have little coding time for Mate itself because what coding time I have, I put into

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.920
Ubuntu Mate and the Ubuntu Mate specific things.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:53.160
But there is a small group of people who are very dedicated working on Mate and you just

01:00:53.160 --> 01:01:00.200
have to look at the GitHub churn, you know, it's quite the commit rate, you know, it moves

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.200
every day.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.200
It's not slow moving.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.640
It's a fast, fast moving project.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:10.160
And Ubuntu Mate, I made it for other people and I was maintaining it for other people

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:14.800
and I was using it because I felt I needed to because that's how I would see what the

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.280
rough edges were to improve it for others.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:23.560
But with Ubuntu Mate 17.10, so after three years of making this thing, I finally had

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:29.880
a desktop environment that I was really proud of and was happy to use, really happy to use

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.120
on a day to day basis.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.520
And with 18.04, I feel that even more.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.840
I actually feel like, you know, I've made something here that I'm really proud of and

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.020
I'm happy to use.

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:44.400
And those two features we've talked about today, the Dash menu in Brisk and this work

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:51.440
on high DPI, both of those projects were funded through the generous support that we get through

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.180
our Patreon.

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:58.960
So you know, big thanks to everyone who's supporting Ubuntu Mate on the Patreon because

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:03.960
you've supported that development that happened in the Solus project on Brisk and this upstream

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:06.320
development in the Mate desktop.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.960
And all of these distros get to benefit from that.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.200
So well done you for supporting the project, everyone.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:16.320
And it's been fascinating, it's just been it's been a lot of fun, really, to watch the

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:22.880
development of this patreon.com slash Ubuntu underscore Mate if you want to get in on the

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.880
action.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.520
Boy, I I don't know how I'm going to contain myself.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.120
It's almost too many good options.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.980
You know, I've got so I've got Unity seven, of course, the did rocks is pulling me back

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:33.980
to gnome three.

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:37.480
Like there's some weird draw I have to going back to gnome.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.960
There's something about gnome.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.960
It pulls me back.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.560
KDE, KDE plasma is doing great stuff.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:47.200
Yeah, I hear rumors coming out of another flavor in Ubuntu that there's some interesting

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.360
stuff going on there as well.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:54.360
So I think this year is going to be a it's good, a good year for the Linux desktop in

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:55.840
terms of the desktop environments.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:03.360
Yeah, I've got a 2013 MacBook Pro running arch Linux that has the plasma 512 desktop.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.500
And it was one of those things where I was really putting off the updates.

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.880
We talked about this recently.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.640
I brought that whole damn machine.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.320
I mean, it could have been as much as I hate to say it.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:18.840
I hate to say it four or five months behind, which is a bad move on arch.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.840
That is a bad move.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.320
But I've been on the my fi, you know, and I was just convinced after a couple of months

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:27.660
that plasma desktop would break like a bitch after I tried to update it.

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:32.160
And I sat down, I got through all of my GPG key errors.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:37.120
I got through all of these little esoteric like package conflicts problems that just

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.280
took like a little bit of time to work through.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:40.280
Command here.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.280
Command there.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.280
Yeah.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:46.360
And I finally got every damn package on that MacBook that you set up live on the show.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.360
Right.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.360
Updated.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:52.760
And I was convinced after the reboot plasma wouldn't log in, because that was my experience

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:53.760
in the good old days.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.160
Oh, yeah, I know that feeling.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:01.560
And sure enough, I rebooted, logged back in and my desktop, the plasma desktop was exactly

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.640
exactly where I left it and performing better than ever.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.640
Just snappy as hell.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.080
Just clearly faster than Mac OS on the same hardware.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.080
So it is a good year.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.900
You got you got you got the you got folks that are doing a unity remix.

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:18.960
Gnome three's got more attention than it's ever had in its entire existence.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.640
More hands on the code, more eyes on the code, more companies working with the code than

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.800
have ever, ever been.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:29.880
And and the plasma desktop, the five series is in a super stable position.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.600
They're about to release their next LTS.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.200
They've really matured the project.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.960
So that's in a really good spot.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:40.640
And then Mahatay is bringing in like these killer features for high DPI and the new launcher

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.700
is just got all kinds of options.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:43.700
It's too damn much.

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:44.700
Yeah, it is.

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.820
So we just need a few applications.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:50.040
That's what that's really what it takes is we just need a few more good apps.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:56.680
Before we go there, though, I just want to say Happy Birthday to lwn.net 20 years of

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.600
of service from lwn.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:04.040
And and Jonathan Covert writes over here, he says over the following years, we've borne

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.280
witness to a long series of events that none of us could really have predicted.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:14.160
Linux got caught up in the dot com boom and with the VA systems IPO came to epitomize

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.620
its success.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:18.960
But when that went boom, Linux was still there stronger than ever.

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.160
The SCO group tried to steal our community and work it and turn it into its own rent

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.800
generating machine.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.560
In the process of fending them off, it was made clear that the Linux kernel had one of

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.760
the cleanest code bases around companies discovered a little hobbyist system and invested billions

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.960
into it, massively accelerating the development at all levels of the system.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:42.940
We learned how to scale development communities from dozens of developers to many thousands

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.660
of developers.

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:48.520
The security environment, which was initially defending against script kiddies playing their

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:55.200
own form of capture the flag became a fight against spammers, organized criminals and nation

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:58.560
states with vast resources.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:03.040
Google bought an obscure phone operating system called Android and used it to dominate the

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.040
phone market.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:08.560
And as a result, we got mobile devices that are far more open than they would have otherwise

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.560
been.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:13.360
Linux became a base software supporting the bulk of the internet economy.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:18.360
Some of our biggest contributors do not distribute Linux at all, but they use it internally,

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.600
want to help and they want to make it better.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.920
It's been quite a ride.

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:28.380
We in the free software community set out to change the world and we exceeded and succeeded

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:29.920
beyond our wildest expectations.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:35.360
And that's in the last 20 years and you know, JB has been there for half of that ride and

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.160
a lot of that we've seen ourselves.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:44.040
And so here I am like 11, 12 years into covering this area and I look at Jonathan, I think

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.340
20 years.

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.280
That's truly impressive.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.160
So congratulations to him.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.040
And I've been a subscriber for many, many years.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:58.440
In fact, even about two months ago, I ran into a bug on his website and he unsubscribed

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.600
me even though I was only a couple of months in and I had to resubscribe.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:08.680
So I paid him twice this year for my LWN subscription and it was money well spent because it's real

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.840
good journalism, you know, without the spin, without the hype.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:17.600
You look at this whole gnome desktop icons issue and that's the result of advertising

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:24.960
based media where they have to get a certain amount of clicks for those images on their

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.380
website in order to justify paying that writer.

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:33.000
And so they run these articles that say gnomes development team is arrogant, removes all

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
icons.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.320
Really incentivizes the drama that you try to put into your stories even when it's not

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.320
really there.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.320
Yeah.

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:44.080
And so it also serves to divide the community as well because you then get tribes building

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.580
up on those that are going to defend gnome on this decision and those that are going

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:52.760
to rally behind the, you know, what they feel is a bad decision.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:57.160
So this kind of journalism is, is self-serving for the publications themselves because it

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:01.800
doesn't do our communities any good whatsoever because it just creates conflict and it's,

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.840
it's one of my pet peeves and I hate it.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:10.800
Wimpy, if you and I had 12 hours for a podcast, we could not get half of why this is bad in

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.800
that show.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.800
Yeah.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.880
But in brief, the Linux community isn't like the Mac community or in the Windows community.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:25.000
It is, we, we are, we are much more exposed and so when the discussions, when the discussion

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:32.120
is set low, when you have, when you have clickbait YouTubers and clickbait bloggers that, that

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:37.100
just want to get clicks and so they start the, they start the discussion at the lowest

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:38.600
common denominator.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:44.360
They start the discussion in the mud and so that's, so that creates the spectrum of conversation

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.800
and then you have people on the other side and you have people in the middle and it just

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:52.680
turns out into a full-on turf war and it's just simply because of the way the advertising

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:58.240
model works and it's one of those things that I think I say maybe 200 times out of 233 episodes,

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.880
I think I've maybe mentioned this in 200 episodes.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:05.920
But if you're not in the business and I, and I'm not like, I mean I'm just barely in the

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:10.480
business but even if you just get a peek, if you just see behind the curtain for 15

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:16.400
seconds, you realize what's going on here and how it directly damages an open community.

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:20.480
When you have a bunch of employees behind a closed door at Apple that are doing what

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:25.120
Phil Schiller tells them to do or they're doing what Craig Federighi comes up with or

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:29.880
they're doing what Johnny Ive tells them to do, it doesn't matter what some jackass on

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.560
Hacker News or on Reddit says.

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.440
They can say whatever they want all day long, Johnny Ive told them what to do.

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:41.760
But when a person is volunteering their personal time, maybe even at the exclusion of time

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:46.920
with their friends and family to work on an open source project, that stupid thing that

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:51.540
somebody says on Reddit has 10 times the impact on an open source developer.

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:56.400
Or that stupid thing that somebody said on YouTube that they made a video about can completely

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.320
derail a project.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:05.040
And there's people in this community at all of the major companies that you know of.

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:09.560
If I say to you, listen or think of an open source company, I've probably had conversations

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:14.080
with people at that company that are no longer working on projects simply because they can't

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.940
take community reaction anymore.

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:19.480
And you name a major open source company, and I've had a conversation with somebody

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.700
from there about it.

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.580
It really makes a difference.

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:25.160
It's something I hear about all of the time.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:32.540
And I can't really underscore how much of a difference that outlets like LWN can make

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:33.540
in this.

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:43.680
That's why I am a subscriber because the focus for LWN.net is not pissing off their subscribers.

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:48.360
Not how many clicks can I get so that way I can go get the new HelloFresh advertising

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.360
contract.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.440
Can I make the people that are paying me on a monthly basis happy?

01:10:53.440 --> 01:11:00.680
There's what I think LWN has been so dependable for me for how many years that it is just

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:06.360
indispensable, included with its built-in comments section below, forum style, even

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.360
though it's a new site.

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.920
It is beautiful.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:10.920
Yeah.

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:16.840
And it kind of makes me wish that Patreon didn't get oversaturated because I also think

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:21.320
that the things that make LWN great are the same kind of things that could make an open

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.320
source project great.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.520
If an open source project is held responsible to its primary patrons, then it's not going

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.040
after the trend of the week.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:31.840
If a podcast network is held after its primary patrons, then you're not worried about them

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.920
trying to just build up enough clickbaity content so that way they can get yet another

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.120
sponsor.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:45.040
And it just is a shame that every Tom, Dick, and Harry that lives in a van or makes a song

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:51.560
or writes a video game has gone to Patreon because it's saturated the market and it's

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:57.160
lowered the value in the audience's mind of sponsoring people on Patreon.

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.960
But the reality is it's all about the money.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.560
You've got to follow the money.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:06.720
It's like why Wes' really good buddy, his long-term friend, Tobey Maguire, always says,

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:07.720
show me the money.

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.880
Show me the money.

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.080
You follow the money.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:16.480
And that's why I think LWN, after 20 years, is looked at as one of the most reliable news

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.480
sources.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:22.400
And the only evidence you need of that is look at all of the coverage for Meltdown Inspector,

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.400
right?

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.400
Absolutely.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.920
You and I know this because we pored through all of it for TechSnap.

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:31.320
There's a lot of the people that really matter in this discussion, the people that really

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:37.840
know what the hell's going on, are constantly referring to LWN as LWN was on top of this

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:38.840
for months.

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.880
LWN was following this when it was rumors.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.440
LWN was accurately, technically covering this the entire time.

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:48.520
I hope 20 years from now people will say the same damn thing about Jupiter Broadcasting.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.240
And I say, good job, Jonathan.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.240
Keep at it.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.300
And I'm going to be a subscriber.

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.080
I'm going to continue to be a subscriber here.

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:57.440
All right, just one more thing to get to before we're all done this week.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.540
It's exciting.

01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.720
It's important.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.480
And it's a great piece that was written by Joey.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:05.540
So let's mention Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:10.100
That's where Wes goes, and I go, to learn more about Linux as a full-featured training

01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:14.680
library with everything you need to learn new skills and advance your career.

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:17.160
Now, that's easy to say.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.800
But the actual implementation makes all of the difference.

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:21.680
It's not just one of the things they do.

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:24.280
It's all of the things.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:28.680
All of the things they do is Linux, linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:33.120
Go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:37.400
Self-paced, in-depth video courses on every Linux, cloud, and DevOps topic, hands-on scenario-based

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.700
labs to give you real experience.

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:43.760
And they got human beings that can help you whenever you need actual real help.

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:48.840
Whether you're an experienced sysadmin or new to the world of Linux, Azure, and AWS,

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.960
in stack and DevOps, a sharp skillset is an absolute necessity to succeed.

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:59.960
Meet Linux Academy, an online Linux and cloud training platform that uses self-paced video

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:06.100
courses and hands-on labs to give you real-world experience for a wide range of skills.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:10.680
Train for your certification, learn the latest DevOps tools, and grow your skillset to do

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.800
better work.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:14.660
Linux Academy is not just a video library.

01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:19.540
Our scenario-based server labs and quiz system allow you to learn hands-on.

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:24.960
We also have full-time human instructors who answer questions and help you earn that certification

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.600
or promotion at work.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.640
We add new training every week, so you'll always be up to date on the latest tech.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:36.320
Sysadmins of every experience level use Linux Academy to stay on the bleeding edge of the

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.880
Linux ecosystem.

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:42.080
You should too.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:47.720
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, I think it's just a combination of their sole focus,

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:52.800
the continual improvements, the full-time human beings, and the community that's stacked

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.280
full of Jupyter broadcasting members.

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.280
That doesn't hurt.

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:59.760
Yeah, it's a resource like no other, and that's why it's a perfect fit right here on this

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:00.960
show.

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.400
Linux is one of those platforms.

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:05.600
If you're coming from Windows and you're getting into Linux, one of the things you quickly

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:10.840
realize is, really, you can do anything with Linux, you just need to know how.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.000
And sometimes you got to bend it in certain ways, sometimes you have to know certain incantations,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.880
and Linux Academy is a library full of all of that.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:21.760
And now with public profiles, so that way the new job you're trying to get, the new

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.320
client or your current employer can see exactly all of the awesome work you've got done.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.920
Yeah, you can show off all that hard work.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.840
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.960
I don't know if everyone in the audience got a chance to see this piece by Joey, but he

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:37.960
nailed it.

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:43.000
I'm a big fan of Joey's work just because I know how hard he hustles.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
He really is.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
He really does.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.400
He's a hard worker, and he has had the opportunity to sit back and sort of showcase all of the

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.760
good stuff that comes to the Ubuntu desktop, which generally, if somebody writes a Linux

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:56.720
app, they tend to write it for Ubuntu.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.720
Yep.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.720
It's over there, and he's talked about it.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.300
Yeah, he's known about it.

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:04.160
And he says, well, what the hell is going on?

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.160
You like that?

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.160
You hear that?

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.200
That's me getting into it.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.480
That's me getting into position here to talk about this.

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.200
That's how I can tell you're excited.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:16.000
And Joey says some stuff here that I just completely agree with.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.680
He says, once upon a time, I was writing about yet another music player, and it was almost

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.680
meme-like.

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:25.160
It was such a weekly occurrence.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:29.400
And just that first sentence right there resonated with me.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:36.060
When we launched the Linux Action Show Picks, it was a conversation that went something

01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.960
like this.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:43.560
There's so many apps that we're not getting to that we need to just stop waiting to review

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:46.680
each one of them and just talk about them.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.800
Because there's too many apps, and we've got to just talk about them.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:55.200
And so we carved out an app pick segment that we ran every single week at the top of the

01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:01.480
show that was yet another application for the Linux desktop.

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:04.600
And we started that segment because there was an abundance of apps.

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.680
It was easy pickings, right?

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.760
You had a whole bunch to choose from.

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:15.080
By the end of the Linux Action Show, that was one of the most brutal segments.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:24.800
It was a matter of just scavenging and going to producers and Beard and yourself.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:30.320
It just meant just digging and digging for something new that wasn't a web application

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:33.000
and that wasn't Electron.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.560
And then it meant installing it and trying it.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:38.920
It became one of the most tedious parts of the show.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.780
And now here in this show, we just throw them in there.

01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:42.160
We had a couple of great ones.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.120
Because they come in spurts now.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.500
But it's not every single damn week anymore.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.800
And I think Joey's noticed that too.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:52.680
He says, same goes for video players, download managers, instant messengers, torrent apps,

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:58.120
image editors, Twitter apps, image viewers, text editors, photo uploaders, you name it.

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:02.360
I probably wrote about it, and it seemed like for a long while, app developers were out

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:07.080
there in mass creating quality apps to satisfy a full gamut of end user needs.

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:13.500
These days, though, availability of new native Linux apps which cater to users of the most

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:20.520
popular distributions seem few and far between.

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.360
We do have a lot of Electron apps.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.360
Go ahead.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.920
There's no winning here.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:31.240
So when I look at these Electron apps, it's a sensible cost efficiency thing.

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:34.320
Also, the people developing have changed.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:41.080
I think a lot of people that used to develop for the Linux's used to be people doing it

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:42.080
for a hobby.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.560
That's why so many, yet another video player is usually you want to start with something

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.160
you can look at the reference of implementation.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.160
Yeah.

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.160
You were doing it because you wanted to.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.160
Yes.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.080
And a lot of people then learned the brutal way that you can't make money if you're not

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:59.120
doing like a business, market research on what you're building, if you're just building

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:02.480
something that you have a lot of competition in.

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:09.320
And nowadays, the people writing apps have two other categories, which I think is the

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.320
primary focus.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.320
Right.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:15.180
So if you're developing an app for Ubuntu, you know that there's some commercial backing.

01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:20.480
So the system and the platform that you're building and targeting is not just shifting

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:21.480
out random.

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:27.480
You can reach somebody to know what they're going for and that gives you stability, but

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:32.800
also means that a lot of the apps is not consumer or front user facing, but rather actually

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.680
enterprise facing.

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:40.320
And that's the part that is harder to see on the repository, but it exists actually

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:41.320
in higher quantity.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:46.800
Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many ports of developer tools, even from, you know, proprietary

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.360
building software companies.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.360
Okay.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:50.360
Fair enough.

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:59.000
So I'm picking up what you're putting down, but I think I kind of disagree in some ways.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:05.040
I can't really fully disagree with you, Daredevil, but I mean, looking at this, I have to point

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:10.080
to our friends over at elementary OS, which have an abundance of native applications right

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.080
now.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:15.840
They just have a smattering, if you will, a buffet.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:22.160
I think the elementary OS has one thing that is what distinguishes them and makes it appealing

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:24.320
for developers, which is all right.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:28.960
A lot of people are good at developing, like developing code, but they're not designers

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:29.960
themselves.

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:37.000
Then having these semi-authoritarian view on how things should look like presents a

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
design.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.880
And if you're a developer and you don't really want to do design stuff, but you want to write

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:48.600
that cool app, well, you go with them because he just does the design for you.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.960
Don't you feel like you're underselling what they're doing?

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:54.920
I mean, aren't they really saying, here's a set of toolkits you can use so you have

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.360
consistent design.

01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:01.560
Here's a set of really good, easy to read, easy to understand, and oh, by the way, easy

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.960
to find documentation.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:06.040
Oh, and then you want to monetize that son of a bitch.

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:10.680
Well here's an app store with a payment system that's built around Stripe that you already

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:12.000
trust and know.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Sounds like iOS.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.640
I mean, it just seems like, yeah, you could say it's authoritarianism, you could say it's

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:22.240
a design vision, but to me it seems like just a practical path, there's a breadcrumb path

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:25.000
for developers to follow.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.120
That breadcrumb path has been there since day one.

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:31.760
But the thing that catered most of the developers that I've talked to that moved to elementary

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:36.720
to build their app is, hey, there's this guy, he's good in design, I wonder if he has input

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.320
on my app and I'll build this thing.

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.680
Because they're not designers, right?

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:45.680
They're just one like, I want to spend my time writing this new cool machine learning

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:50.160
technique and I want to implement that in the music store or whatever, right, in the

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.160
music player.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:52.200
How can I do that?

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:57.280
But then I don't have the outreach to users and everybody feels useful if they can help

01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:58.280
somebody.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.400
And that's the part that if you know users are going to find your application pretty,

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:04.760
they will use it even if it sucks for the beginning because it's pretty.

01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:08.200
And this is, I think, the strategy Apple has figured out.

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:12.040
If you have a pretty app, even if it sucks in the beginning, the user will put up with

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:14.400
it because it's not as unpleasant to be there.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:19.080
And if it's a productivity app, you probably don't mind using if it's ugly because you

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.440
know you'll get your shit done, essentially.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:21.440
Yeah.

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.440
Yeah.

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.840
And as long as they show that they eventually add more stuff and make it better, you're

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:28.720
more likely to say, okay, yeah, I'll live with this on the rough edges.

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:33.800
JJ, I know you had a comment about how perhaps Snaps and Flatpak could help even this whole

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:34.800
problem out.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:40.880
Well, maybe Snaps more or less because a lot more of the mainstream applications are coming

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:47.360
via Snaps, such as Spotify and other apps that seem to be more...

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.360
Yeah, Slack.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:54.560
You know, we should mention Slack is now being distributed as a Snap as of last week's episode.

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:55.560
That's huge.

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:56.560
Yeah.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:06.840
And so, and this being an ease of entry for bigger app creators to get into Linux, it

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:16.160
sort of makes the jump from going from Windows and OSX to making and also making this less

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:23.960
of a daunting task and having to develop for a lot of out of distributions rather than

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:30.200
and only focus on one form of that app and you don't have to be specific to a specific

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:31.560
subset of apps.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:40.120
I know most of the time that Linux developers usually initially do Debian application packages,

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.120
don't they?

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.520
Well, it depends on who they're trying to target.

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:44.520
I actually have a...

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.520
Before we go...

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.520
Okay, go ahead.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.880
And then I have a question for Wimpy about some technical limitations with Snaps.

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:50.880
Go ahead.

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:54.040
And the only thing I just actually wanted to say is that actually the example of the

01:23:54.040 --> 01:24:00.400
apps demonstrated in here are just yet another reinforcing point to the companies being the

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.880
primary target nowadays.

01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:08.080
See, if you are Spotify and Linux user base is not easy to quantify because of the self-reporting

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:13.960
part of it, and before you decide to invest in making an app for Linux that is going to

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:19.280
be native there, it's going to work there, it is hard for you to justify the price, except

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:24.280
if you can actually know of many other services that are being used by enterprises, and then

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:27.040
you know at least this quantity of people because it's more measurable.

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.520
You can say, this company has these many users.

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:34.280
So then they become capable of saying, it's worthwhile to invest in here because we have

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:40.040
these many customers accessing from this platform right now, and if we actually make an app,

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.480
they will be better served, and as a consequence, we'll have better customers willing to pay

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.720
higher premiums.

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:52.080
And it's better outcomes for normals who want to transition over to Linux because they feel

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:56.320
fed up with OSX, and also they don't have to mess with wine as much.

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.260
Well, that's a fair point.

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:05.840
So let's talk about flat packs and snaps, and I have a question for Mr. Wimpress.

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:11.520
Is it possible with snaps to ship like a runtime in the snap?

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:16.920
And what I mean by that is, could I ship a enterprise Java application where the Java

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:19.240
runtime is just all inside the single snap?

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:25.120
Could I ship TeamViewer that uses some sort of wine runtime where that is all packaged

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.580
inside the snap?

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:33.200
Is it possible that some of these like these gap covering solutions that we've come up

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:37.120
with, these things that help people transition from Windows to Linux, could those just be

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:43.020
included as one single snap, so I as an end user, I snap install TeamViewer, of course

01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:47.360
I recognize TeamViewer 13 as native now, but I as an end user for this example install

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:52.360
TeamViewer via snap, and I just get the wine runtime and all that stuff inside the snap?

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.840
Is that technically possible right now, Wimpy?

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:59.000
Yes, and there are snaps that already do precisely those things that you outlined.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.120
Okay, I thought it wasn't for some reason.

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:04.520
I thought that was something that flat pack could do that snaps couldn't.

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:10.760
So in the case of Java, JetBrains have published the vast majority of their product portfolio

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:19.080
and those are all Java based and they have their own custom build of the JVM inside the

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.360
snap in order to make those work.

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:31.040
And then our friend Alan Pope has made a snap of ZZT, which is an old DOS based adventure

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:38.360
game and that ships DOSBox inside the snap and then uses DOSBox to launch the game.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:44.640
One of the Ubuntu podcast listeners, McPhail, has done the same with Blades of Agony, which

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:54.320
is a Doom mod or re-implementation and that uses DOSBox embedded and I happen to know

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:58.640
it's not publicly available but I happen to know one of my colleagues at Canonical created

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.040
a snap of Internet Explorer by using wine.

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:09.960
I love it, of course.

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:10.960
Of course, why not, right?

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:12.040
That just makes my day.

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:22.000
So I'm struck with one thing that I take away from this is we are, as Linux users, experiencing

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.800
something that the wider market is currently going through.

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:36.040
When you install Slack on Windows 10, I've got news for you, when you use Atom on your

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:40.600
Mac, it's not just a Linux phenomenon.

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:43.060
This is happening to the entire market.

01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:49.280
This is the consequence of mobile and the web becoming predominant platforms.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:54.400
The web and mobile are what people are writing for today that are spending millions of dollars

01:27:54.400 --> 01:28:02.720
on developers, for the most part, and the desktop is sort of a second-class to third-class

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:07.200
citizen now in this new world that we see ourselves in 2018.

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:11.600
Many people would rather write a LadyTube skill than a Linux desktop application.

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:14.120
Simply put, it would be more valuable.

01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:16.800
You know, I'll give you an example.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:22.200
There's a lot of different podcast networks that are writing LadyTube apps right now so

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:27.320
you can listen to podcasts on your LadyTube, and they're not really all that interested

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.800
and don't really give any shits about the Linux desktop.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.960
It's just not on their radar.

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:39.240
It's a simple market dynamics, market force that we are also at the whim of, just like

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:41.360
Mac users are.

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:47.440
I've got some thoughts about this that put this into context.

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:54.720
Currently there are 46 GNOME applications that make up the core GNOME applications,

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:55.720
right?

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:56.720
Okay.

01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:59.440
More or less.

01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:03.580
Elementary have been doing a fine job with their developer outreach and their developer

01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:09.960
program and their app store, and they now have 70 apps in their store, which is a fantastic

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.480
achievement considering the size of their team.

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:16.440
I think they're punching above their weight in that respect.

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.000
Absolutely.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:24.400
There are 30,000 to 40,000 packages in the Debian and Ubuntu archives.

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:32.400
That includes libfu and devthis and all the rest of it, right?

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.720
There are approximately 50,000 electron applications on GitHub.

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:38.920
Oh boy.

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:39.920
Well put.

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:40.920
Right there.

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:44.320
That's it, isn't it?

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:45.480
That puts it all in context.

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.480
It sure does.

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:47.480
Thank you, Mr. Wimpress.

01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:52.040
Go find out more about what Wimpy's up to and his whole crew, the Ubuntu podcast.

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:56.200
There's plenty of fine episodes ready for you to listen to.

01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:59.760
The season hasn't started yet, the new season, although rumor has it it may come around.

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.760
Is that right?

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:01.760
Possibly.

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.380
So go get more of that Ubuntu podcast.

01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:09.060
Go get more Westpane at Westpane and also TechSnap.Systems.

01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:14.060
Brand new episode just went out this morning where Wes breaks down configuration management

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:18.920
for thousands of systems to your personal Linux workstation.

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:21.600
I'm at Chris Hellyes, Networks at Jupyter Signal.

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:45.360
See you right back here, next week.

01:30:52.480 --> 01:31:05.120
All right, guys.

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:06.120
That was a lot of fun.

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:07.760
I really enjoyed this week's episode.

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:08.760
That was kick ass.

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:09.760
Thank you.

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:10.760
And that's really wimpy.

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.560
That really puts it all into perspective, too, doesn't it?

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:15.360
You're trying to hit an hour and a half for episode blank.

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:18.140
Well, you know, we got to make room now for the Ask Noah show.

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:20.960
This is a bit of a longer show, but we got to make room for Noah.

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:21.960
He's coming.

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:22.960
And there's no avoiding it.

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:23.960
He can't stop him.

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:24.960
No.

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:25.960
He can't stop Noah.

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:26.960
Don't even try.

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:27.960
Chris.

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:28.960
Yeah.

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:29.960
Yeah.

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:31.040
I got a quick question about Wi-Fi adapters.

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:34.800
So my dad's looking to get me a USB Wi-Fi adapter for my machine.

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:35.800
Oh, that's nice of him.

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:36.800
Yeah.

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:42.560
You see, I'm upstairs in my room right now talking to you guys on my phone, but my desktop,

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:46.520
it has a D-Link DWA 125 Wi-Fi adapter.

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:52.120
It's USB-N only, and I need an AC adapter, and I was wondering if you had any suggestions

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.120
for me.

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:54.120
Oh, I don't.

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:55.120
I don't.

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:56.560
I mean, I have so many things.

01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:02.080
There's a lot going on with what you just said, and boy.

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.360
You know, what's your budget?

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.120
So let's start there.

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:11.760
My dad said he's willing to go at least 60, but he'd prefer to keep it a little bit lower.

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:12.760
Okay.

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:13.760
All right.

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.760
And what kind of machine you're plugging in?

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:15.760
It's got to be USB?

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.320
It's got to be a tower.

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:22.560
It's a custom-built machine, and it does have USB 3 capabilities.

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:24.600
Maybe you should ask Noah.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:29.280
Hey, Citizen, by the way, I got to say, Oh Hi DPI is really funny.

01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:30.280
That's really good.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.960
That's a good title, by the way.

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:36.160
Well, I'll ask Noah, I guess, when he comes on, because he may be the better person to

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:37.160
ask that kind of person.

01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:38.160
Does anybody have any hardware?

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:40.640
Does anybody have any hardware recommendations for that?

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:45.200
Asus Dongle, they have one that is pretty good.

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:46.200
I'm trying to find it.

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:48.920
And is that Asus one, is it like an Intel chipset on the inside, or what is that?

01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:50.640
I just posted it in the chat.

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:51.640
Oh yeah?

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:52.640
Okay.

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.640
Very good.

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:54.640
Okay, Rekai.

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:55.640
There you go.

01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.640
And Best Buy's got it, too.

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.840
So it's an Asus dual-band wireless AC USB network adapter.

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:02.120
And I'm fairly close to St. Matthew's portion of Louisville, Kentucky.

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:07.200
So hopefully I might just have him go down and pick it up.

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:08.200
Just one thing.

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.200
Just one thing.

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.200
That's nice.

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:13.400
That's just basically the size of like a mouse wireless adapter.

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.400
Yeah.

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.280
Just one small thing, though.

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:21.680
Because you're using in tower, and the tower itself can interfere with wireless, make sure

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:25.360
that you have an adapter in case you need like a cable, an extension cable.

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.360
Yes.

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:27.360
You can actually-

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.360
Get a USB extender cable.

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:29.360
He's absolutely right.

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:33.160
So get a USB extender cable, and then put this at the end of it.

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:35.520
I have had that same exact problem.

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:37.120
That is good advice right there.

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.120
Yeah.

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:40.320
My current one is sitting up on the wall right now.

01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:41.320
Oh yeah.

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.320
There you go.

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:43.320
So you're hip to it.

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.320
Okay.

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:45.320
I'll definitely look into that.

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:46.320
Even not in the wall.

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.320
That's what I usually do.

01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.320
What do you think, Wes?

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:52.160
Oh, just in the same situation in the past, I've ended up, if you have like some of the

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:56.400
cheaper and like older Wi-Fi hardware just sitting around, you can flash a lot of those

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:59.840
routers, add them as just a Wi-Fi adapter plug and plug it into your-

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:00.840
A bridge.

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:01.840
Yeah.

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:02.840
It's funny you say that.

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:04.720
That's what I was actually going to say until he said this Asus thing.

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.160
I was actually going to just recommend just bridge it.

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:14.100
I got to tell you, at the end of the day, all my devices that are Wi-Fi bridged, I just

01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:15.100
like better.

01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:16.240
I just plug them into the ethernet port.

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.600
The machine is none the wiser.

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.240
It doesn't have to futz with the Wi-Fi stuff.

01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:20.580
It has no idea.

01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:23.500
And the bridge is always connected to the Wi-Fi network.

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:24.500
And that is my-

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:25.840
Provided your Wi-Fi doesn't change a lot.

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:26.840
It works pretty well.

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:27.840
Yeah.

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:28.840
Yes.

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:50.240
Thank you.
