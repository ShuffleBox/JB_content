WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.480
We talked a little bit on Tech Talk today, but we got a little bit of a

00:03.480 --> 00:07.820
different crowd here. Some of the same folks too. Maybe I know Odyssey and Eric

00:07.820 --> 00:11.960
and Lionhead were here this morning. Maybe you guys have time to process this.

00:11.960 --> 00:15.720
What do you think about the news that there's gonna be a special version of a

00:15.720 --> 00:21.200
project Photoshop streaming beta available to Chrome on Windows and Chrome

00:21.200 --> 00:27.000
Books? I just wouldn't put it past Adobe to use or agent block it. So you think

00:27.000 --> 00:30.200
they'll detect you're coming from a standard Linux machine and say

00:30.200 --> 00:35.600
Netflix 2.0 is what they're gonna do? Yeah, pretty much. So we had

00:35.600 --> 00:40.340
Tivoization in the early days were when binary blobs and what you

00:40.340 --> 00:42.800
could do with the GPL was really being struggled with and now we have

00:42.800 --> 00:46.920
Netflixation where it's technically possible to run something on a general

00:46.920 --> 00:51.080
Linux box like these Android apps that we saw after a week or so people got

00:51.080 --> 00:55.160
working under Linux. So now you have the Netflixization where it's well we could

00:55.160 --> 00:58.640
technically make it work you know but we don't want to support it so we just

00:58.640 --> 01:02.360
block it all together. Instead of you know which is really

01:02.360 --> 01:06.400
misrepresentative of the of the early era of computing where it was have at it

01:06.400 --> 01:08.960
you can make it work but you're on your own you have to support it yourself.

01:08.960 --> 01:13.000
Which I think all of us in this room would be totally comfortable doing if

01:13.000 --> 01:16.600
there was a way to make project Photoshop streaming beta as that's

01:16.600 --> 01:21.320
what that's his name work on everyday Linux if you had Chrome. I think we would

01:21.320 --> 01:26.280
all take that sort of social contract that it's okay if it doesn't work

01:26.280 --> 01:29.160
perfectly under my distribution because I'm not using it in a supported

01:29.160 --> 01:34.280
environment and you can see a real-world example of that today with Steam.

01:34.280 --> 01:38.400
Steam is technically supported on Ubuntu but it's used across all of the

01:38.400 --> 01:41.880
distributions and there's a social contract in place that sometimes when

01:41.880 --> 01:45.680
you hit a few problems that you might not hit under Ubuntu it's not

01:45.680 --> 01:50.600
necessarily anybody's fault but your own. I imagine what they will do is they

01:50.600 --> 01:54.720
will they will use their same creative cloud streaming stuff and they will

01:54.720 --> 01:59.360
package that up into a Chrome app with some drive like Google Drive.

01:59.360 --> 02:02.320
Here's how it's working on the no it's kind of crazy Josh and I don't know what kind

02:02.320 --> 02:06.360
of VM it is but the way that and I have a link to 95 Google it goes into details.

02:06.360 --> 02:11.080
The way it sounds like it's working is they're actually distributing a VM

02:11.080 --> 02:17.360
through Chrome through a Chrome app and Photoshop will run inside this VM and as

02:17.360 --> 02:22.320
per those virtual limitations there's no GPU acceleration some of the more

02:22.320 --> 02:27.480
advanced effects won't work and there's no access to the local file system so

02:27.480 --> 02:32.080
the only place you can save with this Photoshop project Photoshop streaming

02:32.080 --> 02:36.640
beta the only place you can save is to Google Drive.

02:36.640 --> 02:40.680
You know my mom like my mom's a graphic artist and she'll have like

02:40.680 --> 02:47.560
three four five six gigabyte PSD files sometimes that are just huge layout yeah

02:47.560 --> 02:59.920
I'd have the same thing when I was doing photography I'd have like these huge PST files taking up tons of space I'd be

02:59.920 --> 03:03.840
like great I'm running out of space because I'm doing photography what gives?

03:03.840 --> 03:09.500
Yeah so I'm pretty sure this is aimed more at you know people who make low

03:09.500 --> 03:14.200
quality gifts for Tumblr. No it's aimed at education in fact they're only gonna

03:14.200 --> 03:20.040
distribute it to education. At first. Yeah I think education means low quality

03:20.040 --> 03:25.560
gifts for Tumblr. Well I mean let's be clear this is obviously significant this

03:25.560 --> 03:30.760
is it going in the right step initially we weren't here to begin with like it

03:30.760 --> 03:34.160
wasn't there to begin with well who knows maybe it'll come to Linux at some

03:34.160 --> 03:39.240
point. It sounds like an interesting way to distribute a really thick

03:39.240 --> 03:44.880
application like this. The thing is for education you could also be talking

03:44.880 --> 03:49.320
about not just you know your standard public education you could be talking

03:49.320 --> 03:54.380
about people who do this professionally for professionals and they're not

03:54.380 --> 03:59.960
necessarily going to be needing to run Creative Cloud when you need actual

03:59.960 --> 04:05.400
hardware in front of you that's beefy enough to do these applications.

04:05.400 --> 04:10.660
I agree I agree okay late-breaking pre-show topic submitted by Popey in the

04:10.660 --> 04:14.400
IRC chat room he brings our attention you know I love a good Kickstarter that's

04:14.400 --> 04:18.120
Linux based he brings our attention to Matchstick the streaming stick built on

04:18.120 --> 04:26.000
Firefox OS 2668 backers $61,000 towards a goal of a hundred thousand dollars

04:26.000 --> 04:32.880
with 29 days to go so this looks like like a like a like a Chrome stick what

04:32.880 --> 04:36.760
are those called the Chromecast I'm gonna play this let's see what we get

04:36.760 --> 04:42.920
Matchstick. Fire up online content on your TV with Matchstick. Oh yeah why wouldn't I?

04:42.920 --> 04:48.900
Because it's Matchstick. The first HDMI streaming stick powered by Mozilla's

04:48.900 --> 04:56.080
Firefox OS use your phone tablet or laptop to watch movies listen to music

04:56.080 --> 05:01.920
and play games right on your TV okay no matter where you are powered by Mozilla's

05:01.920 --> 05:08.600
Firefox OS and we need your help to bring it to market Matchstick is

05:08.600 --> 05:14.100
open-sourced and fully adaptable just like Firefox OS we can't wait to see

05:14.100 --> 05:19.200
what you come up with got an idea for a TV app join our

05:19.200 --> 05:25.400
developer network and make it happen help us build Matchstick and let's take

05:25.400 --> 05:32.560
back our favorite online content help us help you to watch whatever whenever all

05:32.560 --> 05:37.640
right so I love the idea of an open-source Chromecast see how big it

05:37.640 --> 05:42.040
is and I also like the idea of just keeping my TV a dumb display and putting

05:42.040 --> 05:44.920
the smart deliver the ultimate you know maybe in my tablet or my smartphone but

05:44.920 --> 05:49.280
guys guys guys guys isn't the critical flaw here you've got to have the support

05:49.280 --> 05:53.380
for it baked into every single freaking app that would ever use this because it

05:53.380 --> 05:59.560
supports the Chromecast protocol ah there's the magic sauce so it's is the

05:59.560 --> 06:05.000
Chromecast is the Chromecast protocol open or they first engineered it's like

06:05.000 --> 06:09.080
mere cast I think I don't know if it's open but it's you can you can create

06:09.080 --> 06:15.240
apps that will stream to that and then that means it's like cuz that is that's

06:15.240 --> 06:18.720
great that is that means like this thing is gonna be like ready to go with a ton

06:18.720 --> 06:22.320
of stuff out of the box and they've opened the designs up as well question I

06:22.320 --> 06:26.160
already have a Chromecast why is this any more compelling than a Chromecast

06:26.160 --> 06:30.720
well it's probably let's do more stuff yeah I mean well there's that and you

06:30.720 --> 06:34.040
could use it across multiple browsers well I'm not entirely sure you could do

06:34.040 --> 06:36.560
that with Chromecast here's the fundamental difference that I think it

06:36.560 --> 06:40.760
does and I'm reading the description right now so I don't know but it looks

06:40.760 --> 06:46.640
like it streams over your Wi-Fi from your device to the Firefox stick seeing

06:46.640 --> 06:50.220
which is contrary to right in the Chromecast that you initiate it from a

06:50.220 --> 06:54.960
remote session and then it pushes that content to the Chromecast I and and and

06:54.960 --> 07:00.120
I actually I don't like the Apple TV at all but the one thing I like about

07:00.120 --> 07:05.680
AirPlay is that all stays on my LAN and I I like that a lot more from just like

07:05.680 --> 07:09.680
a like then there's nothing that registers and logs what it is I've

07:09.680 --> 07:13.360
streamed or initiated that's one small part but then B I feel like I can get a

07:13.360 --> 07:16.540
higher quality more reliable stream if I'm doing over my well set up LAN at

07:16.540 --> 07:20.520
home that has gigabit networking and 802 11 n throughout the house so I have a

07:20.520 --> 07:24.520
better setup there so I would prefer to stream it locally plus some of the stuff

07:24.520 --> 07:30.200
I have is not stuff I'm gonna have up in the cloud that I want to stream so this

07:30.200 --> 07:34.240
yeah okay and I think like even with Plex I from what I understand but it

07:34.240 --> 07:37.420
looks like the majority of it like if I find something for example online and I

07:37.420 --> 07:40.640
send to the Chromecast it's not coming from my device it's coming from whatever

07:40.640 --> 07:47.600
service has like a like the YouTube or something like that if you want to play

07:47.600 --> 07:51.080
locally with with like stuff from Plex and it comes straight from your own

07:51.080 --> 07:54.400
server I never see that's well that's kind of what I was thinking about doing

07:54.400 --> 07:57.920
but now I'm thinking now I'm thinking maybe I'll wait for this and you can

07:57.920 --> 08:02.960
also stream the Chrome's not even your Chrome browser screen but also like any

08:02.960 --> 08:08.000
like my Nexus I can stream it straight to my Chromecast yes you I got a

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Chromecast I gave it to Matt but I had a Chromecast and I was thinking about

08:11.000 --> 08:14.160
hooking it up to one of our HDMI capture ports here in the studio and then

08:14.160 --> 08:18.080
whatever I sent to the Chromecast when I would build it I would build a pull in

08:18.080 --> 08:22.360
on the on the switcher but I ended up buying three of them I've got three

08:22.360 --> 08:26.120
Chromecast really house because the kids love it they've got one of them's got an

08:26.120 --> 08:29.480
iPhone one's got an Android tablet and they they stream stuff to the telly

08:29.480 --> 08:32.400
wherever they are so this is I want them to get out the room they go to another

08:32.400 --> 08:35.200
room and stream it to a different so are you backing matchstick then are you

08:35.200 --> 08:38.240
gonna try this yeah yeah I've already backed it yeah I think I might too I

08:38.240 --> 08:41.320
think this is looking good I like that they already have essentially the

08:41.320 --> 08:45.480
hardware designed so they're there they're there in that regard it's a big

08:45.480 --> 08:50.200
device though isn't it oh that's the first version it's behind the telly so

08:50.200 --> 08:53.520
they're really it's only slightly bigger than a Chromecast looks about the size

08:53.520 --> 08:57.120
of the Chromecast isn't it is it well that picture down the some with the

08:57.120 --> 09:03.200
satchel that looks bloody massive is there I'm looking for one where it

09:03.200 --> 09:06.920
looks really big oh boy it does look huge on the satchel you're right it does

09:06.920 --> 09:10.620
oh wow that is huge I mean let's be honest it's gonna be plugged into the

09:10.620 --> 09:16.220
back of your TV or not exactly like the HDMI ports are really close together and

09:16.220 --> 09:18.920
it's hard when you have a really thick that that's true well they usually come

09:18.920 --> 09:24.520
with a tiny cable right an extender yeah and you can pick one up off Amazon for

09:24.520 --> 09:28.040
super cheap or wherever you get your local wires at least it's not like the

09:28.040 --> 09:32.480
one Microsoft is trying to pull yeah so poppy did you see what they're with

09:32.480 --> 09:39.920
their target market prices once they hit production okay that's what I thought so

09:39.920 --> 09:42.680
you can get a two-pack first I think I'm gonna back him for 34 bucks because you

09:42.680 --> 09:47.600
can get a two-pack I got the 24 developer unit because I want to get it

09:47.600 --> 09:55.400
working with Ubuntu 20 you're gonna get 24 of them know that $24 okay okay you're

09:55.400 --> 09:59.160
really gonna get it working with a bunch of like a poppy anyone that when you say

09:59.160 --> 10:04.520
Ubuntu do you mean touch yeah oh that'd be cool

10:06.960 --> 10:12.360
welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show I swear is literally

10:12.360 --> 10:18.720
powered by flannel my name is Chris my name is Matt I I just I'm getting in the

10:18.720 --> 10:22.360
Pacific Northwest spirit today so I'm rocking a new flannel shirt from Costco

10:22.360 --> 10:27.480
and it's comfortable it's super comfortable it's it's nice and and so

10:27.480 --> 10:30.240
that means I'm in a good mood for today's show because I'm in my comfort

10:30.240 --> 10:35.360
zone so I thought today we'd warm up with a nice delicious strip of bacon a

10:35.360 --> 10:40.800
little whiskey and coke and we'd read some feedback I also want to go I talk

10:40.800 --> 10:44.360
about the reaction in the general public to the whole shell shock

10:44.360 --> 10:47.200
vulnerability if maybe it's just getting a little out of hand and I want to get

10:47.200 --> 10:51.920
everybody's opinion on that so we'll pull that in and then we've also got I

10:51.920 --> 10:56.040
apologize Matt if it smells like burnt toast when you walked into the studio

10:56.040 --> 10:59.480
today that's just my ass hair on fire because well that's good to know I'll

10:59.480 --> 11:02.840
tell you what man I don't know if you've been to the subreddit in the last couple

11:02.840 --> 11:06.760
of days whoa Chris is under fire Matt he's under

11:06.760 --> 11:10.880
fire oh yeah yeah I as soon as I see anything negative I'm just like I don't

11:10.880 --> 11:14.080
care it's under fire so well no it's cool it's cool you know what you know

11:14.080 --> 11:16.560
what we're gonna talk about it we're gonna talk about it we'll talk to the

11:16.560 --> 11:19.420
people that's why I want everybody to get their whiskey and bacon so that way

11:19.420 --> 11:22.000
we're gonna we'll get to that in a little bit in the show so we'll do

11:22.000 --> 11:24.560
we'll talk about it then so everybody just prepare yourselves mentally for

11:24.560 --> 11:28.680
that with your whiskey and bacon and first to get us started we'll take a

11:28.680 --> 11:34.480
little walk down feedback lane with our discussion around XFCE last week and we

11:34.480 --> 11:38.000
got a couple of emails about the state of XFC and Nick wrote in with a question

11:38.000 --> 11:41.720
looking towards the future so I will bring in the mumble room hey there guys

11:41.720 --> 11:44.840
we're gonna get to our first email this week and I want to see if you think that

11:44.840 --> 11:48.680
maybe XFCE is just waiting around for Whalen to make its move so here's Nick's

11:48.680 --> 11:51.920
thought he says I wanted to weigh in on the discussion regarding the future of

11:51.920 --> 11:57.200
XFCE I toyed with the idea some time ago of maybe trying to pitch a port of XFCE

11:57.200 --> 12:02.680
to GTK 3 but I eventually decided just to give up and move to elementary OS

12:02.680 --> 12:07.320
which I'm fairly happy with but my dream is to have a box style window manager

12:07.320 --> 12:12.200
with modular components for a panel a menu and a file manager etc and it but

12:12.200 --> 12:16.600
it needs to take advantage of Whalen to add subtle compositing effects and

12:16.600 --> 12:22.520
animations is it possible there are more XFCE fans out there who are waiting for

12:22.520 --> 12:27.080
the next generation of display managers to land before we start a rewrite of the

12:27.080 --> 12:31.640
desktop just thought well Nick what do you think that first thing if you're

12:31.640 --> 12:35.800
using the words compositing and XFC in the same sentence you're going the wrong

12:35.800 --> 12:40.080
direction now I say this is someone that's done this now I speak as I speak

12:40.080 --> 12:43.640
as a previous addict to such things I used to do this okay and so I'm not

12:43.640 --> 12:46.320
ripping on the guy at all I totally get the reasoning because you're thinking oh

12:46.320 --> 12:49.280
I could have the lightweight goodness and you know yeah I could also have the

12:49.280 --> 12:53.760
composite right yeah you know just go known at that point really well that's

12:53.760 --> 12:57.720
kind of what I'm wondering but okay I know we have a couple of XFC users in

12:57.720 --> 13:02.280
the mumble room guys in there anybody feeling like maybe XFC should just hang

13:02.280 --> 13:06.600
tight for a couple years let Whalen settle in let the drivers get mature let

13:06.600 --> 13:11.000
distro start shipping it by default then XFC needs to get off the pot is this

13:11.000 --> 13:19.040
maybe any XFC guys want to chime in on that maybe that's what's going on go

13:19.040 --> 13:23.480
ahead well have you read read the roadmap where they've outlined where

13:23.480 --> 13:28.280
they're gonna be implementing GTK 3 and that would obviously be there their

13:28.280 --> 13:33.240
precursor to Whalen support so like you're doubtful well that it was

13:33.240 --> 13:38.760
originally on the agenda for 412 but it's now being bumped so they're gonna

13:38.760 --> 13:49.000
stick with GTK 2 for the next major revision by the sounds of it so I see

13:49.000 --> 13:51.880
what you're saying it's kind of like it keeps getting bumped a little bit and so

13:51.880 --> 13:54.760
now you're starting to get skeptical rotten corpse want to toss it to you I

13:54.760 --> 13:59.200
think you're maybe our resident XFC skeptic what do you think about rotten

13:59.200 --> 14:02.440
seriously what do you think about the idea of maybe just not changing

14:02.440 --> 14:05.200
something for a little while and letting the Linux ecosystem sort of stabilize

14:05.200 --> 14:09.520
and then worrying about it is that really that ridiculous well that if

14:09.520 --> 14:12.840
that's the case then they've been having that same opinion for the past decade

14:12.840 --> 14:19.000
and so that's not very practical but if some if other people who are not part of

14:19.000 --> 14:23.360
the current team want to fork it and make a new one that's based on Whalen

14:23.360 --> 14:25.960
there's something like that when it when everything settles that could be

14:25.960 --> 14:31.720
interesting but the the team that right now their track record is we we will

14:31.720 --> 14:36.000
they'll say that they're gonna do something never actually do it push it

14:36.000 --> 14:41.160
push everything back release things like on average every two years maybe two and

14:41.160 --> 14:47.360
a half years and essentially make promises that never come to fruition see

14:47.360 --> 14:53.800
I feel like it's it's too there's two planes to this debate there is the the

14:53.800 --> 14:58.000
argument that you're making right there rotten about failed expectations the

14:58.000 --> 15:02.320
need to adapt to future changes of Linux responding to user needs stagnation

15:02.320 --> 15:06.960
things like that and then there's also the real world use case where I think

15:06.960 --> 15:11.720
I've said this story once before on there but I worked at a school district

15:11.720 --> 15:16.800
and when I was there the one of the IT guys had a Debian XFCE box running on

15:16.800 --> 15:24.160
like a like an old Dell something tower and I left and came back like nine years

15:24.160 --> 15:28.680
later I think it was or eight years later and that guy was still using

15:28.680 --> 15:36.920
Debian with XFCE on that same Dell and it works for him and he actually to him

15:36.920 --> 15:42.520
that stagnation was the number one reason he chose those that distribution

15:42.520 --> 15:47.120
and that desktop that was the number one features for him because he wanted to

15:47.120 --> 15:53.280
have stability you can have stability and you can have you know updates still

15:53.280 --> 15:58.640
and still keep the the lightweight stuff for example having mate on Debian or

15:58.640 --> 16:02.440
right Ubuntu or whatever yeah I think I think if he was if he was gonna build a

16:02.440 --> 16:07.440
box today he'd go mate or mate is what he would do and I think that's yeah I

16:07.440 --> 16:12.920
okay we've got one more thing on XFCE I Kjell writes and Kjell writes and

16:12.920 --> 16:17.080
says I I don't see the XFCE future as grim as most of your mumble users he

16:17.080 --> 16:20.640
says I dug around for five minutes on the XFCE form jump jumped into the

16:20.640 --> 16:24.920
mailing list and well I what I see tells a slightly different story I don't think

16:24.920 --> 16:28.720
development commits for XFC are actually shown in the public git until they're

16:28.720 --> 16:33.500
released hence it looks like they really haven't done anything since 4.10 and I

16:33.500 --> 16:39.360
don't know if that's true or not but he says that XFCE 4-PWM 1.4 was announced

16:39.360 --> 16:42.840
and released September 15th it was patched just three days ago

16:42.840 --> 16:46.440
arch already has it in testing maybe the Debian could do their own testing to

16:46.440 --> 16:51.360
move from experimental to unstable so he points out that there is current

16:51.360 --> 16:55.600
development happening and there are some distributions that have newer packages

16:55.600 --> 17:00.160
and he points out that sometimes they don't commit to their public git until

17:00.160 --> 17:05.560
it's in a release stage which seems kind of backwards but he says there's also an

17:05.560 --> 17:08.360
interesting thread about 412 stabilization in the mailing list so

17:08.360 --> 17:11.280
we'll have links to that if you guys want to check it out he also wanted to

17:11.280 --> 17:15.920
chime in about XFCE moving to QT he says why would they toss out 1.5 years of

17:15.920 --> 17:21.920
coding for version what's that go ahead no okay she's why would they toss out

17:21.920 --> 17:26.600
years of coding for version 4.12 that's not gonna happen at all he thinks he

17:26.600 --> 17:29.080
doesn't think they'll be moving to QT which was tossed around in one last

17:29.080 --> 17:32.200
piece he says Matei has a modern replacement well I tried it several

17:32.200 --> 17:35.440
times I've always had issues it's nice looking but it doesn't feel mature at

17:35.440 --> 17:40.520
all but he acknowledges that is a subjective opinion so there you go some

17:40.520 --> 17:47.000
pro XFCE stuff I you know I thought about it after our episode last week and

17:47.000 --> 17:49.280
I you know the thing that I really walked away from the conversation I

17:49.280 --> 17:52.920
can't remember if I said this in the post show or not but I realized after

17:52.920 --> 18:00.480
last week's show that your mic keeps popping open I realized after last week's

18:00.480 --> 18:05.040
show that I stopped installing XFCE about a year ago and I was trying to

18:05.040 --> 18:09.600
think about why that was and I think what I came down to is there's just a

18:09.600 --> 18:14.120
lot of really great lightweight alternatives like LXQT now or Matei yeah

18:14.120 --> 18:18.120
that just have my interest more and it's for me it's just a personal taste thing

18:18.120 --> 18:24.320
and I think I think a lot of times you know we have these crazy debates and we

18:24.320 --> 18:30.160
don't allow for personal opinion to be a perfectly legitimate deciding factor and

18:30.160 --> 18:34.200
and it goes across all things it's not just as Linux users right look at the

18:34.200 --> 18:39.240
Mac Windows Android iOS debates like we never just leave room for personal

18:39.240 --> 18:44.720
preference and allow that to be a justifying reason you can be an XFCE fan

18:44.720 --> 18:51.720
and enjoy XFCE in despite of all of its potential problems and that's okay right

18:51.720 --> 18:55.360
and and it's not like you're spending a bunch of money you know I mean maybe

18:55.360 --> 18:58.480
exactly the iOS and Android wars almost make more sense because there's hundreds

18:58.480 --> 19:01.400
of dollars on the line and those know that this one it's just free software

19:01.400 --> 19:08.760
you're picking from so yeah people need to be right all the time I don't know

19:08.760 --> 19:12.840
it's like it's yeah I don't understand I never understood that it's like why did

19:12.840 --> 19:16.000
you know it's okay to have an opinion and your needs may differ from mine

19:16.000 --> 19:19.120
that's always been my philosophy go ahead line and what were you gonna chime

19:19.120 --> 19:25.880
in with no I'm just since last Tuesday I've installed Matei on every desktop I

19:25.880 --> 19:32.960
have really with it and I find that it does everything that affects XFCE way

19:32.960 --> 19:38.680
yeah yeah I can actually live with it yeah I'm not feel compromised right right

19:38.680 --> 19:43.280
yes that is you know that's a great point about Matei isn't it is that

19:43.280 --> 19:47.480
they've walked the line where it's the classic desktop UI but they keep

19:47.480 --> 19:51.240
bringing little elements of modernization and the functionality is

19:51.240 --> 19:55.520
there and so you can really just sit down and you have the classic environment

19:55.520 --> 19:59.800
with a few tweaks and touches here I think you know you know we're gonna get

19:59.800 --> 20:04.360
to Ubuntu 1410 in a couple of minutes and I think one of the things I'm

20:04.360 --> 20:07.880
looking forward to the most about it for Ubuntu 1410 is and maybe wimpy and

20:07.880 --> 20:12.800
poppy I'm right in that by 1410 when it ships Ubuntu Matei at that point will be

20:12.800 --> 20:21.480
an official spin of Ubuntu close but not quite close but not quite yeah good

20:21.480 --> 20:25.440
enough for government work or what yeah yeah we're gonna we're definitely gonna

20:25.440 --> 20:31.720
release have been released and on the same schedule as the official Ubuntu

20:31.720 --> 20:39.660
flavors I think we're gonna miss being official for 1410 but the the work has

20:39.660 --> 20:44.400
already started and I think that will will be official early in the 1504

20:44.400 --> 20:49.600
cycle okay so I mean there will be a 1410 release that you can download and

20:49.600 --> 20:53.200
install and all that good stuff I'm looking forward to that and we're gonna

20:53.200 --> 20:56.720
get into the Ubuntu stuff in a bit but I am I am honestly looking forward to

20:56.720 --> 21:00.200
that then I am the main Ubuntu release and I'm also looking forward to the

21:00.200 --> 21:04.560
Kubuntu spin more I and I think you know we're gonna talk about it so I don't

21:04.560 --> 21:08.160
want to spoil it but um that's some of where the more exciting stuff is

21:08.160 --> 21:12.800
happening in Ubuntu so and I just don't feel that way about an XFCE spin I knew

21:12.800 --> 21:16.360
Zubuntu is out there they do great work but I'm not excited you know so it's

21:16.360 --> 21:19.440
just what I walked away with and that's just you know what it's just my personal

21:19.440 --> 21:22.000
take on it it could be there is somebody out there there probably is people out

21:22.000 --> 21:24.560
there really excited about the next Zubuntu release aside from the Zubuntu

21:24.560 --> 21:29.400
team of course and so I just I wanted to walk away from the XFCE discussion and I

21:29.400 --> 21:33.240
think I don't think we really upset anybody but I just wanted to say like

21:33.240 --> 21:37.040
even if all other things aside you just don't like it or you do like it that's

21:37.040 --> 21:40.480
okay too and I think we should just work on accepting that a little bit and that

21:40.480 --> 21:45.920
we'll get into more than a minute but and and to carry on with the positivity

21:45.920 --> 21:53.080
there about XFCE if you are an XFCE fan then install Zubuntu 14.04 and you can

21:53.080 --> 21:57.880
be running that OS for the next five years right right very much now because

21:57.880 --> 22:02.120
because 14.04 is not going to yank or change any of the underlying libraries

22:02.120 --> 22:06.200
or APIs so that desktop is solid and good to go for the next five years so if

22:06.200 --> 22:09.560
that's your thing then that's the platform to go for right good point

22:09.560 --> 22:18.040
thank you sir your D won't update anyway so yeah perfect Wow Wow yeah I mean I

22:18.040 --> 22:24.920
was trying to see you see how I had it all like some like actual work done

22:24.920 --> 22:29.240
instead of caring about version numbers all right we don't need to get into

22:29.240 --> 22:32.600
debate I was trying to end the XFC discussion with warm fuzzies okay now

22:32.600 --> 22:35.840
you guys are getting into it again all right I mean on the plus side there

22:35.840 --> 22:41.600
should be at least one release of XC XFCE in next five years yeah and that's

22:41.600 --> 22:45.680
fine there you go who needs more than that not not me all right so before we

22:45.680 --> 22:48.960
move on any further because we do have some more follow-up to get into and

22:48.960 --> 22:55.360
actually a classic computer debate it's not it I there's a few debates that I

22:55.360 --> 22:58.800
think we could retread a few times and it changes all the time I'm really

22:58.800 --> 23:01.800
curious to hear what Matt in the mumble room do but first I want to mention

23:01.800 --> 23:05.680
Linux Academy our first sponsor of the Linux unplugged show I'm so glad they're

23:05.680 --> 23:09.120
a sponsor of our show because they are a perfect fit for our audience if you guys

23:09.120 --> 23:12.200
just want to go out there and move your skill set forward a little bit or a lot

23:12.200 --> 23:16.040
of it maybe you need something to help get that next job or maybe you just need

23:16.040 --> 23:19.000
something to check something off on the review that you have every single year

23:19.000 --> 23:21.920
or something to help you bill or complete a contract if you've been

23:21.920 --> 23:25.680
thrown into a position where you got to catch something you know got to make it

23:25.680 --> 23:28.640
work quick you got to really hit the ground running and you got to get up

23:28.640 --> 23:32.840
yourself up to speed on like the lamb stack or open stack or virtualization

23:32.840 --> 23:36.940
or AWS will Linux Academy has got you covered and if you go to Linux Academy

23:36.940 --> 23:42.280
comm slash unplugged you're gonna get a 33% discount that's a great offering so

23:42.280 --> 23:45.920
what is Linux Academy I kind of just told you it's really a way for you to go

23:45.920 --> 23:49.520
do self-paced training with an amazing dashboard and you can pick from seven

23:49.520 --> 23:52.920
plus Linux distributions and they'll automatically adjust the courseware to

23:52.920 --> 23:56.080
match the distribution you've chosen and they're rolling out new features they've

23:56.080 --> 23:59.720
got videos they got audio comprehensive study guides you can download and

23:59.720 --> 24:02.840
listen to or watch offline or while you're commuting I've heard people use

24:02.840 --> 24:07.040
them as podcasts and they're always adding new courseware constantly they're

24:07.040 --> 24:10.560
really hustling on all that they recently introduced learning plans they

24:10.560 --> 24:13.320
let you select your daily availability and they'll automatically adjust the

24:13.320 --> 24:16.480
courseware and they'll also give you lessons and quizzes and give you status

24:16.480 --> 24:21.240
updates as you go along this is really an awesome way to for myself to kind of

24:21.240 --> 24:26.040
stay informed on new technology as it emerges because I'm back in the day the

24:26.040 --> 24:29.600
way I would discover if I'd liked something is I would go implement it for

24:29.600 --> 24:34.040
a for a job for a client whatever for myself at home and then I would be stuck

24:34.040 --> 24:38.480
either supporting something I hated or attempted to fiddle with something I

24:38.480 --> 24:43.680
loved Linux Academy is like my healthy outlet for that discoverability not only

24:43.680 --> 24:47.080
because it's an all-I-can-eat approach and they've got tons of courseware over

24:47.080 --> 24:50.560
there so I can just keep going as fast as I can dig through it but I can try

24:50.560 --> 24:54.400
out different areas and experiment with things I never would have done for

24:54.400 --> 24:58.160
example I could be playing around with a sequel setup and when it comes time to

24:58.160 --> 25:01.080
actually launch the sequel server and go through the backup part part of it

25:01.080 --> 25:05.040
they'll spin up the virtual lab for me they do that automatically for AWS or

25:05.040 --> 25:08.000
any other server instance and they're doing it even cooler now you can do

25:08.000 --> 25:11.960
shared server instances with public IPs and domain names it is really getting

25:11.960 --> 25:15.840
advanced and it's all just part of your Linux Academy subscription so go to

25:15.840 --> 25:20.000
linuxacademy.com slash unplug try out some of their AWS courses with

25:20.000 --> 25:24.400
scenario-based learning their virtual labs all of it their live streams where

25:24.400 --> 25:26.920
you can ask the educators questions directly or their community where you

25:26.920 --> 25:31.280
can get involved and ask your fellow students linuxacademy.com slash unplug

25:31.280 --> 25:35.760
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a huge thank you to Linux Academy for

25:35.760 --> 25:39.880
sponsoring the Linux unplugged show such a great fit for our audience a lot of

25:39.880 --> 25:43.920
great opportunities for you guys linuxacademy.com slash unplugged okay

25:43.920 --> 25:49.400
just a couple bits of email before we get into kind of our big topic or one of

25:49.400 --> 25:53.440
our big topics of the day so Craig writes in with a classic debate dearest

25:53.440 --> 25:57.720
Matt Chris in mumble room I'm a Linux user slash enthusiast an aspiring Linux

25:57.720 --> 26:01.880
sysadmin I'm a longtime listener of lass well under a year and a first-time

26:01.880 --> 26:05.880
emailer I understand what hibernate suspend and shut down all do so he's got

26:05.880 --> 26:11.480
the basics I'm just curious though which one is the best for a healthy Linux

26:11.480 --> 26:14.840
system I've read the hibernation is bad in some regards I'm not really sure why

26:14.840 --> 26:19.000
I just kind of looked that and thought well if I've been suspending and maybe I

26:19.000 --> 26:22.600
should be shutting down instead what do you guys think what does the mumble room

26:22.600 --> 26:25.880
think are you worried about cron jobs not executing and cleaning your system

26:25.880 --> 26:29.800
up or your package cache not updating automatically do you leave your system

26:29.800 --> 26:32.360
running on all the time do you sleep but when you're not using do you shut it

26:32.360 --> 26:38.160
down Matt what is your computer hygiene approach for me I tend to leave most most

26:38.160 --> 26:41.800
of the time I leave stuff on if there's like a lightning storm or I'm like

26:41.800 --> 26:45.760
changing out a UPS or something then I might actually turn things off but for

26:45.760 --> 26:49.800
the most part I just leave everything on I do too especially in the studio where

26:49.800 --> 26:54.880
I've definitely noticed when I shut stuff down I always have problems for

26:54.880 --> 27:00.600
example I put the screen to sleep on the bonobo before I left the studio earlier

27:00.600 --> 27:04.440
today and when I got back the capture system was no longer working because it

27:04.440 --> 27:07.560
detected the screen went blank and so it shut off the HDMI capture port and I had

27:07.560 --> 27:10.640
to reboot everything to get stuff working where if I just left it all on

27:10.640 --> 27:15.000
it would be working when I got back I keep my server running but that's

27:15.000 --> 27:18.520
because it's running an SSD and shuts down its external hard drive when it

27:18.520 --> 27:23.800
needs to yeah so I leave it running I'll probably update it like maybe once a

27:23.800 --> 27:26.440
week just to make sure the security updates are good to go but other than

27:26.440 --> 27:30.160
that it just stays running I don't have to worry about it mm-hmm mm-hmm I've

27:30.160 --> 27:34.120
never considered that about Chrome jobs or cleaning up or anything I just

27:34.120 --> 27:40.240
suspend the device and wake it up when I want to use it yeah yeah I definitely do

27:40.240 --> 27:44.240
some of my laptops that way it depends for me the desktops I leave on 24-7 the

27:44.240 --> 27:49.080
laptops I sleep yeah I sleep my laptop as well if I'm not around I just close

27:49.080 --> 27:53.640
the lid and it sleeps yeah and I never hibernate ever well it's just these days

27:53.640 --> 27:56.200
there's too much you have too much RAM so you have to have a huge hibernation

27:56.200 --> 28:01.680
file sitting around and when you got an SSD that's expensive it's faster I just

28:01.680 --> 28:06.120
for me I just end up shutting it off because you know I booted up in ten

28:06.120 --> 28:09.520
seconds later my computers up and running and already opening programs

28:09.520 --> 28:17.760
automatic yeah my Chrome has got like a thousand tabs open just to reload them

28:17.760 --> 28:21.480
after a review so I just suspend and wake out it's fun my wife has that same

28:21.480 --> 28:25.880
problem but for me it of the too many tabs open but for me it just becomes I'm

28:25.880 --> 28:29.320
just accessing my laptop so often that if I had to start it up and shut it down

28:29.320 --> 28:36.060
constantly that's all I would do all day yeah all right Josh was saying that you

28:36.060 --> 28:40.160
know you know spins up in ten seconds anyway so if you just shut it down yeah

28:40.160 --> 28:43.280
it's not a problem especially if we're running Linux if we're running Windows

28:43.280 --> 28:46.760
and it decides oh I need to install this update then you're gonna have a little

28:46.760 --> 28:50.800
bit of time to wait yeah that's a point where suspend comes in handy a whole lot

28:50.800 --> 28:53.920
more TV K in the chair in the chat room says that he just suspends to save his

28:53.920 --> 28:56.240
power bill you know just to save on power wimpy you were gonna make a

28:56.240 --> 29:01.960
mention about Z RAM right yeah so I've been I've switched as Z RAM for all of

29:01.960 --> 29:06.200
my system so I've done away with swap and therefore have no hibernate

29:06.200 --> 29:11.200
capability on my laptops anymore because without swap partition you can't

29:11.200 --> 29:15.240
hibernate unless you install some of those user space tools so but Z RAM

29:15.240 --> 29:20.240
works really well and if you've got SSDs it's a nice way to give yourself some

29:20.240 --> 29:26.000
relief if your systems under memory pressure very nice so there's our take

29:26.000 --> 29:29.160
on if we hibernate sleep or shut down it seems like it's a little bit of a mix

29:29.160 --> 29:33.640
but I'm hearing a lot of leave-ons especially for desktops very interesting

29:33.640 --> 29:38.080
I also I'd leave the bonobo in a 24-7 because this in the studio but it was a

29:38.080 --> 29:42.360
beast man and the nice thing about bonobos it's well-ventilated so alright

29:42.360 --> 29:46.640
so I want to move in to the topic that was sparked after Sunday's coverage of

29:46.640 --> 29:52.400
Ubuntu 1410 and before we get into that so in the Linux action show subreddit

29:52.400 --> 29:57.240
and in the email there are a lot of people that apparently decided that I am

29:57.240 --> 30:01.400
very biased against Ubuntu and one of the reasons decided was that I skipped

30:01.400 --> 30:04.840
over talking Unity's touch support when we were talking about gnome 3.14 I just

30:04.840 --> 30:07.760
want to clear the ground right now just quickly mentioned that was not me

30:07.760 --> 30:11.880
sliding unity at all that was just me focusing on gnome 3.14 because we were

30:11.880 --> 30:15.640
covering gnome 3.14 we were not covering what unity can do we were covering what

30:15.640 --> 30:19.920
gnome can do so I just didn't mention it doesn't mean I was intentionally because

30:19.920 --> 30:22.920
I don't like it leaving it out it was because I was talking about gnome and

30:22.920 --> 30:27.320
what gnome was adding and what Wayland was adding so but there is more

30:27.320 --> 30:32.880
contention over our coverage of Ubuntu 1410 itself it's probably you know

30:32.880 --> 30:35.600
people you know what Matt people hate crickets I think is what it is people

30:35.600 --> 30:38.080
just hate cricket I think it is yeah I think the crickets may have been

30:38.080 --> 30:43.560
something that kind of set folks off yeah it's just too much I think and I

30:43.560 --> 30:47.400
think all of that people have explosions a lot of it boils down to a

30:47.400 --> 30:54.480
misunderstanding of I think a lot of people attributed it to arch fanboyism

30:54.480 --> 30:58.600
on my part and that I was such an arch fanboy that I was putting Ubuntu down

30:58.600 --> 31:02.280
because of it and I think a lot of it was probably coming from people who

31:02.280 --> 31:07.400
haven't watched the shows for a long time because I think you know people

31:07.400 --> 31:12.200
sometimes what happens is people see that I am pro something I you know I was

31:12.200 --> 31:15.360
very pro Ubuntu very pro unity of the desktop for a long time I still think

31:15.360 --> 31:22.600
it's a good desktop and so because I was pro something for a long time it is to

31:22.600 --> 31:28.400
them illogical that I would now say something that is not pro because you

31:28.400 --> 31:31.320
know once you like something you're supposed to like it forever but I think

31:31.320 --> 31:35.200
people who watch me know that my opinions change over time based on

31:35.200 --> 31:39.320
results and the way things go I'll give you a great example I think you could go

31:39.320 --> 31:43.800
back in time and you could clearly see episodes where I was slamming on fedora

31:43.800 --> 31:49.240
pretty handily slamming on fedora for maybe the entire review now my position

31:49.240 --> 31:54.640
on fedora has changed quite a bit as they sort of are addressing some of

31:54.640 --> 31:58.160
these problems I would say I still approach fedora with some tepidation and

31:58.160 --> 32:02.720
and some level of skepticism but I am I am impressed with the changes they're

32:02.720 --> 32:05.680
making I'm impressed with their project leader obviously we've had them on the

32:05.680 --> 32:09.960
show twice in a few weeks and it's in the times of course the second time

32:09.960 --> 32:14.080
wasn't really about fedora but so it you know it was funny because in that very

32:14.080 --> 32:16.640
episode of people say well Chris is such an arch fanboy they were completely

32:16.640 --> 32:19.760
negating the fact that we have like a 25 minute interview with the lead of the

32:19.760 --> 32:25.560
project of the fedora project my point is it's not a bias towards arch that

32:25.560 --> 32:31.880
influences my reporting on Ubuntu I don't have any distribution bias at all

32:31.880 --> 32:37.480
that would be ridiculous the reason I go with arch is because it does everything

32:37.480 --> 32:42.280
I needed to do and it doesn't feel like a distribution it doesn't have politics

32:42.280 --> 32:48.200
it doesn't have councils it doesn't have advisory boards it just is and you don't

32:48.200 --> 32:52.000
have to worry about the politics and the people it just it feels just like a

32:52.000 --> 32:56.280
meta layer on top of Linux that's why I like arch just I could just as easily

32:56.280 --> 33:00.120
switch to fedora next when they've got that rolling I could see that happening

33:00.120 --> 33:04.080
in you know in the next year or so I don't have allegiance to any one

33:04.080 --> 33:09.280
particular distribution I do have a bias though and that bias is a bias towards

33:09.280 --> 33:14.120
winning people who are doing it right people who are producing results people

33:14.120 --> 33:19.120
who are coming through on what they say they will do and as a company any

33:19.120 --> 33:23.060
project doesn't have to be Ubuntu as any project slides in one direction or the

33:23.060 --> 33:28.760
other my coverage of that project will reflect that slide so if they say now

33:28.760 --> 33:31.560
I'm sorry Poby but let's just say there were supposed to be two phones already

33:31.560 --> 33:34.880
in the marketplace let's just say Mir was already supposed to ship let's say

33:34.880 --> 33:38.680
that Ubuntu 1410 is the most boring Linux desktop release we've ever seen

33:38.680 --> 33:42.440
from the most important distro maker out there let's accept all of these things

33:42.440 --> 33:47.100
as genuine facts unfortunate facts but let's just accept those things me

33:47.100 --> 33:51.360
reporting on that does not mean I have an Ubuntu agenda where I want to tear

33:51.360 --> 33:56.200
Ubuntu down it's me reporting on the state of Ubuntu one of the more

33:56.200 --> 34:00.440
important distributions in the market it's not coming from an arch influence

34:00.440 --> 34:05.520
it's coming from following these things and maybe a little disappointment does

34:05.520 --> 34:09.280
that make sense like Matt can you fill in am I missing any gaps here I think

34:09.280 --> 34:13.000
you pretty much hit it I mean it's you know it's basically different it really

34:13.000 --> 34:15.480
boils down to different strokes for different folks I think it's just word

34:15.480 --> 34:19.680
is at the end of the day and for you you have a specific set of expectations that

34:19.680 --> 34:22.840
one distro or another may or may not be meeting and that could of course change

34:22.840 --> 34:26.760
over time I think what I'm I think what I'm trying to get to is it feels like

34:26.760 --> 34:32.040
the conversation I don't know if poisoned is the right word or derailed

34:32.040 --> 34:38.160
but the rails right this latching on to oh well he's just saying that because

34:38.160 --> 34:44.560
he's a fanboy or Chris is too biased by arch to cover it just me saying that out

34:44.560 --> 34:51.440
loud sounds ridiculous and childish I would the concept that I would have some

34:51.440 --> 34:54.620
sort of allegiance to some Linux distribution that would influence my

34:54.620 --> 34:59.520
coverage of it is ridiculous what I will do is identify a Linux distribution that

34:59.520 --> 35:03.120
does something interesting and if they're doing that something better than

35:03.120 --> 35:07.280
everybody else is I might suggest those other distributions try to adopt some of

35:07.280 --> 35:12.560
those things but that doesn't make them invalid I've used every distribution out

35:12.560 --> 35:16.280
there I also don't report much on Mandriva do I that doesn't mean I have

35:16.280 --> 35:20.320
an anti Mandriva bias it just means they're not really moving the needle

35:20.320 --> 35:23.320
much these days so they don't really work their way up into the coverage very

35:23.320 --> 35:27.400
often well I think it's also worth mentioning it's someone will undoubtedly

35:27.400 --> 35:31.000
point out okay then why are why do we does it appear that we quote-unquote

35:31.000 --> 35:34.720
rip on a boon to but not on Mandriva and my response to that would be simply

35:34.720 --> 35:38.600
because we have a set of expectations for this particular distro one that

35:38.600 --> 35:42.000
we've had a lot of great experiences with and we just simply want to see

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
certain things addressed and that's not happening the realm for myself

35:45.000 --> 35:49.720
Ubuntu's relevance in the marketplace makes it more likely to receive

35:49.720 --> 35:53.480
criticism and it also makes it more likely to receive praise and hype I mean

35:53.480 --> 35:57.040
there there's two sides to that coin absolutely higher expectations and so

35:57.040 --> 35:59.760
like in the chat rooms pointing out why do we dog on Mir and not wait on well

35:59.760 --> 36:04.200
actually I don't really think we dog on Mir in fact if you trace the here in the

36:04.200 --> 36:09.040
last no but if you trace the history of our show back when Mir was announced we

36:09.040 --> 36:12.400
were some of the biggest defenders of hey let him try it let him give give

36:12.400 --> 36:17.220
him space and let him do something and we took so much shit for that like Matt

36:17.220 --> 36:21.640
nice stuff in a monkey suit exactly exactly I brought the monkey suit to be

36:21.640 --> 36:25.440
like we were there like saying let him give him a shot and the thing is is

36:25.440 --> 36:27.800
it's not that we don't want them to still have a shot it's just the

36:27.800 --> 36:31.760
fundamental fact is we're still waiting that was that was a long time ago that's

36:31.760 --> 36:36.920
fine that's these things take time but results at the end of the day are what

36:36.920 --> 36:40.860
we have to report on that's what we have here to talk about that's what the

36:40.860 --> 36:46.160
discussion is about that's the reality and so when OMG Ubuntu is in bold and

36:46.160 --> 36:51.040
italic saying there's no new features not even a new wallpaper what is the

36:51.040 --> 36:55.120
Linux action show supposed to say what dick am I supposed to suck to make all

36:55.120 --> 37:02.080
of you happy because there is no dick I can find holy shit pretty much right I

37:02.080 --> 37:08.240
mean seriously yeah there I mean I I was so we are working right now on a

37:08.240 --> 37:12.680
different approach to our Ubuntu reviews that I think it was producer Eric's idea

37:12.680 --> 37:17.080
and I think it's a really solid idea it'll make our Ubuntu 14.10 reviews

37:17.080 --> 37:21.080
extremely interesting but it is requiring a completely reformulation of

37:21.080 --> 37:24.760
the way we approach a Linux distribution because we have to find something to

37:24.760 --> 37:27.920
talk about to talk about otherwise we just wouldn't review it and that doesn't

37:27.920 --> 37:32.760
seem like a good option either I have covered this distribution for a long

37:32.760 --> 37:36.280
time and I've never been at a point where I've literally had no idea what to

37:36.280 --> 37:40.800
say other than bad things so I'm working so we're working on a new formula to

37:40.800 --> 37:44.080
come up give the respin some attention and and and really kind of have a nice

37:44.080 --> 37:47.640
comprehensive look at it I'm pretty happy with where we're going with it but

37:47.640 --> 37:51.240
it's required a total adjustment of our approach because of the situation we now

37:51.240 --> 37:55.560
find ourselves in and I feel like you know there's a lot of energy being put

37:55.560 --> 37:59.520
in by our community there's about five threads in the Linux action show sub

37:59.520 --> 38:03.400
reddit right now if you count threads that have also devolved into this topic

38:03.400 --> 38:06.640
so there's two or three primary threads and one or two that have devolved into

38:06.640 --> 38:11.560
this topic currently live in the Linux action show subreddit claiming that we

38:11.560 --> 38:16.840
are so far off base with Ubuntu 1410 because of our biases and etc etc it's

38:16.840 --> 38:21.160
there's no way for me to tell you this there's no anti Ubuntu agenda here

38:21.160 --> 38:26.160
there's no arch bias here there is a bias towards winning there is some

38:26.160 --> 38:30.200
Linux elitism because we've been Linux users for a very long time and we start

38:30.200 --> 38:32.560
to know when something smells like shit and we start to know when something's

38:32.560 --> 38:36.800
winning and we call it like it is there I will grant you those things bias

38:36.800 --> 38:40.480
towards winning and an elitism that isn't arch elitism it's just a Linux

38:40.480 --> 38:45.200
user elitism that just it's just there because honestly after you see enough of

38:45.200 --> 38:49.040
this crap you start to tell people get off your lawn it's not a function of

38:49.040 --> 38:53.640
being against Ubuntu it's just calling a spade a spade or whatever the saying is

38:53.640 --> 38:57.800
I don't even know it's just that's what that's where we're at right now and I I

38:57.800 --> 39:01.560
want to address this because I'm seeing there's a lot of energy being put into

39:01.560 --> 39:05.160
this so here's a great and there's some great posts I mean like a lot of thought

39:05.160 --> 39:10.320
is being put into this stuff but it's kind of it's kind of misguided in the

39:10.320 --> 39:17.440
sense that the trouble is we we will continue to say if something's bad we

39:17.440 --> 39:21.760
will I believe it is our responsibility if something isn't going right we cannot

39:21.760 --> 39:26.600
sit here on this show it is the number one watch Linux media I cannot sit on

39:26.600 --> 39:30.080
that show and say something is great when it's not great it is our

39:30.080 --> 39:34.280
responsibility in any way we can to help these things move along in the right

39:34.280 --> 39:37.880
direction if that's just our voice that's just echoing the thought of some

39:37.880 --> 39:42.080
users that's fine if other projects watch this stuff and go hmm maybe we

39:42.080 --> 39:45.560
should rethink this that's great it doesn't really matter but we we have to

39:45.560 --> 39:49.600
be genuine to what we believe and you have to understand that it's it's not

39:49.600 --> 39:53.640
it's not about us going after shuttleworth or making poppy cry or

39:53.640 --> 39:58.080
anything like that because at the end of the day if you watch the show long

39:58.080 --> 40:02.200
enough you will know that if they start producing results if in 2015 we start

40:02.200 --> 40:05.880
seeing several great phone models come out and and it's kind of great and you

40:05.880 --> 40:09.600
know down the road by unity 8's got its bugs worked out and it's great and

40:09.600 --> 40:15.840
mirrors we will be beyond elated to cover that on the show I love covering

40:15.840 --> 40:20.700
stuff that rocks under Linux that's why the word action is in the Linux action

40:20.700 --> 40:25.640
show we like covering the stuff that kicks the most ass every single week in

40:25.640 --> 40:31.440
Linux and open source I will be the happiest person trust me I nobody will

40:31.440 --> 40:35.240
be happier than Chris because it'll be great content for the Linux action show

40:35.240 --> 40:38.720
when they have something that we all love go ahead Bobby you got your mic

40:38.720 --> 40:43.400
open you might as well go so there's a few things I I didn't know about your

40:43.400 --> 40:47.000
review and because I was away at a conference over that's someone that's

40:47.000 --> 40:50.920
fine and then someone pointed out to me and so I I watched it a bit earlier on

40:50.920 --> 40:57.200
and there's a few things that struck me one was that you kind of missed the fact

40:57.200 --> 41:02.120
that we've been saying all through this release that the focus is on phone we've

41:02.120 --> 41:13.240
said it over and over again right but you've waited until beta release before

41:13.240 --> 41:17.120
you decide to review it and then say it sucks because of what we've been saying

41:17.120 --> 41:22.960
on the desktop this is this is specifically this specifically why I

41:22.960 --> 41:27.440
aired those concerns when we were talking about the beta release because I

41:27.440 --> 41:30.320
want to put all that out on the table and I don't want it to influence the

41:30.320 --> 41:33.680
review it's out there now now it's not gonna be part of the review see what I

41:33.680 --> 41:38.880
was essentially doing was taking that and and and extracting that bit of what

41:38.880 --> 41:42.000
would have been in the review and putting it in that news bit and now when

41:42.000 --> 41:46.920
the review comes we have a that's not a review don't that us covering something

41:46.920 --> 41:49.640
then I'm picking on you about this because we get this all the time us

41:49.640 --> 41:56.880
covering a news item is not us reviewing something in the show and you specifically

41:56.880 --> 42:02.320
said that we make a big song and dance about it which we didn't we've mailed a

42:02.320 --> 42:06.800
mailing list saying the beta is out OMG post an article about it that doesn't

42:06.800 --> 42:10.200
mean we've made a song and dance about 1410 we haven't made a song no no no I

42:10.200 --> 42:13.680
because we're not focused on it no I think Matt's point there was that there

42:13.680 --> 42:18.480
used to be a song and dance and now you specifically said about there being a

42:18.480 --> 42:23.080
someone does anyway that that was one thing was you know why why bring it up

42:23.080 --> 42:26.600
when you know we keep saying this is not a big release it's not the first big

42:26.600 --> 42:32.640
release that's that's not been that's not had made because it's more unusual

42:32.640 --> 42:37.400
for the in-between LTS is to be so boring it's more often you know the LTS

42:37.400 --> 42:41.160
is about the refinement the polish and then that the big experimentation

42:41.160 --> 42:44.680
happens in the dot-10 release and that's always the one really 610 didn't change

42:44.680 --> 42:48.360
much 1210 didn't change a lot but 1210 have the shopping lens so everybody had

42:48.360 --> 42:52.240
something to talk about right well I think a lot of interesting things that

42:52.240 --> 42:55.920
happened in the 10 releases and shopping lens is obviously the big one and this

42:55.920 --> 43:00.200
one those were both post LTS releases right that's my point they didn't have

43:00.200 --> 43:04.240
yeah and they didn't have tremendously huge game-changing things are you going

43:04.240 --> 43:08.160
back to 610 I mean that's well that was the first one that came to mind okay

43:08.160 --> 43:11.400
because the ones in the middle of the head the ones the ones after that had unity

43:11.400 --> 43:15.920
and obviously that's a massive yeah exactly I mean so yeah the other thing

43:15.920 --> 43:19.400
is there's it's not just a bun to you you know that not a lot has changed in

43:19.400 --> 43:24.880
a bun to but then there's come into the bun to use of them to but that's so

43:24.880 --> 43:27.680
that's it yeah I agree that's where the interesting stuff is happening district

43:27.680 --> 43:32.280
right well oh oh now now they're just one flavors now now when that's the only

43:32.280 --> 43:35.360
place where the innovation is happening now Ubuntu is just one of the many

43:35.360 --> 43:38.040
flavors but of course when all the innovations happening one of the many

43:38.040 --> 43:41.280
now of course of course it always yet they're just yeah it's just one of it's

43:41.280 --> 43:44.520
the main dog and the point is is all the innovation all the excitement is

43:44.520 --> 43:48.640
happening in all of the other flavors which you know it worked great over a

43:48.640 --> 43:52.200
lot it was a lot of excitement going on in any of the others either oh ouch to

43:52.200 --> 43:58.560
be honest dude look at them at a kabuntus got plasma 5 preview dude

43:58.560 --> 44:03.920
that's great that's that's you and that's not that's not in the archive the

44:03.920 --> 44:08.840
release that's a preview ISO isn't it in the same way that unity 8 next and is a

44:08.840 --> 44:12.760
preview ISO also the mate project isn't officially in a boom to flavor it seems

44:12.760 --> 44:16.600
like there's a common thread which is one that I didn't list my point is

44:16.600 --> 44:19.880
really because it's not an official you don't think it's a problem that all of

44:19.880 --> 44:23.760
the interesting things are happening all of the distros based off you I didn't

44:23.760 --> 44:28.800
say that I said there are other distros that there are other flavors of Ubuntu

44:28.800 --> 44:32.420
and there are interesting things going on there you only focused on Ubuntu you

44:32.420 --> 44:36.680
didn't mention any of the others because that's the point I was making those

44:36.680 --> 44:40.080
others were gonna those are again this wasn't a full review this is an

44:40.080 --> 44:44.480
announcement of the Ubuntu 1410 beta right well in fact you don't see doesn't

44:44.480 --> 44:48.320
participate in the the alphas and betas as much as all the others do so it would

44:48.320 --> 44:51.400
be more interesting to talk about all the others on this particular release oh

44:51.400 --> 44:56.080
I like how your tell okay oh okay right so poppy you don't know is that no it's

44:56.080 --> 44:59.520
not fair to say that these these guys are all participating and building up

44:59.520 --> 45:05.520
you don't see the justification you're doing here you don't see how how by you

45:05.520 --> 45:08.200
don't see the deferment that's happening by saying well yeah of course nothing's

45:08.200 --> 45:11.100
happening in Ubuntu but don't pay attention to main Ubuntu don't pay

45:11.100 --> 45:13.680
attention to the most important distribution don't put the attention all

45:13.680 --> 45:16.280
the one that has all the people officially working for canonical on pay

45:16.280 --> 45:19.600
attention all the ones based off of us pay attention to these guys over here

45:19.600 --> 45:24.080
this is a total change just saying that these others are just as important as

45:24.080 --> 45:28.180
Ubuntu in this that's not true at all that's not true at all and you know

45:28.180 --> 45:32.040
that's not true at all no that is not true they are very important but they

45:32.040 --> 45:35.400
are not as important as going to I don't believe that they're not as important

45:35.400 --> 45:43.840
come on come on no I don't we have an archive that has a variety of desktops

45:43.840 --> 45:47.600
and more than there are flavors you know there's lots of other desktops in the

45:47.600 --> 45:52.040
archive that are important in fact Marty is now in the archive as well and

45:52.040 --> 45:59.560
they're all important none of them are I love all my children I know I know years

45:59.560 --> 46:04.040
ago Katie felt themselves as the blue-headed stepchild and that was

46:04.040 --> 46:09.960
that was frustrating because we put a lot of work I'm just gonna put that out

46:09.960 --> 46:17.240
there so I think I think you know when you're entitled to your opinion of

46:17.240 --> 46:21.040
course I just think it's not an opinion I mean yes my opinion that it is

46:21.040 --> 46:24.960
discipline where the opinion comes in is in my disappointment but the fact of

46:24.960 --> 46:30.160
the matter is there really is nothing to talk about right okay but you could

46:30.160 --> 46:34.880
argue that that's the same thing with every LTS this isn't an LTS release no

46:34.880 --> 46:37.680
this none of the same package with every every time there's something that the

46:37.680 --> 46:41.720
release right after an LTS it always happens it's just more refinement to the

46:41.720 --> 46:47.880
route to the LTS 10 12 10 14 10 it's the same you just you just listed all the

46:47.880 --> 46:51.720
ones where they rolled out major changes to the unity dash including search and

46:51.720 --> 46:54.880
privacy features just the ones you just named where there was massive changes

46:54.880 --> 47:03.400
no the the 10 10 was known to 12 10 was a slight changes with the the adding

47:03.400 --> 47:08.560
search adding Amazon search to change that's a huge change as far as

47:08.560 --> 47:12.360
functionality it's the same I mean it's nice like it's basically I don't want to

47:12.360 --> 47:15.620
argue version numbers you add Amazon search to the dashboard that's a big

47:15.620 --> 47:19.240
change there's a lot to talk about when you're an LTS just being an LTS that's

47:19.240 --> 47:25.520
something to talk about okay you guys and we're getting down into the weeds of

47:25.520 --> 47:29.080
what versions of Ubuntu have what features the important part is what we

47:29.080 --> 47:32.640
really what I want to make walk walking from is a that wasn't a review okay we're

47:32.640 --> 47:35.480
going to do something different for the actual review where we'll look at we'll

47:35.480 --> 47:39.640
take a look at the spin so so don't consider that like our final opinion on

47:39.640 --> 47:46.840
Ubuntu 1410 however we are at an interesting point in Ubuntu's history

47:46.840 --> 47:50.800
right now we're kind of in the thick of it and we are documenting what happens

47:50.800 --> 47:55.480
while they are making this huge huge huge transition this is what happens

47:55.480 --> 47:59.760
right now we don't know and we're not casting what's going to happen we're not

47:59.760 --> 48:03.840
projecting what's going to happen but what we do know is right now what we

48:03.840 --> 48:07.840
get what so what we will get in the long run is potentially a competitive mobile

48:07.840 --> 48:10.600
operating system that has some great features that could tie in really nicely

48:10.600 --> 48:14.320
with desktops and offer power Linux users a great experience but what we

48:14.320 --> 48:18.520
have today is not a great experience for Linux power users today and that's what

48:18.520 --> 48:22.560
we're documenting the fact that we could be released 1210 doesn't make 1204

48:22.560 --> 48:27.400
instantly or that sorry 40 dead doesn't make 1404 instantly obsolete actually I

48:27.400 --> 48:32.320
think that's the interesting thing about 1410 is in a lot of ways it doesn't

48:32.320 --> 48:37.640
change 1404 relevance at all you add a few PPAs to 1404 you don't have to

48:37.640 --> 48:42.600
change anything right right and we do hardware enablement kernels and XOR

48:42.600 --> 48:50.600
back ports to the LTS release so yeah so you could you could consider 1410 to be

48:50.600 --> 48:56.560
not exciting not that much going on so fine that that's happened in the past

48:56.560 --> 49:02.600
we're focused on other stuff and we'll come back to desktop next release I kind

49:02.600 --> 49:08.320
of feel like I mean so why am I getting beat up on for saying that I don't know

49:08.320 --> 49:14.560
I that's I was quite surprised myself that people reacted so badly I my only

49:14.560 --> 49:18.600
point was that you only focused on Ubuntu I didn't focus on the other that

49:18.600 --> 49:21.880
was a little sleight of hand because I plan to focus more on the respins later

49:21.880 --> 49:25.080
and I figured I'd get that criticism out of the way so that way wasn't in the

49:25.080 --> 49:29.920
review it's all sort of pre setting up the review it's me kind of so like so

49:29.920 --> 49:33.800
some of this was was format formatting for the show for the arc of the story

49:33.800 --> 49:37.520
here like I didn't talk about unity's multi-touch support because we had just

49:37.520 --> 49:40.720
talked about that and I was talking about no so people took that as me

49:40.720 --> 49:44.200
sliding unity and then when we got to the Ubuntu 1410 discussion I didn't

49:44.200 --> 49:46.880
really talk about the remixes and the reflavors because that's what we're

49:46.880 --> 49:50.160
gonna focus on in the review because what the hell else can we focus on and I

49:50.160 --> 49:52.600
don't want to just spend the whole review criticizing all of the mistakes

49:52.600 --> 49:57.300
and we retrashing the software center like we like we often do so we got it

49:57.300 --> 50:00.960
out right there in the new segment now it's done now it's sort of like it's

50:00.960 --> 50:04.440
it's setting up the narrative for the review setting up the expectations

50:04.440 --> 50:08.920
setting up the state of things and then what I'm really looking forward to this

50:08.920 --> 50:14.040
review this sounds awesome and then we deliver well we'll see I mean maybe not

50:14.040 --> 50:19.480
you know and so I guess people kind of jumped down like our throats for a lot

50:19.480 --> 50:23.120
lately whenever we kind of bring up the topic of Ubuntu and it sort of feels

50:23.120 --> 50:27.640
like there's an expectation that we really should only talk about the good

50:27.640 --> 50:32.800
stuff and I could agree there could be more good stuff we talk about yeah we

50:32.800 --> 50:36.080
get grief for that too though yeah exactly well that was that was the thing

50:36.080 --> 50:39.800
is like we used to get a ton of grief about that but this week it was

50:39.800 --> 50:42.960
particularly strong so I don't know if we've helped I don't know if we've made

50:42.960 --> 50:48.560
any sense in any of this but I I definitely want I want to tamp down I

50:48.560 --> 50:52.680
want to I find it insulting I find it personally insulting to be called an

50:52.680 --> 50:57.960
arch fanboy because it implies that I am so simple-minded that my preference for

50:57.960 --> 51:03.480
one distribution over another would somehow like infect how I think about

51:03.480 --> 51:07.840
everything in my life when really there was one other thing oh yeah I forgot to

51:07.840 --> 51:11.800
mention the the known release schedule meaning that we don't have the latest

51:11.800 --> 51:17.480
and greatest known in you know okay that was that you know that's that's kind of

51:17.480 --> 51:21.880
sad and it's a bit frustrating that we can't sink those things up it would be

51:21.880 --> 51:26.000
nice if we could but you know our six months releases have been like that for

51:26.000 --> 51:30.640
ten years and when we had known as a desktop I think we made exceptions and

51:30.640 --> 51:35.600
would pull it in at the last minute yeah but now now GNOME isn't our default

51:35.600 --> 51:41.800
desktop so you know should we should we bust a gut to get GNOME in there for the

51:41.800 --> 51:45.800
final release when it isn't even our default desktop I agree I think and the

51:45.800 --> 51:49.260
fact that there is a pretty good PPA system in place where you can grab the

51:49.260 --> 51:52.440
the reason why and I don't think I said this in the show but the reason why I

51:52.440 --> 51:56.240
would love to see it just as a personal preference is a would definitely make

51:56.240 --> 51:59.560
Ubuntu feel much more like a contender for me to use as my daily driver but

51:59.560 --> 52:04.200
there's there's Ubuntu no meditation but also it's just kind of seems like maybe

52:04.200 --> 52:07.560
while unity isn't seen a lot of stuff why we're just going you know just small

52:07.560 --> 52:12.080
bug fixes here and there wouldn't it be really cool if there was a you know a

52:12.080 --> 52:16.320
very fresh being worked on desktop available to me to choose from and that

52:16.320 --> 52:21.320
would be known 314 and to be honest with you I I honestly think a lot of Linux

52:21.320 --> 52:24.160
users are going to install for door 21 because it'll be one of the first

52:24.160 --> 52:27.120
distros that does known 314 out of the box and they will install it just for

52:27.120 --> 52:32.280
that reason alone and so if it would just be a nice feather in the buntu 14

52:32.280 --> 52:36.720
tens cap if it could be like a great way to get known 3.14 right out of the box

52:36.720 --> 52:39.560
that's why I kind of brought it up because I think that would be a great

52:39.560 --> 52:43.440
combo while unity's kind of on the shelf but I understand you know really

52:43.440 --> 52:48.000
schedules and whatnot that's just how it goes and the PPA solve that that's fine

52:48.000 --> 52:51.280
chat room mentions you know maybe it's not what we're talking but maybe it's

52:51.280 --> 52:56.680
how it's brought up I think maybe that's potentially true but at the end of the

52:56.680 --> 53:00.320
day you have to understand that we have to provide some level of entertainment

53:00.320 --> 53:03.920
too so there has to be something to engage people there has to be something

53:03.920 --> 53:07.760
that makes people really feel passionate and want to you know engage with us

53:07.760 --> 53:12.480
because sometimes if you just keep it really dry and boring people get bored

53:12.480 --> 53:16.120
and they tune out so sometimes it might be if it's presented in a certain way

53:16.120 --> 53:18.640
that you find offensive consider that maybe it's being presented in a certain

53:18.640 --> 53:23.800
way to grab attention well the love of God people stop being so friggin

53:23.800 --> 53:28.600
sensitive I mean that's my first and foremost I recommend a boom to everybody

53:28.600 --> 53:32.000
I do and I rip on them hard because I've high expectations everyone I know that

53:32.000 --> 53:35.840
recently switched to Linux is using a boom to and I will continue to do so

53:35.840 --> 53:40.800
because it's a good distro I will also continue to rip on it because I care so

53:40.800 --> 53:45.480
I'll throw the I'll throw this in for you Chris today I installed fedora 21

53:45.480 --> 53:59.600
or 20 and possess you to do so such a thing so I just I don't know I don't

53:59.600 --> 54:02.160
know if we're gonna ever resolve this because it's it's such a fundamental

54:02.160 --> 54:04.760
like I understand you know you guys are really passionate about some of these

54:04.760 --> 54:08.320
projects some of you don't just contribute you know your your voice but

54:08.320 --> 54:12.640
you also contribute your time and your code and I don't I don't want to

54:12.640 --> 54:15.760
discourage anybody from volunteering on any open source project they're into and

54:15.760 --> 54:20.800
I hope I hope you will maybe consider just stick with us for a little bit and

54:20.800 --> 54:27.340
consider that our opinions are not I think it's a benefit to be somebody who

54:27.340 --> 54:30.520
constantly reevaluates the way they think about things and their opinions of

54:30.520 --> 54:34.720
things and you can see over time those will transition there's a lot of things

54:34.720 --> 54:37.720
over the history of the Linux action show where we came down pretty hard on

54:37.720 --> 54:42.720
something and as they were as those things were addressed our I mean I know

54:42.720 --> 54:47.320
is another one gnome 3 oh yeah right I mean no and the reason was is at first

54:47.320 --> 54:50.960
gnome 3 was no good it just was no good and it has gotten a lot better and now

54:50.960 --> 54:56.880
our our tone our coverage of gnome has changed to reflect that it's it's just

54:56.880 --> 54:59.840
kind of natural if you think about it it's not that weird it just it does it's

54:59.840 --> 55:03.480
it just kind of it's not a fanboy thing it's it's just actions people out of

55:03.480 --> 55:07.760
them words and here's a tip for folks that want to that want to bring up a

55:07.760 --> 55:11.840
legitimate point if they want to bring up legitimate concerns like I have a

55:11.840 --> 55:15.560
concern with blank and they want to address that concern directly that's a

55:15.560 --> 55:19.800
conversation like what we did here today if they're in the reddit you know on

55:19.800 --> 55:22.200
reddit and they're all that oh that's just they're just ranting and raving

55:22.200 --> 55:26.520
if they're not bringing up specifics it's noise I don't care if they bring up

55:26.520 --> 55:29.960
specifics it's a conversation that's your differentiator if they're not

55:29.960 --> 55:32.520
having a conversation to waste your time with them if they want to talk about

55:32.520 --> 55:36.600
specifics like we did today that's awesome because that's progress that's

55:36.600 --> 55:42.960
just my view I agree and yeah I I hope I hope that we'll find a good way to

55:42.960 --> 55:47.680
tackle Ubuntu 1410 and it's gonna be interesting too to see how the reviews

55:47.680 --> 55:52.200
go because yes a lot of people are gonna have to reformulate the way they review

55:52.200 --> 55:56.560
a distribution and I think some will do it successfully and others won't so

55:56.560 --> 55:59.640
we'll see how that works out yeah I think we just take tackle one thing at a

55:59.640 --> 56:03.480
time a concern point let's tackle that let's have the conversation move on to

56:03.480 --> 56:06.360
the next concern point and that's all we got to do I like points I think you've

56:06.360 --> 56:11.160
got to think yourself lucky that this release is a nice calm relaxed not too

56:11.160 --> 56:14.960
much changing going on in the next couple of releases you're gonna start

56:14.960 --> 56:20.640
seeing you know the conversion desktop new apps everywhere cute and everything

56:20.640 --> 56:27.520
so yeah I think it could be like we could be literally this time in a year

56:27.520 --> 56:29.840
so I'll be like gosh remember when we were complaining about it being boring

56:29.840 --> 56:39.600
gosh I think right now support for a lot of a bunch of desktops so this stuff

56:39.600 --> 56:43.640
matters to me you know certainly yeah yeah yeah maybe maybe yeah maybe it'll

56:43.640 --> 56:47.160
be a new market Matt speaking of a new market tings trying to make the mobile

56:47.160 --> 56:51.000
industry a brand new market let me tell you about ting calm go to Linux dot ting

56:51.000 --> 56:54.680
comm they're our next sponsor of the Linux almost a Linux action show I

56:54.680 --> 56:58.000
almost don't give don't give those jerks over the Linux action show credit they

56:58.000 --> 57:02.240
don't deserve it at all but I've heard they're just a bunch of Ubuntu hating

57:02.240 --> 57:05.240
arch fanboy jerks so don't give them any credit give these Linux unplug guys

57:05.240 --> 57:09.880
credit they're much nicer Linux dot ting comm that also take $25 off your first

57:09.880 --> 57:12.600
device if you've got a ting compatible device well then they'll give you a

57:12.600 --> 57:17.080
$25 credit that paid for more than my first month of service and and ting is

57:17.080 --> 57:20.360
always busting out ways for their customers to save money they have a blog

57:20.360 --> 57:24.600
post up right now over at ting comm slash blog but go to Linux dot ting comm first

57:24.600 --> 57:28.920
and it's basically here's how you can get free calls on ting it's essentially

57:28.920 --> 57:33.120
it's it's routing your calls using Google Hangouts over Wi-Fi and they just

57:33.120 --> 57:36.320
lay it all out there for you nothing about that think about what that means

57:36.320 --> 57:38.720
that means you're not gonna rack up as many minutes that means they're gonna

57:38.720 --> 57:43.660
make less money ting don't care they're honey badger no contracts no early

57:43.660 --> 57:47.880
termination fees and you only pay for what you use it's a flat six dollars a

57:47.880 --> 57:50.760
month and they take your minutes your messages your megabytes they add them

57:50.760 --> 57:53.840
all up whatever bucket you fall into at the end of the month son that's all you

57:53.840 --> 57:59.160
pay shoot can you believe that my bills like I mean I got I got three lines my

57:59.160 --> 58:02.640
bills like 40 bucks now but that's it for three lines I got three lines I got

58:02.640 --> 58:06.720
that's nuts for 40 bucks and that's with data and hotspot and tethering picture

58:06.720 --> 58:10.360
messaging caller ID all included of course I'm using a bunch of data and I

58:10.360 --> 58:13.440
don't use a lot of voice and if you flip it around it's just whatever you use

58:13.440 --> 58:17.040
more of that's just what you pay it's a really slick system and of course now

58:17.040 --> 58:20.680
ting is officially welcoming the iPhone 5s and 5c so if you've got a compatible

58:20.680 --> 58:24.440
device and you want to bring it over go get some more life out of your iPhone

58:24.440 --> 58:29.200
5c or 5s bring it over to ting with no contract no early termination fee it

58:29.200 --> 58:33.600
makes this a great device for kids too this is a really super way to get your

58:33.600 --> 58:36.640
kids something as a data connection but only pay when they actually use it which

58:36.640 --> 58:40.720
is nice they also have some great my fi hotspots of work excellent for that same

58:40.720 --> 58:45.040
kind of thing so go to linux.ting.com try out that savings calculator put in

58:45.040 --> 58:49.680
what you actually pay for right now so the the minute plan and them and the

58:49.680 --> 58:52.800
megabytes that you have to prepay for and the messages you have to prepay for

58:52.800 --> 58:58.560
plug all that in but just plug in your usage not not what you are paying for

58:58.560 --> 59:02.960
just what you actually use see that's the that's the entire difference with

59:02.960 --> 59:06.080
ting it's what you actually use you're not buying the prepaid stuff that the

59:06.080 --> 59:09.440
extra minutes in case you use them and they oh I might go over 4 gigs so I

59:09.440 --> 59:13.520
better get the 6 gig plan that's ridiculous and you go into that savings

59:13.520 --> 59:15.600
calculator and they'll show you how much you could really save you could be like

59:15.600 --> 59:19.440
rotten corpse and our chairman I think he was gonna save like 2500 bucks over

59:19.440 --> 59:22.640
two years he could get himself a new laptop every two years by switching to

59:22.640 --> 59:27.680
ting linux.ting.com they've got a great dashboard no cold no hold customer

59:27.680 --> 59:31.280
service too which is quite awesome so a big thank you to ting for sponsoring

59:31.280 --> 59:36.720
linux unplugged okay Matt moving right along I just got a quick topic I wanted

59:36.720 --> 59:39.760
to toss to you first Matt because you've been around a while and then we'll toss

59:39.760 --> 59:44.080
to the folks in the mumble room and it starts with an email we got from a non

59:44.080 --> 59:47.280
and it kind of got me thinking and I wanted to bounce it around from you guys

59:47.280 --> 59:51.200
and see what you think he says the bash bug shell shock I almost called it

59:51.200 --> 59:54.800
heartbeat shell shock blown totally out of proportion in regards to the

59:54.800 --> 59:58.680
structure without direct terminal access apart from slack code and CGI scripts

59:58.680 --> 01:00:03.920
and maybe PHP that's why this is way overblown it takes an exploit to run an

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.000
exploit with a script injection in my humble opinion it would need an exploit

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.540
to run shell shock I'm not sure embedded stuff but it doesn't seem like a big

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:16.160
deal to me media is playing it playing it way over there's a culture of cyber

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.400
threats now that is taking this stuff giving it fancy names logos websites

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:25.840
everybody's freaking out about it's on Good Morning America it's on CBS morning

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:29.520
news Matt is it legitimate are we finally seeing people get worried and

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:34.880
motivated to fix security problems or is this just the industry overreacting

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:40.160
creating jobs I don't think it's the industry overreacting I do think that

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:44.120
you will find that with non with folks that are not in the know that they're

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.500
looking at these types of situations and they generally happen on a kind of a

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:51.040
plateau or like a mountain type situation to where we'll reach our peak

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:56.280
of oh my god it's y2k and and then after after that's over with we'll have all

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.440
these extra food stocks and we'll be living on beans for the next oh my gosh

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:05.840
oh my gosh so you know I think it's one of those things now I think the bigger

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:10.120
problem that we have to remember is that most people outside of security and IT

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:15.000
will only care as long as the news cycle cares once the new cycles done they're

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.600
done and then the IT and security people are left picking up the pieces shaking

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.560
their heads going god people are idiots and I think that's really where we're at

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:26.040
so wimpy you said you had something brilliant from your local press there

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:32.040
yeah so I was sent an email over the weekend from a colleague of mine from a

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:35.040
newspaper that they were reading and they were like oh my goodness are we

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:42.080
safe and I thought I'd just read two paragraphs yeah okay so it starts a

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.560
government databases home computers and global websites are at risk from a

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:50.920
security floor found in hundreds of millions of devices the next paragraph

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:56.020
is called shell shock it could allow criminal gangs take control of computers

01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:01.320
and this is the bullshit smartphones and tablets it means credit card details

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:06.200
passwords and sensitive data are at risk of being stolen oh my goodness this

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:11.840
article goes on and on and on and it talks about computers and the web and

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:17.920
blah blah blah and you know what they mentioned Linux once hmm so I say that's

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:23.200
a yes is being overblown but is that a bad thing well it is because this is

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.960
what the likes of my mom and my dad read and they suddenly think that all of

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:33.640
their things are at risk creates a techno fear culture exactly and then

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:43.760
there's the people who are calling bash the bug yes right right yeah gosh that

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:48.360
is the when the worst you know when and this this this I'll call him out it's

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.800
been Spencer of the Daily Bail and he's apparently their science reporter yeah

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.880
and and the thing is is that these sorts of articles you know they're bullshit

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.620
when they refer to it so their headline is cyber loophole discovered and he

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:06.000
refers to cyber security experts well as soon as you put cyber in front of

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.340
security your article has got no credibility whatsoever cyber loophole

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:14.520
alert warning is computer security flaws puts millions at risk of exposure to

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:22.240
criminals that's a good I'm gonna save this one oh I love I love I love the

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:26.040
fear porn this is some good fear porn right here oh and here he is tweeting

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:34.160
examples of a vulnerable Mac oh it's just be censored from the planet please

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.920
I just want him out of there no kidding get him out of here well so go ahead

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:42.160
well I was just gonna follow up saying you know whilst whilst there is some

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:46.560
concern yeah over this and there are some ways that this could be exploited

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:51.560
but it's certainly not on smartphones and tablets you know it might be on some

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:56.160
aged Q mail server that you're running yeah mail filtering rules with a bash

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.440
script for example or it might be on some aged CGI server that you're you

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:07.120
know passing to you know a bash back end or something but this is this is not

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:11.840
quite the apocalypse that it's been drawn out to be I'm so glad that blaster

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:18.320
is also just as annoyed by the term cyber oh I'm so sick of it I'm so sick

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:27.720
of cyber it's just yeah who is it the FBI guy oh right yeah oh my gosh yeah

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:33.360
that was the worst that was really the worst yeah yeah cyber this cyber that

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.800
yeah they're really it's it's becoming like an industry around it it really is

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:42.400
truly becoming this sick sort of make money off of the fear people who have

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:48.200
no computer skills no text no technical expertise at all can sit here and pump

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:52.520
up the fear about this stuff they just jump on it they glom onto these

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:57.680
situations and and they just they make it the war like they just scare

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:10.280
everybody it is yeah I don't know it is very much so all right guys well so I

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:15.640
had a I had a couple other things I wanted to touch on I think I think I

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:19.720
wanted to read this post that Andrew and I'm sure I'm not gonna get Andrew a I'll

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:23.160
just say and just get your take on this and then we'll move on from the bash bug

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:31.880
thing but he said a dear clueless assholes stop bashing bash and GNU right

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.480
there on the screen it says that this is a defense of the most

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.040
prolific and dedicated public servant that has graced the world in my lifetime

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:43.200
one man has added hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars to value in

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.960
the global economy this man has worked tireless tirelessly for the benefit of

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:51.840
everyone around him it is impossible to name a publicly traded company that is

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.480
not somehow benefited from his contributions and many have benefited to

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.600
the tune of billions in return for the countless billions of wealth the people

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:04.120
have made from the fruits of his labor he was rewarded with poverty and

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:08.880
ridicule now the world is done taking now that the world is done taking from

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.760
him they're heading for the next step which is vilifying him as incompetent I

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:20.560
speak of Richard Stallman well first of all we are the world we are the children

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:26.000
let's get that out of the way secondly my god what a okay secondly you know I

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.840
agreed with everything until you went into the financial end of it that's a

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:33.760
personal choice in my opinion he says by bashing by bashing bash we are slamming

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:41.200
Stallman and GNU what do you think rotten corpse they're giving they're giving us

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:47.040
Stallman way too much credit for what they actually done right so the project

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:56.280
on a ton but RMS himself just kind of organized it well I mean now more so

01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:01.000
than ever yes right advocates for it and he helps a lot of things get done but as

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.060
far as most of the stuff he does is you know he does documentation which is

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:09.880
important it does translation helping which is important yeah I mean I don't

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:14.520
even I don't even see discussion of the bash shell vulnerability really an

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:18.920
indictment of Richard Stallman at all he's not long he's not the current

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:22.360
maintainer of it I don't really I don't even see doesn't make it in the first

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:26.400
place straw man victim that's what this is is we need a straw man victim and

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:30.920
that's that's all okay so I wasn't sure because I wasn't I guess why I'm okay

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.800
but I want to bring this to the human element of it for a second and we have

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:38.880
to acknowledge that these open source projects that we talk about like open

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:45.640
SSL and bash sometime come down to one two three people human beings that are

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:50.120
working on this and then this stuff becomes worldwide news could you imagine

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:54.240
if some open source project that you poked away at over the years all of a

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.560
sudden was the attention of the entire world and they were saying such horrible

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:02.800
things about it I'd be scared oh yeah no I can definitely see that being a thing

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:06.520
so which something that Stallman does very well he is able to get on to

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:10.080
various news outlets and believe me they're gonna be more than willing to

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:15.640
have right yes history and he's very he's a very good diplomatic figure that

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:19.600
can just state the case great and actually have a great podium to preach

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:24.080
things that are important yeah which I'm willing to argue that his views are more

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:27.920
important than the FUD about bash I will bet money on that yeah you know that is

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.840
a really RMS is really good at going on anywhere that'll have him and really

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.680
kind of making his case regardless of the agenda of the host and things like

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.640
that so there it is yeah yeah you you know what we don't need to fight for RMS

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:42.520
he is totally capable of defending himself that's a great point all right

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:47.160
logically defending himself on every front he gets I am I am giddy as a

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:51.120
schoolgirl the last thing I want to touch on today I can't believe I waited

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.880
till the end of the show because I am so freaking excited first though I want to

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.840
tell you about something else I'm extremely excited about that's the

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.280
awesome folks over Digital Ocean our last sponsor for Linux unplugged a

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:03.960

how that happened and like the last month my son started school I were

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.520

by you hear that that's September flying off into the wind but you know what I still see when I

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:26.760
look at that oh there it goes there goes unplug September unplug September you

for September on Linux unplugged over at digital ocean.com so what is digital

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:37.640
ocean I'll tell you what digital ocean it it's a simple cloud hosting provider

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.520
dedicated offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server

you can probably get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans start

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:48.440
at only five dollars per month that'll get you 512 megabytes of RAM a 20

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.600
gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer connected to tier one bandwidth

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:57.680
a date digital ocean has data centers in fact go check out their Instagram they

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.840
have some date some data center porn that they posted that is awesome they've

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:04.800
data center locations in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam and London

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:11.320
brand new one there in London IP v6 core OS board is so fancy I'm gonna put one

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:14.960
over there so I can say I have a dated I have a server in London yeah that makes

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.200
me feel fancy don't judge they also have an amazing interface with an intuitive

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.640
control panel and you can replicate that control panel on a larger scale with

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:28.500
digital oceans straightforward API and that Ubuntu OS that I hear some of you

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:35.400
like guess what they have a notification applet thingy for your Ubuntu I forget

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.680
what it's called but you can get one of those little applet thingies for a bond

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:44.800
man is a boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom anyways they got an app

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.040
that uses that digital ocean API and you can manage your droplets right from your

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.920
Ubuntu desktop it probably works in other districts too I don't know I only

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.720

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:45.280
update I don't know why I can't help myself I'm a child on the inside but I

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:52.080
am so so so so freaking excited to announce the borderlands 2 one of the

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:57.600
best first-person first-person shooters of all time is now to as of today available on

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:07.760
Steam for Linux it has it has a RPG like where you can upgrade your web your guns

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:11.600
there's so many different types of guns you could modify them you can get as a

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.160
whole skill tree system to it but at the end of the day it's also an amazing

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:21.080
first-person cooperative shooter and it also has this great cel-shaded look to

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:26.120
it I played it I think on the console when it first came out I think it might

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.840
have been borderlands 1 I played on the car I can't remember but I love the

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:32.640
borderlands series so hard and there's a borderlands prequel coming to Linux soon

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:38.080
too and this is just the icing on the cake because as if I don't know how long

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:44.320
but as of today it's on sale for 75% off it's normally like 20 bucks right now

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:50.280
it's five bucks great deal this is a great game that just hit Linux this is

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:55.280
when we talked about Steam coming to Linux this is one of the games I wanted

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:59.720
to get here this is huge this we are seeing some some amazing games come to

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:03.680
Linux this week and we'll have some more in Linux action show but I don't know

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:07.560
how long that deals going on so I wanted to get the word out right now you guys

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:10.240
can go out there and pick it up for a great price and remember we got some

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:14.640
questions into the show round about 40 hours the deal goes still on oh okay 40

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.480
hours perfect so I guess so for people to get in the downloadability grab it to

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.200
the prequel is officially confirmed of coming to Linux the same day as the

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.080
Windows version 2 so go out there and play it because when the prequel comes

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:27.840
day one Linux support for the new borderlands which is awesome which makes

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.240
me want to get the current one even more now here's the thing you have to buy it

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:36.240
from your Linux box okay buy it don't buy it from the web don't buy it from a

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.100
Windows machine to play on Linux please try to buy it from your Linux box so

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:43.400
that way it's registered as a Linux purchase if you've already bought it

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.040
ahead of time for our for Windows like you already own it like that's happened

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.000
to me for a bunch of games that I just bought ahead of time during sales you

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.080
have to play it for a couple of weeks under Linux before it's counted as a

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:56.920
Linux play so keep that in mind when you're buying steam games the only

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.920
reason we mention this is because I think sometimes I have and I so I'm

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.800
assuming maybe some of you have out there's I've pre-bought a few games that

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.320
I knew we're gonna come to Linux and I got them on sale and unfortunately when

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:12.960
I did that I just put another checkmark in the Windows column and I feel really

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:16.160
bad about that now so if you're like me and you want to you want to actually

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.600
make sure you can demonstrate your support for Linux you do have to buy it

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:24.200
under Linux go ahead Colonel you had a question about Linux steam sales there

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:29.640
was a huge I'll just say discussion for lack of a more polite term in the

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:35.360
mumble room like two nights ago do you know with any certainty if the sale is

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:39.520
tracked by steam on which OS it's purchased oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah how

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.640
sure like can you give me can you cite a source for that or is that just your

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:48.480
belief I believe the original clarification came from a developer AMA

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:55.080
on reddit okay and though and the way it works is is it's it's whatever OS is

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:59.360
purchased under and then and then after that what supersedes that is whatever OS

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.520
is played under for a two-week period right that was my understanding and

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:07.760
that's what I articulated in the mobile room and then then insert three hours of

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:11.720
non-stop arguing here's where the complexity comes in there is a bit of a

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.960
wrinkle to that so you take a company like Aspire or Aspire who ported over

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:21.880
what game did they just put over that was really good Wasteland 2 can't

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:25.160
remember no it wasn't Wasteland 2, Civ 5 they did the Civ 5 port great great

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:32.040
example so they don't even get money unless you buy that under Linux so if

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:36.480
you buy Civ 5 under Windows and then play it under Linux for two weeks it'll

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:42.200
get counted eventually as a Linux player after two weeks of time but they will

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:46.160
never get the revenue for it and this is on Steam this is on Steam so if a

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:51.320
company is contracted like Aspire which does great work to port a game they only

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:54.080
get paid when you specifically buy the Linux version after it's been released

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:59.080
by them in the Steam store and that is exactly why that's exactly why I'm

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:03.160
holding off on civilization beyond earth is waiting for them to land it through

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:07.320
the next because they're gonna be the porters of it so yeah so this is this is

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:10.120
I used to pre-purchase two when the sales were good and now I've stopped

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:14.280
doing that and so but thankfully like Borderlands 2 came out on sale 75% off

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:19.080
so I'm like all right all right it was good waiting so I and I know a lot of us

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.720
care about showing support for Linux I mean you know that's why we buy a lot of

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:26.280
the things we buy and and and have a lot of the sponsors we sponsor or have

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:30.320
sponsor us because they are Linux based themself and they promote Linux and so

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:33.040
it's important to me so I wanted to pass that along to you so it's like a little

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:38.320
steam pro tip I guess Chris did you see the valve collection is on offer as

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:42.520
well yes I already have that but that's about 19 hours left to go that's a

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:47.800
really great deal to all the really good as a steam newbie I picked up 23 games

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:53.080
for 18 quid yeah it's a good it is a good time oh look you know what you can

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.320
pre-purchase the pre sequel right now and I think it will count as a Linux

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:59.040
purchase because they have it see the way you can tell is if they have the

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.320
little penguin by the add to cart then you know if you buy it under Linux it

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.080
will be counted as a Linux purchase so and they already have that up for the

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:13.080
the pre sequel pre sequel that's about another 19 hours left on it before it

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:17.920
goes back up to the regular price of $99 it's 75% off yeah I'm looking for I'm

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:20.520
wondering why they don't have like a banner for right now because it's a

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:29.000
really great it was really hard to find yeah I did as well I couldn't find it

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000
through the steam valve complete pack yeah it's 24 bucks right now and I will

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.280
link to this in the show notes too so that way you guys don't have to go

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:38.960
search for it like that's close to $150 with the games for 24 bucks you can't

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:42.200
beat it no you get you get the portal series you get left for dead you get the

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.080
team fortresses you get your counter strikes your half-lives all the

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:52.360
half-lives yeah yeah between CS go and borderlands 2 I don't know I'm gonna be

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:56.240
able to get any work done anymore under the next how much how much do I have to

01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:01.080
pay to get it all open so oh wait so by the way minimum requirements for

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:06.520
borderlands 2 on your Linux box you're gonna need an Intel core 2 quad or AMD

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:12.600
phenom x4 2.4 gigahertz 4 gigs of RAM 13 gigabytes of hard drive space and this

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:18.040
is actually not bad a GeForce 20 I'm sorry a GeForce 260 minimum video that's

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:21.920
I think the cel shading gives you a lot there so here's an interesting note they

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.120
put on the Linux requirements they say does your meet your machine doesn't meet

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:29.520
the above specs doesn't mean your configuration won't run borderlands 2

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:35.480
nice yeah essentially the way they put it is you know what it looks like a spy

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:38.480
reported borderlands 2 as well because it says if you have any problems with

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.840
Linux please report to the Linux port please please report them to a spy well

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.600
that's now now I'm even more happy that it was a spy report it's a def it's a

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:50.080
direct port instead of a yeah yeah exactly instead of the whatever that

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.440
rapper thing was wine or wherever you think yeah yeah and also a little plug

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:57.040

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:04.360
pre-show borderlands 2 thing that'd be fun I forgot to mention it but there's

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:22.000
want to yeah I can I can show my Linux support when they release it just as

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.200
much as I can show it during the pre-order in front of the probably less

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:30.360
money all right JB titles calm gotta pick a title everybody JB titles calm

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:35.960
let's go so I had a question for everybody if you don't mind go man I

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:41.920
mind we do oh well I've been racking my head around something you know I love

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:45.360
all these distributions but when it comes to being marketable in the

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:51.200
workplace I'm trying to figure out which one to specialize so maybe input from

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:55.320
you guys and give me reasons why as well good question what are you trying to do

01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:00.760
in in the industry I don't know be employable how's this for an answer

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:05.600
Eric on the server side I've worked exclusively with no I take that back I

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:09.640
worked I worked almost exclusively with Red Hat and I've seen one Debian server

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:14.760
and on the desktop side the two choices that business will allow me to install

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:20.000
or Ubuntu and openSUSE and I and I would say that my experience working with

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.360
servers I've only seen Debian and Ubuntu servers and never seen a Red House

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:28.200
into a service and my experience has been a lot of places that have Red Hat

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:32.720
servers often kind of wish they had Debian or Ubuntu servers oh that's true

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:35.840
though I'm actually that's actually legitimately true now the difference is

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:41.360
it's it's I have probably seen it depends Eric so on on-premise I see a

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:46.760
lot more Red Hat or CentOS actually I see a lot more I've seen a lot but in

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:51.480
in in hosted environments in the cloud or brand brand new infrastructures like

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:55.160
they're building a server for the first time like an internal lamp server or

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:59.840
something like that it's really often Ubuntu interesting so maybe it's a good

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:10.720
idea to be specializing in both ecosystems then I'd say look at your

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:14.680
region because at the region and area that you want to work in and see which

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:19.440
type of company the size of the company and the structure they have often

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:23.360
impacts the software they use and as a result in the area that you want to work

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:28.400
on you focus on that it doesn't matter you can actually come and ask what kind

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:34.160
of software they use if you are a sales guy you will get this information because

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:37.800
people are willing to talk about the cool stuff they have in the house okay

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.880
so here's what I'm thinking here's what I'm getting from you guys it's a good

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:46.160
thing then to have the know-how from both the Ubuntu families which would

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:51.120
cover Debian as well and from CentOS which would cover Red Hat as well yeah I

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:54.240
think yeah yeah I think that's two really good ones to focus on for

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.640
employability skills yeah and here's another thought you have food for thought

01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:01.400
Eric and Chris you told me if this has been your experience as well very rarely

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:05.040
at least in big organizations have ever gone to work where they just say have at

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:09.240
it us here's the most times there's a senior admin on staff that says we want

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:12.680
these very specific things done and then they essentially describe to you would

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:16.520
dictate to you what it is so it's not like you walk into to us I mean every

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:18.760
once in a while it happens but usually don't walk into a site and they're like

01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:23.020
we have problem XYZ and we need you to craft a solution usually they're

01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:26.840
dictating so okay let's talk about titles for a second then we'll go back

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:31.800
so we I like a storm is brewing calm before the storm and who do I have to

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:42.280
blow but we probably shouldn't go with that as a title calm before the storm

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:45.640
is pretty good a storm is brewing is also pretty good

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:52.400
Pope he runs Chris yeah I think calm before the storm is actually apt and

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:59.000
accurate did somebody say apt oh let's apt-get Odyssey Westras title

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:07.560
suggestion wait it hurts yeah Eric I you know it's it's going back to the there's

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:10.480
a lot of different ways to look at distributions and how what makes them

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.100
relevant you know like what agenda can they push forward could be one way to

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:18.440
look at it what is the most employable that's another way to look at which has

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.520
the most faces staring at the screen if I want to develop an app that's another

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:26.440
way to look at it which one gives me the best satisfaction that's another way to

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:28.960
look at it it's like and everybody's coming at it from different

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:35.020
perspectives and so you know like I'd say if employability is the things the

01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:39.640
reason he wants to work or needs to work in is the key right that's right his

01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:43.520
limitation yeah and there's some areas where opens or where Sousa Enterprise

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:48.400
servers the top dog and that's typically like Europe and whatnot and over here

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:52.160
seems like this continent really likes Red Hat that's at least why I've been

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:55.400
getting and that's might be because Red Hat is based in North Carolina here's

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:59.920
yes an American here's a really super crazy ass don't like bet your life on it

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:05.320
rough rule of thumb to follow if it's if it's a product driven by developers you

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.740
and that's the area you're gonna go into like small businesses where somebody

01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:11.780
created something and they formed a business around it they're gonna be

01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:15.240
using Ubuntu if it's an established business where they've been around for a

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:18.840
long time maybe they've been calling it the MIS department since the 80s they're

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:23.840
gonna be running Red Hat so whatever you're targeting that's so depending on

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:27.000
which ones you're targeting that's that would be a really kind of crazy ass

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.200
loose rough rule of thumb to follow here's another crazy ass loose rule of

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:34.520
thumb to follow if you judge them and they have character they'll be running

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:51.520
Red Hat I want to simultaneously target both because I want to be as

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:56.720
employable as possible to anybody I've been I'm wearing on like you guys thought

01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:05.640
chases unemployment situation was bad I know I know do we have a website to

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:15.800
track your employment not yet just just give her a pass by on the companies make

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:20.560
a list of the companies of your year of your area that's if that's the area you

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:25.480
want to work in and it's in your region that's how you're gonna be able to see

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:30.760
what you need to focus first because you want to try your chances nearby I assume

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:36.680
don't forget that some some companies will let you work from home for example

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:42.760
the one I work at and we hire people who we often hire people who have a track

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:48.280
record of community contribution so you can build up quite a portfolio on github

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:55.400
rather than having a CV that's based on experience from companies if you're if

01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:00.120
your if your personal contributions to projects are significant enough that can

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:06.680
be enough of a CV I agree in fact I've always you know I it's really a mistake

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.480
to hire somebody based on what distribution they know what you really

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:12.840
want to know is how adept are they at Linux and how fast can they adapt

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:17.480
because truth be told distros change a shit ton over five six years and so like

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:21.640
one distro will have Zen for a couple of years and then that distro even though

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:25.040
it's a huge enterprise distro in the next release will switch to KVM and then

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:28.800
the next release will switch to systemd and then the next release will totally

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.960
integrate Docker containers and reformat you know like it's just there it's

01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:37.120
always changing right and and so yet to get too locked into which distro is kind

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:40.960
of like it's sort of like this accidental getting locked into how

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:44.760
Linux is today really it's more about what you already do staying informed

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:47.640
following the trends seeing the new technologies how do those adapt to

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:52.480
workloads how would I integrate those and and you know maybe today you're

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:55.840
gonna deploy that package using yum but in two years when you're sitting at a

01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:59.080
reddit enterprise Linux box you're gonna be using DNF right and it's it doesn't

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:02.440
it doesn't really matter it changes anyways I get what you're saying at the

01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:06.600
same time that's a very that's a very difficult metric to codify right yeah

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:13.240
yeah well that's I was about to say you're probably better off to do

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:22.240
something to show people that you were worth for them to be trained then train

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:27.720
training yourself to be to get hired by some specific company because that just

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:32.160
may not work out yeah well here's one thing I've noticed and lately I was just

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:35.440
kind of trolling some stuff it will not really troll it but going through some

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:40.660
stuff on LinkedIn and I did come across a job posting for somebody and they

01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:46.280
basically said they wanted like four years of centos experience specifically

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:51.520
I was like what okay hmm if I could pass along two pieces of advice that have

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:55.600
gotten me through some really rough points in time it's one who you know be

01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:00.040
where the people that we want you want to be hired our conventions anything you

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:04.320
can do to be in their face I've gotten work with people one company comes to

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:08.020
mind specifically dating years back that I'm still with to this day that happened

01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:12.600
because I asked a question I got in the guy's face I asked two questions next

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:16.400
within a month's time I had actually developed a contract with this company

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:27.040
yeah the guy happens you know hold on let let Colonel links go cuz he's hiring

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.480
guys to work on Linux all the time oh yeah there you go there you go well I

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:33.000
was just gonna say when we were at when we were at self q5 and at the guy we

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.080
interviewed for arches and not arch assault he was doing the other booth he

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:42.880
was doing the the scepter the the thin PC he got his job the year before at

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:46.200
self because he walked up to the booth and said this is really cool what are

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:49.240
you guys doing here and the guy gave him a job right on the spot well so I guess

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:52.400
so when you're looking you know so you're hiring some guy who's gonna cover

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:55.760
for you when you're going to things like self you're going to OSCON you're going

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:59.040
to Ohio Linux fest how do you know that guy you're gonna hire is gonna be able

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:03.480
to handle a Linux problem when it comes up what test can you give him and the

01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:05.680
reason why I asked that is because maybe Eric could take that and reverse

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:09.160
engineer it and kind of figure out you know what to expect so what do you like

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:13.800
what do you look for Noah well we so I won't personally just because the

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:18.240
community a small word spreads fast I can't take a chance on on on measuring

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:22.760
that metric wrong I won't I won't let somebody work out unless go on their own

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:25.880
unless they've been with me for six or seven weeks and I they come around and

01:32:25.880 --> 01:32:29.240
then we go through and go over all the stuff that we do and then after that I

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:36.200
let him run solo but places like what was we did an interview at Linux fest

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:40.600
Northwest yeah and that's exactly what they do they have a test that I can't

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:43.920
remember the name do you know what I do but I don't remember the name either go

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:47.480
back and look at the Northwest episode Eric because they have a there was it

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:49.920
there was a group there that essentially what you do is you go to

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:53.640
their site and you can take their tests and then they send those to potential

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:56.120
and so employer goes out and they say I'm looking for somebody that knows

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:59.720
rel6 then this company will say here are the people that have successfully

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:05.920
completed a test with 80% or higher in rel6 it's that might be a thought too

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:09.680
yeah it's very cool that one thing you also want to watch out for is the worst

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:13.880
thing you can ever do is be that guy that is like you could be the best the

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:18.360
most certified at rel6 expert and then they ask you to use rel7 you're like

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:21.720
well I'm not certified for that right yeah right yeah never be that guy yeah

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:26.200
yeah textbook smart but can problem solve your way out of a paper bag are you

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:40.960
talking about Cisco guys yeah
