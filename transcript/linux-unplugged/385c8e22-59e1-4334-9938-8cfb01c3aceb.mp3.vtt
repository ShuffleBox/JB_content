WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.940
We are wading into a territory this episode where we're going to have a little tough love

00:04.940 --> 00:06.380
to share about the Linux desktop.

00:06.380 --> 00:10.780
So I thought maybe we'd actually start by acknowledging there's a lot of places where

00:10.780 --> 00:12.780
it's working really great.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.760
Google's in-house Linux is a great example of this.

00:14.760 --> 00:19.140
We recently covered on Linux Action News some changes that they're making.

00:19.140 --> 00:24.160
Lots of shops like Red Hat and many, many, many others run Linux as their daily driver.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.340
So do we.

00:25.340 --> 00:30.540
So today's episode might have a little bit of tough love, but if you're feeling down,

00:30.540 --> 00:31.780
we'll have a link in the show notes.

00:31.780 --> 00:38.180
You can read all about the inside story on Google's home-grown Google desktop operating

00:38.180 --> 00:39.520
system.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.360
This is one we got to get you to try, Brent.

00:41.360 --> 00:42.720
Is it publicly available then?

00:42.720 --> 00:44.560
No, that's why it'd be a really great episode.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.560
Oh, yeah.

00:45.560 --> 00:46.560
You want me to infiltrate.

00:46.560 --> 00:47.560
I'm all for it.

00:47.560 --> 00:48.560
Brent goes undercover.

00:48.560 --> 01:04.900
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:04.900 --> 01:05.900
My name is Chris.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.580
And my name is Brent.

01:07.580 --> 01:08.860
Hello, Brent.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.000
It's just you and me this week.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.420
I almost said, and my name is Wes.

01:14.420 --> 01:19.660
Good to confuse everybody because Wes is out on assignment doing something awesome, I would

01:19.660 --> 01:20.660
assume.

01:20.660 --> 01:21.660
As always.

01:21.660 --> 01:22.660
Yeah.

01:22.660 --> 01:23.660
Whenever he's not with us, he's still doing awesome stuff.

01:23.660 --> 01:28.640
Well, coming up on the show this week, is the Linux desktop hard to love?

01:28.640 --> 01:32.980
Are there just compromises that we make on a daily basis to use it?

01:32.980 --> 01:35.700
We'll talk about some of the tough spots there.

01:35.700 --> 01:39.780
We'll respond to a thought provoking article that was recently posted this last week.

01:39.780 --> 01:44.440
And then we'll round out the show with some boosts, some picks, and a lot more.

01:44.440 --> 01:46.660
So before we go any further, I'm just going to say hello to Carl.

01:46.660 --> 01:49.100
Hey, Carl, in the virtual log.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.100
Howdy.

01:50.100 --> 01:52.880
We've got some folks in the quiet listening too.

01:52.880 --> 01:57.960
But we're recording this early on Thursday, not our normal Sunday time.

01:57.960 --> 02:03.520
And we decided that we would do this about 17 hours ago as we go live.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.260
So we didn't have any heads up.

02:05.260 --> 02:09.140
But I promised the kiddos that we were going to the beach this weekend and that it would

02:09.140 --> 02:11.420
be a dad doesn't work weekend.

02:11.420 --> 02:12.960
So we got to rearrange everything.

02:12.960 --> 02:13.960
That's a big promise.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.580
That only happens a few times a year, right?

02:15.580 --> 02:16.580
I know.

02:16.580 --> 02:22.880
They've been asking for weeks, giving me the full on dad guilt trip every Sunday morning.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.180
So I figured, you know, I'd have to give eventually.

02:25.180 --> 02:26.580
So that's what we're doing this week.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.160
So we're here.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.300
We're doing it on a Thursday.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.820
But I still want to say a big good morning to tail scale.

02:31.820 --> 02:36.140
You know, tail scale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

02:36.140 --> 02:37.760
It's one of the best VPNs in the game.

02:37.760 --> 02:42.660
You can get set up in minutes on just about any device, mobile device, arm device, arch

02:42.660 --> 02:48.140
box, red hat box, get it for free for up to 20 devices when you go to tailscale.com.

02:48.140 --> 02:49.920
We love tail scale.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.560
So yeah, we are on a Thursday.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.900
So we're a little out of sorts.

02:52.900 --> 02:56.900
But we did want to remind you we have the London meetup just days away as this episode

02:56.900 --> 02:58.780
goes live.

02:58.780 --> 03:00.740
Keep an eye on that meetup page.

03:00.740 --> 03:05.460
As the time gets closer and closer, you never know what could happen.

03:05.460 --> 03:08.820
Brent's down there at operation center one, you'll be one of the first people you'll be

03:08.820 --> 03:12.300
reporting on the scene remotely today.

03:12.300 --> 03:17.420
We check in on the London meetup to make sure it's actually still happening.

03:17.420 --> 03:22.080
All reports are London meetup is still go green light, green light.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.180
Thank you, Brent.

03:23.180 --> 03:24.780
Keep us informed and stay safe.

03:24.780 --> 03:27.620
Back to you, Chris.

03:27.620 --> 03:31.860
And the West Coast meetups are getting serious, seriously serious.

03:31.860 --> 03:34.860
I got my wife Adia now in the West Coast crew chat room.

03:34.860 --> 03:37.060
She's chatting with people about locations.

03:37.060 --> 03:41.380
If you are on the West Coast, check out meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

03:41.380 --> 03:47.240
We got a bunch of meetups coming up and we got a chat room in there where maybe some

03:47.240 --> 03:48.980
pictures of Levi got posted.

03:48.980 --> 03:50.700
Oh, those are worth seeing.

03:50.700 --> 03:54.900
I think we're actually considering doing one of the meetups at a dog park so people can

03:54.900 --> 03:56.400
bring dog goes if they want.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.620
That is a great idea.

03:57.620 --> 04:02.020
Yeah, not just dogs, but humans, too, can go, but you don't require a dog to be there.

04:02.020 --> 04:03.020
You can.

04:03.020 --> 04:04.020
You can.

04:04.020 --> 04:08.980
Levi's a community dog, you know, I don't own that dog.

04:08.980 --> 04:12.340
That dog just lives with me and he'll hang out with whoever he wants to hang out with.

04:12.340 --> 04:13.340
You know it.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.340
I do.

04:14.340 --> 04:19.140
I was just I was just picturing drone chasing at some recent events that we were at a couple

04:19.140 --> 04:20.140
of years ago.

04:20.140 --> 04:22.700
We were at Linux Fest Northwest and we were doing a big barbecue.

04:22.700 --> 04:26.940
I mean, no exaggeration, hundreds of people were at this barbecue we were doing.

04:26.940 --> 04:28.220
Yeah, lots of brats.

04:28.220 --> 04:30.660
Yeah, lots of brats at the front of the line.

04:30.660 --> 04:32.340
And we had a couple of folks there.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.540
Jeff was probably one of them with racing drones.

04:35.540 --> 04:41.380
And Levi successfully managed to leap up in the air and pluck a drone out of the sky.

04:41.380 --> 04:43.820
And then he ran around very proud.

04:43.820 --> 04:47.140
And I had just the luck of timing.

04:47.140 --> 04:50.420
I had the first person goggles on when he did it.

04:50.420 --> 04:54.580
So I got to see from Levi's perspective is and he had the camera pretty well placed,

04:54.580 --> 04:55.580
right?

04:55.580 --> 04:56.580
So I could see where he was going.

04:56.580 --> 04:57.580
It was hilarious.

04:57.580 --> 05:01.580
So he does make a meetup a little bit more fun.

05:01.580 --> 05:03.860
And then lastly, we're putting the word out.

05:03.860 --> 05:10.580
We'd like your ideas for the best used or cheap, super cheap Linux PC build.

05:10.580 --> 05:15.900
So something pre-built could be used or something from like PC part picker or whatever that

05:15.900 --> 05:16.900
you put together.

05:16.900 --> 05:24.320
And I'm thinking like sub $300 would be great, but with a couple of requirements, it needs

05:24.320 --> 05:28.860
to be good enough for most day to day casual work, you know, web browsing, office work,

05:28.860 --> 05:30.000
that kind of stuff.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.420
And ideally, it could be a computer that lasts a couple of years.

05:33.420 --> 05:38.400
So send us your PC part picker links or eBay links or whatever you might have out there.

05:38.400 --> 05:43.980
And if we get a really interesting build idea for like a really cheap usable Linux PC, I

05:43.980 --> 05:48.860
might pick one up and give it a review here on the show or build it, whatever it is.

05:48.860 --> 05:51.860
If there's a good one, if there's an interesting one that seems like it could have a practical

05:51.860 --> 05:57.720
use, I think I'd like to come up with like if you're looking for a $300 ish PC to run

05:57.720 --> 06:00.260
desktop Linux.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.260
Go look at this, right?

06:01.260 --> 06:04.480
I just want something we could recommend to people that we can vouch for.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.500
So I'd love to get your ideas.

06:05.500 --> 06:09.620
You can boost them in or go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

06:09.620 --> 06:13.780
I'm wondering, Brent, if you have any suggestions just off the top because you kind of can live

06:13.780 --> 06:15.700
in this area sometimes for weeks, years.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.840
It feels like my normal lifestyle.

06:18.840 --> 06:19.840
Your comfort zone.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.380
What are you hoping to get out of it?

06:21.380 --> 06:23.980
Like how long will you use it for the review?

06:23.980 --> 06:27.600
Is there some other purpose that might be a long term thing, you know?

06:27.600 --> 06:29.380
Can you set some more boundaries for us?

06:29.380 --> 06:34.980
Well, after we're done, I'd like to give it away for somebody to use as their Linux PC.

06:34.980 --> 06:39.280
But I kind of want to be able to say, hey, if you're on a tight budget and you're looking

06:39.280 --> 06:42.760
for a desktop computer, we recommend this.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.940
Here's an episode where we talked about it, that kind of thing.

06:44.940 --> 06:50.820
I'm just looking for something to just sort of, I guess, help us get an idea of what is

06:50.820 --> 06:55.900
acceptable performance at what price point when you're looking at the Linux desktop.

06:55.900 --> 06:56.900
Where is that right now?

06:56.900 --> 06:58.380
What are you getting for around $300?

06:58.380 --> 06:59.380
What can you get?

06:59.380 --> 07:03.300
Do you remember back in the day, some of the netbooks were that recommendation?

07:03.300 --> 07:08.160
I mean, I don't think they are anymore, considering no one makes them, et cetera, et cetera.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.400
You know, for years and years, you've seen me with this computer.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.880
I used the ThinkPad X220.

07:14.880 --> 07:18.120
It's mildly portable, but that would be my temptation.

07:18.120 --> 07:26.580
You can go to eBay and find lots and lots and lots of variously configured X220s that

07:26.580 --> 07:28.620
are still, some of them, in very good shape.

07:28.620 --> 07:34.060
They were, I think, leased quite a lot to large businesses, and so there are just hordes

07:34.060 --> 07:35.060
of these things.

07:35.060 --> 07:36.780
And they're a great computer.

07:36.780 --> 07:40.340
It's one of my favorite keyboards of all time, actually.

07:40.340 --> 07:43.900
These days, whenever I'm using a laptop, I always wish I had that keyboard.

07:43.900 --> 07:47.740
And the thing's not too bad in terms of performance.

07:47.740 --> 07:50.340
You can squeeze in 16 gigs of RAM in that thing.

07:50.340 --> 07:56.220
It's not officially supported, but I've done it for years, and it works perfectly fine.

07:56.220 --> 08:01.280
You're not gonna get away with lots of processing power, but for doing some, you know, light

08:01.280 --> 08:06.080
browsing, you can't have 28 tabs open or 100 like I used to.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.260
But I think a few tens of tabs, you'd be fine.

08:09.260 --> 08:13.460
The other nice thing is if you're a slight tinkerer, you can get parts for this thing.

08:13.460 --> 08:14.460
Like, crazy.

08:14.460 --> 08:19.980
Some people even put, like, modern motherboards in some of the X220 and X230 chassis, if that's

08:19.980 --> 08:21.940
your kind of crazy thing.

08:21.940 --> 08:26.180
That may run the cost up a little bit, but I think you could get some of these for as

08:26.180 --> 08:32.660
low as, like, $75 if you already have a hard drive to throw in it, and SSD all the way.

08:32.660 --> 08:35.260
That's an interesting idea, right?

08:35.260 --> 08:43.380
Get like a $75, $100 ThinkPad, and then replace the disk, replace the RAM, maybe even replace

08:43.380 --> 08:44.380
the screen.

08:44.380 --> 08:46.780
I don't know how far you could take that and how much time people would want to dedicate

08:46.780 --> 08:47.780
to it.

08:47.780 --> 08:54.660
I will say the screen on that laptop is fairly easily replaceable, but I have an X250 beside

08:54.660 --> 08:59.140
me here, which is probably a little bit more than you're like, but these days it might

08:59.140 --> 09:02.560
be around the $300 mark, actually, that you might be able to find used.

09:02.560 --> 09:08.900
And Alex and I bought a screen for this thing because I, as a photographer, wanted an IPS,

09:08.900 --> 09:13.560
and I think it was like $100 at the time, a few years ago.

09:13.560 --> 09:17.180
And the replacement was the easiest thing I've ever done on a laptop.

09:17.180 --> 09:22.740
It was like, take the bezel off, just kind of clip it off, throw the screen in there,

09:22.740 --> 09:23.740
and then put it back on.

09:23.740 --> 09:24.740
And you're done.

09:24.740 --> 09:28.020
I think gaming's probably obviously eliminated in this area.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.020
Yeah.

09:29.020 --> 09:32.660
No, no, there are plenty of games like Pong will play just fine.

09:32.660 --> 09:36.180
And okay, all right.

09:36.180 --> 09:37.180
Maybe Race the Sun.

09:37.180 --> 09:43.100
I'm trying to think now, I think I may have played Portal at the time on that laptop.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.100
Really?

09:44.100 --> 09:46.020
I believe that I may be mistaken.

09:46.020 --> 09:49.940
So don't take that 100% accurate, but perhaps.

09:49.940 --> 09:54.100
I think the X220, and there's probably other ThinkPads out there, I think that's probably

09:54.100 --> 09:57.180
going to be the number one recommendation as a ThinkPad.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.940
And I'm not opposed to that at all.

09:59.940 --> 10:03.460
If somebody has like a specific recommendation, that would be my preference.

10:03.460 --> 10:09.860
I was picturing when I was talking about this, either something that would be built or rebuilt,

10:09.860 --> 10:13.660
or something that'd be like all parts, and then you assemble it yourself.

10:13.660 --> 10:15.260
I feel like that's the only two ways.

10:15.260 --> 10:19.420
It's either going to be something like a laptop or a used desktop.

10:19.420 --> 10:22.780
One of the things, because I was checking around before I put the links in the notes

10:22.780 --> 10:29.580
and stuff, and I saw a couple of batches of Dell Optiplex type desktops that were like

10:29.580 --> 10:33.780
a corporate deal that they were getting rid of, and they had like 45 of them.

10:33.780 --> 10:35.980
You buy the whole lot or what?

10:35.980 --> 10:38.100
No, no, no.

10:38.100 --> 10:42.820
But I thought, okay, they were like 280 bucks, and they had an i5 in them, and they had eight

10:42.820 --> 10:46.740
gigs of RAM, and they had a spinning rest drive, but I thought, you know, for under

10:46.740 --> 10:50.060
300 bucks shipped, that's not a bad deal.

10:50.060 --> 10:51.620
So it depends on like when you're buying, too.

10:51.620 --> 10:55.380
If you buy at the right time, when a company is in the process of offloading, you can get

10:55.380 --> 10:56.680
a good deal.

10:56.680 --> 11:00.220
And when they're that cheap, too, it's like in a business, sometimes it's nice to buy

11:00.220 --> 11:05.220
a couple of extra spare parts, and then you have a couple of spare rigs for either Frankensteining

11:05.220 --> 11:09.220
parts out of, or just full-on swapping when you need to.

11:09.220 --> 11:11.820
The more you talk, the more questions I have for you, Chris.

11:11.820 --> 11:15.060
I take it power's not an important thing?

11:15.060 --> 11:16.060
Not for this one.

11:16.060 --> 11:20.380
I could see doing a power-specific build, most performance for the watts kind of thing.

11:20.380 --> 11:23.540
But no, on this one, I'm thinking just price and longevity.

11:23.540 --> 11:24.820
Oh, longevity.

11:24.820 --> 11:25.820
That's a good one.

11:25.820 --> 11:26.820
Okay.

11:26.820 --> 11:27.820
Right.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.400
Because if you're budget-conscious and you're getting a machine now, you're probably not

11:29.400 --> 11:33.100
going to be in a position to replace it in a year, maybe even two.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.100
You're talking lightning nodes, right?

11:34.100 --> 11:38.060
Isn't that what we're getting to?

11:38.060 --> 11:41.780
I'm curious, like how come you didn't mention the Pi yet?

11:41.780 --> 11:46.740
It seems like it might fit in that world a little bit, but yeah.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.220
Yeah, I think that's a good thing to clarify.

11:48.220 --> 11:54.740
I feel like the Raspberry Pi is just on the other side of unusable, like as a desktop,

11:54.740 --> 11:59.020
your only desktop, your main machine, I don't think it's fast enough.

11:59.020 --> 12:04.500
Not even with like a SSD USB drive, I just don't think it's fast enough yet.

12:04.500 --> 12:08.460
And not for years either, you know, two, three years.

12:08.460 --> 12:13.940
Maybe the Pi 5, maybe with different storage, eMMC or something like that.

12:13.940 --> 12:19.860
And you know, depending on who's getting this, x86 has a big compatibility factor.

12:19.860 --> 12:20.860
That's very true.

12:20.860 --> 12:22.220
And it's something I don't always think about.

12:22.220 --> 12:27.180
So I think x86 for this experiment, although I could see doing a separate one for ARM as

12:27.180 --> 12:28.180
well.

12:28.180 --> 12:34.020
Now will whichever computer this is mysteriously get filled with JB stickers?

12:34.020 --> 12:35.020
Maybe.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.020
That'd be fun.

12:36.020 --> 12:37.020
That'd be fun.

12:37.020 --> 12:39.300
Let me throw a few on there.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.300
We got some old ones here.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.300
All right.

12:41.300 --> 12:44.300
You know, throw a bunch of those on there.

12:44.300 --> 12:45.300
Yeah.

12:45.300 --> 12:46.300
All right.

12:46.300 --> 12:47.300
So send us your suggestions.

12:47.300 --> 12:51.660
linuxunplugged.com slash contact or you can boost in a link or a suggestion.

12:51.660 --> 12:55.380
We'd love to know what you think might be good enough for day to day desktop Linux on

12:55.380 --> 12:59.940
a budget.

12:59.940 --> 13:03.380
linode.com slash unplugged friends.

13:03.380 --> 13:04.460
Linode is where it's at, man.

13:04.460 --> 13:07.540
That's where we've been hosting everything for the last couple of years.

13:07.540 --> 13:13.620
And Linode is a great combination of performance, price, support, industry, adoption.

13:13.620 --> 13:16.460
I mean, really, this is a great combination of all the things.

13:16.460 --> 13:19.260
I wouldn't really host anywhere else, to be honest with you.

13:19.260 --> 13:21.060
I mean, why would you host anywhere else?

13:21.060 --> 13:22.060
It's crazy.

13:22.060 --> 13:23.060
It's crazy out there.

13:23.060 --> 13:27.260
You look at these crazy hypervisors that are creating these specific esoteric technology

13:27.260 --> 13:30.140
stacks that they just want to lock you into and they have their own verbiage and their

13:30.140 --> 13:35.420
own training materials just to learn that one platform's way of doing things.

13:35.420 --> 13:36.420
Who does that serve?

13:36.420 --> 13:40.620
It doesn't serve you and it doesn't serve your business.

13:40.620 --> 13:44.340
Linode has been in this for nearly 19 years and their mission has remained unchanged.

13:44.340 --> 13:48.620
They just try to make cloud computing accessible and affordable to just about anyone.

13:48.620 --> 13:52.340
So when you go to linode.com slash unplugged, you get $100.

13:52.340 --> 13:57.040
That's $100 you can try things with, really kick the tires and see what it's capable of.

13:57.040 --> 14:01.820
And if you're listening to this while we're recording and you're down in the LAX area

14:01.820 --> 14:06.460
at scale, Linode is at booth 211.

14:06.460 --> 14:07.460
That's right.

14:07.460 --> 14:08.740
Jay the Linux guy and Gardner Bryant are there too.

14:08.740 --> 14:12.260
You can go say hello to the Linode crew at booth 211 at scale.

14:12.260 --> 14:16.940
If you're at scale right now though, I got a little bit of FOMO.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.940
I got a little bit of FOMO if you're down there.

14:19.940 --> 14:20.940
Go say hi.

14:20.940 --> 14:21.940
Go say, Chris says hi.

14:21.940 --> 14:22.940
You agree?

14:22.940 --> 14:25.620
A little bit of FOMO for not being at scale right now?

14:25.620 --> 14:26.620
Oh yeah.

14:26.620 --> 14:28.540
I have never been.

14:28.540 --> 14:32.180
And I feel like that's a shocker.

14:32.180 --> 14:34.380
We need to make that happen maybe next year.

14:34.380 --> 14:37.260
The only thing better than going to scale is getting a hundred bucks.

14:37.260 --> 14:42.900
So go to linode.com slash unplugged, get that $100, support the show and go try it out.

14:42.900 --> 14:46.420
They're 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers out there that want to lock you into their

14:46.420 --> 14:47.420
crazy platforms.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.740
They got the best support, 11 data centers around the world.

14:50.740 --> 14:51.740
They're great.

14:51.740 --> 14:52.740
Try them out.

14:52.740 --> 14:57.900
Go to linode.com slash unplugged.

14:57.900 --> 15:04.100
Well this week we're looking at an article that I think, um, gets our ponderings happening

15:04.100 --> 15:05.220
quite a lot.

15:05.220 --> 15:12.860
The author calls themselves TDARB or Brad Taunt for the normals.

15:12.860 --> 15:18.060
He describes himself as a user experience designer with over 12 years of professional

15:18.060 --> 15:25.060
experience with a strong emphasis on creating intuitive interfaces with a focus on accessibility,

15:25.060 --> 15:26.620
performance and minimalism.

15:26.620 --> 15:31.700
And I also noticed Chris, he does mention the Ottawa senators in his bio.

15:31.700 --> 15:35.420
So that gets my Ottawa Canadians kind of.

15:35.420 --> 15:36.420
Interesting.

15:36.420 --> 15:37.420
I did not notice that.

15:37.420 --> 15:38.420
Mm hmm.

15:38.420 --> 15:39.420
Comradery going on there.

15:39.420 --> 15:45.180
So I've, I already, um, have a big heart for TDARB and the title of the post that we're

15:45.180 --> 15:48.820
looking at, the Linux desktop is hard to love.

15:48.820 --> 15:52.820
This one hits a little close to home, you know, just right there in the title.

15:52.820 --> 15:54.720
It's a hard desktop to love.

15:54.720 --> 15:58.020
It implies that takes a little bit of work to be in this relationship with the Linux

15:58.020 --> 15:59.700
desktop, right?

15:59.700 --> 16:05.420
It's just kind of, uh, I can't completely disagree because behind the scenes, I know

16:05.420 --> 16:09.420
and we talked a little bit on the show, I think you've been having some strugs with

16:09.420 --> 16:12.580
your high resolution monitor settings and stuff like that.

16:12.580 --> 16:16.580
You're kind of, you're getting that experience that I've had where you've got a couple of

16:16.580 --> 16:21.480
monitors hooked up to a desktop rig with an NVIDIA card and it's just a crap shoot when

16:21.480 --> 16:22.900
you wake that thing up from sleep.

16:22.900 --> 16:23.900
Yeah.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.160
You know, I think one advantage that I have running these ancient, well supported machines

16:27.160 --> 16:30.460
is that I never run into some of this hardware stuff, right?

16:30.460 --> 16:34.640
And so now, um, I have the great fortune of using a computer that has all sorts of different

16:34.640 --> 16:36.500
types of stuff connected to it.

16:36.500 --> 16:41.420
And, uh, it turns out that's kind of problematic and I, you're right.

16:41.420 --> 16:45.940
It has been an eye opener for me because I thought we were further along than this in

16:45.940 --> 16:51.220
a sense and that really makes me a little bit sad actually.

16:51.220 --> 16:58.340
So it feels challenging and that title, man, did that ever cause me to pause and reflect

16:58.340 --> 17:05.580
a little bit and, uh, I think come to some sobering reality perhaps.

17:05.580 --> 17:08.420
So the author starts with what Linux gets right.

17:08.420 --> 17:14.180
Complete user control, the ability to drastically change your desktop UI between GNOME and KDE

17:14.180 --> 17:16.300
and XSE and all the others.

17:16.300 --> 17:22.380
Overall, pretty welcoming communities, especially in the right areas and generally pretty good

17:22.380 --> 17:26.020
documentation really, especially if you're sticking to your Ubuntu's and your Fedora's

17:26.020 --> 17:27.980
and stuff like that.

17:27.980 --> 17:36.220
And the author adds, quote, these things make Linux a solid experience overall, but not,

17:36.220 --> 17:37.220
not a great one.

17:37.220 --> 17:42.060
Like that stuff, he says, doesn't make up for the rough edges where, where it falls

17:42.060 --> 17:43.300
down a little bit.

17:43.300 --> 17:47.460
As for what it gets wrong, I think that's exactly what we want to chew on today.

17:47.460 --> 17:53.240
Um, it seems like there's a little bit more than we might want to admit to.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.740
So he starts with the overall OS cohesion.

17:55.740 --> 18:00.220
He describes it as Linux lacking a consistency throughout the entire design.

18:00.220 --> 18:04.580
And I think Chris, you might agree that sort of makes sense considering all of the choices.

18:04.580 --> 18:09.660
Like if you have all these choices for which desktop UI you're going to choose, um, I think

18:09.660 --> 18:13.620
that, uh, presents a cohesion challenge, uh, wouldn't you agree?

18:13.620 --> 18:14.940
Yeah, I think so.

18:14.940 --> 18:18.420
Um, especially when you look at things like you've got electron and you've got GTK and

18:18.420 --> 18:22.540
you've got Qt and you've got all these other things, but this is a problem that isn't unique

18:22.540 --> 18:23.540
to Linux.

18:23.540 --> 18:30.180
I think it started in a worse spot on Linux, but I think all of the other OS's Mac and

18:30.180 --> 18:34.060
windows specifically, I think they have been drifting towards this for a decade.

18:34.060 --> 18:36.760
And I think it's getting pretty hodgepodge everywhere.

18:36.760 --> 18:37.860
Can you like give an example?

18:37.860 --> 18:41.620
I haven't been on those other two platforms in quite a while, so I'm curious what you've

18:41.620 --> 18:42.620
seen recently.

18:42.620 --> 18:47.540
Well, Slack, for example, Slack doesn't look like any native toolkit on any desktop, windows,

18:47.540 --> 18:48.540
Mac or Linux.

18:48.540 --> 18:49.540
Right?

18:49.540 --> 18:50.540
That's true.

18:50.540 --> 18:51.540
And Slack is used by millions of people, right?

18:51.540 --> 18:56.540
Same with discord, telegram, none of them use the native control elements of the platform.

18:56.540 --> 19:01.940
And yet there you'll find them on all of the VS code is another great example, right?

19:01.940 --> 19:02.940
Super popular.

19:02.940 --> 19:06.620
It's even kind of crazy, especially in the VS code example, like they have a native desktop

19:06.620 --> 19:10.140
that they could sort of aim for, but no.

19:10.140 --> 19:11.140
Yeah.

19:11.140 --> 19:14.940
These are things that I complained about for years on Coder Radio.

19:14.940 --> 19:17.260
It just come just groused and groused and groused.

19:17.260 --> 19:23.540
And here we are now, nothing ever changed, it seems, but that's curious to me because,

19:23.540 --> 19:28.020
you know, you're describing a particular applications, but I think with on the Linux side here, we're

19:28.020 --> 19:32.860
talking about the whole, the whole operating system really, and that feels a little bit

19:32.860 --> 19:33.860
more problematic.

19:33.860 --> 19:34.860
Yeah.

19:34.860 --> 19:39.440
I do think it is a little bit deeper on Linux because you'll even notice this if you use

19:39.440 --> 19:44.800
FreeBSD for a little bit, FreeBSD, even at the command line feels more cohesive.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.880
It feels like the tools because they are, are all made by the same people in the same

19:48.880 --> 19:49.880
team.

19:49.880 --> 19:54.160
And you get a little bit more cohesion from the bottom all the way up.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.160
Linux lacks that.

19:55.160 --> 19:59.820
When you live every day in a complete GTK or cute environment, when you drop to the

19:59.820 --> 20:06.100
command line, those different free software apps are made by different individuals with

20:06.100 --> 20:10.740
different design choices and different philosophies on how to build applications and different

20:10.740 --> 20:14.620
things that they think are important to document and different flags and different ways of

20:14.620 --> 20:15.860
implementing those flags.

20:15.860 --> 20:23.500
And all of that stuff is kind of inconsistent in Linux, but feels more, in my opinion, more

20:23.500 --> 20:26.760
organic, more like real life, like that's how things are in the real world too.

20:26.760 --> 20:30.800
You interface with lots of vendors, different products, everything's a little bit different.

20:30.800 --> 20:34.180
Every surface has a different texture, everything has a different sound, right?

20:34.180 --> 20:39.580
That kind of fragmentation is just sort of organic in the evolved world.

20:39.580 --> 20:44.980
You know, he also continues making a point about distro packages and snaps and flat packs

20:44.980 --> 20:51.260
and all the various options there and how from a user perspective, it's just not as

20:51.260 --> 20:53.940
smooth as it might be on something like the Mac, for instance.

20:53.940 --> 20:57.780
Yeah, he says it's kind of overwhelming for the average computer user.

20:57.780 --> 20:59.380
You know what, Brent?

20:59.380 --> 21:07.160
I am surprised that the multiple package format debate has become something that normal folks

21:07.160 --> 21:10.020
that are looking at Linux from the outside have attached to.

21:10.020 --> 21:12.320
I didn't think it would register.

21:12.320 --> 21:15.580
It just seemed like an internal debate, but at the end of the day, your software gets

21:15.580 --> 21:20.420
installed and however your software manager is doing that is just an implementation detail.

21:20.420 --> 21:24.780
And I didn't expect it to be something that surfaced up to people who are evaluating Linux

21:24.780 --> 21:29.820
from the outside, but yet we see it come up over and over and freaking over again.

21:29.820 --> 21:35.340
I am personally exhausted by the package manager and package debate and all of that.

21:35.340 --> 21:36.940
I am exhausted by it.

21:36.940 --> 21:42.500
And yet if you go on YouTube right now and you search for like Linux package manager,

21:42.500 --> 21:46.500
there's probably a couple hundred videos that were made in the last couple of months about

21:46.500 --> 21:47.500
the topic, right?

21:47.500 --> 21:52.940
It's brought up right here in this blog post, there's too many formats, but I don't believe

21:52.940 --> 21:53.940
it.

21:53.940 --> 21:58.460
I just can't because nobody complains that there's too many different shift knobs from

21:58.460 --> 22:00.060
all the different car manufacturers.

22:00.060 --> 22:03.740
Nobody complains that there's too many gas station brands.

22:03.740 --> 22:07.020
At the end of the day, you're still getting gas in your car, you're still shifting.

22:07.020 --> 22:13.260
What does it matter as an end user if it was a Snap, a Flatpak, or a Deb, or an RPM?

22:13.260 --> 22:17.900
It has some ramifications, but it honestly just seems like something that only the computer

22:17.900 --> 22:21.860
gigs would care about, but I don't know, maybe that's the type of person who's evaluating

22:21.860 --> 22:22.860
Linux right now.

22:22.860 --> 22:23.860
So perhaps it is an issue.

22:23.860 --> 22:30.020
I think one of the things about these modern package management ideas in Flatpak, Snaps,

22:30.020 --> 22:33.860
et cetera, is it kind of early days for them.

22:33.860 --> 22:38.340
It's only very recently that it feels like something like Flatpaks have been stable enough

22:38.340 --> 22:45.260
to be the main way to deliver software to a distribution, and we visited that just last

22:45.260 --> 22:50.940
week with Silverblue, and you said you had mostly a really great and smooth experience,

22:50.940 --> 22:58.020
so I wonder if a lot of that user's latching on to the various package methods is just

22:58.020 --> 23:00.340
born out of that transition?

23:00.340 --> 23:05.020
Yeah, it's a problem for today, but one that it feels like there's just no way this isn't

23:05.020 --> 23:08.900
solved in 10 years, but who knows?

23:08.900 --> 23:09.900
Who knows?

23:09.900 --> 23:14.620
But from a new user's perspective, I just don't quite buy it yet that it's a big problem.

23:14.620 --> 23:19.800
Assuming they're using graphical tools, all that is sort of not even obvious to them what's

23:19.800 --> 23:23.420
happening in the backend, unless you're really paying attention.

23:23.420 --> 23:28.220
There's another area in here that he gets to, kind of touches on cohesion, kind of touches

23:28.220 --> 23:33.260
on UI design, and I think it really is a symptom of fragmented desktop environments.

23:33.260 --> 23:39.660
He criticizes both Bluetooth, Bluetooth setup, printing, adding printers, managing printers.

23:39.660 --> 23:40.980
He's like, it's bad still.

23:40.980 --> 23:42.740
It's really bad.

23:42.740 --> 23:47.100
Not in my opinion so bad if you stick with Plasma or GNOME.

23:47.100 --> 23:49.940
They manage this stuff pretty well, but I'm curious what you think.

23:49.940 --> 23:54.700
What's your impressions of adding things like printers or Bluetooth devices to a Linux device?

23:54.700 --> 23:56.740
Has this been a big problem recently for you?

23:56.740 --> 24:01.780
Well, I'd say as far as Bluetooth devices go, I have not had any very Linux-specific

24:01.780 --> 24:02.780
issues.

24:02.780 --> 24:06.820
Linux itself has its whole host of issues that I don't think we'll touch on today.

24:06.820 --> 24:10.580
But that for me, in my personal experience, has been fairly smooth, and I'd be curious

24:10.580 --> 24:12.340
to hear your experience, Chris.

24:12.340 --> 24:16.860
Yeah, I mean, mostly I kind of have phased a lot of Bluetooth out because it was kind

24:16.860 --> 24:20.740
of crappy for years, and I just sort of over the years just said, all right, I'll either

24:20.740 --> 24:22.900
go wired or RF.

24:22.900 --> 24:27.420
But I asked Wes because he works all day with Bluetooth headphones.

24:27.420 --> 24:30.780
He does meetings, he listens to music, he streams podcasts from his Linux desktop.

24:30.780 --> 24:34.420
I think he got like some of those well-known Sony noise-canceling earbuds.

24:34.420 --> 24:38.700
So I asked him before he left for a special assignment, and he said that he does think

24:38.700 --> 24:43.620
it used to be a bigger issue, and that really, Apple deserves credit here for having Bluetooth

24:43.620 --> 24:47.260
pretty much figured out on their own devices, so that kind of adds pressure.

24:47.260 --> 24:50.300
Like they set the goalposts there.

24:50.300 --> 24:54.580
But over the years, things have gotten better, and then when you combine the underlying Bluetooth

24:54.580 --> 24:59.140
improvements with PipeWire, Wes says that he feels like things have gotten significantly

24:59.140 --> 25:00.140
better.

25:00.140 --> 25:01.500
He's improved a lot.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.880
There's some trade-offs.

25:02.880 --> 25:06.660
The Mac experience is absolutely good, but honestly, the Linux experience has gotten

25:06.660 --> 25:08.980
great and it gives you more control.

25:08.980 --> 25:12.620
He also likes the fact that he has the option to mess with codecs and such, so he can kind

25:12.620 --> 25:16.860
of dial in how it sounds in his headphones, which he can't do on the Mac side.

25:16.860 --> 25:18.580
That's actually kind of nice.

25:18.580 --> 25:24.140
You did ask me as well about printers, and I got to say it's the total opposite story

25:24.140 --> 25:25.140
there for me.

25:25.140 --> 25:31.300
I have successfully installed many printers on family and friends and my own systems,

25:31.300 --> 25:35.100
and it never has been a smooth process.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.100
Not once.

25:36.100 --> 25:42.660
It always involved deep diving into ancient blog posts that hint at possible solutions,

25:42.660 --> 25:49.320
or for instance, Brother printers have pretty great support, except you need an application

25:49.320 --> 25:56.100
from them, which is a terminal command line-based tool that works sometimes, most of the time,

25:56.100 --> 25:59.220
but it's like an 80% kind of thing and they can be super finicky.

25:59.220 --> 26:05.180
So I kind of cringe every time I need to install a printer, to be honest, and I try to get

26:05.180 --> 26:06.700
away from it for that very reason.

26:06.700 --> 26:10.900
So I could feel, as someone in an office situation, that might be a totally different story.

26:10.900 --> 26:15.800
It's fair to say, if you buy your printer with Linux compatibility in mind, you shop

26:15.800 --> 26:19.140
with Linux compatibility in mind, when you get it home and plug it in, it's going to

26:19.140 --> 26:20.140
be fine.

26:20.140 --> 26:21.140
It's going to just work.

26:21.140 --> 26:24.980
Even if it's a network printer, he specifically criticizes network printers.

26:24.980 --> 26:29.100
If it's a Linux compatible printer, i.e. there's a driver for it and all that stuff, it's going

26:29.100 --> 26:30.100
to be just fine.

26:30.100 --> 26:36.220
For years now, I've just auto-detected my wife's desk jet that she bought, what I need

26:36.220 --> 26:40.420
to print occasionally, and I just, at that point, I open up a print wizard and it just

26:40.420 --> 26:44.020
auto-detects the printer and I add it to my system and I print, and it's been as bad as

26:44.020 --> 26:45.940
simple as it gets for a long time.

26:45.940 --> 26:47.680
You got to buy for compatibility.

26:47.680 --> 26:51.220
You got to buy for compatibility, just like you do with the Mac.

26:51.220 --> 26:53.740
You got to buy for compatibility with the Mac too.

26:53.740 --> 26:57.860
It's no, I mean, maybe there's more options, but not really, not when it comes to printers.

26:57.860 --> 26:59.580
And so, is it a compromise?

26:59.580 --> 27:02.160
Yeah, I think this is where he's got us a little bit.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.160
It is a compromise.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.160
Same with scanners.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.000
I'd be buying for compatibility.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.380
You know, again, is that a compromise?

27:08.380 --> 27:11.920
Sure, but it's one I'm willing to make to have a computing environment that works the

27:11.920 --> 27:12.920
way I need it to.

27:12.920 --> 27:16.700
Just like if I was a Mac user, I'd be willing to buy a Mac compatible printer.

27:16.700 --> 27:22.140
A lot of people in our community and people who just need to get things done have recently,

27:22.140 --> 27:24.820
especially with the M1 stuff, moved to Macs full time.

27:24.820 --> 27:27.780
And I know you've been playing with one recently.

27:27.780 --> 27:30.300
Is it the same experience these days as it used to be?

27:30.300 --> 27:33.780
Like are you feeling like, like printing, for instance, there's cups under the hood

27:33.780 --> 27:37.980
on both systems, but does the Mac just do something that's a little bit better for instance?

27:37.980 --> 27:38.980
I don't know.

27:38.980 --> 27:39.980
I can't really speak to that.

27:39.980 --> 27:43.180
I haven't used a lot in those situations, but it feels about the same.

27:43.180 --> 27:44.180
You know, you need to print.

27:44.180 --> 27:45.180
Oh, okay.

27:45.180 --> 27:46.180
Well, I don't have a printer at it yet.

27:46.180 --> 27:47.460
I don't have a printer at it right now.

27:47.460 --> 27:50.380
And you go through a wizard and auto detects the dang thing and then you're done.

27:50.380 --> 27:52.740
It's like almost the exact same process.

27:52.740 --> 27:54.580
It's just a matter of if, is there a driver?

27:54.580 --> 27:58.460
I think where the Mac, maybe, although this is just me guessing has a leg up is there's

27:58.460 --> 28:02.460
probably more vendor direct software that you can install on your machine, but I hate

28:02.460 --> 28:03.460
all that stuff.

28:03.460 --> 28:04.460
That stuff's all garbage.

28:04.460 --> 28:05.460
So.

28:05.460 --> 28:10.180
I mean, that touches on, you know, one advantage that the Mac has, which is a dedicated set

28:10.180 --> 28:11.700
of hardware.

28:11.700 --> 28:17.700
When you think of Linux and how many pieces of hardware Linux desktop supports, it's actually

28:17.700 --> 28:22.540
quite a feat of engineering if you think about, you know, those ancient devices that I was

28:22.540 --> 28:26.760
talking about earlier, the X220s, et cetera, right up to the modern, modern stuff we're

28:26.760 --> 28:27.760
buying these days.

28:27.760 --> 28:34.020
And it's even more impressive when you think about ARM and RISC and PowerPC and just all

28:34.020 --> 28:37.380
the architectures that Linux supports as well.

28:37.380 --> 28:38.380
It's even more impressive.

28:38.380 --> 28:43.780
I think it's important to pause there and to really extend gratitude for that.

28:43.780 --> 28:47.540
It's sort of an amazing feat of engineering when you really, really think about it.

28:47.540 --> 28:51.220
And Mac OS falls apart real quick on a Hackintosh.

28:51.220 --> 28:52.220
Non Mac hardware.

28:52.220 --> 28:53.900
I did that for about a week one time.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.140
I don't know how long you lasted.

28:55.140 --> 28:59.060
Well, I had to do it for a couple of years for at least a year, you know, for a while

28:59.060 --> 29:03.620
back back in the battle days of live streaming years ago, years and years ago.

29:03.620 --> 29:07.540
You know, it's just so taped together.

29:07.540 --> 29:15.980
It's so built on a whole like card of house assumptions, Mac OS, it's a good OS until

29:15.980 --> 29:19.140
it's outside its comfort zone and then it just falls apart.

29:19.140 --> 29:24.820
The thing is, is that's not something most users ever really have to experience.

29:24.820 --> 29:30.260
And Linux does such a remarkable job considering the range of hardware it supports and the

29:30.260 --> 29:32.260
drivers that it has to be able to support.

29:32.260 --> 29:37.780
You know, he's right in the sense that you're going to get 100 percent hardware compatibility

29:37.780 --> 29:41.180
when you get a Mac or if you get a Surface with Windows.

29:41.180 --> 29:44.940
But I actually feel like we're doing pretty good as far as Linux first hardware choices

29:44.940 --> 29:45.940
go these days.

29:45.940 --> 29:48.980
Feels like 2022 is a better year than it ever has been.

29:48.980 --> 29:52.660
Yeah, I certainly, certainly agree there.

29:52.660 --> 29:56.580
It feels like it's almost hard to choose these days.

29:56.580 --> 30:00.220
And I think we have a little bit of feedback coming up in that regard.

30:00.220 --> 30:06.580
One thing I'm noting that is lacking from this conversation, both his article and our

30:06.580 --> 30:11.020
conversation here is nobody's mentioned Windows anywhere in this.

30:11.020 --> 30:12.620
That seems like a data point to me.

30:12.620 --> 30:17.440
I think in part it's because he's looking at it from an enthusiast standpoint who's

30:17.440 --> 30:21.540
probably moved on from Windows, maybe, I don't really know.

30:21.540 --> 30:26.620
Could be that, you know, that developer market, they tend to either buy Linux or Macs unless

30:26.620 --> 30:29.060
their work requires them to use Windows.

30:29.060 --> 30:31.380
There is that aspect of it.

30:31.380 --> 30:32.380
Maybe you're right.

30:32.380 --> 30:34.060
Maybe, maybe Windows gets some of these things better.

30:34.060 --> 30:38.440
My sense is that not really, though, sort of the same struggles, maybe a wider range

30:38.440 --> 30:40.060
of printers that are just going to work.

30:40.060 --> 30:42.700
But also you're going to have a wider range of crap software that gets installed.

30:42.700 --> 30:46.020
It's like the worst of all worlds, perhaps.

30:46.020 --> 30:50.260
You know, Chris, one reason I was on the Mac for like, I don't know, five years or something.

30:50.260 --> 30:52.080
Now this is slightly outdated information.

30:52.080 --> 30:57.920
But one of the reasons I did move away from it was I always felt as though I was running

30:57.920 --> 31:04.180
up against that wall of what the Apple folks expect you to be doing with your computer

31:04.180 --> 31:06.300
versus what you actually want to be doing.

31:06.300 --> 31:10.700
And it seems totally fine if you stay within that realm of, hey, here's what we think you

31:10.700 --> 31:11.700
should be doing.

31:11.700 --> 31:15.100
And we've really thought out the design of how that flow works.

31:15.100 --> 31:19.740
But as soon as you try to do something a little different or start tinkering or something,

31:19.740 --> 31:21.740
I feel like it's a real struggle.

31:21.740 --> 31:24.220
Or at least the system gets a little bit in your way.

31:24.220 --> 31:25.220
Maybe it's different these days.

31:25.220 --> 31:30.660
I mean, some developers love the Mac, and I acknowledge that my information here is

31:30.660 --> 31:31.660
quite outdated.

31:31.660 --> 31:35.180
I'd be curious to dive back in and give it a shot for a little bit.

31:35.180 --> 31:37.020
But has that been your experience recently?

31:37.020 --> 31:42.340
Yeah, I feel like that characterization is mostly accurate.

31:42.340 --> 31:45.940
It's a sandbox, and you're expected to play within that sandbox.

31:45.940 --> 31:52.940
And my conspiracy bacon is it's going to get even worse, not better.

31:52.940 --> 31:57.480
Because if you look at where Apple's going with the Apple Silicon, they're really building

31:57.480 --> 32:06.820
in a lot of purpose-specific co-processors, things that are physical chips on their SOC

32:06.820 --> 32:08.100
that do one thing.

32:08.100 --> 32:14.000
And they do that one thing really, really fast to offload it off of the general CPU.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.520
And it requires a whole set of software stack support and all that kind of stuff.

32:17.520 --> 32:22.820
So it's kind of something that Apple can be uniquely good at, is they can ship a new co-processor

32:22.820 --> 32:28.040
in an SOC, and at the same time, they can ship an update to the OS that enables support

32:28.040 --> 32:29.980
for that SOC.

32:29.980 --> 32:32.640
And it's neat, and there's going to obviously be advantages.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.620
But what it also does is it boxes you in.

32:34.620 --> 32:39.420
It means that when you go outside of one of those specific co-processors, you're just

32:39.420 --> 32:41.720
going to be on the general CPU.

32:41.720 --> 32:45.720
And in a way, that's going to also kind of create this environment of, well, the Mac

32:45.720 --> 32:51.380
is really good at some things, but there's other things where the Mac kind of lags behind

32:51.380 --> 32:53.520
at and it's not so good at.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.620
And we're going to see that kind of shake out over the next couple of years.

32:56.620 --> 33:01.660
But I think that will add to the sort of sandbox feeling of the Mac platform, where over on

33:01.660 --> 33:04.940
the x86 side, you're going to absolutely get co-processors, and you're going to get things

33:04.940 --> 33:05.940
like that.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.820
But it won't have that sandbox feeling.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.900
You can take advantage of it, or you can't.

33:09.900 --> 33:10.900
You don't.

33:10.900 --> 33:14.740
There's lots of ways you can solve that problem on the PC platform.

33:14.740 --> 33:20.500
And do you think that's the cost of rapid evolution and innovation?

33:20.500 --> 33:25.740
Is this kind of narrow view, narrow perspective, and sort of ignoring all this other stuff

33:25.740 --> 33:26.740
for now?

33:26.740 --> 33:31.380
Yeah, I think, too, it's probably just an area where they can compete where other manufacturers

33:31.380 --> 33:32.380
can't, really.

33:32.380 --> 33:37.220
Intel could add a co-processor for ProRes decoding or H.264 accelerated decoding.

33:37.220 --> 33:41.020
But how many applications would get updated to support it?

33:41.020 --> 33:42.020
One or two?

33:42.020 --> 33:43.020
Right?

33:43.020 --> 33:44.020
Maybe.

33:44.020 --> 33:45.020
Maybe.

33:45.020 --> 33:47.460
But on the Apple side, they could update the entire stack.

33:47.460 --> 33:50.100
The flip side of that is they own that entire stack.

33:50.100 --> 33:53.860
If they don't make the app, or they don't add the feature you want, you don't get it.

33:53.860 --> 33:55.900
And there's nobody in the market that can create it.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.940
It's just the way it is.

33:57.940 --> 34:02.360
I think after reading this article and really pondering the facts, I think the big question

34:02.360 --> 34:09.460
that comes to me, and I'm curious about what you think, is what do we do about it?

34:09.460 --> 34:10.460
What's the next step?

34:10.460 --> 34:12.100
What are we hoping?

34:12.100 --> 34:13.300
Do we want this to change?

34:13.300 --> 34:14.860
Is this just the way it is?

34:14.860 --> 34:18.100
Is there something we can do to help things out?

34:18.100 --> 34:19.100
What do we want from it?

34:19.100 --> 34:23.220
I've been trying to think about that, too, and I know one thing, obviously, that we can

34:23.220 --> 34:27.540
do as users is we can file bug reports, and we can get involved in the conversation, and

34:27.540 --> 34:30.700
we can say, hey, this is my hardware stack, and this is the problem I'm running into.

34:30.700 --> 34:33.340
So we can absolutely do a lot more of that.

34:33.340 --> 34:38.340
But I also think over time in Linux, it's been so amazing as these problems have gotten

34:38.340 --> 34:39.340
solved.

34:39.340 --> 34:44.300
We're about a year away from all of the issues you're having right now with your Nvidia card

34:44.300 --> 34:47.420
from probably being solved, right?

34:47.420 --> 34:52.540
I think a big part of it is you're dealing with a really cranky driver stack there.

34:52.540 --> 34:57.300
If you had maybe all Intel graphics or all AMD graphics in that PC, you probably wouldn't

34:57.300 --> 35:00.560
be having these multi-monitor refresh rate issues that you're having with those weird

35:00.560 --> 35:02.740
artifacts and whatnot.

35:02.740 --> 35:09.060
And in a year or so, the Nvidia driver will be open source, and I have seen a lot of remarkable

35:09.060 --> 35:11.780
things happen in desktop Linux, you know?

35:11.780 --> 35:13.300
Wi-Fi was a huge thing.

35:13.300 --> 35:16.620
When we got Wi-Fi sorted out, that was a game changer.

35:16.620 --> 35:23.900
That used to be such a pain, like an incredible pain, and a showstopper for some.

35:23.900 --> 35:27.260
And when we got that solved, it felt like, wow, we've really reached a milestone here.

35:27.260 --> 35:28.260
This is big, right?

35:28.260 --> 35:32.500
But I remember when we found out that the Nvidia driver was going to get open sourced

35:32.500 --> 35:36.320
and it was coming and it was going to be about a year's worth of work, I remember thinking

35:36.320 --> 35:42.220
right then and there, like, this is like the last really big desktop problem that remains

35:42.220 --> 35:43.540
to be solved.

35:43.540 --> 35:47.980
Because once you solve this, a lot of the little issues that you're experiencing and

35:47.980 --> 35:51.340
other people are experiencing just start to go away.

35:51.340 --> 35:54.780
It'll take a little bit of time, but we're so close.

35:54.780 --> 35:59.860
And so ultimately, you know, you look at it and you think, maybe the kernel team strategy

35:59.860 --> 36:02.060
has been rock solid all along.

36:02.060 --> 36:08.100
You know, they just held the course, they didn't compromise, and the end result is we're

36:08.100 --> 36:10.100
going to get open source drivers.

36:10.100 --> 36:14.940
And you look out there and I think, really, the last thing standing that would really

36:14.940 --> 36:18.420
make this one whole suite package would be ZFS.

36:18.420 --> 36:20.020
It's so true.

36:20.020 --> 36:21.020
It's so true.

36:21.020 --> 36:22.020
Yeah.

36:22.020 --> 36:25.340
The author didn't even touch on file systems, right?

36:25.340 --> 36:28.420
No, but man, that's a whole other bag of tricks.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.420
Yeah, yeah.

36:29.420 --> 36:30.420
It'd be great to see.

36:30.420 --> 36:35.140
And maybe one day, you know, I mean, if we're seeing Nvidia doing about face, maybe Oracle

36:35.140 --> 36:36.180
could do it.

36:36.180 --> 36:38.500
Is this a new, like, mid-year prediction?

36:38.500 --> 36:39.540
Is that what's coming out?

36:39.540 --> 36:40.600
It's a summer prediction, Brent.

36:40.600 --> 36:41.980
It's a summer prediction indeed.

36:41.980 --> 36:44.540
Get it in and lock it in right now.

36:44.540 --> 36:45.900
I'll link to the article.

36:45.900 --> 36:46.940
I think it is worth a read.

36:46.940 --> 36:50.100
It's worth considering this stuff as Linux users, especially those of us who go on the

36:50.100 --> 36:51.820
air and say, yeah, you should do this Linux thing.

36:51.820 --> 36:55.340
It's great.

36:55.340 --> 36:57.300
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

36:57.300 --> 37:02.140
Go get started with a free trial for yourself, for your team, or your enterprise at Bitwarden.com

37:02.140 --> 37:03.620
slash Linux.

37:03.620 --> 37:10.120
This is the easiest way for you or a business to store sensitive data and sync it securely.

37:10.120 --> 37:11.400
This is a great tool.

37:11.400 --> 37:14.220
And of course, Bitwarden is open source.

37:14.220 --> 37:19.060
It's trusted by millions of individuals, teams, and organizations out there for any kind of

37:19.060 --> 37:21.340
sensitive data, like your passwords.

37:21.340 --> 37:25.420
It's a great way to get started for onboarding employees or getting started on an open source

37:25.420 --> 37:26.420
team.

37:26.420 --> 37:29.740
Like here at JB, you get on board, you get access to Bitwarden.

37:29.740 --> 37:32.040
I love the features they've been adding too.

37:32.040 --> 37:36.380
In just the last couple of months, my Bitwarden has gotten better and better.

37:36.380 --> 37:38.500
The username generator is fantastic.

37:38.500 --> 37:42.740
I don't know how I never thought of this, but it's just absolutely brilliant.

37:42.740 --> 37:47.100
Why not have a unique password and username for every site and service you use?

37:47.100 --> 37:49.640
And their mobile app is really great.

37:49.640 --> 37:53.140
On iOS, the face ID integration is just fantastic.

37:53.140 --> 37:56.620
If I want to get on a website or log into an app, it just like scans my face I'm in.

37:56.620 --> 38:00.740
On Android, they've got quick account switching right there at the keyboard where you're entering

38:00.740 --> 38:01.740
the password.

38:01.740 --> 38:04.980
They support all the bio authentication over there as well.

38:04.980 --> 38:09.060
And there is a large community always available to help if you ever get stuck, plus they've

38:09.060 --> 38:11.080
got support as well.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.640
And then there's a lot of other nice features baked in.

38:13.640 --> 38:17.420
As you start using Bitwarden, that you discover and you think, what was I doing before this?

38:17.420 --> 38:18.420
What was I doing?

38:18.420 --> 38:19.980
An animal, that's what I was doing.

38:19.980 --> 38:23.120
And you probably know somebody out there who's not using Bitwarden.

38:23.120 --> 38:26.580
Maybe it's your team or your company, maybe it's the project you're working with.

38:26.580 --> 38:29.180
They could probably use a little Bitwarden, you know what I'm saying, a little upgrade

38:29.180 --> 38:30.180
to their security.

38:30.180 --> 38:34.220
Go try Bitwarden right now at bitwarden.com slash Linux or send that link to a friend,

38:34.220 --> 38:37.180
a family member or someone at work that needs to do this.

38:37.180 --> 38:41.740
It's probably like the number one thing you could do online to increase your security

38:41.740 --> 38:46.820
is use a really great password, use a unique username for every website, every service

38:46.820 --> 38:48.320
you use online.

38:48.320 --> 38:51.860
And you can do that while supporting the show and getting the best password manager in the

38:51.860 --> 38:52.860
business.

38:52.860 --> 38:56.680
So go to bitwarden.com slash Linux to grab that and support the show.

38:56.680 --> 39:05.520
Try it for free for yourself or a team at bitwarden.com slash Linux.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.060
We got some more great feedback this week.

39:07.060 --> 39:08.620
So thank you for everyone who sent some in.

39:08.620 --> 39:15.140
I had a hard time, you know, choosing some for this episode just to keep it keep it small.

39:15.140 --> 39:17.540
But those those others will follow next time.

39:17.540 --> 39:19.020
David wrote in about Silverblue.

39:19.020 --> 39:21.780
I think we got quite a bit of feedback on Silverblue, right, Chris?

39:21.780 --> 39:26.100
Oh, we sure did, Brettly, from all kinds of means and methods.

39:26.100 --> 39:29.980
It means either we did good things or we did bad things.

39:29.980 --> 39:33.940
David writes in about Ansible, using Ansible, because I mentioned, hey, it'd be lovely to

39:33.940 --> 39:36.780
have some declarative configuration in there.

39:36.780 --> 39:40.340
David writes, Hey, guys, I really appreciated the Silverblue segment you did.

39:40.340 --> 39:44.580
One thing that I wanted to highlight is that it's possible to build a Silverblue workstation

39:44.580 --> 39:48.880
up with Ansible, just like you declaratively build it up on Nix.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.940
This is the solution that I've adopted.

39:50.940 --> 39:57.180
And my daily driver has never been this solid, and I can reproduce it at a moment's notice.

39:57.180 --> 40:00.020
I got to say, that is a very obvious way of doing it.

40:00.020 --> 40:06.080
I passed over that when I mentioned it on last episode, and I'm happy to be corrected

40:06.080 --> 40:09.220
because I think this is a wonderful way to accomplish that.

40:09.220 --> 40:10.220
So thank you, David.

40:10.220 --> 40:12.180
It's like peanut butter and jelly.

40:12.180 --> 40:15.700
Joe writes in with Chrome on Silverblue and toolboxes.

40:15.700 --> 40:19.700
Love the episode on Silverblue and good tip on updating Flatpak to allow for Chrome.

40:19.700 --> 40:23.780
I've been experimenting with Toolbox to just install RPM downloads.

40:23.780 --> 40:25.300
I tested it out using Chrome.

40:25.300 --> 40:30.180
It's a bit slower to start than Flatpak, but it definitely works, he says.

40:30.180 --> 40:31.460
That may be useful.

40:31.460 --> 40:32.460
Cheers.

40:32.460 --> 40:34.940
Toolbox is a great, great tool.

40:34.940 --> 40:39.620
We linked to Distrobox in last week's episode where you can get toolbox-like capabilities

40:39.620 --> 40:42.040
on any Linux desktop environment.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.820
But what I love about it is somebody who's trying out apps all the time, because I can

40:45.820 --> 40:50.740
trash a toolbox environment, like all kinds of crazy dependencies, all kinds of crazy

40:50.740 --> 40:53.700
libraries, whatever, and then just blow it away.

40:53.700 --> 40:56.620
And my system goes about just like everything's totes fine.

40:56.620 --> 41:00.140
And the cool thing they're doing, the clever thing they're doing in the background is they're

41:00.140 --> 41:04.340
doing some mount magic so it looks like you're on your local file system, but you're totally

41:04.340 --> 41:06.060
isolated in a protected system.

41:06.060 --> 41:08.460
I feel like we're living in a really great time.

41:08.460 --> 41:10.260
There's so many options to get stuff done.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.260
It's amazing.

41:11.260 --> 41:16.900
Jordan also wrote in, hey Chris, I heard you had trouble with tailscale on Silverblue.

41:16.900 --> 41:22.700
I use it on all of my RPM OS tree based systems by just adding their yum repository to my

41:22.700 --> 41:23.700
system.

41:23.700 --> 41:28.700
You can add any RPM repository to your system and get updates and such that way.

41:28.700 --> 41:29.700
Works great.

41:29.700 --> 41:33.940
I got that tip a few times and I wasn't sure at the time we were recorded, so I didn't

41:33.940 --> 41:39.300
say anything, but I thought maybe it was possible that space would get overwritten when I did

41:39.300 --> 41:40.300
an update.

41:40.300 --> 41:43.700
I don't want to say it on air, but then I heard about a hundred times afterwards, it's

41:43.700 --> 41:45.180
totally fine.

41:45.180 --> 41:50.060
So basically what he's saying is I could just add a tailscale repo to my Silverblue install

41:50.060 --> 41:52.060
and then just install it with RPM OS tree.

41:52.060 --> 41:53.060
No bigs.

41:53.060 --> 41:54.060
That would be pretty straightforward.

41:54.060 --> 41:58.300
Yeah, but I think you touched on something there, like we're looking at quite a different

41:58.300 --> 42:02.540
paradigm and it seems like you paused a little bit and said, well, is the old way of doing

42:02.540 --> 42:05.060
things going to work just as I expect here?

42:05.060 --> 42:08.900
So I think that's a question worth asking and apparently the answer is yes.

42:08.900 --> 42:10.460
At least for tailscale.

42:10.460 --> 42:11.460
All right.

42:11.460 --> 42:12.460
I think you got to take this next one.

42:12.460 --> 42:14.060
I think you know what's going on with this next one.

42:14.060 --> 42:19.540
Brent wrote in and it reads Brent and I had a chance to chat a bit when you guys were

42:19.540 --> 42:22.660
all in town at the last rally meetup.

42:22.660 --> 42:27.180
I'd like to offer to take Brent out to dinner and show him around town a bit while he's

42:27.180 --> 42:28.180
here again.

42:28.180 --> 42:29.180
Wow.

42:29.180 --> 42:32.860
How about, what about I'm just stuck up here in Seattle.

42:32.860 --> 42:33.860
Nobody's getting me dinner.

42:33.860 --> 42:34.860
No, that's great.

42:34.860 --> 42:35.860
That is really great.

42:35.860 --> 42:36.860
Are you going to do it?

42:36.860 --> 42:37.860
Oh yeah.

42:37.860 --> 42:38.860
So Brent and I had a good time.

42:38.860 --> 42:42.660
I mean, anytime I meet someone named Brent out in the wild, which doesn't surprisingly

42:42.660 --> 42:47.540
happen that often, Chris, I would imagine you meet quite a few Chris.

42:47.540 --> 42:53.980
But every Brent I've met has been handsome and really kind and gentle and just an upstanding

42:53.980 --> 42:54.980
citizen.

42:54.980 --> 42:57.140
So Brent, I'll take you up on your offer for sure.

42:57.140 --> 43:00.060
Boy, not as Chris as we are a bad batch.

43:00.060 --> 43:04.580
The whole batch of us, I tell you what, no, they sure are.

43:04.580 --> 43:08.060
Most places I've ever worked at, there's been a minimum of five Chris's.

43:08.060 --> 43:09.300
Oh my goodness.

43:09.300 --> 43:13.060
Uncle Nicky writes in and he says, Hey guys, I don't know if you're aware of this, but

43:13.060 --> 43:18.900
the Dell XPS 13 developer edition has quietly been pulled from Dell's online store.

43:18.900 --> 43:21.820
I'm looking for a good laptop for my PhD work.

43:21.820 --> 43:27.000
And because of all the great reviews of the XPS 13 dev edition or over the years, I decided

43:27.000 --> 43:28.220
this is the way to go.

43:28.220 --> 43:33.540
But lo and behold, when I went to Dell's website, the XPS 13 developer edition is listed as

43:33.540 --> 43:35.820
no longer available.

43:35.820 --> 43:41.580
Oh, he says, I hope this is just a case of them removing the product listing before introducing

43:41.580 --> 43:42.580
new hardware.

43:42.580 --> 43:43.580
Hmm.

43:43.580 --> 43:47.340
You know, I am not sure exactly what is going on here.

43:47.340 --> 43:52.100
I haven't heard anything from our contacts at Dell, but I did notice a change in their

43:52.100 --> 43:53.380
language.

43:53.380 --> 43:59.180
I've noticed that they're now saying the Dell XPS 13 has been certified for Ubuntu as in

43:59.180 --> 44:03.980
like just the Dell XPS 13, the main one, just the regular one you buy.

44:03.980 --> 44:07.180
They're just saying now certified for Ubuntu.

44:07.180 --> 44:10.740
I don't know if maybe that's the change, but I actually would be a little bit sad if they

44:10.740 --> 44:14.380
were no longer making a Linux specific Dell XPS.

44:14.380 --> 44:15.860
I think that'd be a loss.

44:15.860 --> 44:20.180
But I wonder if there's an advantage there, you know, is it just, and I haven't looked

44:20.180 --> 44:24.220
into this and it's worth doing once we get off air here, but is it just going to be a

44:24.220 --> 44:29.980
dropdown on the regular XPS that you can just choose Ubuntu, for instance?

44:29.980 --> 44:34.380
That wouldn't be maybe an acceptable compromise, I would think.

44:34.380 --> 44:38.500
Although maybe it comes with a little bit less, you know, Linux happy PR.

44:38.500 --> 44:39.500
Yeah.

44:39.500 --> 44:43.740
It'd be unfortunate if it's like, no, you just get it with windows, but just wipe it.

44:43.740 --> 44:44.740
It's fine.

44:44.740 --> 44:45.740
It's fine.

44:45.740 --> 44:46.740
Yeah.

44:46.740 --> 44:47.740
That would be a shame.

44:47.740 --> 44:50.480
I agree completely.

44:50.480 --> 44:53.780
And now it is time for the boost.

44:53.780 --> 45:01.740
Dev writes in with our first boost, 1,853 SATs, he says, 1853 is the year Isaac Stevens,

45:01.740 --> 45:04.900
the first governor of Washington was elected into office.

45:04.900 --> 45:05.900
Now you know.

45:05.900 --> 45:07.300
I love the reasons for the boosts.

45:07.300 --> 45:10.560
I have to regret to inform you that I will be stopping my core subscription because I

45:10.560 --> 45:16.580
just don't really have a lot going on currently, but I do have a wallet of over 50K SATs.

45:16.580 --> 45:19.900
Feels wrong to just give them all at once when I could boost in historical facts instead.

45:19.900 --> 45:20.900
So please advise.

45:20.900 --> 45:21.900
That's wonderful.

45:21.900 --> 45:28.940
You know what, now if you keep boosting and we like hearing from you, I'd like feedback.

45:28.940 --> 45:32.880
I always appreciate the thing about the boosts because I always appreciate when they get

45:32.880 --> 45:35.820
us talking about something we didn't plan on talking about.

45:35.820 --> 45:40.020
You know, the other thing about the boosts is they help keep our compass aligned towards

45:40.020 --> 45:41.020
the audience.

45:41.020 --> 45:44.560
They make the audience the number one customer for the show, for the network.

45:44.560 --> 45:46.300
And so keep it coming.

45:46.300 --> 45:49.700
I'll let you decide on how to do it, but keep it coming.

45:49.700 --> 45:51.540
Sir Lurks a lot wrote in.

45:51.540 --> 45:57.660
You know, that's a memorable time when Sir Lurks a lot boosts in two days ago, one thousand

45:57.660 --> 46:00.660
three hundred thirty seven SATs.

46:00.660 --> 46:01.660
Nice.

46:01.660 --> 46:02.660
B-O-O-S-T.

46:02.660 --> 46:03.660
They're right.

46:03.660 --> 46:06.900
I know you're looking for good warm up songs for the pre show.

46:06.900 --> 46:13.940
Someone is story in the Matrix lab lug room suggested Axel F. Famous from the Beverly

46:13.940 --> 46:16.380
Hills cop movies with Eddie Murphy.

46:16.380 --> 46:22.260
I thought that was a great idea and search for remixes when I came upon Crazy Frog.

46:22.260 --> 46:26.700
How oh how could I forget about Crazy Frog?

46:26.700 --> 46:31.900
That video went so viral back in the day and the Crazy Frog version has great build ups

46:31.900 --> 46:37.380
at different points and it makes perhaps a good contender for the warm up music.

46:37.380 --> 46:38.980
I'm not doing Crazy Frog.

46:38.980 --> 46:40.620
I'm not doing Crazy Frog.

46:40.620 --> 46:45.380
I did play it and I thought, you know, it does have good energy.

46:45.380 --> 46:52.020
It does get your, you know, your toes tapping, but it would be such an earworm for the audience.

46:52.020 --> 46:53.340
I think people would hate it.

46:53.340 --> 47:07.900
So but Axel F. does have a lot of what makes Crazy Frog good.

47:07.900 --> 47:22.620
It's just so 1984.

47:22.620 --> 47:24.420
You know, it's so it's so classic.

47:24.420 --> 47:26.740
I think it needs a bit more cowbell to be honest.

47:26.740 --> 47:27.740
Yeah, it could.

47:27.740 --> 47:28.740
You know what?

47:28.740 --> 47:29.740
I agree, Brent.

47:29.740 --> 47:31.420
A lot of things could use more cowbell, though.

47:31.420 --> 47:32.980
They're just not hearing us.

47:32.980 --> 47:33.980
Guess what?

47:33.980 --> 47:36.900
Lurkslot comes in with a double boost.

47:36.900 --> 47:40.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:40.960 --> 47:49.380
With fifty three thousand two hundred and eighty sets.

47:49.380 --> 47:52.140
A couple of gallons for Brent's gas tank.

47:52.140 --> 47:53.940
My first computer was a Commodore 64.

47:53.940 --> 47:54.940
Nice.

47:54.940 --> 48:01.300
You know, you could use the poke command directly to set values into a memory address specifically.

48:01.300 --> 48:06.740
Sixty three to eighty is the memory address used to set the border color on the screen.

48:06.740 --> 48:12.620
And since Brent will be crossing borders, that is the inspiration for the SAT numerology.

48:12.620 --> 48:13.980
Wow.

48:13.980 --> 48:16.860
That is wonderfully geeky.

48:16.860 --> 48:19.140
I really, really appreciate that.

48:19.140 --> 48:20.140
Lurkslot.

48:20.140 --> 48:21.140
That's great.

48:21.140 --> 48:22.140
Totally nailed it.

48:22.140 --> 48:25.860
I don't know how many liters that is for my tank, but I really appreciate it.

48:25.860 --> 48:29.860
And also as a little tidbit, Commodore 64 was my first computer, too.

48:29.860 --> 48:30.860
Thanks, Dad.

48:30.860 --> 48:31.860
Aww.

48:31.860 --> 48:39.340
Well, as it turns out, Sir Lurkslot did a triple boost.

48:39.340 --> 48:40.340
Triple boost unlocked.

48:40.340 --> 48:44.220
One thousand three hundred thirty seven sets.

48:44.220 --> 48:45.220
Leap boost.

48:45.220 --> 48:53.220
Can you use the Nyx package manager on top of Steam OS such that all your custom apps

48:53.220 --> 48:55.220
are done via Nyx?

48:55.220 --> 48:59.340
Then when you update Steam OS, you can quickly redeploy all your apps via Nyx configuration.

48:59.340 --> 49:03.700
I'm still new to the whole Nyx OS concept myself, so I'm not sure if home manager might

49:03.700 --> 49:09.420
work here, but I would appreciate if this worthy question could get answered by someone

49:09.420 --> 49:11.400
more Nyx experienced.

49:11.400 --> 49:12.400
We could try this.

49:12.400 --> 49:14.860
I was already wondering this myself, Lurks.

49:14.860 --> 49:20.680
Yeah, we'll try to get the Nyx package manager, not Nyx OS, but the Nyx package manager running

49:20.680 --> 49:23.520
on top of the Steam OS image.

49:23.520 --> 49:27.220
I think it could work if I can keep it all contained in my home directory.

49:27.220 --> 49:28.900
I think that could do it.

49:28.900 --> 49:34.340
I'm really curious for this update and are you going to rope Wes into doing this with

49:34.340 --> 49:35.340
you?

49:35.340 --> 49:37.780
I think I feel like I should get into some trouble together.

49:37.780 --> 49:43.220
Rose Deer boosted in two days ago with three thousand three hundred and thirty three sets.

49:43.220 --> 49:44.220
Boost!

49:44.220 --> 49:45.620
Now this is a feature request.

49:45.620 --> 49:50.220
Please remove the matrix registration info for the JB server because it recommends currently

49:50.220 --> 49:52.260
to create an account, which we're not allowing.

49:52.260 --> 49:53.980
We should make a GitHub thing about that.

49:53.980 --> 49:59.500
I'm taking full responsibility for this one because, wonderfully, several months ago I

49:59.500 --> 50:01.300
wrote a ticket about this very thing.

50:01.300 --> 50:02.780
Hey, we need to change that.

50:02.780 --> 50:07.380
And then we got very, very, very, very distracted by the new Hugo website that we're building

50:07.380 --> 50:09.740
and the community has been amazing there.

50:09.740 --> 50:13.460
And I've been so overwhelmed with just keeping up with all the activity that even though

50:13.460 --> 50:18.100
I may have assigned myself to that ticket, I haven't actually done it in far too long.

50:18.100 --> 50:21.980
So that is completely my responsibility and I apologize.

50:21.980 --> 50:23.420
I will get right on it.

50:23.420 --> 50:25.820
But that new site is coming along.

50:25.820 --> 50:26.820
It's very impressive.

50:26.820 --> 50:27.820
Yeah, it is.

50:27.820 --> 50:35.860
Ibuki wrote in two days ago two thousand one hundred sets coming in hot with the boost.

50:35.860 --> 50:36.860
I love that one.

50:36.860 --> 50:37.860
You got me every time with it.

50:37.860 --> 50:38.860
I know.

50:38.860 --> 50:39.860
It is the best.

50:39.860 --> 50:44.420
You should make other lotteries for similar initiatives and make the tickets have a price

50:44.420 --> 50:47.500
like ten thousand sets, say, just like a regular lottery.

50:47.500 --> 50:49.900
It could be another way of sustaining JB.

50:49.900 --> 50:54.260
We're talking about the JPO lottery, which is up right now at Linux unplugged dot com

50:54.260 --> 50:55.260
JP.

50:55.260 --> 50:56.260
Oh, no, that's required.

50:56.260 --> 50:59.940
But you do need to be in the area or be able to get yourself in the area.

50:59.940 --> 51:01.540
That's kind of required.

51:01.540 --> 51:06.340
We do have a limited slots and we'll be running a lottery on that to give away those spots.

51:06.340 --> 51:07.660
Yeah, I don't know.

51:07.660 --> 51:13.060
I could definitely see one day I was trying to do like a fundraiser for some initiative

51:13.060 --> 51:15.500
or some show we want to launch or some other open source project.

51:15.500 --> 51:17.500
I don't even know how we would ever do that.

51:17.500 --> 51:20.620
You know, that feels like we give it some special thought.

51:20.620 --> 51:28.700
We may have our first prize, which is your custom built, old, perhaps old, the used machine

51:28.700 --> 51:29.700
here.

51:29.700 --> 51:30.700
You get on my used crap.

51:30.700 --> 51:31.700
All right.

51:31.700 --> 51:33.500
Well, a row writes in 15 hours ago.

51:33.500 --> 51:36.820
I don't think that's how you say it with a row of ducks.

51:36.820 --> 51:41.540
I'm a duck, D-U-K duck loaded with talent.

51:41.540 --> 51:43.700
Two thousand two hundred and twenty two stats.

51:43.700 --> 51:48.180
Number of blue sounds like a good option to manage my family devices.

51:48.180 --> 51:51.660
I'll see if it can cut down on my quote support tickets.

51:51.660 --> 51:52.660
Thanks for the show.

51:52.660 --> 51:53.660
I agree.

51:53.660 --> 51:54.660
I had the same thought afterwards.

51:54.660 --> 51:58.780
I was like, this could be the desktop environment I deploy for family.

51:58.780 --> 52:02.580
You know, I did hear some feedback about that when I was doing research that it was a perfect

52:02.580 --> 52:08.140
friends and family distro for those who want to support them a little less.

52:08.140 --> 52:09.580
It's not that we don't want to support you.

52:09.580 --> 52:11.860
It's just that, you know, we're busy.

52:11.860 --> 52:12.860
Yeah, right.

52:12.860 --> 52:18.060
Dragon's wing boosted in nine thousand and one sets.

52:18.060 --> 52:20.540
It's over nine thousand.

52:20.540 --> 52:24.520
I would like to introduce you to the over nine thousand boost.

52:24.520 --> 52:27.960
If you don't know, shame on you if you don't know.

52:27.960 --> 52:34.940
It's a reference to Dragon Ball Z, specifically the scene where I'm going to show my not knowing

52:34.940 --> 52:35.940
this in this one.

52:35.940 --> 52:36.940
Here we go.

52:36.940 --> 52:38.460
I wish you were reading this one.

52:38.460 --> 52:39.740
I'm right there with you.

52:39.740 --> 52:40.740
No, I don't.

52:40.740 --> 52:41.740
I don't.

52:41.740 --> 52:42.740
I don't know anything about Dragon Ball Z.

52:42.740 --> 52:43.740
I apologize.

52:43.740 --> 52:45.940
Bronze Way guide, please write in with all your corrections.

52:45.940 --> 52:49.340
I will read every one of them.

52:49.340 --> 52:57.620
They continue specifically the scene where the gator checks Goku's power level and yells,

52:57.620 --> 52:59.860
it's over nine thousand.

52:59.860 --> 53:02.540
It's over nine thousand.

53:02.540 --> 53:05.620
If you YouTube that scene, there are quite a few funny lines that would be funny to hear

53:05.620 --> 53:09.780
on the podcast when a nine thousand and one boost come in.

53:09.780 --> 53:14.580
Also funny side fact, Oprah was trolled back in the day by someone and she said over nine

53:14.580 --> 53:17.060
thousand on the air without fact checking anything.

53:17.060 --> 53:18.060
Well that's special.

53:18.060 --> 53:19.100
I love that.

53:19.100 --> 53:20.100
That's great.

53:20.100 --> 53:21.420
Thank you, Bronze and Wing.

53:21.420 --> 53:22.420
That's fantastic.

53:22.420 --> 53:30.620
We also have a couple of thank you boosts that came in.

53:30.620 --> 53:36.220
One thousand sats from Neural P, 33 sats from Texas Comrade, and an announcement.

53:36.220 --> 53:39.980
We'll be raising the sat limit to one thousand sats to get your message read on the show,

53:39.980 --> 53:45.820
just to keep the boosts segment at an appropriate length, at a manageable length, but we'll

53:45.820 --> 53:51.340
be reading all of them and we may occasionally promote a sub one thousand sat boost if there's

53:51.340 --> 53:52.340
a great message in there.

53:52.340 --> 53:55.460
If you'd like to send us a boost, support the show, keep the podcast independent, and

53:55.460 --> 54:01.140
take advantage of a free peer-to-peer open source value network, go grab a new podcast

54:01.140 --> 54:02.140
app at newpodcastapps.com.

54:02.140 --> 54:07.220
There's a whole lot of open source and free software happening right there too.

54:07.220 --> 54:12.500
Like one of our favorites, Podverse, which will be embedded into our new website is a

54:12.500 --> 54:20.900
totally GPL podcast player that even has a F-Droid app store entry, iOS version, a web

54:20.900 --> 54:21.900
version.

54:21.900 --> 54:23.580
Podverse is just absolutely fantastic.

54:23.580 --> 54:29.380
Fountain FM as well, very good, and on iOS, if you like CarPlay, Cast-O-Matic can't be

54:29.380 --> 54:30.380
beat.

54:30.380 --> 54:33.740
If you just want to do it by the command line, boost CLI to get your geek cred up, because

54:33.740 --> 54:35.860
we'll call that out as well.

54:35.860 --> 54:37.820
Newpodcastapps.com for all of that.

54:37.820 --> 54:43.500
And with that, we do have ourselves some picks, Brent.

54:43.500 --> 54:49.100
So everybody from time to time probably wants to take advantage of a little bit of cheap

54:49.100 --> 54:50.300
cloud storage, right?

54:50.300 --> 54:53.740
A Google Drive, your drop-bizzles, you know what I'm saying?

54:53.740 --> 54:54.940
Drop-bizzles is my favorite.

54:54.940 --> 54:57.260
It just can't be avoided, Brent.

54:57.260 --> 55:01.180
These are massive companies, their services are wide-reaching, and they can be a great

55:01.180 --> 55:03.100
way to send files to people.

55:03.100 --> 55:04.940
So that's where our app pick comes in today.

55:04.940 --> 55:10.020
It's called CryptoMator, and it's the old kind of crypto, the one that involves file

55:10.020 --> 55:13.020
encryption, you know, the way it should, the way the term should be used.

55:13.020 --> 55:14.020
Oh, that one.

55:14.020 --> 55:15.460
I forgot about that one.

55:15.460 --> 55:20.820
With CryptoMator, it will create encrypted volumes or archives on cloud storage for you.

55:20.820 --> 55:24.060
So you can place your files in there, and then it will encrypt it locally before it

55:24.060 --> 55:26.620
uploads it to cloud storage.

55:26.620 --> 55:27.740
You get what I'm saying here?

55:27.740 --> 55:32.860
So it's a way to take advantage of cheap public cloud storage, but have your files encrypted

55:32.860 --> 55:38.180
locally on your client before they're put there, and then it gives you a UI to manage

55:38.180 --> 55:39.380
all of that.

55:39.380 --> 55:43.660
And then to make it even easier, you guys, it's available as a flat pack on Flat Hub

55:43.660 --> 55:44.740
as well.

55:44.740 --> 55:49.660
But in the example here, they have it attached to OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, and Next

55:49.660 --> 55:53.740
Cloud, and then it's just managing the security for the encryption on all of those.

55:53.740 --> 55:56.860
That is so great and very impressive.

55:56.860 --> 56:03.620
I have recently, so this is a bonus pic, I've recently been using our clone, which accomplishes

56:03.620 --> 56:04.860
a very similar thing.

56:04.860 --> 56:11.100
No fancy UI, well, there's a UI, but it's not quite as fancy as what you were just describing.

56:11.100 --> 56:12.100
And it works great.

56:12.100 --> 56:16.620
But this sounds like maybe a little bit of an upgrade there, or maybe a simpler implementation

56:16.620 --> 56:17.620
perhaps.

56:17.620 --> 56:19.460
I think both those are great, great choices.

56:19.460 --> 56:21.700
Yeah, I think it probably is a little bit simpler.

56:21.700 --> 56:26.940
It has a pretty clean, minimal UI, uses AES 256-bit encryption.

56:26.940 --> 56:29.260
I think it's just really nice and simple.

56:29.260 --> 56:30.580
It is available for other platforms, too.

56:30.580 --> 56:32.660
I'm just looking at their website right now.

56:32.660 --> 56:35.920
It is GDPR compliant as well.

56:35.920 --> 56:39.340
And they have an independent security audit that's been conducted on the two that they

56:39.340 --> 56:41.180
have the results publicly available.

56:41.180 --> 56:42.180
That is something.

56:42.180 --> 56:45.300
Man, you've got my like curiosity ears tingling.

56:45.300 --> 56:46.300
So thank you.

56:46.300 --> 56:49.780
We'll have a link in the show notes or you can go to cryptomator.org or just search for

56:49.780 --> 56:52.260
cryptomator on Flat Hub.

56:52.260 --> 56:53.260
That's all over there.

56:53.260 --> 56:54.860
Well, I think that's it.

56:54.860 --> 56:58.460
We'll we'll be back live on our regular Sunday time with the next episode.

56:58.460 --> 57:00.800
This is just sort of a last minute special.

57:00.800 --> 57:04.540
So that way I can treat the kids to a nice weekend at the beach.

57:04.540 --> 57:08.300
So I appreciate you rearranging your schedule at the last minute there, Brantley.

57:08.300 --> 57:09.300
Well, you're welcome.

57:09.300 --> 57:10.300
Good show.

57:10.300 --> 57:11.300
You're welcome.

57:11.300 --> 57:12.300
It's good having you here.

57:12.300 --> 57:13.300
Appreciate you.

57:13.300 --> 57:14.300
And you know what?

57:14.300 --> 57:15.300
Wes will be back.

57:15.300 --> 57:16.300
He'll be back.

57:16.300 --> 57:17.300
So if you're a big Wes fan and you missed him, don't worry.

57:17.300 --> 57:18.300
He'll be returning.

57:18.300 --> 57:20.540
And, you know, otherwise, that's it.

57:20.540 --> 57:21.540
We're just about done here.

57:21.540 --> 57:23.460
So I'll just give you the last bits of information you need to know.

57:23.460 --> 57:26.580
You can go to LinuxActionNews.com to get a little more show.

57:26.580 --> 57:28.060
We cover the news there.

57:28.060 --> 57:29.180
And there's always a lot going on.

57:29.180 --> 57:31.060
It's kind of like a companion to this here episode.

57:31.060 --> 57:35.460
And then we'll be back to our regular live schedule on Sundays at Jupiter.Tube at noon

57:35.460 --> 57:38.380
Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern.

57:38.380 --> 57:39.380
See you next week.

57:39.380 --> 57:43.940
Same bad time, same bad station.

57:43.940 --> 57:45.740
And then links to what we talked about today.

57:45.740 --> 57:51.020
Well, you can find those over at LinuxUnplugged.com slash 469.

57:51.020 --> 57:55.100
And I'd like to take a moment and thank our members, UnpluggedCore.com.

57:55.100 --> 57:59.300
Our members give us the ability to say no to the craziest kind of sponsors that want

57:59.300 --> 58:04.540
to give us big special deals, quote unquote, this last email we got.

58:04.540 --> 58:06.700
You wouldn't believe the things they want us to sell.

58:06.700 --> 58:08.500
It was so bad.

58:08.500 --> 58:09.700
And our members let us say no.

58:09.700 --> 58:13.180
We get to say no and wait until the right company comes along.

58:13.180 --> 58:16.500
UnpluggedCore.com if you'd like to join that and get the show ad free.

58:16.500 --> 58:17.500
Thanks so much for joining us.

58:17.500 --> 58:44.540
We'll see you right back here next Sunday.

58:47.500 --> 59:01.340
How are you doing over there, Brent?

59:01.340 --> 59:07.580
Yeah, I was thinking I actually think it's responsible of us to just apologize slightly

59:07.580 --> 59:14.920
to listeners for maybe having lowered down the slight intelligence and style quotients

59:14.920 --> 59:15.920
this week.

59:15.920 --> 59:20.220
I mean, Wes isn't here, so we're trying to keep up his end of things, but right without

59:20.220 --> 59:25.700
Wes, like our style goes down a notch because he's always here with like a really good looking

59:25.700 --> 59:28.060
hat, maybe a scarf in the winter.

59:28.060 --> 59:29.060
That's it.

59:29.060 --> 59:32.920
Those shoes, those shoes he wears, always, always smart shoes, always smart shoes.

59:32.920 --> 59:36.340
The scarf helps with audio quality, you know, it absorbs sound.

59:36.340 --> 59:37.340
Yeah.

59:37.340 --> 59:39.740
So I apologize if that feels like it's missing this week.

59:39.740 --> 59:41.580
Yeah, it's weird, right?

59:41.580 --> 59:46.140
And then like, who am I going to go grill with after this, myself?

59:46.140 --> 59:47.280
Do you have the sous vide set up yet?

59:47.280 --> 59:48.740
He usually takes care of that, right?

59:48.740 --> 59:49.740
No, that's his job.

59:49.740 --> 59:50.740
Oh, no.

59:50.740 --> 59:51.740
He didn't set it up last week for you?

59:51.740 --> 01:00:12.340
I think I'm only going to have his chips.
