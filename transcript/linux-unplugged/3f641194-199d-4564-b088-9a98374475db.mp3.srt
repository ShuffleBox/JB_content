00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,600
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 281 for December 26, 2018, our predictions episode!

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,880
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's going off the unscript today.

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,880
I don't know.

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,880
My name is Chris.

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,880
My name is Wes.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,880
And my name is Joe.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,880
Hello, gentlemen.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,400
Joe, it's great to have you on a special episode.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,760
I'll talk a little bit more about what Joe's doing here and what we'll be accomplishing.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,820
This is our opportunity to get out our crystal balls and make a prediction about 2019, where

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,320
things are going in Linux.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,280
And maybe, maybe my chance to finally dominate, finally dominate the predictions.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,880
We're getting really serious this year.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,040
Don't you do this as a living?

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,920
You should be able to get these things right.

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,920
That's right.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,380
This year, I've watched the news closely, followed the trends and the signals, and I

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,160
think I've narrowed it down to a bunch of solid wins.

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,960
And Joe is here to be our ref, to really be the bastard that says, no, no, no, you need

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,480
to be clear about what you're predicting.

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,280
This needs to be measurable.

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,520
And Joe's going to hold us accountable this episode to make sure that the predictions

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:24,100
that Wes, myself and the Mumble Room make are easily understandable and easily measurable.

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,240
So that way, at the end of next year, when we play this back, we can have easy yes or

25
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
no wins.

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,240
Yeah.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,480
You even need acceptance criteria tests to evaluate so that you can actually say, yes,

28
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
did this production happen?

29
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Exactly.

30
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,240
And it's got nothing to do with me not being able to do any predictions because I've wasted

31
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,000
them all on LAN and late night Linux.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yeah, I suppose.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,440
I mean, it might have something to do with that.

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,440
We do have a predictions episode of Linux Action News about to come out.

35
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,280
I just thought that since you correct Chris' grammar so often, you would just be a natural

36
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
referee.

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,040
Well, if anyone was going to call us on our BS, it would be Joe, right?

38
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,480
So I felt like that was sort of perfect.

39
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,040
But we will have a predictions episode of Linux Action News with a totally different

40
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
set of predictions.

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,480
I was really on my game this year.

42
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:13,060
With it being a full year of Linux Action News, I've been deep in the news now.

43
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,060
You're plugged in.

44
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,160
You could say I'm unplugged too.

45
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,320
And so I've been kind of carefully keeping track all year long.

46
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,160
So I really brought my game face.

47
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,760
But it's not just us, also here with their predictions is our virtual lug time appropriate

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,920
greetings mumble room.

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Hello, everybody.

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
Good morning.

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Hello.

52
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
Merry Christmas.

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
Happy New Year.

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,920
Happy Holidays, everybody.

55
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,160
So we've got Brandon in there.

56
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,400
We got Mr. Nate in there, Bitten and Em Manson and Popeys in there and Sean and see me and

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,400
the Drifter is also in there as well.

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,520
And we got a few folks in the quiet listening.

59
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,680
There is there is one stream if you could tune into that's like the most like real time

60
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
high quality stream.

61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
And that's our mumble room.

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,520
So you can actually we have a room in there if you just want to hang out in the quiet

63
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,640
listening if you got nothing to say direct to the studio connection.

64
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Yeah.

65
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Yeah.

66
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, you know, before we start with the show, normally we would have like a pre show and

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
all that kind of stuff.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,160
But we dispensed with all of that because this is this we're not following any formats.

69
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,400
And I thought I'd ask I'd start with with you, Wes, because I'm pretty sure I know the

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,240
answer for Joe.

71
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,720
Did you end up getting roped in any tech support this year?

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
Oh, yeah.

73
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Just just a little bit.

74
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,440
But I will say I was very willing.

75
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,960
My younger brother has a like just a couple of generations old HP laptop.

76
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,920
It runs Linux pretty darn well, except it's got one of those Broadcom Wi Fi chips.

77
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

78
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
Already runs?

79
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
Yeah, it's already running Linux.

80
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,760
How did this happen?

81
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
So I'm doing Linux tech support.

82
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
Isn't that great?

83
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
That is really great.

84
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,840
For me, the family tech supports always really bad Android devices and super old Windows

85
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
computers.

86
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,040
See, my trick is I just install Linux anyway, like they just get it there.

87
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,800
And then I say, you know, it'll be a lot easier for me to help you.

88
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,800
If you just use Linux.

89
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,640
I believe that's called the Chilean maneuver.

90
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
It very much is.

91
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,860
Anyway, we were just able to pop it open.

92
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,920
It was a little bit troublesome.

93
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,240
There was some unfortunate screw decisions that HP made.

94
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,480
But all in all, you know, I bought a I bought an Intel chip that works way better with open

95
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,400
source, plugged it in, rebooted into Ubuntu.

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,160
I think he's got 1804 on there right now, recognized it instantly.

97
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,200
And now he's got solid Wi-Fi.

98
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,800
So the process wasn't too bad, aside from the screws.

99
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,180
Did you Amazon that part?

100
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,340
Did you buy it in person?

101
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,600
Did you come with it?

102
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,440
Like what was your what was your process for getting the card?

103
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,240
Well, you know, actually, I was able to look it up and they sold they had to they had a

104
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,480
Broadcom and an Intel OEM model for chips that they put in that model.

105
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,520
So I was able to just go find one on eBay and I shipped it to him kind of saying like

106
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
you could learn something.

107
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
Try to install this yourself.

108
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,000
I ended up being roped into help, but I was more than happy.

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Nice.

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That is a ninja move.

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,320
I mean, here's hoping that like most of the time I've never had to do that before.

112
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,240
I mean, I've always known you could of course, but laptops these days are just good enough

113
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,960
and that makes me hopeful for 2019.

114
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,400
Hopefully that's the first and last time I do it.

115
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,520
Joe I'm pretty sure I know the answer.

116
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,760
Do you get roped in the any kind of family tech support scenarios in the holidays or

117
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,360
have you successfully avoided all that?

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,400
Well, I almost managed to successfully avoid my entire family.

119
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
So that was a win.

120
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Bravo.

121
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,480
I did go and see my parents and my mom was struggling to find her bookmarks on her iPhone

122
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,080
on Chrome on iOS and she'd followed some guide and created like a folder within a folder

123
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
within a folder.

124
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Oh no.

125
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
So she was kind of stuck in there.

126
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,320
So I had to go back, back, back, delete that.

127
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,380
And then I showed her how to do it.

128
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,960
So we'll see next time I see her, probably in the new year, go and see her and see if

129
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
she's fixed that.

130
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,960
But yeah, I can't believe the only tech support I did was iOS based and I don't know anything

131
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,280
about iOS.

132
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
That's pretty great.

133
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
Okay.

134
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,260
Well, you're not going to believe my family tech support story.

135
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,760
So first of all, my Christmas day, after we got done with the kids early morning, we dropped

136
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,640
them off with their mom and the plan was to do nothing except for just slowly cook and

137
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
watch Deep Space Nine.

138
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,440
Oh, that sounds like the best day.

139
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,680
It was really good.

140
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,680
First of all, the season finale for season five of Deep Space Nine is really good.

141
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,680
It's really, really good.

142
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Oh, you're just making me drool here.

143
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
I'm on my way there.

144
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
Yeah.

145
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,200
Plus we, you know, slow cook some meat, you know, and that was really good too.

146
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:15,440
But my mom talked me into coming down to visit and she was, she really, she next level manipulated

147
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
me too.

148
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,480
First, she got me to, to proudly describe my plans for having a super chill day.

149
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,040
And then she comes in with the, with the, but my car just broke down sob story.

150
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Oh no.

151
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
And then comes in with that.

152
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,080
Well, Hey, since you got nothing coming up, going on anyways, why don't you just come

153
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,000
visit me real quick.

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And what do I say at that point?

155
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I put all my cards on the table.

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,440
I can't say, sorry, mom, I'm busy.

157
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
There's no lies left.

158
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
Yeah.

159
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,920
And she, and she played me.

160
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
She played me.

161
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
I think she knows you pretty darn well.

162
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
She does.

163
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
And she knows she played me too.

164
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,800
So I ended up down there at mom's house and she's like, before you come down, I just want

165
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,720
you to know I'm having this problem with my computer.

166
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,480
I want to get access to my old data.

167
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
I'm like, your old data?

168
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
What do you mean your old data?

169
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,360
Well, I got this older computer, um, in about, about five years ago, my mom, she, she got

170
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,600
a new machine and I'm like, Oh, okay.

171
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
All right.

172
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Well, um, what's the problem?

173
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,080
Well, I'm plugging the drive in and I can't get to my data.

174
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,080
I'm like, okay.

175
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
All right.

176
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
Well, let's, uh, so I, I get data.

177
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,120
I get down there.

178
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:15,000
And what I discover is that she has an old power PC Macintosh, okay.

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,960
That she is trying to plug into her son's, my, my half-brother's windows 10 PC.

180
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,200
What plug in hell?

181
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,720
Well, she's got the power connector, but there's, there's no IDE connector in the entire case,

182
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
right?

183
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
It's all SATA.

184
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
His ring is all SATA, right?

185
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
And it's an old IDE cable.

186
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,760
I'm plugging it in and it's spinning up and she knows enough to know like the drive spinning

187
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
and it's powered up.

188
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Oh, wow.

189
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
And she knows enough.

190
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,280
She's looking at the other ones like the connectors are small, but it's not showing up.

191
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,720
I don't see a D drive and I want to get to my files like she doesn't have, but she doesn't

192
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,160
know that's HFS.

193
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,220
She doesn't know that's a total different connection interface, right?

194
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,120
So I brought down with me one of these old toasters.

195
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,760
Do you remember these like a USB toaster?

196
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,600
Oh, you just jump, dump a drive in and then, yeah.

197
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,280
And it's an old IDE toaster with a USB B to USB A.

198
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,560
But I take the old ThinkPad down there that has a handy USB A port, one of those quote

199
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
unquote legacy ports that nobody uses.

200
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,120
And I plug it in and of course, you know, GNU slash Linux and I got the HFS drive.

201
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,040
I mount her new computer over the network and I copy the data over for her.

202
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Beautiful.

203
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Yeah.

204
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,440
It was, but just to go in there and like not quite knowing what to expect and to walk in

205
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,140
on this Windows 10 PC, which my mom has attempted to essentially take apart and like the case

206
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,800
is still open and the drive is just hanging there by the power adapter.

207
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,600
And like it's slowly dawning on me what she's attempting to pull off.

208
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,520
And my thought was like, you know, mom, it just would have been easier to power up the

209
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,240
old Mac, put it on the network, just copy the files or put it on an external hard drive.

210
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
Any of that.

211
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Right.

212
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,560
But, you know, she just thought she, to her, like it's a disk, it's a computer.

213
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,520
It's the same kind of connector for the power, the level of knowledge that's like just enough

214
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,240
to be very dangerous.

215
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,240
Yeah.

216
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Yeah.

217
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
That just about describes it.

218
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,880
So that was my holiday tech support experience.

219
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,240
And that was, and I didn't, I didn't plan to have any because I kept it pretty minimal.

220
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,280
This is my most minimal family thing.

221
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,600
I only went to two official family events, different family events.

222
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,920
And I thought I had, I had gotten out just completely with unscathed.

223
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,160
And then this came in at the last minute as a, as a little twist.

224
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Well, you're a good son.

225
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,440
It was pretty funny.

226
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,080
These old, these old power Macs, like they have these reflective mirrored drives.

227
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Oh yeah.

228
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,560
They call them the mirrored doors.

229
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,560
And then it's got like these air intake vents, like a Cadillac to like take in air to like

230
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,680
cool the G4 processor.

231
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,500
It's a ridiculous contraption and it makes a lot of noise.

232
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,560
It was a very loud Mac.

233
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,220
It was a different era, but all right, that's not what we're here to talk about today.

234
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,920
This episode is really about our predictions for 2019.

235
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,440
We wanted to get it in, in 2018, firmly while still inside the boundary of 2018.

236
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,760
So that way these are clean predictions, fair and fair, made before the year arrives.

237
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,880
Now to some of us, these predictions will seem a little obvious to others.

238
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
They're going to seem like long shots.

239
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,760
What we decided to do this year was set some ground rules that we all have to play by.

240
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:19,000
We're taking it serious this year and I'm going to warn you, I apologize ahead of time.

241
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,600
After much deliberation, we have decided to introduce a process.

242
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,480
None of us like it, but it had to happen.

243
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,520
First of all, we need a ref.

244
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
That's Joe's role.

245
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,040
Joe will be playing the role of the referee, keeping us on the straight and narrow, making

246
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,240
sure that all predictions are measurable, making sure that the predictions are clear

247
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,920
and specific, and Joe will be asking us at the end after we debate them if needed or

248
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
need any clarification.

249
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,680
Right, a refinement process when they're proposed to the group.

250
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,280
Which is a friendly space, no judgment.

251
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,720
At the end of that process, Joe will ask us to restate the prediction one more time, so

252
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,640
that way it's clear and concise, and once the prediction is made final, it will be signaled

253
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,220
with the final ding.

254
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,400
That means prediction locked.

255
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,480
And we will move on to the next one.

256
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,480
No changing it.

257
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,480
No changing it.

258
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
It is in the official show record.

259
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,440
Now I'm very excited about this.

260
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Do you have predictions?

261
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Oh yeah.

262
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Because they're not in the doc yet.

263
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
No, no.

264
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Yeah, I got them right here.

265
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
I know you sneaky jerk.

266
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,000
So, Mumba Room, you are welcome.

267
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,640
I just have to ask, is anyone going to make the year of the Linux desktop prediction?

268
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,240
Because if you are, we can just get that out of the way right now.

269
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,360
Because let's be honest, hands up.

270
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Everybody wants that one.

271
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,860
Does anybody in the Mumba Room want to make a prediction that is actually legitimately

272
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,600
the year of the Linux desktop?

273
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,480
Every year is the year of the Linux desktop.

274
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
All right.

275
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Very fair.

276
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,920
I mean, I think that's the answer we've all decided to go with that makes us comfortable

277
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,960
at this point.

278
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,200
We keep telling ourselves that.

279
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,840
Joe, I think you can be the decider there.

280
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,000
Do you think it's your call?

281
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,800
Is that a prediction on Bittens or I mean, every year is the year of Linux desktop?

282
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,160
Doesn't feel like a prediction to me.

283
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,400
No, anything to do with year of Linux desktop just gets instantly taken out of the equation,

284
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
I'm afraid.

285
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
We're not having it.

286
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,840
We had to have that conversation.

287
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,020
People listening, they want to know.

288
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,600
We had to have that conversation.

289
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,380
I do think there could be room for a Chrome OS prediction in this space, but that's not

290
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,400
one of mine.

291
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,160
So I think maybe I'll start and then maybe you can give one.

292
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,200
But I thought I'd start with one to help us just warm up because this is my most vague

293
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,400
prediction and I think we need to kick it around a little bit.

294
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,000
But I think this is going to happen.

295
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,740
And I don't think you're going to be surprised when I say this.

296
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:44,560
One of my first predictions for 2019 is that dark mode for the web becomes a design trend

297
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,680
and websites start going dark.

298
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,960
Is this something universal or is it a toggle?

299
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,800
Is this some sort of universal cookie that gets set and shared?

300
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,520
What's my experience in the dark mode?

301
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Do I have to define that?

302
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Maybe not.

303
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,640
I don't feel like I have to define that because I think each site could implement it differently.

304
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,600
But you just think a lot of sites will have a dark mode or will be just a dark design.

305
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Yeah.

306
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,800
I mean, there's several factors at play here.

307
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,200
So you've got the fact that dark mode has been an option on Linux forever.

308
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,360
You've got commercial desktops that are offering more dark modes now.

309
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,400
You've got the fact that OLED screens on mobile devices have significant battery savings when

310
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,760
you use dark mode.

311
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,360
So there's a lot of pressure mechanisms.

312
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,000
The other one that I've noticed is a general user pressure.

313
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,280
And you saw me talking to one of the users at System76.

314
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,500
When I've been, as I travel around, Wes, and talk to people, when I travel around and talk

315
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,040
to the people, Wes, they tell me about the dark mode for the browser.

316
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,000
And I've gotten, this really is true though.

317
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,680
I say it like I'm joking, but it is true.

318
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,880
I've had different people tell me different types of dark mode extensions for the web

319
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,300
browser to make it look good.

320
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,480
And I've gone all in.

321
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,840
I'm using dark mode on Chrome and Firefox for everything.

322
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,720
I have dark reader on Chrome, which is great.

323
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,720
It does a great job of making sites that aren't designed for dark mode at least readable.

324
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,720
And I think when you combine the fact that users are manually changing the site design,

325
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,280
so they're going dark.

326
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
That's right.

327
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,800
I mean, dark mode CSS hacks are pretty common.

328
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,620
And dark mode is much better if you design for it than if you force it.

329
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,200
The websites are going to have that pressure, plus the OLED screens, like I mentioned, plus

330
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,160
the fact that commercial desktops are going dark and a lot of the user applications are

331
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,200
going dark to complement the change of the desktop.

332
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,720
I just think this is going to be a thing.

333
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,120
I don't have a definition of how it's going to be implemented, Joe.

334
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
I defer to your judgment.

335
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,140
Well, the referee has to step in here.

336
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,320
The first rule is predictions must be measurable.

337
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
How are we going to measure this?

338
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Okay.

339
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
All right.

340
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Fair.

341
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
That's fair.

342
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
That's a good question.

343
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,480
How many major websites go dark?

344
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
I'm going to say...

345
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
That's still pretty vague.

346
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
The New York...

347
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
What are you going to say?

348
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
Google.com?

349
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Is that going to go dark?

350
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
Facebook?

351
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,480
Oh!

352
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
Okay.

353
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
Okay.

354
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
All right.

355
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
So it's either Google.com or New York Times.

356
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,480
One of those goes dark.

357
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Okay.

358
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,480
How's that?

359
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
All right.

360
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,480
Yeah, that's measurable.

361
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,480
All right.

362
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,480
One of those.

363
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
All right.

364
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
All right.

365
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
Now, I'll summarize it up.

366
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
2019 will be the year of the web going dark mode and a major property like Google.com

367
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,560
will roll out to fanfare a dark mode.

368
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Prediction locked.

369
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,920
That felt really good.

370
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,920
Nicely done, sir.

371
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Thank you.

372
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,400
I really hope that happens also because I also love dark mode.

373
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Yeah.

374
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
I just think it's great.

375
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
That's my...

376
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,200
That's, by the way, that was my vaguest, most non-Linux prediction.

377
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,040
The rest are all on topic.

378
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
What do you got?

379
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Okay.

380
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:38,400
So I think in 2019, Gnome will have improved enough that you are using it on at least one

381
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:46,120
system by year's end or used it on a system for like a couple of months.

382
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
You bastard.

383
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
Oh, man.

384
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Okay.

385
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
I mean...

386
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
That's fairly measurable.

387
00:15:51,120 --> 00:16:00,160
That means that Chris just has to have used it for at least 60 days on one machine in

388
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
2019.

389
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Yeah.

390
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Yeah.

391
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Yeah.

392
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
I agree.

393
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
I agree.

394
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
I hate that.

395
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,720
I hate that I hate that I hate that I hate that I hate that I think you're right.

396
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,120
I can't really argue with that.

397
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,080
I'm trying to think if I could poke any holes in it.

398
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,060
Well, my hole that I've got to poke in it is what if it's just a machine that's tucked

399
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,360
off in the corner that hardly ever gets used?

400
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,120
Surely it has to be either your ThinkPad or your main workstation or one of the RBS machine

401
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
or something like that.

402
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,200
And it can't just be like for a couple of weeks, even if it's like three weeks for a

403
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
review and then I switch off of it.

404
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,000
No, it's got to be you using it personally to get work done.

405
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah.

406
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Okay.

407
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
All right.

408
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,620
So I don't think I can poke any holes in that.

409
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,000
Do you want to restate it in the final summary?

410
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,240
I predict that in 2019, Chris is using the Gnome desktop on at least one production machine

411
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,360
for 60 days or longer.

412
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,560
All right.

413
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,780
Prediction locked in there.

414
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,040
And I think I think that has a high chance of success.

415
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
It's funny.

416
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
All right.

417
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Mumble room.

418
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,000
If anybody wants to jump in with a prediction, go ahead.

419
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I have one.

420
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,040
All right, Popey, go ahead.

421
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:15,400
In 2019, Apple will announce and ship a non x86 based MacBook line of computers.

422
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
All right.

423
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Okay.

424
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,240
Meaning specifically ARM.

425
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Yeah.

426
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,720
Their ARM, their own ARM sauce.

427
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,000
Well, not RISC-V. Come on.

428
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,640
I was going to leave the door open for RISC-V, but then I thought, no, that's just ludicrous.

429
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,380
So you think so, huh?

430
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,960
And how would you see that?

431
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,520
Would you see that as more like the bottom of the consumer line?

432
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,240
Or do you see that as like the Mac Pro that's supposedly going to ship?

433
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
I see it.

434
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
I see it.

435
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,820
The new MacBook Air that has amazing battery life.

436
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,420
And we've taken everything we've learned from making amazing ARM processors in phones and

437
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:54,600
tablets over all the years, and we baked that into this device that is lightweight, silent

438
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
and long battery life.

439
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,640
All those kind of things that people ask for from a MacBook Air and it will have all the

440
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,200
usual display and the connectivity and all that kind of stuff.

441
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
It's still running OS X.

442
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Yes.

443
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
It'll run OS X.

444
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,400
But the key thing that relates it to Linux is it will make it much harder for us to run

445
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Linux on that device.

446
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Yeah.

447
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Sorry.

448
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
If I'm being the referee here, I have to correct you.

449
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
It's Mac OS, not OS X.

450
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
You're right.

451
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
You're right.

452
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Thank you.

453
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Thank you, referee.

454
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
You're right.

455
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
You're right.

456
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Yeah.

457
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Yeah.

458
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
That's what I was wondering is how compatible will these be with Linux?

459
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,800
And I'll tell you, we already have some insights, and it is not very.

460
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,580
Because the T2 chip, everybody's been talking about with the Mac Mini and the other devices,

461
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,720
the drives simply do not show up for Linux because Linux has no software support in any

462
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,560
regards for that SATA controller.

463
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:46,160
The T2 chip that controls touch ID or the touch bar if your Mac has one is also the

464
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,580
SATA controller for those MVD drives that are in the MacBook Pro.

465
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,880
And Linux has no drivers.

466
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,300
And Apple will not be writing any drivers for Linux.

467
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,720
Why would they?

468
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,120
And if Popeye's prediction is to come true, it is the expansion of this T2 platform.

469
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:07,000
Sometimes they'll call it the T3 platform or something like that, that will consume

470
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,760
and replace the Intel chip.

471
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,060
They'll just grow the existing ARM board that's already based on one of their A series processors

472
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,080
running an isolated version of iOS with a secure enclave.

473
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,840
They'll just grow that out to be a larger motherboard or a logic board, as they call

474
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
it.

475
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,200
And it could even ship with a low end Intel mobile processor that could be spun up on

476
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,400
demand to run applications in compatibility mode.

477
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Absolutely, right?

478
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
It could be.

479
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
It could be ideological.

480
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,920
They just want, they have their own design goals and they're going to use whatever tech

481
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
they can to meet them.

482
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,760
I don't think the board even needs to be that much bigger to go in a laptop.

483
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,520
I mean, if you look at the size of MacBook Air logic boards, they're pretty tiny.

484
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,480
And there's the associated circuitry for charging and the IO and stuff like that.

485
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,960
But there's not actually a lot different between an iPhone and an iPad and a laptop in Apple's

486
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,800
eyes internally other than a giant battery and a massive screen.

487
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Yeah.

488
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,960
I don't mean in size, I mean in functionality.

489
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,400
And I think you could achieve it with something that is comparable to what the iPad Pro does

490
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
today.

491
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Yeah, exactly.

492
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,960
I think we need a bonus point here for what it's going to be called.

493
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,040
So let's all speculate on what this new product is going to be called.

494
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:20,440
I'm going to predict the MacBook Helium.

495
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,600
I think to make it normalized, they'll just call it the new MacBook Air.

496
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
Yeah.

497
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,800
I think it will just be a continuation of the MacBook Air line.

498
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Yeah.

499
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Hmm.

500
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
That's terrific.

501
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,320
But the ambiguity there is whether or not it's going to have an x86 chip as well that

502
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,800
will be secondary, like the ARM chip secondary now.

503
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,040
Popi, are you saying it's going to be pure ARM with no x86?

504
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,440
Yes, pure ARM, no x86.

505
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,800
It will be a non x86 laptop.

506
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Right.

507
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,280
So you need to lock that in then.

508
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,480
Let's have it in a nice editable chunk.

509
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
Very succinct.

510
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,800
In 2019, Apple will announce and launch a line of laptops called MacBook Air, which

511
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,400
will feature ARM-based processors and no x86 processors.

512
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Prediction locked.

513
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
There we go.

514
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
We're doing great, guys.

515
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
Excellent.

516
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Thank you for your contribution.

517
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
That was a good one.

518
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,640
Yeah, because I could totally see that happening.

519
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,360
Before the iPad Pro with lightning, maybe not.

520
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,960
But now with the iPad Pro that has USB-C, I feel like I could see that.

521
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
All right.

522
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
You ready for my next prediction?

523
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
All right.

524
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,640
My next one that I'm not as confident, I kind of go up in confidence as I go, but my next

525
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,600
one is Clear Linux has a great 2019 by just about anyone's measure.

526
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,400
It will see specifically more press coverage and more coverage of using Clear Linux as

527
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,040
a desktop operating system.

528
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,200
Now, obviously, you covered it on one of your shows, it doesn't count.

529
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,200
Really?

530
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
Okay, fair.

531
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
All right.

532
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,680
Excluding Jupyter Broadcasting's coverage.

533
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:55,000
Can exclude Ferronix's coverage as well.

534
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Here's the thing.

535
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,860
It's really kind of a bet on the fact that Ike is back in there and that they're starting

536
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:05,200
to talk about it more and they're sort of solidifying their open source software group

537
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,840
and getting them out there talking more.

538
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:13,480
I feel like Intel is trying to make a play to keep relevance in the data center while

539
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,160
they're still relevant and Clear Linux is a key part of that strategy.

540
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Right.

541
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,080
So referee time again, although I do agree with you that it is going to be a great year,

542
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,040
we're going to be talking about Clear Linux a lot more, but that's not measurable.

543
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,240
We need some quantifiable thing.

544
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,760
I don't know how you could come up with it.

545
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,880
Is it a number of articles or is it being featured on a certain website?

546
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,400
How high it is on DistroWatch?

547
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,400
No, no, that's never going to be it.

548
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,440
There's a good random chance it'll just happen.

549
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,320
Yeah, that's never going to be it.

550
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:52,040
I was thinking articles, but I don't know, again, how to exactly measure that other than

551
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:57,080
we have a sense of how much things get covered because we watch it on a day-to-day basis.

552
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,280
But I don't really, I don't have like a spreadsheet where every time I see a Clear Linux story,

553
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,320
I tick another number in the column.

554
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,200
So I'm not quite sure how to measure that one.

555
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,360
Well, don't make me throw this out then.

556
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,440
I mean, it could be throwable.

557
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,440
It could be.

558
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Like Wes, can you think of a way we could measure it?

559
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,320
What about like an article?

560
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,040
See the thing is anything I say could influence that blogger not to do it.

561
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,960
You know, like if I say so-and-so will write a post about setting up Clear Linux as the

562
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,760
ultimate desktop, they may not do it just out of spite because I said it on this show

563
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
because they're bastards like that.

564
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,560
I mean, you could just set like a certain number of articles from a, you know, we can

565
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,520
blacklist some sources, Foronix or whatever you have for Foronix.

566
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,240
I think the very, the specificness of Foronix needs to be mentioned just because they're

567
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:55,240
a very pro Intel mouthpiece, if you like, and will post about Clear Linux at the drop

568
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
of a hat.

569
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
Okay.

570
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
How about this?

571
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,320
Five articles about Clear Linux in the server space and the desktop space that are not Foronix

572
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,600
and not on this show.

573
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Good?

574
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Are we good with that?

575
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,560
I think that seems to me a little bit too low, really, because if you looked at how

576
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,560
many articles there were over the last year, it's got to be more than five.

577
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
You think so?

578
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,560
Okay.

579
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
Now you could say something of a certain caliber, right?

580
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:24,640
Like if it was like an R's or something of a, you know, like a mainstream article, more

581
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
so than a Linux world article.

582
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,120
Yeah, like five on Ars Technica, that would do it.

583
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
That's not going to happen, though.

584
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,120
That's not going to happen.

585
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Well, yeah.

586
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
Voodoo doesn't even get five on Ars Technica.

587
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
They might get five.

588
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,120
Barely, they might get five.

589
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:42,040
I mean, okay, how about 50, 50 across the industry that's not Foronix and not Linux

590
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
unplugged?

591
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,360
Yeah, that's going to be pretty hard to try and count up, though, isn't it?

592
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,560
It's going to be easier if you just say three on Ars or something.

593
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Yeah, I know.

594
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,520
I'm, what can I say, I'm bullish.

595
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,200
I'm bullish on Intel, I'm bullish on Clear Linux.

596
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,640
I think people are, a lot of people on Linux are looking for specific types of optimized

597
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,200
performance and they have workloads where they need to eek every bit of performance

598
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,840
out of a machine that's sitting in their rack.

599
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,960
And when you've got the manufacturer of a CPU that's making a Linux distribution where

600
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,160
they say they're building every bit of software in the entire stack optimized for their processors,

601
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,040
that might sell.

602
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,440
We could make a little like a Slack channel or something.

603
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,320
Every article we see about it, we just post it in there and go back next year.

604
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm going to have to start keeping track after this.

605
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,760
This is one of those predictions that's going to make it years worth of work.

606
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
You need work for yourself.

607
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
Damn it.

608
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,960
Yeah, I'm not counting this up, so it's on you.

609
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
All right.

610
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
All right, I'll keep track.

611
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Are we good with 50?

612
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Are we good with 50?

613
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
What do you say?

614
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,960
Yeah.

615
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
All right.

616
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,720
And I'm going for, I'm going for articles that are talking about using Clear Linux or

617
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,060
talking about using it for the desktop or talking about why it's great for containers

618
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,840
or great for machine learning, like articles that are very, you know, like, hey, check

619
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,520
out this up and coming distro that you don't know about that we've all been talking about

620
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,520
for years now.

621
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,640
Do they count if it's a huge vulnerability in it?

622
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
Yes.

623
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,640
Yeah.

624
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,640
If it, because if it gets coverage, that means it's of an industry importance that

625
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
it gets mentioned.

626
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
Yeah.

627
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
All right.

628
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
I think you better lock it in then.

629
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
All right.

630
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,600
So in summary, 2019, we'll see 50 publications about Clear Linux.

631
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:18,520
The Clear Linux hype will grow, excluding articles from Ferronics and coverage from

632
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,440
Linux Unplugged.

633
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Prediction locked.

634
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Nicely done.

635
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,840
You guys made me work for that one.

636
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,160
That's what the rules are about.

637
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
All right, Wes.

638
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,160
All right, Wes.

639
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,800
Well, so we'll go to the mumble room after you, but I want to get one more of yours on

640
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
the record.

641
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Wes Payne.

642
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,800
Okay.

643
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,720
So this one will need to, we'll need some help cleaning up as well.

644
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:46,280
In 2019, Red Hat drops either just explicitly or by key people leaving support for one major

645
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,600
component of the free desktop.

646
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Wow.

647
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,720
I think we need some examples of the components here.

648
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,160
And that's where, yeah, that's where we need some help cleaning it up.

649
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Okay.

650
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:02,600
So basically, you're thinking of major components like PulseAudio or Bolt or Network Manager

651
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,060
or something in the Gnome stack.

652
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,600
Something that, you know, we would be like, oh, boy, I got to tell you, that makes me

653
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,920
very uncomfortable when you say that.

654
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
Yeah, I'm not happy you say that.

655
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
I don't know.

656
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,760
I'm just, if it happens, I want, I want to, I want credit.

657
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,760
Oh, okay.

658
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,760
All right.

659
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,080
So what do you think, Ref?

660
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,920
How specific does Wes need to get in this?

661
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,640
Because this is one of those where there's a lot of room even for a project just to be

662
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,400
end of life because it's the end of the project.

663
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,280
Yeah, I think this is a little bit too vague.

664
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:39,000
I think you're going to have to look it down to, I don't know, maybe pick five or six actual

665
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,640
examples of it and say that one of those is going to go away because it's just too many

666
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,640
aspects here.

667
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Like a range of five projects.

668
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,640
Yeah, okay.

669
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Well, let's, let's.

670
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,640
Yeah, okay.

671
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,440
So I mean, oh, that's tough because like you could say system D, but then there's so many

672
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,340
things like underneath system D that could technically qualify.

673
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,760
There's also aspects of Wayland to consider.

674
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
Yeah.

675
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,680
And what happens if they drop Pulse in favor of PipeWire, for example?

676
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,700
Well, and this, you know, really when you zoom out, this is why the IBM purchasing Red

677
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:14,200
Hat news was so big specifically for us and our audience because there's so many projects

678
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,360
that Red Hat does manage as part of a comprehensive desktop support that we don't really talk

679
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,840
about very often.

680
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,040
There's a lot of free desktop components that are just maintained by Red Hat for years now

681
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,100
that we just all rely upon and don't really think about.

682
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,080
And so when you start talking about some of those going away, what you're talking about

683
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,960
is one of the pillars of the Linux desktop going away or transitioning away.

684
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,640
And that makes me really uncomfortable.

685
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,640
You're squirming over there.

686
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,640
I am.

687
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,640
I just want my stuff to work.

688
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,640
Okay.

689
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,640
So yeah.

690
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,640
Network manager.

691
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,640
Let's do PipeWire.

692
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
Sure.

693
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
That's three at us.

694
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
We could say that.

695
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
That's three.

696
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
Okay.

697
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
What else?

698
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
Bolt, you said?

699
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,640
Yeah.

700
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,640
That's kind of small.

701
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,640
You also, yeah.

702
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,600
It feels like Bolt and FWFD and the LVFS stuff has like no chance of going away.

703
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Like that stuff's more important than ever right now.

704
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
That's relevant on the server.

705
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Yeah.

706
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,760
Really desktop focused things is really what I'm thinking.

707
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Okay.

708
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Okay, Ref.

709
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
Okay.

710
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,520
I got a suggestion, but it's not exactly what he's going for.

711
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,720
What about punting GTK4 for another year?

712
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,160
Is that, does that qualify?

713
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Hmm.

714
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
Possibly.

715
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
Yeah.

716
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Possibly.

717
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
That seems reasonable.

718
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,480
So, so that could be your last one is they, you know, nothing happens in that department

719
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,220
for another year.

720
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,960
What about tying in with your other one?

721
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,800
Kind of hedging your bets and saying that they completely dropped GNOME.

722
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,600
I don't, I feel like, I feel like that has a momentum on GNOME is better than ever right

723
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
now.

724
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Yeah.

725
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,920
So I feel like it's got a better shot than ever right now.

726
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,920
I don't know.

727
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,520
Yeah, so all right, you got to come up with a five, you got to come up with all five.

728
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,460
So we've got, what do we have so far?

729
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,480
We've got Network Manager.

730
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
We've got PipeWire.

731
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Yep.

732
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
We've got Stratus.

733
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Yep.

734
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,840
We've got, I don't know about Bolt, but that's the fourth one.

735
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,880
And then the fifth one is GTK4 doesn't ship.

736
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
Okay.

737
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Okay.

738
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,880
So you ready to lock it in then Wes?

739
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
All right.

740
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,560
I predict in 2019 Red Hat drops support either just explicitly or key people leave for one

741
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:18,640
of these projects, Network Manager, PipeWire, Stratus, Bolt, or they just sort of delay

742
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,080
any work on GTK4.

743
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
It just doesn't ship.

744
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,080
In 2019.

745
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
In 2019.

746
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,080
That's one of those things.

747
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,080
I'm going to lock it.

748
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
All righty.

749
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
I'm not happy to say it.

750
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Okay.

751
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,080
It's locked in.

752
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
Whew, that was rough.

753
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
That was rough.

754
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,200
Mumble Room, you got one that we can shift gears to?

755
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Anybody else have a prediction?

756
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Something happier.

757
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
I've got one.

758
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:44,640
Sometime in 2019, a major piece of enterprise software will be ported to Ubuntu 18.04, such

759
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,520
as SAP or Active Directory.

760
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,320
Active Directory for Linux.

761
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,800
That would be massive.

762
00:30:53,800 --> 00:31:01,640
Microsoft SQL Server is available on Linux now, so if it is ported to 18.04, there is

763
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,720
a 50-50 chance it will be distributed as a SNAP.

764
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,720
Whoa.

765
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Going for a bonus point there.

766
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
What do you say, ref?

767
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
Is this allowed?

768
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
Yeah.

769
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,800
Well, I was going to say the SNAP thing.

770
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,520
Poppy, you can probably tell us whether this is going to come true or not already.

771
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,280
But I guess your lips are sealed on this one.

772
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,320
Yeah, that would have to be in the works.

773
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Keep it clean.

774
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,320
Keep it clean.

775
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Suddenly, Mumble's not working for him.

776
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
Oh, weird.

777
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,320
Strange.

778
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,320
He's having connection issues.

779
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
He can't comment on it.

780
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
Oh, no.

781
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Nothing.

782
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,320
We're just kidding.

783
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
It's fine.

784
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
But yeah, that's a pretty good one.

785
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
I got to say.

786
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
All right.

787
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,800
As someone who used to work on SAP, that's a super interesting one to pick.

788
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,320
If you're going to explicitly put that in your prediction, that's an interesting one

789
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,320
to pick.

790
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
But you're not.

791
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,360
And you're just talking about something of the size or the order of magnitude of SAP.

792
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,240
I'm just using SAP as an example because that's a really big piece of enterprise software

793
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,160
I'm using as an example because that's the kind of scale that I'm talking about of large

794
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,480
enterprise applications.

795
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
I don't know.

796
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,480
I think maybe you ought to name a couple.

797
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,520
I think you should go on the record.

798
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
What do you think, Ref?

799
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Yeah, I think so.

800
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,000
I think we're going to have to have some names of applications here.

801
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,360
I think SAP is a good one.

802
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,800
I think SAP, Active Directory, I think those are good ones.

803
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,840
I think great.

804
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
Not necessarily SAP.

805
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,600
SAP is pretty vague because there's multiple applications.

806
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,200
I think a good benchmark would be SAP HANA.

807
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
All right.

808
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
So what do you say, Sean?

809
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,760
Can you summarize that up to lock it in?

810
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:38,360
I predict at some point in 2019, a major piece of enterprise software such as SAP for HANA

811
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:44,680
or Active Directory will be imported to Ubuntu 18.04.

812
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:53,040
And if such a thing is done, I predict a 50% chance that it will be distributed as a snap.

813
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
I like that.

814
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
That is locked in.

815
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
That's a good one.

816
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,960
You know, I was trying to think of some enterprise ones specifically because a lot of times on

817
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,540
this show, we focus on the desktop.

818
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,460
But no one's joking.

819
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,840
We all understand the enterprise is way, way, way bigger for Linux.

820
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,920
And we should be talking more about it than we do.

821
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,720
But it's more fun to talk about it.

822
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
That's right.

823
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:19,160
I predict that in 2019, all virtualized guests will be utilizing encrypted memory.

824
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,000
Oh, that'd be nice to see.

825
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,200
But quite the performance hit.

826
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,240
Do you think people really want to do that at scale?

827
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,240
I think so.

828
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Oh, absolutely.

829
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,600
I think that what they're going to do is integrate hardware solutions as part of that encryption.

830
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
What do you think, Wes?

831
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Could you see that?

832
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,960
It could be a feature for sure.

833
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,920
Like the premier cloud providers roll it out first.

834
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,000
I mean, yeah, I guess it's the percentage, right?

835
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That's the question.

836
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,960
I could definitely see it increasing and would like to.

837
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Yeah, yeah.

838
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
That's a good point.

839
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,160
How much of a market domination are you talking about here?

840
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
That's a good question.

841
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,040
I'm going to say at least a 15% to 20% adoption.

842
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,800
I would go more, but I want to be conservative.

843
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,360
What do you think, Ref?

844
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,080
Is that enough to really say it's a clear win or not?

845
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,000
Well, I think that if you're going to put a percentage on it, then that's something

846
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
we can measure.

847
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So that's fair enough.

848
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Okay.

849
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
All right.

850
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
All right.

851
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Ref says it's good.

852
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
All right.

853
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
All right.

854
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I guess we lock it in.

855
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
All right.

856
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
All right.

857
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
All right.

858
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Go ahead.

859
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Sum it up, Drifter, and lock it in.

860
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,360
Fuchsia enterprise virtualization will utilize encrypted memory.

861
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,360
That's a good one.

862
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,360
That's a really, really good one.

863
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,320
A couple of good enterprise ones there.

864
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,320
Nice one.

865
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,600
I hope that one does come true.

866
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,480
I think out of all the ones we've done, the one that I hope for the most is that.

867
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
Yep.

868
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
All right.

869
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
Is it my turn?

870
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
I think it is.

871
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,440
This one I get a little nervous about, and I'm almost positive it's going to happen.

872
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,320
Fuchsia app development will begin in 2019, taking advantage of existing Android tools

873
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,440
such as Android Studio and the Android emulator to build software for Fuchsia that runs on

874
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,680
Android and Fuchsia at the same time.

875
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,960
Isn't that already happening?

876
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,960
Is it?

877
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
I don't know if it is.

878
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,760
I know that I follow the news very closely, and there's indications that it may be in

879
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,600
the works, and that certain components are showing up in repositories, but I don't know

880
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,240
that it's actually going to happen.

881
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,080
Those repositories, as we record right now, are empty.

882
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,160
So are you talking about internal to Google, or are you going to go out and say external

883
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,160
app developers?

884
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,720
I don't know if it's like a Google I.O. level announcement or if it's a smaller soft launch

885
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:29,420
style thing, but I'm saying if you have Android Studio, by the end of 2019 you can start building

886
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,420
Fuchsia applications.

887
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,880
Well, yeah, people will be able to do that, but are you predicting that people will be

888
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,160
doing it or just that the ability will be there?

889
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,720
Oh, absolutely both.

890
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Absolutely both.

891
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Yeah.

892
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,240
I mean, you just take it as a given, but there's really nothing locked in at this point that

893
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,360
any of this happens in 2019.

894
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,720
Google could take another year to soft build this thing and experiment with more devices,

895
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,360
and they could maybe announce it in 2020 for all we know.

896
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
There's really no...

897
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,520
I mean, so this is one of these things about these predictions.

898
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,640
When we sit at this point in the year, we have a recency bias, and we think things are

899
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,760
a bigger deal than the things at the beginning of the year.

900
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,700
And I point to how excited we all got, me specifically, about Bitcoin last year, right?

901
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,880
Because Bitcoin just seemed like a foregone conclusion at the end of last year that it

902
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,040
was going to be huge.

903
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,780
And now, as we record, it's at $3,806.93, not that I'm keeping track.

904
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:27,760
And it really was a huge flop, but we would have taken it as a given at the end of last

905
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
year.

906
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,100
So I'm not so sure Fuchsia is necessarily a given when you take the whole year in context,

907
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,600
but I'm going on a limb and I'm saying, a limb, a limb, what is it, a ledge?

908
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Out on a limb.

909
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
Limb.

910
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Thank you.

911
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
I'm going out on the limb.

912
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
What?

913
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
No.

914
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
It's a lunar module.

915
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Never mind.

916
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,840
I'm going out on the limb, not the ledge.

917
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,040
I'm taking a risk here.

918
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,280
And I'm going to say that developers will be creating Fuchsia applications and running

919
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,280
them in emulators and getting ready to ship them on Fuchsia devices.

920
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,280
How do we measure that?

921
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,760
Well, we'll start seeing Fuchsia applications show up.

922
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
We'll start seeing-

923
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
How many?

924
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,960
Well, so first of all, Google will have to make an announcement that it's go time, right?

925
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,840
So that'll be a clear indicator, I think.

926
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,360
Do you think this will show up in a beta of Android Studio in 2019 or a final release

927
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,000
in 2019?

928
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Maybe just the next release.

929
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Like a supported release.

930
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yeah.

931
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Right.

932
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Just really soon.

933
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Yeah, like really soon.

934
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Like maybe not the next release, but the release after that.

935
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,440
I think the first way it'll show up is you'll have the Fuchsia emulator, which will be like

936
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,720
a generic Google device that runs Fuchsia that you can run your application on to make

937
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,240
sure that if you're writing an Android application that's going to run on Fuchsia that everything's

938
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,240
solid.

939
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,320
That's how it first rolls out.

940
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,920
And that'll be, I would think around Google IO, but who knows?

941
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Okay.

942
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,200
So we need to be specific here.

943
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,560
Are you going to say a third party developer will release an app for Fuchsia?

944
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,400
And if so, are you going to go so far as to say what that might be or who it might be?

945
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,800
Are you going to say like Facebook Messenger or something like that maybe?

946
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,360
Here's the problem.

947
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,480
I'm not saying Fuchsia devices are shipping in 2019.

948
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,700
I'm not saying that.

949
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,840
So there may be zero reason, really.

950
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,520
There may be no reason for a developer to ship this Fuchsia application if there's no

951
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,520
device.

952
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,960
But what you'll be able to start doing is making sure that the Android applications

953
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,920
you're building run okay on Fuchsia.

954
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,840
Just like you can run Android applications on some Chromebooks right now, you'll be able

955
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,840
to run Android applications on Fuchsia devices.

956
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,360
And that's what developers will be testing.

957
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,400
Now how do I lock that in?

958
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,000
Because you know the first application is going to be a fart app.

959
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I hope so.

960
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,080
That would be such a great bonus prediction.

961
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,800
Somebody in the audience, please make that happen.

962
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,520
That would be so great.

963
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,040
Okay, here's what I'm thinking I could lock in is Google will announce that you can start

964
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,040
testing Android devices in the Fuchsia emulator.

965
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
Yeah.

966
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,040
Is that fair?

967
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,520
That seems like definitely going to happen.

968
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,320
And that is testable and measurable.

969
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,480
So yeah, I think you could lock that in if you wanted to.

970
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,200
But you're definitely going to win.

971
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Really?

972
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
You think so?

973
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,200
There's a recency bias.

974
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,280
See, again, I go back to the Bitcoin thing.

975
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,320
Like it seems like a definite now.

976
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,400
But a lot can happen in a year.

977
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,680
And this could never really come to fruition like it just might not happen.

978
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
You seem skeptical.

979
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,000
I mean, it seems like they're kind of bullish on it.

980
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
But you're right.

981
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,420
There is a recency bias.

982
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,420
It's ready.

983
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,420
It's here.

984
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,420
I guess lock it in.

985
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,420
All right.

986
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,420
Okay, here we go.

987
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,420
To lock it in.

988
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:36,560
In 2019, Google announced that you can start testing your Android applications on Fuchsia

989
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,280
using their handy generic emulator.

990
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,800
And I don't know what that means for Android and then eventually Google's long term commitments

991
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,720
and contributions to the Linux kernel.

992
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,080
I don't know what that means.

993
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,080
We'll see.

994
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,080
I guess we just wait and see.

995
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,080
All right, Mr. Payne.

996
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,560
How are you feeling about your next one?

997
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
Yeah.

998
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,560
Yeah.

999
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,560
All right, let's go.

1000
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,320
I'm going to say that in 2019, BcashFS is mainlined.

1001
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,200
Oh, that's a good one.

1002
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,600
That's easily measurable, too.

1003
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,600
Don't you think, Rev?

1004
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,600
That's pretty clear.

1005
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:11,920
Well, mainlined in a kernel that we can actually use, or is it going to be in an RC or what?

1006
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,720
Yeah, I'm going to say it's going to be in Linus's tree.

1007
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,880
Okay, Linus's tree, but will it be like in a Ubuntu or like a Fedora?

1008
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,800
Is it going to be in a distro or are you just saying-

1009
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,800
I don't know.

1010
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
I think it'll be in Linus's tree.

1011
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
I don't know about the distro part.

1012
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Okay.

1013
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
Will it at least be an arch?

1014
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Yeah.

1015
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,800
Yeah, it'll be an arch.

1016
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,800
Okay, sure.

1017
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,800
It already is.

1018
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
That's pretty good.

1019
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,200
I really can't argue with pretty much any of that.

1020
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,320
I think you could sum it up and lock it in.

1021
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,320
Rev, it's your call.

1022
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,320
I think that's pretty good, though.

1023
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,720
Yeah, I think that, yeah, lock it in.

1024
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:51,320
In 2019, BcashFS will enter the mainline kernel and be shipped in a distribution like Arch.

1025
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,880
I really hope that comes to fruition.

1026
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,840
I have no idea if it will, but hey, we'll see.

1027
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,340
I am a big fan of that file system.

1028
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,340
Watch it.

1029
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,340
And I am a patron of...

1030
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,340
Is it Ken?

1031
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,340
Right?

1032
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,340
Ken to Overstreet.

1033
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,340
Ken.

1034
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,340
I have a last one.

1035
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,340
All right, Mr. Drifter, take it away.

1036
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,340
Okay.

1037
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:15,080
In 2019, at the end, Microsoft will begin discussions with TPG in purchasing SUSE.

1038
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,080
Huh.

1039
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,080
Interesting.

1040
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,080
Again?

1041
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,080
They're going to get acquired?

1042
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,880
You know, I was listening to Late Night Linux, the one that came out this week, and I was

1043
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,080
thinking to myself, is SUSE going to get bought again this year?

1044
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:31,080
And I rolled it around in my head, and I didn't really think of a buyer, because they're really

1045
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,400
focused on a market outside the US.

1046
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,200
And so Microsoft didn't land on that for me, Drifter.

1047
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,480
What makes you think Microsoft over, say, maybe making a significant investment in,

1048
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
say, Canonical?

1049
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,560
So the reason that I think that is because, like, SUSE and Windows have kind of been a

1050
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,560
thing.

1051
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,120
Like, back when it was Novell, they kind of had an agreement with different things.

1052
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Okay.

1053
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,240
I was talking with Stitch in the chat room about Active Directory services, and I happen

1054
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,440
to know a guy who happens to be working on an Active Directory integration with Yast.

1055
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:07,080
So it would make sense, I think, that Windows will buy it, because, like he was mentioning,

1056
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:12,240
it makes sense in the long term for Microsoft to basically make Windows a skin for a Linux

1057
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,240
distribution.

1058
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,240
Hmm.

1059
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,800
Yeah, I've seen that prediction flow around on the internet a couple of times this year,

1060
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,920
that Microsoft will ship a desktop environment on Linux.

1061
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,520
I think your prediction is pretty solid.

1062
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,680
I'll let the ref make the final call.

1063
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,680
But what do you think?

1064
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,440
Do you think we're ready to go with Microsoft buys SUSE ref?

1065
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,440
Yep.

1066
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
All right.

1067
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,440
What do you think, Victor?

1068
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:36,720
I think that in 2019, SUSE and TPG in specific will be in discussion with Microsoft and the

1069
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,280
purchase of SUSE.

1070
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,640
All right.

1071
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,480
So they won't necessarily finish the acquisition or won't be finalized.

1072
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,200
But like a purchase is announced.

1073
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Yeah.

1074
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,200
Right.

1075
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,680
And the reason I say that is because, I mean, like it's been discussed, it's kind of already

1076
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
been purchased by TPG.

1077
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,200
They might have to wait a bit to see if it's worth it, you know?

1078
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,200
Yeah.

1079
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,200
Yeah.

1080
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,360
They're probably still working the books out on that.

1081
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,360
All right.

1082
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,640
So we'll go to Brandon next and then Popey after Brandon.

1083
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,840
So Brandon, you have a prediction that involves Dell.

1084
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
Yeah.

1085
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:11,840
So in 2019, I predict that Dell Technologies or one of its subsidiaries, like VMware, will

1086
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,840
purchase SUSE.

1087
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
Okay.

1088
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,840
All right.

1089
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:20,600
You could have just hit the lock-in sound straight away on that.

1090
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,600
Almost, right?

1091
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,080
Like I was just trying to think like anything I can poke on that.

1092
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,320
And I don't think so.

1093
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,880
And I think that makes more sense than Microsoft, too, if you think about it.

1094
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,000
I have a few reasonings for that.

1095
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
All right.

1096
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Okay.

1097
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,500
So SUSE has some overlapping products with VMware that are actually, like specifically

1098
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,560
with Pivotal, I think are superior.

1099
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,560
Like the way they handle cloud, SUSE handles cloud foundries a little bit better than the

1100
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,480
way Pivotal handles cloud foundry and they created it.

1101
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:53,200
And also operating systems become the most relevant thing.

1102
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,400
And VMware doesn't have an operating system.

1103
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:03,120
And there was a lot of rumors that years ago that VMware was going to acquire an OVL.

1104
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:08,680
And I think this, it just makes sense that they'll buy it.

1105
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,680
That's pretty solid.

1106
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,680
Yeah.

1107
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,680
That's a pretty solid.

1108
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,680
Plenty of enterprise play there.

1109
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,680
Yeah.

1110
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,680
And EMC.

1111
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,160
SUSE has been making a lot of noise about their Kubernetes offering.

1112
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,760
And any company that gets involved in that usually helps the stock price.

1113
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,960
So Brandon, I think that's pretty great.

1114
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,920
I think, yeah, I think I agree with Joe.

1115
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
Go ahead and lock that in.

1116
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:33,480
In 2019, SUSE will be acquired by Dell Technologies or one of the subsidiaries like VMware.

1117
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,480
That's pretty solid.

1118
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,600
That would be also one of the best news stories of the year because it'd be so much fun to

1119
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,480
talk about SUSE getting sold again.

1120
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,440
We could just have a party about it, like a SUSE sale party.

1121
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,880
If that, you know, if that happens, we're having a barbecue.

1122
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,880
I say it right now.

1123
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,240
All right, Mr. Popey, I'd love to hear your next prediction for 2019.

1124
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
Okay.

1125
00:44:50,240 --> 00:45:00,360
In 2019, I predict three AAA titles will withdraw plans for having a native Linux port of games

1126
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,000
and they will instead support Proton.

1127
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,120
Just a new story out today about Proton getting even more support for more titles.

1128
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,320
So does this mean titles that have already announced that they're going to be on Linux

1129
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,320
or what?

1130
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:21,400
Well, the ones that are either in early access or beta or almost out, but not quite, or planned

1131
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:27,000
to go out in 2019, so that was their launch window, was 2019, and they're not going to

1132
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
do Linux.

1133
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,320
They're going to do, or they were planning to do Linux in the future at some point, but

1134
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,700
whatever plans they had for Linux will be shelved and they'll use Proton instead.

1135
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,400
And how exactly are we defining AAA?

1136
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,320
Large, big budget companies that you've heard of, not tiny.

1137
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,120
So not a kickstarter?

1138
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,400
No, no.

1139
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,880
These are like reputable companies.

1140
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,920
As an example, like EA and Bethesda and those kinds of names that you've heard of rather

1141
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,360
than some guy in his bedroom.

1142
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,720
And I have to say Proton is shockingly good.

1143
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,440
I've been playing the hell out of No Man's Sky again.

1144
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,120
Such a fun game for me and it's, you know, just don't even notice it.

1145
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,320
I wouldn't even know it's not a native port.

1146
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,320
That's pretty good.

1147
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,320
Yeah, this makes sense.

1148
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,760
I was trying to come up with a Proton Steam prediction and this is better.

1149
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:18,800
Yeah, you got a number, you got a specific action that happens, and the logic for why

1150
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,480
that action happens, I think I agree with.

1151
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,640
All right, Mr. Popey, I think it's safe to lock that one in.

1152
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:30,560
Okay, in 2019, I predict three AAA titles from well-known publishers will either push

1153
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,340
back their Linux port or withdraw their Linux port, but instead use Proton to support their

1154
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,960
Linux users.

1155
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,640
Now I had an outlandish Proton-based prediction, which is going to be in the next Linux action

1156
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,640
news.

1157
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,640
But I'm not going to spoil it.

1158
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,640
I look forward to that.

1159
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,240
Okay, Benton, I'd love to hear your next prediction.

1160
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,520
My prediction is canonical will get IPO'd in 2019.

1161
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,940
Ah, there's our first solid canonical prediction.

1162
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,940
It's nice and concise.

1163
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,940
Ref, what do you think?

1164
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,840
Yeah, I think you can lock that straight in.

1165
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:06,120
So my prediction for 2019 is that canonical will get IPO'd.

1166
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,160
I'm surprised nobody else has made that prediction yet.

1167
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,440
I think we would all shine away from that.

1168
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,440
Yeah, you know what?

1169
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,440
It's not on my list either.

1170
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,120
I just, but you almost, you almost kind of hope that happens because like, damn, they're

1171
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,120
working hard.

1172
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,120
If not, maybe some interesting investment news or something like that.

1173
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,840
Well, I'll jump in with my last prediction now.

1174
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:28,800
And that is that Linux sees big market gains in virtual desktops.

1175
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,160
It's the year of the Linux virtual desktop, as major cloud providers go mainstream with

1176
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,080
their virtual desktop cloud offerings.

1177
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,440
So you mean like a cloud desktop?

1178
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,440
It's in a browser?

1179
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:43,440
Some sort of Citrix session, any kind of thin client.

1180
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:50,080
But it's you remote in, you get a full Linux desktop and it becomes a mainstream workflow.

1181
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,640
And I know this has been brewing under the scenes for years now.

1182
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,720
I know a few listeners that use a virtual desktop.

1183
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,760
I've experimented with a couple of different options, but in 2019, every major cloud provider

1184
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,880
is going to roll out their virtual desktop, even Microsoft roll out their virtual desktop.

1185
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,960
And it will be predominantly, maybe with the exception of Microsoft, Linux desktops.

1186
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,160
Now, although again, I agree with you on this, it's not measurable.

1187
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,800
We need some specific details to measure this by.

1188
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,800
You knew this was coming.

1189
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,800
These are your rules.

1190
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,560
You know what would be really fun is if like DigitalOcean rolled out a virtual desktop.

1191
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,560
Wouldn't that be awesome?

1192
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,200
Yeah, you can do it with X2GO at the moment.

1193
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,560
Yeah, we're all rolling our own anyway.

1194
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,620
You can roll your own for sure, yeah.

1195
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:42,860
So Citrix today already supports Linux virtual desktops and so does VMware and so does Red

1196
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,000
Hat with Red Hat virtualization using Spice.

1197
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:54,760
So if you're saying a cloud provider, so maybe a better prediction would be a major cloud

1198
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:00,520
provider such as AWS will be supporting Linux virtual desktops.

1199
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:04,160
Well, they already have something now and I've used it.

1200
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,080
But what I'm talking about is it becomes a mainstream option.

1201
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,600
So you're a business that's rolling out desktops.

1202
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,320
The more I talk about it, the more I realize it's not that measurable.

1203
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,120
I feel like I need to go specific.

1204
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,600
I need to name like a specific provider.

1205
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:22,820
And I'm tempted to either say an Azure Linux desktop or a DigitalOcean Linux desktop.

1206
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,040
And I don't know which one I should go with.

1207
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,040
You can do both, I guess.

1208
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,320
You can hedge your bets as long as you say them both and you're rocking.

1209
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,200
I mean, all right, I mean, I was really confident.

1210
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:39,520
I'm confident about the virtual desktop market because I read some white papers.

1211
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,000
But they convinced me that like the market for virtual desktops is going to be good in

1212
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
2019.

1213
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,480
And then like in 2020 and 2022, it's going to be really good.

1214
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,320
So that was what I was trying to base the prediction on is based on just reading those

1215
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,000
white papers.

1216
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,080
But what I will say is just to make it spicy and to get the approval of the referee.

1217
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,760
This is why we got to have a referee really, right?

1218
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,760
Yes, it is.

1219
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,480
I would have tried to squeak this one in and nobody would have called me on it.

1220
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,400
But to be specific, I'm going to say DigitalOcean and Azure.

1221
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,400
Are you good with that?

1222
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,280
If I say DigitalOcean or Azure launches a virtual desktop that runs Linux?

1223
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,880
Yeah, you can say and or or, it's up to you.

1224
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,320
I'd say or to hedge your bets.

1225
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,320
All right.

1226
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,320
All right.

1227
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,320
Okay.

1228
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,320
All right.

1229
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,320
Thank you.

1230
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,320
All right.

1231
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,320
Okay, here we go.

1232
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:34,960
In 2019, Microsoft Azure or DigitalOcean launches a Linux based virtual desktop.

1233
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,940
That's the one I'm probably the least confident about now.

1234
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,400
And that was that like that general trend is the one I'm the most confident about.

1235
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,400
So that's kind of funny.

1236
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,400
That's difficult, right?

1237
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,400
All right, Mr. Payne.

1238
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,280
I think you have one more, don't you?

1239
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,280
I do.

1240
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,280
Okay.

1241
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,280
All right.

1242
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:54,480
Microsoft says that in 2019, a compiled ZFS module is shipped by another distro outside

1243
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,480
of Ubuntu.

1244
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:00,540
Oh, especially with them rebasing a lot of the stuff on ZFS for Linux now.

1245
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,040
So it's like the it's the mainstream version of ZFS.

1246
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,040
Like there's some steam.

1247
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,040
I don't know if it's gonna happen.

1248
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,040
It would.

1249
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,040
I would love it.

1250
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,040
Damn.

1251
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,320
I can't believe I didn't think of that one.

1252
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,060
That's good.

1253
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,680
So like, Debian would count or SUSE.

1254
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,680
Well, SUSE is not gonna do it.

1255
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,680
That's ridiculous.

1256
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,000
I mean, you can't just say a distro because that could be anything that could be just

1257
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,140
some random respin of Ubuntu or whatever.

1258
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,140
We need some specifics.

1259
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,600
I think you need a short list of distros that count.

1260
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,240
Or what about like just saying Ubuntu and Ubuntu derivatives don't count?

1261
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,240
Would that be fair?

1262
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,240
Hmm.

1263
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,240
Maybe.

1264
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,240
Like a minimum user size or something?

1265
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,240
Because like, I don't.

1266
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,480
Yeah, again, I'm not trying to count like a tiny bespoke distro, but something with like

1267
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,360
that exists now that's an established distribution.

1268
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,420
But clear Linux is a bespoke distribution.

1269
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,800
And if it's shipped it, I think that would be considered a win.

1270
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,840
Okay, it's kind of bespoke, but I mean bespoke like some person on the internet who's not

1271
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,840
worried about lawsuits.

1272
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,840
You know what I mean?

1273
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,560
Like, if you just put some binaries on a DigitalOcean server somewhere, that's not what I'm saying.

1274
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,560
Okay.

1275
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,560
Intel, you know, Intel's behind clear Linux.

1276
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,560
Right.

1277
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,560
Okay.

1278
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,560
Okay.

1279
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,560
All right.

1280
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,560
Are you saying a distro that has corporate backing then?

1281
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,560
Not necessarily, but just like an established mainstream distribution.

1282
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,560
Yeah.

1283
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,560
So Arch would count for example.

1284
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,560
Arch, Debian, whatever.

1285
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,020
Again, I don't think those two will do it.

1286
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,400
But those are examples of...

1287
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,080
But it would be a hell of a thing if Debian did it.

1288
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,080
It would be, wouldn't it?

1289
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,160
It would really be a hell of a thing.

1290
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,160
I'd love to see that.

1291
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,380
I think that we need a list of distros, whereas I'm afraid I think you're going to have to

1292
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,040
come up with four or five.

1293
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,040
Yeah.

1294
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,040
Suse is not going to do it.

1295
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,720
They're all in on butterFS with that thing.

1296
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,800
So that's not going to happen.

1297
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,800
Ubuntu's already doing it.

1298
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,800
Red Hat's not going to do it, are they?

1299
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,800
No.

1300
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,800
Red Hat's not going to do it.

1301
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,800
No.

1302
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,800
No.

1303
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,800
Damn, Wes.

1304
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,800
Okay.

1305
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,800
Okay.

1306
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,800
So should we...

1307
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,800
I mean, how do you...

1308
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,800
I'm just thinking about this.

1309
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,800
I don't know what you've got left after that.

1310
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,840
Well, let's look at distro watch right now.

1311
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,520
So we need to be clear.

1312
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,080
Would Manjaro Linux count?

1313
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,400
Yeah, that would count for me.

1314
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,400
Okay.

1315
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,400
What about Solus?

1316
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,400
Yeah.

1317
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,400
Really?

1318
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,760
As I say on the Ubuntu podcast, hashtag awkward.

1319
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,760
Yeah.

1320
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,760
I don't know if that one...

1321
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,760
What about Void?

1322
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,760
What about Anagros?

1323
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,760
Yeah.

1324
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,720
I feel like Anagros and Void do count.

1325
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,360
I feel like Anagros, Manjia, even though it's...

1326
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,360
I think that would count.

1327
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,360
Boy.

1328
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,120
What about something like Kali, which is more of a live environment?

1329
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,280
But what if they decided to use EFS for a boot environment or something?

1330
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:15,440
Could you not specify a distro that's been around for more than N years?

1331
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,840
So that gives it a heritage and it's established rather than one of these fly-by-night distros.

1332
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,840
It's just a wallpaper change.

1333
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,840
Will you accept that, referee?

1334
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,840
Yeah.

1335
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,840
What do you think?

1336
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,840
Yeah, I'll accept that.

1337
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,840
Okay.

1338
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,840
So like a three-year window?

1339
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,840
Sure.

1340
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,840
That's interesting.

1341
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,840
All right.

1342
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,840
What do you say?

1343
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,840
Yeah, so older than three years?

1344
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,840
So a distribution older than three years ships a pre-compiled ZFS kernel.

1345
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,840
All right.

1346
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,840
Lock it in with.

1347
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:48,120
In 2019, a Linux distribution older than three years will ship a pre-compiled ZFS Linux kernel

1348
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,120
module.

1349
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,920
I like that.

1350
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,880
Now, older than three years in 2019 or older than three years now?

1351
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,880
Oh, damn it.

1352
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,880
Oh, don't complicate it.

1353
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,880
Oh, dang it.

1354
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,200
As of the start of the year.

1355
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,200
I only realized that after you started saying it.

1356
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,200
No, no, no.

1357
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,200
Those clarifications are good.

1358
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,840
That was a thought-provoking one, though.

1359
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,840
I like that.

1360
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,120
I like that as a thought exercise, like who else would be left to do it?

1361
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:14,640
And it does seem like it's a long shot, but them rebasing on ZFS on Linux is the best

1362
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,280
indicator of like once that becomes like the mainline version that the project considers

1363
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,280
upstream, you're more likely to start deploying that.

1364
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,800
Someone small enough kind of bets that if someone's going to get sued, it'll be canonical.

1365
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,800
Yeah.

1366
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,800
Hmm.

1367
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,800
Well, now we're all on the record.

1368
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,800
We've locked it in.

1369
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,480
And my intention is to review this next year and see how we did.

1370
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,760
I felt going into it a lot better than I did on the other end of it.

1371
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:43,080
I have a sneaking suspicion that about this time next year, we're going to look like fools.

1372
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,080
Maybe.

1373
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,080
Maybe.

1374
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,080
Definitely.

1375
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,080
But that will be fun.

1376
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,080
And we're going to get to review it.

1377
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,580
And maybe if we keep doing it, we'll get better.

1378
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,240
It's been a pretty awesome 2018.

1379
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:59,440
You know, I always debate every single year if I should set a New Year's resolution or

1380
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,520
not.

1381
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,480
And the one thing that really stops me every time is around this time, I look back at the

1382
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,520
year and I go, holy shat.

1383
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:11,320
I mean, I would not have expected that we would all be working now for Linux Academy.

1384
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,880
I'd have a day job.

1385
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,320
You guys would be part of the team.

1386
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,320
Are you kidding me?

1387
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,320
That's amazing.

1388
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,640
We have a world class editor slash referee known as Joe Resington now on our team.

1389
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,360
I had no idea that I'd be getting swole this year either.

1390
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,360
Right?

1391
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,360
Yeah.

1392
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,400
Joe's even inspired me to go to the gym a couple of times a month.

1393
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,200
Yeah, I know.

1394
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,200
That is amazing.

1395
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,760
What a positive influence on the shows and on you.

1396
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,680
He's going to be ripped for Linux Fest Northwest.

1397
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,600
It's going to be a hell of a thing.

1398
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,600
You know what I mean?

1399
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,660
Like Joe and all of us at Linux Fest Northwest with me going to the gym a couple of more

1400
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:46,320
times before then and Joe going all the time, it's going to be great.

1401
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,560
We can enjoy it all over some hard cider.

1402
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,160
Also we just have a few things in the works.

1403
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:58,280
I'll just say for 2019, we're going to be upgrading and improving the live stream with

1404
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,360
multi bit rate options and getting our stupid audio stream working again.

1405
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,360
That's right.

1406
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,360
Finally.

1407
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,360
It's very, very close.

1408
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:11,240
We have one more holiday-ish episode that'll be next week on the second.

1409
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,560
We're doing our hopes and reviews.

1410
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:18,320
So we'll look back at 2018 and like when you look back at the year, what major stories

1411
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,760
really jump out at you and try to look back at the whole year and what really kind of

1412
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,760
is the things now with some perspective that really stand out.

1413
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,400
And I'd love to have you join us in the mumble room or in the IRC room.

1414
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,680
We do it at 2 PM Pacific, but jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar gets it converted to your time

1415
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,680
zone.

1416
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,720
You can join us in the IRC or you can join us in the mumble.

1417
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,320
And I'd love to have you in the mumble because then you can get it in the show.

1418
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:45,320
You can join our virtual log and you can, you can hope cast for what will happen next

1419
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,320
year in the open source world.

1420
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,560
This is the time to kind of get excited about all the great things that happened this year

1421
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,880
and the things we hope can happen in the future.

1422
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,880
Absolutely.

1423
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,820
And talk about the major things that bent the universe in 2018.

1424
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,340
So I love those episodes.

1425
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:03,040
We get to do them once a year and that will be the day after New Year's, we'll be doing

1426
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,120
it live and we'd love to have you at jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get it in, get it on the

1427
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,120
record.

1428
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,120
We won't be locking it in per se.

1429
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:15,540
It'll be more just reminiscing and chatting about it, but that wraps up this special holiday

1430
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,360
episode of the unplugged program.

1431
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,240
Thank you so much for joining us.

1432
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:26,120
Linux unplugged.com slash two 81 for show notes and links to the things we talked about.

1433
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,120
See you back here next week.

1434
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,120
Next Tuesday.

1435
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,120
Is it Tuesday?

1436
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,120
Is it Wednesday?

1437
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,120
I don't know, we should, we should know this.

1438
00:57:33,120 --> 00:58:02,120
Oh God.

1439
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:07,120
Bye.
