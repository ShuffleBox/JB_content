WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.920
So, we kind of got this all thrown together.

00:03.920 --> 00:06.820
We weren't quite sure where we were going to get a spot, and we weren't quite sure what

00:06.820 --> 00:11.500
kind of connectivity we were going to have, but they do have like these connectivity stations

00:11.500 --> 00:17.280
with power and USB, and like these tables, and they built these boxes on top with plugs,

00:17.280 --> 00:22.460
four plugs on each side, and so we kind of just came over and commandeered one and took

00:22.460 --> 00:24.200
it over, and now that's where we're broadcasting from.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.360
I actually predicted that as we were walking in.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.680
I said, you know, and he goes, how are we going to make sure we get that spot?

00:28.680 --> 00:32.160
And I said, well, if we just start setting down microphones and mixers and like, excuse

00:32.160 --> 00:37.240
me, sorry, everyone will just kind of move, and sure enough, they moved.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.040
It was great.

00:39.040 --> 00:55.360
This is Linux Unplugged episode 106 for August 18th, 2015.

00:55.360 --> 00:59.720
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's live from LinuxCon 2015 in

00:59.720 --> 01:01.040
Seattle, Washington.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.040
My name is Chris.

01:02.040 --> 01:03.040
And my name is Noah.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.040
Hey, Noah.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.040
Are you ready for an exciting show today?

01:05.040 --> 01:06.040
Jeez, am I ever.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.440
It's only taken us two hours to get here, three hours to get here.

01:08.440 --> 01:12.480
It's exciting for us because we're live on the floor, and that's always, especially when

01:12.480 --> 01:16.040
you get here and you don't know where you're going to be live from, it's a bit challenging,

01:16.040 --> 01:21.560
but not only are we here, but we took the con experience up to the next level because

01:21.560 --> 01:25.480
we're also here with our Mumble Room, time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:25.480 --> 01:28.080
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.080
Hello, guys.

01:29.080 --> 01:30.560
I'm glad our virtual Lug could be here.

01:30.560 --> 01:35.600
They know the Seattle Greater Linux Users Group is upstairs.

01:35.600 --> 01:36.800
We should talk to them at some point.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.800
They have-

01:37.800 --> 01:38.800
That'd be really cool.

01:38.800 --> 01:39.800
Their Lug is here.

01:39.800 --> 01:45.200
And it kind of got me thinking, we could bring the Mumble Room with us to after show parties

01:45.200 --> 01:46.200
and just bring them on a phone.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.200
Oh, yeah.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.200
That'd be really cool.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.200
Oh, that'd be heck of fun, yeah.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.200
Maybe if we do that.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.200
I got the Mumble Client installed on my phone.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.200
Yeah.

01:52.200 --> 01:55.120
Well, coming up on today's episode of Linux Unplugged, we have a couple of things from

01:55.120 --> 01:57.320
the floor we're going to play.

01:57.320 --> 02:01.800
Bruce Schneier, renowned security expert, gave a keynote talk this morning and he had

02:01.800 --> 02:04.120
some interesting points he wanted to make.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.120
You-

02:05.120 --> 02:06.120
Me?

02:06.120 --> 02:09.160
You managed to finally get somebody from HP to go on record and talk about some of the

02:09.160 --> 02:12.200
behind the scenes stuff that they have not shared publicly that they're doing on Linux.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.200
I did.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.640
I've been sitting on that information for over a year and it was driving me nuts.

02:15.640 --> 02:16.640
Yeah.

02:16.640 --> 02:17.640
Absolutely nuts.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.040
Because they would not confirm it publicly.

02:20.040 --> 02:26.520
It's like this big thing, this big huge thing inside of HP that everyone's using Linux and

02:26.520 --> 02:28.120
they wouldn't talk about it on camera.

02:28.120 --> 02:31.320
And I harassed the heck out of them last year and I didn't get anywhere.

02:31.320 --> 02:36.520
And then this year, a person found a guy who found a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy

02:36.520 --> 02:38.460
that was able to talk on camera about it.

02:38.460 --> 02:40.440
And so we got it.

02:40.440 --> 02:47.080
So LinuxCon Seattle is about three floors of goodness.

02:47.080 --> 02:50.480
There's your basic floor, then you've got your second floor where, to be honest with

02:50.480 --> 02:53.160
you guys, we thought was the main floor when we first got here.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.320
And we'll get to that in just a second.

02:54.320 --> 02:58.200
And then there's a third floor where people have sponsored and some other showcases are

02:58.200 --> 02:59.200
up there.

02:59.200 --> 03:02.640
And it's right here in Seattle on sixth and I think it's Pike.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.120
It's at the Sheraton Hotel and it's a really, really, really nice location because if you

03:06.120 --> 03:09.400
get a little burned out and you want to go get some fresh air, you can just go for a

03:09.400 --> 03:10.400
walk.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.800
And there's tons of nice places here in Seattle to go to and so we've taken advantage of that.

03:13.800 --> 03:18.640
And we'll probably tell you a little bit more about that later on in the show today.

03:18.640 --> 03:23.540
But I wanted to tell them about our first impressions when we walked into LinuxCon.

03:23.540 --> 03:26.400
It's a little embarrassing but I'm willing to admit it.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.400
Kind of.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.400
But I mean I don't think that was really our fault.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.800
I think that's more of a layout issue.

03:29.800 --> 03:30.800
Yeah.

03:30.800 --> 03:31.800
You think so?

03:31.800 --> 03:32.800
Yeah.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.280
So we got in and the first thing you find is the registration desk and that's where

03:35.280 --> 03:38.360
you get your badge and your shirt and your swag bag and stuff like that.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.680
So we go over there and had a nice lovely conversation with the lady who, by the way,

03:41.680 --> 03:46.600
told me to walk through a wall and she sends us upstairs because you register at one booth

03:46.600 --> 03:49.920
and then they send you up to another floor which there's another registration booth where

03:49.920 --> 03:52.640
you hand a ticket from the first registration booth to get the rest of the stuff that you

03:52.640 --> 03:55.920
thought you were going to get at the one that you went to to begin with.

03:55.920 --> 03:59.520
So after we got through the two registration booths, one to register and one to get the

03:59.520 --> 04:04.480
stuff that I should have got the first one, then we walk out like right out of that second

04:04.480 --> 04:08.960
registration area and we see what appears to be the show hall.

04:08.960 --> 04:14.480
And there are like nine booths and Chris looks at me and goes, well, is this all there is?

04:14.480 --> 04:19.140
And I remember last year the expo hall was actually so small that they actually put it

04:19.140 --> 04:23.720
inside of the keynote room and it was just, there was the keynotes and then at the back

04:23.720 --> 04:26.000
wall, along that back wall were the booths.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
That was it.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.320
You missed a key part of our trip too because our first stop was actually the media room.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.480
That's where our first, we didn't actually go to the expo floor first, we went to the

04:34.480 --> 04:35.480
media room.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.920
Oh, that's right to drop stuff off.

04:36.920 --> 04:40.600
And then we bumped into a friend of ours and he said, did you guys see how small the floor

04:40.600 --> 04:41.600
is?

04:41.600 --> 04:42.600
And I said, what?

04:42.600 --> 04:44.720
And he's like, did you see how small the floor is?

04:44.720 --> 04:45.720
It's unbelievable.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.400
And that is why when we got there we thought, oh, this must be it.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.240
This must be the floor.

04:50.240 --> 04:54.160
And the other thing that was sort of fascinating about it is when we got there, we realized

04:54.160 --> 04:59.440
every single one of these booths was basically a deviation on itself.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.500
Like they were all the same product, just different makers, like it was all container

05:02.500 --> 05:03.500
management software.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.160
And we were like, oh wow, this is it?

05:05.160 --> 05:08.840
And so then I was a little bummed, I'm like, I'm not sure who we're going to talk to.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.400
Container Con 2015, man.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.400
Yeah.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.440
And it really, you know what, that first impression does kind of stick.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.040
It really is Container Con 2015.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.480
Docker, and we're going to talk about that more in a moment, but this is Container Con.

05:19.480 --> 05:23.560
But however, it turns out when you go up to the third floor, you get your more traditional

05:23.560 --> 05:28.800
vendors like here we've got Cloud Foundry and Cisco and Citrix and Canonical and Docker

05:28.800 --> 05:33.000
and Digital Ocean is here, GitHub's here, and Google is here.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Of course, the Linux Fest Northwest guys are here and SUSE is here and Stack Exchange is

05:37.000 --> 05:41.680
here and Samsung and SanDisk and a couple other well-known folks.

05:41.680 --> 05:46.200
You probably know of Amazon Web Services is here, Atlassian is here, and a couple that

05:46.200 --> 05:48.640
we're going to place some interviews for you are from here too.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.720
So once we got to the third floor, it was actually, it seems like a pretty happening

05:51.720 --> 05:55.080
event and the sessions are really intense.

05:55.080 --> 06:00.040
A lot of sessions this time all about containers, not all containers, but a lot of sessions

06:00.040 --> 06:05.280
about running software in container, managing applications in containers, putting your desktop

06:05.280 --> 06:10.720
applications in containers, like it's all about the different specs, the app spec, and

06:10.720 --> 06:11.720
the different initiatives.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.600
Maybe that's why they've codenamed it Container Con.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.440
Yeah, it's definitely the theme here.

06:17.440 --> 06:21.280
I got a couple of clips I want to play, a couple of interviews I want to get into.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.400
We had a few people in the chatroom that asked us to kind of compare the difference between

06:24.400 --> 06:29.500
Linux Con and Linux Fest, so I want to do that in a little bit as well and kind of give

06:29.500 --> 06:30.500
you our general impressions.

06:30.500 --> 06:35.160
So before we get to the first interview, I do have a bit of an outtake I could play.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.560
Do you want me to play our first outtake?

06:36.560 --> 06:37.560
Sure.

06:37.560 --> 06:38.560
Yeah, let's do that.

06:38.560 --> 06:42.800
This is Chris and Noah entering the Linux Con and I was going to record, you know, build

06:42.800 --> 06:46.280
this beautiful theater of the mind for you guys so we'd really be able to illustrate

06:46.280 --> 06:50.400
what it's like to get here, but, well, Noah was very, very enthusiastic about creating

06:50.400 --> 06:54.960
that theater of the mind and he might have gone a little overboard with painting the

06:54.960 --> 07:00.280
picture.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.280
Here we go, Noah.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.280
Linux Con 2015.

07:02.280 --> 07:03.280
All right, let's walk through the door.

07:03.280 --> 07:04.280
Inside.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.280
Head to the escalator.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.280
Step on here.

07:06.280 --> 07:07.280
You're so bad.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.280
I'm trying to give them a story.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.280
What's happening?

07:09.280 --> 07:10.280
You're too obvious.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.280
What's happening right now?

07:11.280 --> 07:12.280
You don't know.

07:12.280 --> 07:13.280
You don't know.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.280
You just paint the scene with the sound.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.280
Paint the scene.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.280
There's no sound.

07:16.280 --> 07:26.840
So we got here and we do have a couple of interviews to play.

07:26.840 --> 07:27.840
We went to it.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.240
The first thing we got to work was we knew we had to get some stuff for Linux Unplugged

07:30.240 --> 07:33.400
because we had a live broadcast and that was our first drop-dead thing.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.200
So before we get into that, I'm going to tell you about Digital Ocean, the first sponsor

07:36.200 --> 07:37.960
on today's Linux Unplugged.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.720
Digital Ocean is super, super handy.

07:39.720 --> 07:43.480
We're bouncing clips around and things like that and it's very, very easy to spin up droplets

07:43.480 --> 07:48.260
and when you combine it with something like Docker and man is Docker huge here at Linux

07:48.260 --> 07:49.760
Con and of course Digital Ocean is here as well.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.800
You really have something special.

07:51.800 --> 07:56.760
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED to get a $10 credit and here's the best part.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.540
Digital Ocean has $5 a month plans.

07:58.540 --> 08:03.320
So for $5 a month and less than 55 seconds, you can spin up a droplet with 512 megabytes

08:03.320 --> 08:08.760
of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte of transfer and they've got data center locations

08:08.760 --> 08:12.720
in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London and a brand new one in Germany with

08:12.720 --> 08:16.560
lots of great connectivity and good regional locations and Digital Ocean's interface is

08:16.560 --> 08:19.000
so slick and straightforward.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.920
Zero resistance to get something up and running or deploy an application.

08:21.920 --> 08:25.240
You want to do Ubuntu LTS with Apache or something like that.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.240
It's clicks away.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.400
There's so many great ways to deploy software using their interface but even better, they

08:30.400 --> 08:33.920
have a straightforward API you can take advantage of and snap it into your existing management

08:33.920 --> 08:36.000
infrastructure or just use some of the great apps.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.160
They have so many good community tutorials that have been written by the community with

08:39.160 --> 08:40.680
professional editing done to them.

08:40.680 --> 08:41.840
They pay people to edit them.

08:41.840 --> 08:45.400
It is a really good experience and it's great for testing and production.

08:45.400 --> 08:51.240
We use it for all of the above and it is our go-to Linux deployment platform in the cloud

08:51.240 --> 08:55.400
and if you use Docker, if you use CoreOS, if you're using FreeBSD, if you're using

08:55.400 --> 09:00.720
CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, you name it, you can deploy it on Digital Ocean in seconds.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.560
Go over to digitalocean.com and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

09:04.560 --> 09:08.660
You can use that at any time and that'll apply a $10 credit to your account and you can also

09:08.660 --> 09:11.040
support the Unplugged podcast.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.320
Go to digitalocean.com and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and a big thank you to Digital

09:14.320 --> 09:18.040
Ocean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.560
All right, Mr. Colonel, Linux over there.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.720
What do you say we jump into a couple of our interviews that we got here and then we'll

09:24.720 --> 09:25.720
kind of chat about it a little bit.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.040
Man, would I like to do that.

09:27.040 --> 09:32.120
And I wanted to start with the core infrastructure projects announcement this morning.

09:32.120 --> 09:37.040
They had a keynote this morning and they covered a lot of things but one of the initiatives

09:37.040 --> 09:41.800
that keeps getting better and better is in the wake of Heartbleed and Shellshock.

09:41.800 --> 09:45.720
We saw the Linux Foundation along with a bunch of other stakeholders in the industry come

09:45.720 --> 09:49.920
together and launch the core infrastructure initiative.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.840
And the core infrastructure initiative project has been giving out money.

09:52.840 --> 09:57.160
They just announced they're going to be paying for the main developer of NTP, Father Time

09:57.160 --> 09:59.200
is what people call him.

09:59.200 --> 10:03.320
And he's been working on NTP just making nothing but pennies.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.080
And now they just announced they're going to support him which is great.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.440
Hopefully they'll help with some of these NTP reflection attacks.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.160
All the different projects they're investing in have been extremely important.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.800
But there's been one thing that we really haven't been able to kind of agree upon industry

10:14.800 --> 10:19.040
wide and I think we could all agree that if we don't come up with a common set of agreements

10:19.040 --> 10:21.420
and standards, governments will.

10:21.420 --> 10:26.520
And so the core initiative project is setting out to create a open source best practices

10:26.520 --> 10:30.120
program that's going to be hosted up on GitHub and this clip tells us a little bit about

10:30.120 --> 10:31.120
it.

10:31.120 --> 10:36.040
What we're doing is announcing essentially an open source project which will be rolled

10:36.040 --> 10:42.440
out later this year but we wanted to get community feedback on a best practice program that essentially

10:42.440 --> 10:48.640
allows open source projects to meet a set of criteria whether it's having a security

10:48.640 --> 10:53.680
mailing list, peer checking of code, doing static analysis on your code, doing threat

10:53.680 --> 10:58.560
modeling on your code to essentially indicate that you care about security and that it's

10:58.560 --> 11:00.460
important to your project.

11:00.460 --> 11:04.040
People who receive that badge will be able to display it on their project site or in

11:04.040 --> 11:07.840
GitHub and indicate that they have met that criteria.

11:07.840 --> 11:12.320
What we really want is all of your feedback and we don't want it in the form of a bunch

11:12.320 --> 11:13.320
of comments.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.460
We would love it in the form of GitHub poll requests.

11:16.460 --> 11:20.280
So we are doing this, this goes live today.

11:20.280 --> 11:25.000
We're actually announcing this later on this afternoon at a media exclusive luncheon on

11:25.000 --> 11:30.120
the core infrastructure initiative so you all are getting a sneak preview of this today.

11:30.120 --> 11:34.040
Now I think this is a fascinating idea so it's sort of a voluntary program submission

11:34.040 --> 11:39.480
and you get a certified, you meet the best practices and I've been talking about this

11:39.480 --> 11:45.280
on and off with Alan on TechSnap but how do we solve this problem where as a business

11:45.280 --> 11:49.360
you want to use open source in your enterprise but you don't know if it meets a certain,

11:49.360 --> 11:52.100
I don't know if quality standards is the right word but security standards.

11:52.100 --> 11:57.960
You want it to meet a standard, whatever standard that is and actually that makes a lot of sense

11:57.960 --> 12:01.080
right because we do that in basically every other field.

12:01.080 --> 12:04.520
Aviation, anyone can make something but they rate it to be used in aviation.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.360
Or like for example Oracle right?

12:06.360 --> 12:09.920
They go out and get their software better business bureau certified for certain amounts

12:09.920 --> 12:14.920
of software to be free of certain amount of flaws which is kind of a total joke but there

12:14.920 --> 12:19.400
are industry certifications now and this is one that I think what's cool about this is

12:19.400 --> 12:22.560
it's going to be open up to the general public and I don't know if anybody in the Mubroom

12:22.560 --> 12:26.120
has any thoughts on a program like this or maybe any potential downsides but since it

12:26.120 --> 12:32.100
seems volunteer based to me, it seems like a pretty good approach to this and I like

12:32.100 --> 12:35.840
this being run by the Core Infrastructure Initiative because they seem to have their

12:35.840 --> 12:38.720
priorities pretty well aligned.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.560
Anybody in the Mubroom have any thoughts on this?

12:40.560 --> 12:41.560
Going once?

12:41.560 --> 12:42.560
Twice?

12:42.560 --> 12:43.560
No takers.

12:43.560 --> 12:46.520
Okay, all right, well then we'll move on.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.520
I thought it was a good move.

12:47.520 --> 12:51.360
I think I really like what the Core Infrastructure Initiative is doing in the wake of Shellshock

12:51.360 --> 12:52.360
and things like that.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.840
I'm very, very happy about that.

12:53.840 --> 12:59.400
All right, Mr. Noah, then I'm ready for my next clip here and this one was kind of interesting.

12:59.400 --> 13:05.560
It was from Bruce Schneier and he was talking about attributions of cyber attacks and why

13:05.560 --> 13:11.720
attribution is so hard and kind of using the Sony attack in sort of the lens to look through

13:11.720 --> 13:16.720
this problem and if you recall, Sony was using Linux and Apache web servers and things like

13:16.720 --> 13:20.940
that so it's kind of relevant to us because a lot of times Linux is in the server infrastructure

13:20.940 --> 13:24.920
so if there's a problem there, it very much falls on the Linux system administrator to

13:24.920 --> 13:25.920
manage that.

13:25.920 --> 13:31.280
So Bruce Schneier, he was connected in via Google Hangouts this morning for the keynote.

13:31.280 --> 13:35.580
There's a little bit of audio glitchiness because his computer had bad audio but the

13:35.580 --> 13:40.400
content is super critical and important especially with what's going on these days in cybersecurity.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.800
So here's Bruce Schneier talking about how attribution is difficult.

13:43.800 --> 13:47.880
The other big issue and I think the biggest issue that Sony brought out is that attribution

13:47.880 --> 13:48.880
is difficult.

13:48.880 --> 13:55.640
I mean, compared to attacks, in 2006, Israel attacked a Syrian nuclear power plant.

13:55.640 --> 14:03.080
They did it with planes, planes and bombs and the recipient of the attack, Syria, could

14:03.080 --> 14:09.480
look up in the sky, see the planes, see the flags painted on their tails and know where

14:09.480 --> 14:11.160
the attack came from.

14:11.160 --> 14:16.600
2010, US and Israel attacked an Iranian nuclear power plant.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.800
We did it with a cyber weapon, with Stuxnet.

14:19.800 --> 14:24.320
The difference is that there was no way for Iran to attribute the attack.

14:24.320 --> 14:30.920
Actually, Iran didn't seem to have known it was an attack until either the press outed

14:30.920 --> 14:37.660
it or possibly Israel or US called Iran on some diplomatic channel and told them.

14:37.660 --> 14:40.640
It's very difficult to attribute attacks on the internet.

14:40.640 --> 14:46.200
We know this is true, packets don't come with return addresses and it's easy to false flag.

14:46.200 --> 14:50.920
It's easy to pretend your attack comes from somewhere else.

14:50.920 --> 14:55.680
My belief is that a lot of attacks from the western countries go through China simply

14:55.680 --> 15:01.680
because everyone knows a lot of attacks go through China and that's a perfect way to

15:01.680 --> 15:03.160
hide where you're from.

15:03.160 --> 15:07.960
I actually was really glad he made that point.

15:07.960 --> 15:11.400
It's very possible that attacks from western countries are just being routed through China

15:11.400 --> 15:13.640
because a lot of times they're just a Chinese attack.

15:13.640 --> 15:18.480
Now one of the things that jumped out at me about that talk, and he's talking about security,

15:18.480 --> 15:24.480
is one of the main things that the vendors here are showcasing is how to patch your applications

15:24.480 --> 15:27.360
in containers.

15:27.360 --> 15:31.560
Everybody has a different solution for that, how to manage container security, how to update

15:31.560 --> 15:35.280
applications in containers, how to know when the applications in the containers have gone

15:35.280 --> 15:38.360
behind, how to know when the application quits working.

15:38.360 --> 15:44.240
All of that is, I would say, and maybe do you agree that it seems to be the number one

15:44.240 --> 15:48.360
product that's being talked about here, the number one problem?

15:48.360 --> 15:55.560
The container technologies themselves, we've built communities and the standards exist

15:55.560 --> 15:57.560
for that.

15:57.560 --> 16:02.280
What's left, where the market is, where there's left to make a business or money is in products

16:02.280 --> 16:03.280
managing those things.

16:03.280 --> 16:09.600
It's like we're talking about the drive, is you're not going to, nobody is going to manage

16:09.600 --> 16:12.640
that stuff from the command line, even if it's possible.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.200
You need some sort of a solution, especially if you're doing it at a stand.

16:15.200 --> 16:20.200
The other thing is containers encourage you to have a lot of them because not only is

16:20.200 --> 16:24.480
your density higher versus virtualization, so on a server that could have 10 virtual

16:24.480 --> 16:29.000
machines maybe you can now have 20 containers because you don't have the emulation overhead,

16:29.000 --> 16:32.800
but you also are encouraged to do a container per application.

16:32.800 --> 16:37.560
You put your mail server in a container and your web server in a container and your group

16:37.560 --> 16:38.880
collaboration thing.

16:38.880 --> 16:42.000
All these different things go in containers, all of a sudden you have a dozen containers

16:42.000 --> 16:44.080
for one small office.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.820
One of the things that they're finding and talking about here is that container proliferation

16:46.820 --> 16:50.600
is just exploding and then even small shops have all of these containers they have to

16:50.600 --> 16:51.600
manage.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.880
Then the other thing they want to do is move them between services depending on which is

16:53.880 --> 16:55.560
more cost effective.

16:55.560 --> 16:59.240
Schneier talking about attribution and tracking all of this and security patches and updates

16:59.240 --> 17:03.560
is kind of relevant, so that is a problem they're trying to solve here.

17:03.560 --> 17:09.720
I actually really liked his point about why we are seeing so much attribution to China

17:09.720 --> 17:10.720
and Russia these days.

17:10.720 --> 17:14.480
Whenever you hear about a cyber attack, it's Iran, China, North Korea, or Russia every

17:14.480 --> 17:15.480
single time.

17:15.480 --> 17:16.480
It's never anybody else.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.480
It's never Canada.

17:17.480 --> 17:18.520
It's never Mexico.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.960
Sometimes it's the Syrian Electronic Army, but not so often.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.000
It's usually one of those guys.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.800
He tells us why and it's genius.

17:26.800 --> 17:30.680
What I love about Schneier is for the first 5, 10 minutes of his talk, I was like, oh,

17:30.680 --> 17:32.280
this is no good.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.280
Why is this at LinuxCon?

17:33.280 --> 17:35.840
Why is he saying this stuff?

17:35.840 --> 17:40.840
Then the second half of his talk was all like he took what he had set up and kind of re-looked

17:40.840 --> 17:43.960
at it in another lens.

17:43.960 --> 17:47.340
He's connected a few dots for me that I'm not quite like why are we just so publicly

17:47.340 --> 17:52.280
slamming these massively powerful nations and saying you're hacking us with the OPM

17:52.280 --> 17:53.840
breach or whatever it might be.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.240
It's China.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.240
Why are we doing this?

17:56.240 --> 17:58.960
He explains why.

17:58.960 --> 17:59.960
I thought it was fascinating.

17:59.960 --> 18:03.720
Then after that, we have the HP interview, which they also were here talking about the

18:03.720 --> 18:04.720
machine.

18:04.720 --> 18:05.720
That was interesting too.

18:05.720 --> 18:10.720
Before we get to that, I'll tell you about Linux Academy because we were chatting with

18:10.720 --> 18:13.280
some folks in the hallway about different educational resources.

18:13.280 --> 18:16.360
I think Linux Academy has something unique that the other guys don't have.

18:16.360 --> 18:21.600
I tell you, it comes up all the time, especially with containers, is this technology is a moving

18:21.600 --> 18:22.600
target.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.960
App spec is relatively new.

18:23.960 --> 18:27.720
Not much of the courseware out there really reflects that fact.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.760
In fact, pretty much almost none of them do.

18:29.760 --> 18:33.500
The difference with Linux Academy is those enthusiasts there at Linux Academy are following

18:33.500 --> 18:35.520
this stuff because they want to.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.320
They're following this stuff because that's what they're passionate about.

18:37.320 --> 18:40.360
Then they got together with educators and developers and they created the Linux Academy

18:40.360 --> 18:41.720
education platform.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.000
You go there, you figure out what you want to learn, they tell you how long it's going

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
to take.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
You choose from seven plus Linux distributions.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.680
They automatically spin up the virtual machines to match the distribution you choose from

18:49.680 --> 18:51.000
and the courseware adjust.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.280
They've just added new courses as well because they're adding new content constantly.

18:54.280 --> 18:57.200
They have team accounts as well, so if a few people want to go in and learn something,

18:57.200 --> 18:58.200
you can.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.200
That's a good way to motivate each other.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.080
They have an active community stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.720
I encourage you to go there and look at the different programs.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.560
Get started by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.760
That'll give you our 33% discount.

19:09.760 --> 19:10.760
When you're there, log in.

19:10.760 --> 19:14.880
Look how long it's going to take you to learn Python or Ruby or Apache or backing up your

19:14.880 --> 19:20.160
machine using TAR, whatever gap you have in your knowledge set that you want to fill in.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.680
Linux Academy has courses on it.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.920
They also have these nuggets.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.840
You can find them and you go there in like two minutes to 60 minutes long.

19:25.840 --> 19:28.940
They just deep dive right into exactly a course that you want to learn about, which is really

19:28.940 --> 19:34.200
kind of nice because I've been able to use their time availability planner when I'm kind

19:34.200 --> 19:38.580
of like getting on more of a routine, and then when it comes time to just really focus

19:38.580 --> 19:42.920
in on work and I don't really have time to get in something deep, I can still do a nugget

19:42.920 --> 19:43.920
from time to time.

19:43.920 --> 19:49.440
My certification's coming up at the end of this year for Red Hat.

19:49.440 --> 19:52.960
My last certification was in RHEL 6, and now I'll be doing RHEL 7.

19:52.960 --> 19:56.480
I have gotten the practical things nailed down so that I can start rolling out because

19:56.480 --> 20:02.820
we want to be using the... RHEL is, I don't want to say behind, but as stable as it is.

20:02.820 --> 20:11.880
When you go to... If you're not using the latest stable version, it's really stable.

20:11.880 --> 20:17.360
I have nailed out the practical things, but what I haven't quite got down is all the nuances

20:17.360 --> 20:19.160
that they're going to ask me on the test.

20:19.160 --> 20:23.800
I don't have time, as you might imagine, to take off a week to go do all of my recertification

20:23.800 --> 20:26.040
stuff, but I need to learn all the stuff that they're going to ask me.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.880
I found out Linux Academy actually has a course on that.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.880
I use them to learn the practical things.

20:31.880 --> 20:34.080
Now I'm going to go back and I'm going to actually retake the course this time and go

20:34.080 --> 20:37.480
all the way through and learn all of the differences between RHEL 6 and RHEL 7.

20:37.480 --> 20:41.800
That's only possible because I can do that from my laptop while I'm here in Seattle because

20:41.800 --> 20:44.800
everything always takes longer than they think it's going to, you know what I'm saying?

20:44.800 --> 20:45.800
That'll be great.

20:45.800 --> 20:46.800
That's nice.

20:46.800 --> 20:49.400
Go to linux.com slash unplugged to go get the Linux Unplugged discount and support this

20:49.400 --> 20:52.360
show and just take your skill set up a notch.

20:52.360 --> 20:53.360
Linux Academy.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.360
Thanks Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.360
You guys rock.

20:56.360 --> 20:59.080
Okay, let's play this Schneier clip here.

20:59.080 --> 21:02.000
This Schneier clip is our last one from Bruce, although I might go through his talk and see

21:02.000 --> 21:04.600
if there's any more we want to pull out, but I wanted to grab these ones because I thought

21:04.600 --> 21:08.920
these were short enough but extremely poignant and just for anybody involved and interested

21:08.920 --> 21:10.720
in technology, very relevant.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.120
So here's Bruce Schneier on why we're seeing so much attribution these days, basically

21:14.120 --> 21:16.760
why we're seeing the blame game from different nations.

21:16.760 --> 21:20.960
And there's an arms race here, which I think is important to think about this arms race

21:20.960 --> 21:29.680
between attributing attacks and hiding the origins of attacks, attribution versus deception.

21:29.680 --> 21:33.640
And the US is in a singularly powerful position here.

21:33.640 --> 21:37.520
The NSA surveils much of the internet for a bunch of reasons, right?

21:37.520 --> 21:41.780
They have a bigger budget than everyone else, actually than everyone else combined.

21:41.780 --> 21:47.000
And the way the internet is routed, a lot of traffic goes through the United States.

21:47.000 --> 21:54.240
Big article on the 15th last week on how AT&T is doing quite a lot of eavesdropping for

21:54.240 --> 22:02.720
the NSA, both within the United States and in their network points all around the world.

22:02.720 --> 22:09.760
2012, the US Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, he said publicly, he's talking publicly about

22:09.760 --> 22:15.800
attribution and I'm going to read a quote of his, that the US has made significant advances

22:15.800 --> 22:18.360
in identifying the origins of cyber attacks.

22:18.360 --> 22:20.160
That's an interesting statement.

22:20.160 --> 22:23.080
And we actually don't know what that means.

22:23.080 --> 22:29.760
We don't know if the NSA has some fundamental technological advance in identifying packets.

22:29.760 --> 22:34.660
Probably not, or that their espionage is so good that they're monitoring the planning

22:34.660 --> 22:35.660
process.

22:35.660 --> 22:41.520
I mean, we don't know what sort of secret evidence the NSA had.

22:41.520 --> 22:48.080
I mean, did they have recorded phone calls from North Korea discussing the plan?

22:48.080 --> 22:55.720
In my fantasies, I think they have the document of King Jong Un's signature on the approval

22:55.720 --> 22:57.640
to go through with this.

22:57.640 --> 22:59.860
We actually don't know what.

22:59.860 --> 23:03.920
But it's interesting that attribution leads to deterrence.

23:03.920 --> 23:11.100
In the past couple of years, the United States has been more forthcoming in identifying who

23:11.100 --> 23:12.840
attacked them.

23:12.840 --> 23:16.360
They've in several cases identified North Korea.

23:16.360 --> 23:22.960
Last year, we indicted five North Korean government officials in absentia for hacking.

23:22.960 --> 23:30.880
We've attributed Russia, oddly in the OPM attack, there was one statement by Clapper

23:30.880 --> 23:35.040
where he said it was China and then everyone kind of backed off and there's no official

23:35.040 --> 23:37.000
attribution.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.600
But by and large, we're seeing more attribution.

23:39.600 --> 23:49.000
I think that's because it's in the U.S.'s best interests to signal that they can attribute,

23:49.000 --> 23:53.840
to say to the world that if you try this, we will know it's you.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.080
And there is deterrence here.

23:55.080 --> 24:01.280
Actually, I think that leads to over attribution in some cases.

24:01.280 --> 24:06.880
But the thing about attribution in cyberspace is that providing evidence is tricky.

24:06.880 --> 24:14.400
Initially, the United States fingered North Korea, but provided very minimal evidence.

24:14.400 --> 24:18.060
And there's broad mistrust in the security community.

24:18.060 --> 24:23.760
So there was a lot of people, myself included, who just didn't believe them.

24:23.760 --> 24:27.280
And if you think about it, there are several types of attribution.

24:27.280 --> 24:30.760
There's the lowest, where I know you did it.

24:30.760 --> 24:35.560
There's a little harder, I know you did it and it can prove to you I know you did it.

24:35.560 --> 24:39.200
And then the hardest of all, I know you did it and it can prove to the world I know you

24:39.200 --> 24:40.200
did it.

24:40.200 --> 24:47.200
The United States succeeded at one, possibly we succeeded at two, but we failed at number

24:47.200 --> 24:49.840
three.

24:49.840 --> 24:53.520
Attribution based on secret evidence is untrusted.

24:53.520 --> 24:59.120
We all remember Iraq and weapons of mass destruction.

24:59.120 --> 25:07.760
And this problem only becomes worse as more of our attribution relies on secret evidence.

25:07.760 --> 25:13.800
We're going to announce who attacked, we're going to expect the world to support us in

25:13.800 --> 25:20.920
retaliatory action, and yet we won't be able to prove who did it.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.880
And this is going to be complicated.

25:23.880 --> 25:25.560
Hmm, complicated indeed.

25:25.560 --> 25:28.640
So sorry about the little crackly of the audio there, but that was just his feed coming into

25:28.640 --> 25:29.640
the con today.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.400
It wasn't anything we could do about that in the recording.

25:31.400 --> 25:32.400
But I thought it was really interesting.

25:32.400 --> 25:36.720
He says, essentially, one of the reasons we're doing attribution is because it kind of defers

25:36.720 --> 25:40.000
people from doing further attacks because they know we'll call them out.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
It's kind of interesting.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.720
Maybe that is why we call out China or call out...

25:42.720 --> 25:44.280
You can tell he's from the internet.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.280
Why is that?

25:45.280 --> 25:47.480
It's just that that's the recourse that you have on the internet, right?

25:47.480 --> 25:51.200
Just calling people out on things.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.200
Yeah.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.200
Trolling, I guess.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.200
Yeah.

25:54.200 --> 25:58.560
So Schneier went on for a little bit longer and talked more about the problem.

25:58.560 --> 26:02.680
And I'll see if there's any more clips you want to pull out of that.

26:02.680 --> 26:09.280
No, I want to talk a little bit about the differences between LinuxCon and a LinuxFest.

26:09.280 --> 26:13.120
And I think, trying to keep in mind, there's two different audiences for each.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.760
Do you want to describe what you think?

26:14.760 --> 26:19.040
So I tell you what, maybe you want to take the...

26:19.040 --> 26:20.480
Maybe you can take one and I'll take the other.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.460
So I'll come at it from the ultra-speed perspective.

26:23.460 --> 26:27.880
So I have attended LinuxCons for many, many years, probably going on, well, since 2009.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.740
So I've been there numerous times.

26:30.740 --> 26:38.680
And only in the past year, I have come from the eyes of the community member that's interested

26:38.680 --> 26:39.680
in the projects.

26:39.680 --> 26:43.480
Prior to that, I've always come to LinuxCon with the idea of I need to come back with

26:43.480 --> 26:46.480
ways, with solutions for my customers, and ways that I can make money.

26:46.480 --> 26:50.320
Because at the end of the day, while talking about the community and open source and software,

26:50.320 --> 26:51.320
that's all great.

26:51.320 --> 26:56.840
Somehow, I have to find ways to buy McDonald's and buy hotels to come out here and do stuff.

26:56.840 --> 27:00.360
I can't do that if I can't sell solutions.

27:00.360 --> 27:05.480
And so LinuxCon, and OSCON really, are both conferences that are really geared towards

27:05.480 --> 27:06.480
doing that.

27:06.480 --> 27:10.360
And I know that that kind of rubbed you the wrong way in some circumstances, in that this

27:10.360 --> 27:13.960
idea that everyone is selling something.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.320
And there is a difference there.

27:16.320 --> 27:19.540
And as a community member, as somebody who's just interested in seeing Linux and playing

27:19.540 --> 27:22.440
with Linux, it's really not that exciting.

27:22.440 --> 27:26.840
But for somebody who can take a solution back and say, you are selling a solution that's

27:26.840 --> 27:31.200
maybe $10,000 or $15,000, but I could put that into, I have four or five clients that

27:31.200 --> 27:35.600
we could implement that in, and then we could net a $50,000 profit to me.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.600
That's very valuable.

27:36.600 --> 27:41.720
What do you think about this as a high-level differentiator between the two?

27:41.720 --> 27:46.320
Linux Fest is where you go to meet the people who are creating the code.

27:46.320 --> 27:51.560
LinuxCon is where you go to meet the people who are selling the code, or OSCON.

27:51.560 --> 27:59.080
The only objection I have to that is there is a lot of development-focused sessions.

27:59.080 --> 28:02.640
If you look at the sessions, a lot of the people that are speaking here at LinuxCon

28:02.640 --> 28:06.280
are speaking as a developer and two other developers.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.280
So I don't know...

28:07.280 --> 28:08.280
It's a bit of a mix.

28:08.280 --> 28:11.400
You could also kind of tell, another way to tell is you can kind of tell by the attendance

28:11.400 --> 28:12.400
price.

28:12.400 --> 28:13.400
Yeah, yes, yes.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.400
Very good.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.280
So these are the ones that are a little more expensive, where generally they kind of probably

28:17.280 --> 28:20.360
are figuring maybe your department or your business is sending you.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.360
Picking it up, yeah.

28:21.360 --> 28:26.960
I guess I would change developer focus to you're meeting the people in the community

28:26.960 --> 28:29.720
versus you're meeting the people selling the products.

28:29.720 --> 28:32.960
I think that, I might twist it a little bit that way.

28:32.960 --> 28:36.480
And that's not to say that this isn't a good conference, or it isn't a pertinent conference

28:36.480 --> 28:37.480
or valuable conference.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.800
Oh, I think for some people it's extremely valuable.

28:39.800 --> 28:45.040
One of the conversations I've noticed a lot happening here is folks that don't quite understand

28:45.040 --> 28:48.280
everything that's involved in sort of switching their infrastructure over, and so they're

28:48.280 --> 28:49.280
coming here.

28:49.280 --> 28:53.320
And I overheard a couple of conversations, I forget the name, but it's one of the Docker

28:53.320 --> 28:56.160
container managements just right here on, it starts with a ranch or something like that,

28:56.160 --> 28:57.160
right here on the corner.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.160
Sure.

28:58.160 --> 29:02.120
And a couple of different gals were talking about how they're coming from some Microsoft

29:02.120 --> 29:05.080
mom management system and they're moving over to different systems and they don't really

29:05.080 --> 29:06.080
quite understand.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.560
There's the one gal, there's why this story even sticks out, it's because she called it

29:09.560 --> 29:12.760
the, I don't quite understand this whole open source trend and I just kind of thought, oh

29:12.760 --> 29:13.760
how cute.

29:13.760 --> 29:14.760
It's not a trend anymore, sorry.

29:14.760 --> 29:18.360
We have taken over the world, kind of.

29:18.360 --> 29:22.080
Yeah, you deploying a Windows machine would almost be a trend.

29:22.080 --> 29:25.760
So yeah, I thought that was particularly funny, is there are a lot of people here who are

29:25.760 --> 29:28.960
not necessarily totally plugged in to the community aspect, but they're more plugged

29:28.960 --> 29:30.440
into the utility aspect of it.

29:30.440 --> 29:34.720
And in their defense, there's nothing wrong with spending your money to come to a conference

29:34.720 --> 29:39.640
to learn how to make more money using a technology that, let's be frank, is actually very profitable.

29:39.640 --> 29:40.640
Yeah.

29:40.640 --> 29:41.640
There's nothing wrong with that.

29:41.640 --> 29:42.640
And good, secure, scalable.

29:42.640 --> 29:43.640
Right.

29:43.640 --> 29:48.800
It's just that it is a very different lens than you or I might take to get there.

29:48.800 --> 29:55.560
I think that's why we're having a little bit of a challenge keeping our get go up.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.720
Yeah, I don't know.

29:56.720 --> 29:57.720
Yeah, I suppose so.

29:57.720 --> 30:03.560
I think, yeah, well, I'm looking forward to, in the Linux action show, kind of putting

30:03.560 --> 30:06.440
it all together, the whole, like we want to really kind of try to capture the experience

30:06.440 --> 30:07.440
coming.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.440
I don't know how successful we'll be, but yeah, we're going to try to give you more

30:09.440 --> 30:13.400
of the, this, what you're getting right now is really, you know, we've been here for one

30:13.400 --> 30:14.400
day.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.400
This is our mid-game impression right now.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.600
We're only midway through the game.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.040
We still have the shirt contest tonight.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.760
We still have the booth crawl tonight.

30:20.760 --> 30:21.760
We still have the meetup.

30:21.760 --> 30:27.320
Yeah, the meetup, I think, is where the rubber is going to meet the road, because that is,

30:27.320 --> 30:31.200
I think, if there is anyone that's coming from the meetup that's been at LinuxCon, great.

30:31.200 --> 30:34.920
If they're not, just fine, yeah.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.480
But that is where we're going to hit that, that's where we're going to hit the community

30:37.480 --> 30:38.480
part of it.

30:38.480 --> 30:40.720
And I think that's where you and I kind of both have our passion.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.600
We both kind of shine, is in that space.

30:43.600 --> 30:48.240
And so, but nonetheless, what we're trying to do here, what we're trying to accomplish

30:48.240 --> 30:55.400
is we are trying to be that network that goes to these conferences.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.320
We bring all this equipment here, we set up and we stream, and give people that don't

30:58.320 --> 31:04.080
have the opportunity to be here an idea of what's here, and pick the best parts.

31:04.080 --> 31:07.680
I just realized something, too, that would be kind of fun, maybe, if you're not normally

31:07.680 --> 31:13.120
at these events, especially LinuxCon, more so than almost the other ones I've been to,

31:13.120 --> 31:18.200
because LinuxCon is a Linux Foundation event, so this is kind of like the official Linux

31:18.200 --> 31:19.200
event, right?

31:19.200 --> 31:20.200
Right.

31:20.200 --> 31:24.000
And so that brings out all of the open source journalists, for the most part.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.480
Like a lot of them are here, and a lot of people in the industry, like Mark Shuttleworth

31:28.480 --> 31:34.920
is here, the CoreOS guys are here, the Docker guys are here, SUSE guys are here, tons and

31:34.920 --> 31:36.760
tons of Red Hat people are here.

31:36.760 --> 31:40.600
And what's kind of neat is you get to meet people that have built things that you're

31:40.600 --> 31:45.380
familiar with, packages that you've installed, tools that have solved a problem for you.

31:45.380 --> 31:49.160
And these people are here, and in some ways, for some of us nerds, they're kind of celebrities

31:49.160 --> 31:50.160
in a sense.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.160
Yeah, very much so.

31:51.160 --> 31:54.600
And, you know, hey, that's that name I've seen on a blog post a thousand times, or their

31:54.600 --> 31:56.320
picture next to their post.

31:56.320 --> 32:01.420
And literally as we were going on air, we had a journalist stop by and take a selfie

32:01.420 --> 32:04.160
with me, because he and I have never actually seen each other in person, we've only seen

32:04.160 --> 32:06.640
each other online, and it's like, hey, good to see you.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.280
And so it's kind of neat, like when you're coming from the outside, you get to kind of

32:09.280 --> 32:13.600
see the people behind the scenes that work on a lot of this stuff at LinuxCon.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.840
Like even eventually, the rumor is Linus will be here at some point, he doesn't go to the

32:16.840 --> 32:19.720
other ones, because this is LinuxCon.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.800
Well, this is really ContainerCon, but this is LinuxCon.

32:21.800 --> 32:25.040
It might be a little more than a rumor, it might actually be on the schedule.

32:25.040 --> 32:28.400
I just don't, you know, until we have tape of it, I don't want to commit to it, but we're

32:28.400 --> 32:32.520
going to attempt to get tape of Linus Torvalds, I guess they said tape.

32:32.520 --> 32:37.920
Yeah, so, I don't know, NorthRanger says, I'm curious how it compares to LinuxCons from

32:37.920 --> 32:39.000
the first dot com bubble.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.080
Back then it was all venture capital, now it's real profits driving attendance.

32:42.080 --> 32:44.720
That's a really interesting observation, NorthRanger.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.040
It's smaller in scale?

32:46.040 --> 32:48.160
Yeah, they have been on the decline.

32:48.160 --> 32:52.040
So I guess, to me, this looks smaller than it was last year.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.920
I guess the attendance is up, though, from last year, which is a good sign.

32:54.920 --> 32:55.920
Yeah.

32:55.920 --> 33:01.240
Well, that is actually the interesting thing, is both last year, OSCON, oh, I'm sorry, Ohio

33:01.240 --> 33:06.800
and LinuxCon have scaled down, but their attendance has gone up, and the vendor participation

33:06.800 --> 33:07.880
has gone up.

33:07.880 --> 33:13.080
So the interest from the public and the vendors is going up, but the con organizers are scaling

33:13.080 --> 33:16.080
down, because I think cons in general, with a few exceptions, are scaling down.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.080
Yeah, I think so.

33:17.080 --> 33:21.720
And part of that is that you are able, that as people become more self-reliant and become

33:21.720 --> 33:27.000
more educated themselves, I think that they're able to find the information that a lot of

33:27.000 --> 33:31.360
people would have gotten at a conference, and then as the internet kind of exploded

33:31.360 --> 33:34.680
and things like blogs and wikis and forums have taken off.

33:34.680 --> 33:38.600
Sorry to interrupt you, the head of the Fedora project just walked by and gave us a wave.

33:38.600 --> 33:39.600
Yeah.

33:39.600 --> 33:40.600
So that's nice.

33:40.600 --> 33:44.120
I think that as that happens, people are able to get that information and they go, I don't

33:44.120 --> 33:46.120
need to spend that money to come out to the conference.

33:46.120 --> 33:51.760
And I got to tell you, speaking from my own wallets, I have always made money coming to

33:51.760 --> 33:52.760
LinuxCon.

33:52.760 --> 33:55.800
Coming to LinuxCon and taking those solutions home and reselling them, I have always come

33:55.800 --> 33:56.800
out ahead.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.680
You know, and the key point of that, and I've liked it a lot, is TechDog in the chatroom

33:58.680 --> 34:03.840
says I'm used to the kind of CES show, where most of what interests me turns out to be

34:03.840 --> 34:04.840
vaporware.

34:04.840 --> 34:08.680
But here, everything here is a shipping product that they're demoing.

34:08.680 --> 34:12.440
There might be a couple things that are about to ship, but 98% of everything here, if you

34:12.440 --> 34:16.720
get an introduction to it, if you get hands-on information and you get a name and a number,

34:16.720 --> 34:19.160
when you go home, you can call that person and they can ship it to you.

34:19.160 --> 34:20.160
That's true.

34:20.160 --> 34:23.200
But as far as the feel of the conference, very similar to CES.

34:23.200 --> 34:24.200
Have you ever been to CES?

34:24.200 --> 34:25.720
It's a very similar feeling conference.

34:25.720 --> 34:26.720
But yeah, that's true.

34:26.720 --> 34:31.400
I guess they don't show not released stuff yet for them.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.400
There's a couple of that, actually.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.400
Yeah.

34:33.400 --> 34:34.400
There's a couple of things here and there.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.480
And that's actually, though, but you don't really mind that.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.100
You like seeing the code before it's finalized.

34:39.100 --> 34:43.720
And so one of the things that was announced here that is pretty neat, in fact, before

34:43.720 --> 34:47.800
we go, I want to get a picture in front of it, is IBM's mainframe one.

34:47.800 --> 34:48.800
Oh, yeah.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.680
Making a big stink about that here at LinuxCon.

34:50.680 --> 34:55.400
And that, are we allowed to say that that's going to be coming out on last?

34:55.400 --> 34:59.280
So we have an interview with them and we have, that's probably the coolest video I think

34:59.280 --> 35:00.280
we've ever shot.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.280
Yeah.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.280
And that's going to be, we'll have that uploaded.

35:02.280 --> 35:03.280
In the Linux action show this weekend.

35:03.280 --> 35:05.400
Which right now, we tentatively are planning to do Friday at 3 p.m.

35:05.400 --> 35:08.480
But that might change, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

35:08.480 --> 35:14.160
So yeah, and the Canonical guys here announced, I don't know, I don't know if you know anything

35:14.160 --> 35:15.160
about that.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.160
Not to put you on the spot.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.160
I don't really know anything about it.

35:17.160 --> 35:18.480
But if you do, you're more than welcome to chime in.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.200
But Canonical announced that you'll be able to get Ubuntu.

35:21.200 --> 35:27.280
They are, yeah, they are shipping, they have just released Ubuntu 4, this IBM Z series

35:27.280 --> 35:28.280
mainframe.

35:28.280 --> 35:29.280
Of course, the SUSE guys are doing it too.

35:29.280 --> 35:30.280
And you know, but it's really neat.

35:30.280 --> 35:32.280
And Shuttleworth, Shuttleworth did a surprise.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.280
Go ahead, Pope.

35:33.280 --> 35:37.600
Giant, pretty black box with orange stripes down the side is all I know from the photos

35:37.600 --> 35:38.600
I'm seeing.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.600
Yeah.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.600
And Mark was there up on stage.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.280
He came up and surprised everybody during the announcement.

35:43.280 --> 35:44.280
So that was pretty neat.

35:44.280 --> 35:45.600
But we're not here to talk about HP.

35:45.600 --> 35:46.600
We're going to talk about IBM.

35:46.600 --> 35:47.600
We're going to talk about IBM and Linux Action.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.840
So why don't we talk about HP?

35:49.840 --> 35:50.840
You want to do this?

35:50.840 --> 35:51.840
Yeah.

35:51.840 --> 35:52.840
All right.

35:52.840 --> 35:55.820
So this next clip, Noah tells me, is super cool.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.400
It's one I've really wanted to get to for a long time.

35:57.400 --> 36:00.800
So last year, I think I can tell the story now because they've come out on camera and

36:00.800 --> 36:01.800
addressed it.

36:01.800 --> 36:04.600
But last year I was here and I was talking to a couple of the HP guys and I said, you

36:04.600 --> 36:08.840
know, I wish there were more big names that like actively supported Linux like inside

36:08.840 --> 36:12.640
like on the desktop, not just on servers, but actually running it.

36:12.640 --> 36:15.680
And the guy tells me, he goes, I run Linux on my laptop, my work laptop.

36:15.680 --> 36:16.680
This is an HP employee?

36:16.680 --> 36:17.680
Yeah.

36:17.680 --> 36:18.680
This is last year.

36:18.680 --> 36:19.680
And he goes, I run it on my laptop.

36:19.680 --> 36:20.760
And he looks over and he goes, her over there?

36:20.760 --> 36:21.760
She runs Linux.

36:21.760 --> 36:22.920
We've never even installed Windows.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.120
Our work laptops come this way.

36:24.120 --> 36:25.600
I said, well, how does the company treat you?

36:25.600 --> 36:26.680
All they treat us great.

36:26.680 --> 36:27.680
All the software supported.

36:27.680 --> 36:28.680
They support it.

36:28.680 --> 36:31.380
And he goes, and it just works out of the box.

36:31.380 --> 36:32.380
Everything works.

36:32.380 --> 36:34.640
And there's a big majority of us that are doing that.

36:34.640 --> 36:35.640
And I said, wow, that's really cool.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.120
Would you talk to me about it on camera?

36:37.120 --> 36:39.040
And he goes, no, I don't want to do that.

36:39.040 --> 36:41.120
So this year I came here and I walk up and same story.

36:41.120 --> 36:43.920
I started running into the HP employees and they're like, oh yeah, we all use Linux.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.440
I'm like, why won't anyone talk to me?

36:45.440 --> 36:48.940
And they're like, well, we know a guy who knows a guy and he's friends with this other

36:48.940 --> 36:51.720
guy who knows this guy who was trained to speak on camera.

36:51.720 --> 36:52.720
He'll be able to talk to you.

36:52.720 --> 36:53.720
And I'm like, does he work for HP?

36:53.720 --> 36:54.720
And they're like, yeah.

36:54.720 --> 36:55.720
And I'm like, does he use Linux on the desktop?

36:55.720 --> 36:56.720
Oh yeah.

36:56.720 --> 36:57.720
I'm like, find him.

36:57.720 --> 37:04.720
And they're looking all over the conference hall and this guy comes over and he goes,

37:04.720 --> 37:05.720
can I help you?

37:05.720 --> 37:06.720
And I'm like, do you run Linux on your desktop?

37:06.720 --> 37:07.720
And he goes, yes, I do.

37:07.720 --> 37:08.720
And I'm like, I have a camera.

37:08.720 --> 37:09.720
Stand right there.

37:09.720 --> 37:10.720
Yes, you can help me.

37:10.720 --> 37:11.720
All right.

37:11.720 --> 37:12.720
So we're going to play this interview.

37:12.720 --> 37:13.720
You know what?

37:13.720 --> 37:14.720
Before we play it, why don't I tell you about our last sponsor in the show today?

37:14.720 --> 37:15.720
That'll be Ting.

37:15.720 --> 37:16.720
And I want you to check them out because right now this whole show is running off of Ting

37:16.720 --> 37:17.720
and it's pretty awesome.

37:17.720 --> 37:21.040
We actually started on the event Wi-Fi, which is pretty solid during the setup and we thought

37:21.040 --> 37:26.240
we'd be okay with that because they're like a dog with a bone when it comes to finding

37:26.240 --> 37:27.960
rogue wireless signals around here.

37:27.960 --> 37:31.840
So we started on the event wireless and that was walking for a little bit, but I got to

37:31.840 --> 37:35.600
tell you, you go to linux.ting.com because at the end of the day we were so glad to have

37:35.600 --> 37:39.320
backup connectivity, linux.ting.com, Ting is mobile that makes sense.

37:39.320 --> 37:40.320
Look at the signal strength.

37:40.320 --> 37:41.320
Look at that.

37:41.320 --> 37:42.320
Full signal.

37:42.320 --> 37:43.320
Full bars.

37:43.320 --> 37:44.320
Yeah.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.320
Full bars of LTE.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.320
That's nice.

37:46.320 --> 37:47.320
Inside of here.

37:47.320 --> 37:48.320
And you can look around people dropping on and off.

37:48.320 --> 37:51.400
Well, we were, now the only thing we did a little clever is we positioned ourselves next

37:51.400 --> 37:52.400
to a gorgeous view.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.400
Yeah, that's true.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.400
So we have beautiful windows nearby.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.840
So that's helping, but that's just us being savvy.

37:56.840 --> 38:01.360
And so go to linux.ting.com, they'll take $25 off your first Ting device or $25 off

38:01.360 --> 38:03.820
your Ting account or credit wise.

38:03.820 --> 38:07.720
So you get $25 of service credit and then just like for me in my first month, that paid

38:07.720 --> 38:08.720
for it.

38:08.720 --> 38:13.000
It's wireless service with no contract and you only pay for what you use.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.460
It's a flat $6 for the line and there's just your usage on top of that and that's what

38:16.460 --> 38:17.460
you pay.

38:17.460 --> 38:20.240
They have CDMA and GSM, we're on CDMA right now, right?

38:20.240 --> 38:21.240
Actually we're on GSM.

38:21.240 --> 38:22.240
Oh, okay.

38:22.240 --> 38:26.200
We're on the GSM Ting network right now rocking that and you can too and you only pay for

38:26.200 --> 38:27.200
what you use.

38:27.200 --> 38:30.640
And what's great is when you need to use a lot of data, maybe one or two months out of

38:30.640 --> 38:32.080
the year you pay a little more.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.960
The rest of the year your bill's so low that it more than evens out.

38:34.960 --> 38:35.960
It's gorgeous.

38:35.960 --> 38:40.920
Linux.ting.com, go there and try out their savings calculator, plug in your actual usage,

38:40.920 --> 38:41.920
see how much you would save.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.960
I'm saving more than $2,000 in two years.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.900
I can buy a laptop.

38:45.900 --> 38:46.900
That's nuts.

38:46.900 --> 38:47.900
Of course I need a laptop more often than that.

38:47.900 --> 38:49.800
Actually my Bonobo was more than three years old.

38:49.800 --> 38:50.800
And still going strong.

38:50.800 --> 38:51.800
Yeah, so there you go.

38:51.800 --> 38:52.800
That's not so bad.

38:52.800 --> 38:53.800
Linux.ting.com.

38:53.800 --> 38:54.800
Try out the dashboard.

38:54.800 --> 38:55.800
Check out their blog.

38:55.800 --> 38:56.800
It's a great service.

38:56.800 --> 38:57.800
We're using them here at LinuxCon.

38:57.800 --> 39:02.240
We're broadcasting to our Mamba Room and to our IceCast server using Ting.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.240
Live LinuxCon coverage powered by Ting.

39:04.240 --> 39:08.140
It's great to have data in your pocket if you're in IT and they have great phones.

39:08.140 --> 39:12.280
Everything from super, super, super value phones for like under $60, you know, like

39:12.280 --> 39:18.240
feature phones, up to like the greatest hot rods like the S6, the Nexus 6, Moto X2, all

39:18.240 --> 39:20.240
that good stuff.

39:20.240 --> 39:21.240
Linux.ting.com.

39:21.240 --> 39:23.760
Noah, I'm going to play this interview you got from HP.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.880
I'm really looking forward to this because I haven't heard this yet.

39:25.880 --> 39:26.880
I've been waiting.

39:26.880 --> 39:27.880
So here we go.

39:27.880 --> 39:30.440
Here's Noah and HP.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.720
We're here with HP and with Keith.

39:32.720 --> 39:37.080
And I noticed that in the back here he has this big sign that says HP breathes open source.

39:37.080 --> 39:40.040
And as a fellow breather of open source I thought it might be interesting to stop and

39:40.040 --> 39:41.040
talk with Keith.

39:41.040 --> 39:44.640
So tell me Keith, anyone at HP use Linux?

39:44.640 --> 39:47.040
A few people, yeah.

39:47.040 --> 39:50.720
So I'm actually the architect for Linux on the machine.

39:50.720 --> 39:53.640
The machine's a new hardware project we're working on and the operating system we're

39:53.640 --> 39:58.120
developing that we're porting to that hardware is Linux.

39:58.120 --> 40:01.800
So we're doing kernel modifications, user space modifications for that new hardware

40:01.800 --> 40:03.080
project.

40:03.080 --> 40:06.800
We also support Debian Linux in our cloud offering.

40:06.800 --> 40:11.500
So our public and private cloud, HP Helion environment uses Debian natively.

40:11.500 --> 40:19.800
And we use Linux for all of our other server hardware runs Linux as well.

40:19.800 --> 40:23.960
How about people, how about customers that purchase your machines and want to go install

40:23.960 --> 40:24.960
Linux on them?

40:24.960 --> 40:26.760
Do you think that's going to be a smooth experience for them?

40:26.760 --> 40:28.280
Is that something that HP supports?

40:28.280 --> 40:32.880
Yes, we've supported Linux on our hardware for the last 15 or 20 years.

40:32.880 --> 40:36.900
And we've always tried to make it as seamless and easy process as possible.

40:36.900 --> 40:38.840
We provide Linux drivers.

40:38.840 --> 40:42.640
We work with the upstream projects to make sure that the Linux kernel and the Linux user

40:42.640 --> 40:45.200
space stuff works well on our hardware out of the box.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.200
Outstanding.

40:46.200 --> 40:50.200
Tell me a little bit about some projects that HP is either working on or projects that HP

40:50.200 --> 40:53.520
uses or projects that HP supports.

40:53.520 --> 40:57.300
So obviously we work at Linux kernel because we have hardware that needs to run on that.

40:57.300 --> 41:02.520
And then we also have a large investment in the OpenStack ecosystem with a huge number

41:02.520 --> 41:07.520
of contributors to major OpenStack pieces in the HP cloud environment.

41:07.520 --> 41:13.760
And then we also work on other networking NFV stuff, telco stuff, the whole gamut of

41:13.760 --> 41:14.760
enterprise computing.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.880
HP aside, what's your personal favorite distro?

41:17.880 --> 41:18.880
I run Debian.

41:18.880 --> 41:19.880
Oh, okay.

41:19.880 --> 41:21.300
And how long have you run Debian?

41:21.300 --> 41:23.480
I've run Debian for almost 20 years.

41:23.480 --> 41:24.480
Okay.

41:24.480 --> 41:30.000
And is that something that you find that it may, can you get your work work done on Debian?

41:30.000 --> 41:32.760
My business laptop runs Debian exclusively.

41:32.760 --> 41:34.240
Really?

41:34.240 --> 41:35.240
That's pretty impressive.

41:35.240 --> 41:36.880
And HP is pretty supportive of you doing that.

41:36.880 --> 41:37.880
Oddly, yes.

41:37.880 --> 41:40.980
Debian is a very important operating system to HP.

41:40.980 --> 41:45.000
And so they're very supportive of me running Debian as my daily work environment.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
That's outstanding.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.400
Well, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to us.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.400
We really appreciate it.

41:48.400 --> 41:49.400
Of course.

41:49.400 --> 41:50.400
Thank you very much as well.

41:50.400 --> 41:54.400
Oh, that was cool.

41:54.400 --> 41:55.400
That was pretty neat.

41:55.400 --> 41:58.800
So that last line there, Debian is very important to HP.

41:58.800 --> 41:59.800
Yeah.

41:59.800 --> 42:03.760
And I'm actually listening back.

42:03.760 --> 42:10.160
I wish it was culturally appropriate to set a camera up and then film all of the surrounding

42:10.160 --> 42:16.080
stuff because it leaves off, it leaves off some of the picture if you don't get the surrounding

42:16.080 --> 42:19.800
thing of like all the people that were standing there that were running Linux on their work

42:19.800 --> 42:24.040
computers as well, you know, and I don't know, I just want to lurk there and watch, show

42:24.040 --> 42:25.040
them.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.920
It doesn't quite paint the picture as well as it did it in person, but I guess you have

42:27.920 --> 42:28.920
to take my word for it.

42:28.920 --> 42:29.920
No, no.

42:29.920 --> 42:30.920
That's neat.

42:30.920 --> 42:33.700
I like to hear the passion there about in that too.

42:33.700 --> 42:34.700
I thought that was pretty cool.

42:34.700 --> 42:36.760
You know, one of the things that was pointed out to me and I haven't seen it anywhere yet

42:36.760 --> 42:41.640
on any of the brochures, but somebody mentioned to me in the hallway that LinuxCon is also

42:41.640 --> 42:42.640
offering childcare.

42:42.640 --> 42:43.640
Oh, no way.

42:43.640 --> 42:44.640
Yeah.

42:44.640 --> 42:45.640
Isn't that cool?

42:45.640 --> 42:46.640
Oh, that's awesome.

42:46.640 --> 42:49.240
And you know, when it's kind of an expensive conference, that's really a nice perk.

42:49.240 --> 42:55.680
It is, especially because I know firsthand couples that both work in the open source

42:55.680 --> 42:58.760
community and have kids and that is an issue for them.

42:58.760 --> 42:59.760
Yeah.

42:59.760 --> 43:00.760
That's really nice.

43:00.760 --> 43:04.240
And they, for a lot of folks, not all folks, but for a lot of folks, they've provided lunch.

43:04.240 --> 43:06.280
You know, they treat the media exceptionally well here.

43:06.280 --> 43:07.280
Yeah.

43:07.280 --> 43:08.280
We have.

43:08.280 --> 43:09.280
Yeah.

43:09.280 --> 43:10.600
So that actually, a shout out to Dan Brown has been outstanding.

43:10.600 --> 43:17.320
I mean, every little thing I have, I just, my email to Dan is like my lifeline for our

43:17.320 --> 43:19.840
lifeline really to get things done here.

43:19.840 --> 43:24.280
You know, when we need permission for something or when we needed them to make a couple exceptions

43:24.280 --> 43:26.520
for us and a couple of rules, just everything is that guy's animation.

43:26.520 --> 43:29.800
Or even when it was just a sandwich, you know, Andrew's able to grab me a sandwich that they're

43:29.800 --> 43:33.080
giving out to the media folks and they provide a media lounge, which isn't too uncommon,

43:33.080 --> 43:34.080
but still really nice.

43:34.080 --> 43:35.080
Yeah.

43:35.080 --> 43:38.880
And I think that everyone at LinuxCon has done exceptionally well.

43:38.880 --> 43:40.840
And you can actually tell it's a really polished conference.

43:40.840 --> 43:45.640
If you look at the way that they have the keynote hall set up, right?

43:45.640 --> 43:46.640
Yeah.

43:46.640 --> 43:50.120
They take the time to put all of the par and all of the DMX, by the way.

43:50.120 --> 43:55.120
So I have a lot of sympathy for the poor guy who had to set all those up and channel them.

43:55.120 --> 43:59.000
But you know, they put the little extra pizzazz to make it, you really do get your money's

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
worth coming out here.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Yeah.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
And they got display screens up everywhere.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.200
I mean, it feels like a high value production.

44:03.200 --> 44:04.200
Yeah.

44:04.200 --> 44:07.080
They do a really good job.

44:07.080 --> 44:12.360
With that, there is the highly sponsored angle.

44:12.360 --> 44:18.240
So the companies that sponsor, they get placed in an area called, let's see, where is it

44:18.240 --> 44:19.240
right here?

44:19.240 --> 44:23.840
It has a name that's essentially like the sponsor ballroom or something like that.

44:23.840 --> 44:25.760
And if you, yeah, here we go.

44:25.760 --> 44:26.760
Let's see.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.960
Sponsor ballroom, which is harder to find than everyone else.

44:28.960 --> 44:29.960
Yeah.

44:29.960 --> 44:34.880
But if you're a sponsor, you get like really fancy placement, which I guess that's fair.

44:34.880 --> 44:35.880
I don't like.

44:35.880 --> 44:37.840
Because the difference is stark.

44:37.840 --> 44:43.460
It's like the sponsors go in a brightly lit room that looks the nicest room.

44:43.460 --> 44:46.460
And then everybody that's in exhibit that wasn't a sponsor is like out in the hallways

44:46.460 --> 44:48.280
and kind of in the peripheral.

44:48.280 --> 44:53.680
As a business owner, I have no problem with them treating the people who make it financially

44:53.680 --> 44:57.480
possible to do a conference like this, treating them, giving them a little extra treatment.

44:57.480 --> 44:58.480
That's perfectly fine.

44:58.480 --> 45:03.720
But what I object to is the fact that it is so much more difficult to find that room than

45:03.720 --> 45:06.880
what we originally thought was the expo hall.

45:06.880 --> 45:12.040
If you're going to have an overflow of the expo hall, have it somewhere else where-

45:12.040 --> 45:13.560
It's not the first thing you walk into.

45:13.560 --> 45:14.560
Right.

45:14.560 --> 45:15.560
Exactly.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.680
And have it maybe in a room that is maybe a little bit more difficult to get to than

45:17.680 --> 45:20.160
the people that are paying the money to be there.

45:20.160 --> 45:22.280
And that's a personal preference.

45:22.280 --> 45:26.780
I'm sure that the fine people at the Linux Foundation had a very good reason for organizing

45:26.780 --> 45:29.280
it that way, and they spent a lot more time planning this stuff and thinking about it

45:29.280 --> 45:30.280
than we do for certain.

45:30.280 --> 45:31.280
Yeah.

45:31.280 --> 45:32.280
And it is nice.

45:32.280 --> 45:33.280
But it didn't make a lot of sense to me.

45:33.280 --> 45:35.400
They have a giant hacking lounge, which is kind of cool, and they have a Birds of Feathers

45:35.400 --> 45:36.800
signup lounge.

45:36.800 --> 45:40.880
So the sponsor area is done really well, and Microsoft has a decent booth there.

45:40.880 --> 45:42.840
So does IBM and HP.

45:42.840 --> 45:47.560
And I'd say one of the nicest booths here, too, is the SUSE booth.

45:47.560 --> 45:49.880
I really like the SUSE booth because they have green apples out.

45:49.880 --> 45:52.440
They have green snacks and stuff, so that was really neat.

45:52.440 --> 45:54.760
And the Red Hat guys are handing out red hats for certain folks.

45:54.760 --> 45:55.760
That was pretty cool.

45:55.760 --> 45:56.760
Yeah.

45:56.760 --> 45:57.760
And I think you stopped by that, didn't you?

45:57.760 --> 45:58.760
Yeah, I did.

45:58.760 --> 45:59.760
I got a chance to talk to them.

45:59.760 --> 46:00.760
But don't spoil it.

46:00.760 --> 46:01.760
That's coming on Sunday.

46:01.760 --> 46:02.760
Oh, that'll be on last, too?

46:02.760 --> 46:03.760
Yeah.

46:03.760 --> 46:04.760
Yeah, that'll be on Friday.

46:04.760 --> 46:05.760
Man, we've got a big Linux action show coming up.

46:05.760 --> 46:08.960
This is the last chance as we wrap up here, chat room or mumble room, if you guys have

46:08.960 --> 46:10.560
any questions from LinuxCon.

46:10.560 --> 46:11.560
Hey, Ange.

46:11.560 --> 46:12.560
Ange.

46:12.560 --> 46:13.560
Yeah?

46:13.560 --> 46:18.640
Why don't you come over here and give the people a quick five-second, your impressions

46:18.640 --> 46:19.640
of LinuxCon.

46:19.640 --> 46:21.440
What did you think of those since you've been here today?

46:21.440 --> 46:23.340
What do you think of it so far?

46:23.340 --> 46:24.340
It's pretty cool.

46:24.340 --> 46:25.340
I love seeing JB shirts.

46:25.340 --> 46:26.840
I've seen a couple.

46:26.840 --> 46:30.760
I've seen a couple of people that we saw at LinuxFest Northwest, and I'm already angling

46:30.760 --> 46:34.840
for a booth at another con or fest or whatever.

46:34.840 --> 46:41.760
Yeah, it's definitely, I say a lot of suits, but there aren't a lot of suits, but it feels

46:41.760 --> 46:42.760
that way.

46:42.760 --> 46:43.760
It's very business-y.

46:43.760 --> 46:44.760
Yeah.

46:44.760 --> 46:45.760
Yeah.

46:45.760 --> 46:48.680
All right, Mr. WW, you had a question about the con in the mumble room.

46:48.680 --> 46:50.080
Go ahead, sir.

46:50.080 --> 46:55.760
So have you come to a conclusion yet what the cons or pros are of going to LinuxCon

46:55.760 --> 47:00.600
versus going to like a fest where it's more casual, or do you think you'll have to?

47:00.600 --> 47:01.600
It kind of goes back to our answer.

47:01.600 --> 47:06.640
It's like if you want to kind of rub elbows with more community aspect, people that are

47:06.640 --> 47:10.600
more writing the code and thinking about the code and thinking about community and standards

47:10.600 --> 47:14.080
and collaboration, then you kind of want to go to a fest.

47:14.080 --> 47:18.880
If you want to meet the people that are creating solutions and selling the code and that maybe

47:18.880 --> 47:21.280
you're going to solve a problem you have at work, then you might want to go to a con.

47:21.280 --> 47:23.000
Not that Fest doesn't have that stuff too.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
I would just ask, what are you going to get out of it?

47:26.000 --> 47:31.320
Do you want to talk about your passion for Linux or do you want to sell Linux?

47:31.320 --> 47:35.240
That's a little black and white, but that's kind of what it comes down to.

47:35.240 --> 47:39.280
If you have to make a decision about a flight and a hotel and the tickets, then you need

47:39.280 --> 47:40.280
to know that.

47:40.280 --> 47:41.280
Yeah.

47:41.280 --> 47:44.560
I guess I say that because that's the metric that I've used.

47:44.560 --> 47:48.420
I would never go to a... I mean, being honest here, I would never go to a fest and expect

47:48.420 --> 47:51.480
to come back with profitable material for my business.

47:51.480 --> 47:59.360
I would never go to a con without expecting to be able to make a profit on it, and transversely,

47:59.360 --> 48:02.800
I would never go to a fest and not expect to build some relationship, but I would be

48:02.800 --> 48:08.040
perfectly okay with going to a con and coming back with nothing more than a business sense,

48:08.040 --> 48:11.520
even if we didn't have a community bonding.

48:11.520 --> 48:14.220
There is no going out to the range and shooting here.

48:14.220 --> 48:20.280
There is no going out for burgers and stuff unless you range it privately, as opposed

48:20.280 --> 48:21.280
to...

48:21.280 --> 48:22.280
What do you think of North Ranger?

48:22.280 --> 48:24.480
He says, maybe it's a mullet.

48:24.480 --> 48:27.120
It's a mullet of gatherings, business in the front, party in the back.

48:27.120 --> 48:28.120
That's not bad.

48:28.120 --> 48:29.120
That's not bad.

48:29.120 --> 48:30.120
I like that.

48:30.120 --> 48:31.120
Okay, that's a good...

48:31.120 --> 48:32.120
We can go with that.

48:32.120 --> 48:34.360
All right, so Linux Unplugged is live on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv.

48:34.360 --> 48:35.360
We do the show at 2 p.m. Pacific.

48:35.360 --> 48:39.640
You can go to cheaperbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local

48:39.640 --> 48:40.640
time zone.

48:40.640 --> 48:43.540
We'd love to have you join us live in our virtual lug in our mumble room.

48:43.540 --> 48:47.280
You bang mumble in our IRC chat room, and you can go to cheaperbroadcasting.com slash

48:47.280 --> 48:52.000
contact to send us an email, or if you'd like to get content or discussions or any kind

48:52.000 --> 48:56.480
of feedback or topic generation like that, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

48:56.480 --> 48:59.720
Noah, is there anywhere you'd like to send people throughout the week?

48:59.720 --> 49:03.400
Yeah, I'd send them to ultispeed, ultispeed.com.

49:03.400 --> 49:07.320
We are continuing to work on expanding the ability to do remote support.

49:07.320 --> 49:13.000
We just finalized the final in-production test of doing cloud-based Wi-Fi.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.620
We now have the ability, yeah, we now actually have the ability, and this hasn't actually

49:16.620 --> 49:19.920
gone out to the website, and we haven't sent flyers and product literature and stuff, but

49:19.920 --> 49:24.700
we actually now have the ability, if you have a property and you want Wi-Fi on that property,

49:24.700 --> 49:29.500
we can actually ship you an entire box of stuff, and you plug the cables in, and we

49:29.500 --> 49:30.500
take it from there.

49:30.500 --> 49:31.500
Wow.

49:31.500 --> 49:32.500
And we manage the whole thing remotely.

49:32.500 --> 49:33.500
Ultispeed.com?

49:33.500 --> 49:34.500
Yeah, ultispeed.com.

49:34.500 --> 49:36.120
We rolled that out at a hotel in Mankato, Minnesota.

49:36.120 --> 49:38.240
There was actually a guy on Twitter that was asking where he could stay where we had

49:38.240 --> 49:39.240
managed the Wi-Fi.

49:39.240 --> 49:40.240
It was a quality in Mankato.

49:40.240 --> 49:43.760
That's our first place that we've rolled that system out, and so far, it's been 100%.

49:43.760 --> 49:44.760
So cool.

49:44.760 --> 49:45.760
All right, everybody.

49:45.760 --> 49:47.560
Well, thank you so much for tuning in to this episode of Linux Unplugged, and we'll see

49:47.560 --> 50:14.560
you right back here next week.

50:17.560 --> 50:36.160
Hey, Noah, I have a question for you.

50:36.160 --> 50:37.160
All right.

50:37.160 --> 50:38.160
I have an answer for you.

50:38.160 --> 50:40.080
Hey, wouldn't it be cool if your question and my answer match up?

50:40.080 --> 50:43.320
Could we have done this whole transmission over SIP back to the-

50:43.320 --> 50:44.320
Yes.

50:44.320 --> 50:45.320
Yes, we could have.

50:45.320 --> 50:46.320
So why didn't we just use SIP?

50:46.320 --> 50:51.800
Well, I have never tried a SIP call that long to know if, A, the quality would be sufficient,

50:51.800 --> 50:56.880
although I suspect it would, but my big concern is I don't know if the... SIP is very, very

50:56.880 --> 51:02.440
finicky if you actually lose internet because it has to re-register with the server, and

51:02.440 --> 51:08.680
then we'd have to reinitiate the call, and we'd have to try a test call for an hour before

51:08.680 --> 51:12.600
I would really feel comfortable saying try it, although I suppose technically it's no

51:12.600 --> 51:13.600
worse than Skype.

51:13.600 --> 51:14.600
Skype has to...

51:14.600 --> 51:15.600
Hey, Noah.

51:15.600 --> 51:22.280
I do SIP calls to conference calls all the time for very long periods, like two, three

51:22.280 --> 51:27.400
hours at a time, and on my home Wi-Fi, it never drops off just to be able to call SIP

51:27.400 --> 51:28.400
client.

51:28.400 --> 51:29.400
Really?

51:29.400 --> 51:30.400
Well, obviously, you're on conference Wi-Fi.

51:30.400 --> 51:31.400
It might be a bit tricky.

51:31.400 --> 51:32.400
Yeah, we're not actually.

51:32.400 --> 51:34.840
We've provided our own, and our internet's actually pretty strong, so I'll have to give

51:34.840 --> 51:35.840
that a shot.

51:35.840 --> 51:38.880
Now, Popey, did you modify the codex at all, or are you just using the default ones, whatever

51:38.880 --> 51:40.880
comes set with the SIP client?

51:40.880 --> 51:43.880
I was just using the default that was on Android.

51:43.880 --> 51:47.600
I'm connecting to an asterisk server in the office.

51:47.600 --> 51:48.600
Oh, my gosh.

51:48.600 --> 51:50.020
You're doing it over Android?

51:50.020 --> 51:51.020
So we could...

51:51.020 --> 51:52.020
Yeah, that's fine.

51:52.020 --> 51:53.020
So we just bring a little interface?

51:53.020 --> 51:55.000
Oh, my gosh, dude.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
How cool would that be?

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
All this can go away.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
We just plug into...

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
Yeah, it'll work.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
What could go wrong?

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
What could go wrong?

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
Run the whole show on Android.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
I don't think anything could go wrong.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
No, it'll be fine.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
That'll be fine.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
It should be nice.

52:06.000 --> 52:10.960
Actually, and the app has local recording as well, so it can just record the whole conversation.

52:10.960 --> 52:14.560
I use it when we're having internal calls, and we call them and then make them available

52:14.560 --> 52:15.560
for other people.

52:15.560 --> 52:16.560
That's a good idea.

52:16.560 --> 52:17.560
All right, so we've got to pick our title.

52:17.560 --> 52:18.800
We've got to go to JBtitles.com and pick this thing.

52:18.800 --> 52:19.800
Hey, I suggested a title.

52:19.800 --> 52:20.800
You did?

52:20.800 --> 52:21.800
Yeah.

52:21.800 --> 52:22.800
For once in my life.

52:22.800 --> 52:23.800
How was it?

52:23.800 --> 52:24.800
I don't know.

52:24.800 --> 52:25.800
I don't remember what it was.

52:25.800 --> 52:26.800
Do you want to vote?

52:26.800 --> 52:27.800
JBtitles.com.

52:27.800 --> 52:28.800
Yeah, sure.

52:28.800 --> 52:29.800
Sure.

52:29.800 --> 52:30.800
Sure.

52:30.800 --> 52:31.800
Why not?

52:31.800 --> 52:32.800
Sure.

52:32.800 --> 52:33.800
Oh, I went to JBlive.tv.

52:33.800 --> 52:34.800
Oh, how come I have no JBtitles.com?

52:34.800 --> 52:35.800
I don't know.

52:35.800 --> 52:36.800
Why don't you?

52:36.800 --> 52:37.800
Oh, I don't either.

52:37.800 --> 52:38.800
Oh, here it goes.

52:38.800 --> 52:39.800
Now it's going.

52:39.800 --> 52:40.800
Connecting the Docs.

52:40.800 --> 52:41.800
That's kind of funny.

52:41.800 --> 52:42.800
Oh, yeah.

52:42.800 --> 52:43.800
Connecting the Docs.

52:43.800 --> 52:44.800
That actually is.

52:44.800 --> 52:45.800
That kind of works.

52:45.800 --> 52:46.800
That kind of works.

52:46.800 --> 52:47.800
Containing LinuxCon 2015.

52:47.800 --> 52:49.800
That's not bad.

52:49.800 --> 52:50.800
LinuxCon 2015.

52:50.800 --> 52:51.800
Molot Party.

52:51.800 --> 52:52.800
That's not bad either.

52:52.800 --> 52:53.800
There goes Greg KH.

52:53.800 --> 52:54.800
All right.

52:54.800 --> 52:55.800
I have voted for...

52:55.800 --> 52:56.800
Colonel Maintainer Extraordinaire.

52:56.800 --> 52:57.800
Absolution of Attribution.

52:57.800 --> 52:58.800
Hobnobbing with the celebrities.

52:58.800 --> 52:59.800
Look at us.

52:59.800 --> 53:00.800
Yeah, yeah.

53:00.800 --> 53:01.800
Hobnobbing.

53:01.800 --> 53:02.800
That must be...

53:02.800 --> 53:03.800
That must be a...

53:03.800 --> 53:04.800
That must be a...

53:04.800 --> 53:05.800
I've heard of Hobnobbing before.

53:05.800 --> 53:06.800
Oh, really?

53:06.800 --> 53:07.800
Oh, yeah.

53:07.800 --> 53:08.800
Totally.

53:08.800 --> 53:09.800
All right.

53:09.800 --> 53:10.800
I'm trying to educate, man.

53:10.800 --> 53:14.800
Has Popey told you about his new snack that he really likes?

53:14.800 --> 53:15.800
Haggis.

53:15.800 --> 53:16.800
What?

53:16.800 --> 53:17.800
Haggis.

53:17.800 --> 53:18.800
What's Haggis?

53:18.800 --> 53:19.800
Am I pronouncing that right?

53:19.800 --> 53:20.800
That's delicious.

53:20.800 --> 53:21.800
Yes, it is.

53:21.800 --> 53:22.800
Tell them what it is, though.

53:22.800 --> 53:23.800
It's awful.

53:23.800 --> 53:24.800
Mixed with oats and spices.

53:24.800 --> 53:25.800
It's awful.

53:25.800 --> 53:26.800
So it's like a breakfast?

53:26.800 --> 53:27.800
Boiled.

53:27.800 --> 53:28.800
Yeah, you often have a slice of it fried with breakfast.

53:28.800 --> 53:29.800
Fried?

53:29.800 --> 53:30.800
If you have like a full English breakfast, you'd have like a...

53:30.800 --> 53:43.640
Sausage, bacon, eggs, beans, and all that, and black pudding, I'm thinking of black pudding,

53:43.640 --> 53:45.640
but black pudding and, yeah, Haggis, very similar.

53:45.640 --> 53:50.080
But no, you'd normally have Haggis with potatoes and vegetables.

53:50.080 --> 53:51.980
It's lovely.

53:51.980 --> 53:53.440
It's like stomach and kidneys and stuff.

53:53.440 --> 53:54.440
What are you fried in?

53:54.440 --> 53:55.440
Like what kind of grease or oils?

53:55.440 --> 53:56.440
I don't know.

53:56.440 --> 53:57.440
Sorry, I was confusing.

53:57.440 --> 53:58.440
Oh, that was black pudding you fried.

53:58.440 --> 53:59.440
Got you.

53:59.440 --> 54:00.920
Yeah, but Haggis comes in like a bag.

54:00.920 --> 54:02.920
It used to be like sheep stomach, but now it's like a bag.

54:02.920 --> 54:03.920
A bag.

54:03.920 --> 54:04.920
Sheep stomach, yeah.

54:04.920 --> 54:05.920
And you boil it.

54:05.920 --> 54:06.920
Yeah.

54:06.920 --> 54:07.920
Boil sheep stomach.

54:07.920 --> 54:08.920
Come on.

54:08.920 --> 54:09.920
Come on.

54:09.920 --> 54:10.920
Let's not.

54:10.920 --> 54:11.920
It's delicious, man.

54:11.920 --> 54:12.920
Delicious, see?

54:12.920 --> 54:13.920
Yeah.

54:13.920 --> 54:14.920
Yeah.

54:14.920 --> 54:15.920
My wife won't eat it.

54:15.920 --> 54:16.920
She won't go anywhere near it.

54:16.920 --> 54:17.920
What's it smell like?

54:17.920 --> 54:18.920
You married up.

54:18.920 --> 54:19.920
When she goes out, it smells delicious.

54:19.920 --> 54:20.920
It smells like a bag of offal boiled.

54:20.920 --> 54:21.920
What else is it going to smell like?

54:21.920 --> 54:22.920
You married up, my friend.

54:22.920 --> 54:25.560
Do you put any sauce on it, or you just eat it as is?

54:25.560 --> 54:31.200
Actually, I had it the other night with some sriracha on it, which was even better, because

54:31.200 --> 54:32.800
sriracha makes everything better.

54:32.800 --> 54:33.800
Sriracha does.

54:33.800 --> 54:35.280
You know what Rekai put sriracha on?

54:35.280 --> 54:36.280
Pizza.

54:36.280 --> 54:37.280
Sure, yeah.

54:37.280 --> 54:38.280
Sure, yeah.

54:38.280 --> 54:39.280
Totally ordered pizza with sriracha.

54:39.280 --> 54:40.280
It was really good, actually.

54:40.280 --> 54:41.280
Yeah, yeah.

54:41.280 --> 54:42.280
No, I've seen that.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.280
That's a thing.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.280
That's good.

54:44.280 --> 54:45.280
But can you barbecue a Haggis?

54:45.280 --> 54:46.280
Oh, stop it.

54:46.280 --> 54:47.280
Damn it.

54:47.280 --> 54:48.280
If you dig a pit.

54:48.280 --> 54:49.280
If you dig a pit.

54:49.280 --> 54:50.280
If you dig a pit.

54:50.280 --> 54:51.280
Connecting the docks containing LinuxCon 2015 are my favorite.

54:51.280 --> 54:52.280
Connecting the docks is good.

54:52.280 --> 54:54.440
There is a vegetarian Haggis, by the way.

54:54.440 --> 54:57.640
Connecting the docks is good, but containing LinuxCon suggests LinuxCon.

54:57.640 --> 54:59.200
I think actually connecting the docks is good.

54:59.200 --> 55:00.200
Yeah.

55:00.200 --> 55:03.900
If you're going to have containing, it should be can't contain LinuxCon.

55:03.900 --> 55:04.900
Containing LinuxCon 2015.

55:04.900 --> 55:05.900
Can't contain.

55:05.900 --> 55:06.900
You can't contain LinuxCon.

55:06.900 --> 55:09.400
I don't know if you get it.

55:09.400 --> 55:10.400
You don't get it.

55:10.400 --> 55:11.400
I think connecting the docks is better.

55:11.400 --> 55:13.600
If you don't watch the episode, you don't get it.

55:13.600 --> 55:15.400
So I think I like connecting the docks better.

55:15.400 --> 55:17.980
All right, NorthRanger, you win, sir.

55:17.980 --> 55:18.980
You win.

55:18.980 --> 55:19.980
What was yours, ColonelLinux?

55:19.980 --> 55:20.980
Can't contain LinuxCon?

55:20.980 --> 55:21.980
Ah, I see.

55:21.980 --> 55:22.980
See?

55:22.980 --> 55:23.980
Get it?

55:23.980 --> 55:24.980
I got that.

55:24.980 --> 55:27.480
So, Mumbo, were you able to hear the clips okay?

55:27.480 --> 55:28.480
Yeah.

55:28.480 --> 55:29.480
Yeah.

55:29.480 --> 55:30.480
Yeah.

55:30.480 --> 55:31.480
It's a little hokey.

55:31.480 --> 55:32.480
Hey.

55:32.480 --> 55:33.480
But every time we get it, we learn.

55:33.480 --> 55:35.480
So, thanks for making it, you guys.

55:35.480 --> 55:36.480
I love your faces.

55:36.480 --> 55:37.480
Welcome.

55:37.480 --> 55:40.080
We actually didn't even remember you guys until this morning.

55:40.080 --> 55:41.080
That's not true at all.

55:41.080 --> 55:42.080
Chris remembered you.

55:42.080 --> 55:43.080
Oh.

55:43.080 --> 55:44.080
Well, Noah didn't.

55:44.080 --> 55:47.120
And so since I was planning equipment, I was still figuring out how I was going to do

55:47.120 --> 55:48.120
this morning.

55:48.120 --> 55:49.120
That's true.

55:49.120 --> 55:50.120
That part is kind of true.

55:50.120 --> 55:51.120
All right, you guys.

55:51.120 --> 55:52.120
What?

55:52.120 --> 55:54.400
We're going to expect some flowers and then we'll be fine.

55:54.400 --> 55:55.400
Okay.

55:55.400 --> 55:56.400
All right.

55:56.400 --> 55:57.400
I can do that.

55:57.400 --> 55:58.400
Flowers and Haggis.

55:58.400 --> 55:59.400
What about chocolates?

55:59.400 --> 56:00.400
And Haggis.

56:00.400 --> 56:01.400
Oh, and Haggis.

56:01.400 --> 56:02.400
Yeah.

56:02.400 --> 56:03.400
Poppy can supply the Haggis.

56:03.400 --> 56:04.400
All right.

56:04.400 --> 56:05.400
Question on Bruce's talk.

56:05.400 --> 56:08.400
Will they have a full link to that somewhere?

56:08.400 --> 56:09.400
I think so.

56:09.400 --> 56:10.400
Yeah.

56:10.400 --> 56:11.400
Yeah.

56:11.400 --> 56:12.400
Yes.

56:12.400 --> 56:13.400
Yes, they will.

56:13.400 --> 56:14.400
They will publish it.

56:14.400 --> 56:15.560
They send it off to their media guys and then they send it out to Mount Kilimanjaro where

56:15.560 --> 56:19.680
monkeys chew on it for a while and then spit it back out and then a hiker brings it back

56:19.680 --> 56:22.520
down from Mount Kilimanjaro and they publish it and that takes a couple of weeks.

56:22.520 --> 56:23.520
I believe that's how it works.

56:23.520 --> 56:50.440
It's a big mountain, you know?
