WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
have you guys I think we talked about this like a really long time ago the the

00:04.400 --> 00:09.280
sole laptop the solar-powered laptop well now we're getting we're getting

00:09.280 --> 00:13.920
prices 495 Canadian I don't know what that is in real actual money but in

00:13.920 --> 00:17.120
Canadian money it's something now remember this is the one where the box

00:17.120 --> 00:23.280
yeah where the back folds down and the and the panels come out and then it

00:23.280 --> 00:27.640
charges it runs Ubuntu and I haven't looked at the specs yet I was saving for

00:27.640 --> 00:30.400
the show so let me find it right here see if I can oh yeah specs here we go

00:30.400 --> 00:36.640
all right so it's it comes with Ubuntu 1404 or you can get with Windows 7 it

00:36.640 --> 00:42.760
has an Intel Atom 1.8 gigahertz dual core processor 2 gigs of RAM 320 gigabyte

00:42.760 --> 00:49.240
SATA hard drive yeah it's got an Atom so I don't know but it's solar-powered

00:49.240 --> 00:53.720
that's kind of cool right would you buy one Eric if you had the if you had the

00:53.720 --> 00:58.360
cash dude if I had the cash I'd be all over that just because it's a

00:58.360 --> 01:05.280
recognized laptop I wouldn't have to worry about my kid you know and then I

01:05.280 --> 01:09.200
could take it places like into the back woods you know take pictures I'm sorry

01:09.200 --> 01:14.840
what oh I got you I was I was losing you there for a minute hey Colonel Linux

01:14.840 --> 01:18.720
could this be the ultimate travelers laptop never have to look for a charging

01:18.720 --> 01:25.640
board at the airport again he says no no because you have to sorry yeah yeah no I

01:25.640 --> 01:30.360
well here's the thing right so as far as a traveling laptop I think it would be

01:30.360 --> 01:35.240
hard to charge it it would have to be able to actually get to Sun to get it to

01:35.240 --> 01:39.560
charge right man get a window seat

01:39.560 --> 01:47.120
so it's not like you're stuck with just solar power boring all right what about

01:47.120 --> 01:54.320
okay okay where are the specifications when we so slow it's painful it's got a

01:54.320 --> 01:59.040
that's well I mean I don't know 1.8 gigahertz isn't that bad dual core that's

01:59.040 --> 02:03.800
not I'm not talking about the technical specifications of the computer rather

02:03.800 --> 02:13.000
than the power intake and solar size and generate well frankly I've seen some

02:13.000 --> 02:18.760
really significantly large solar panels through what I do with work and they

02:18.760 --> 02:26.480
generate tiny little sips of amperes that barely power an electric biro so

02:26.480 --> 02:30.720
I'd be amazed if this thing can actually charge and power a laptop for any

02:30.720 --> 02:34.840
significant time whatsoever yeah okay that's a good point I mean

02:34.840 --> 02:37.880
that could be a major issue is how long it takes to charge I noticed they're not

02:37.880 --> 02:43.120
actually throwing that out on the pages I'm looking no I can't find that is the

02:43.120 --> 02:49.400
most important specification item for a laptop of this kind and I don't see it

02:49.400 --> 02:54.200
readily available hmm hmm boy look at you just dumping cold water on this like

02:54.200 --> 02:58.120
sorry sorry well the thing is is that I've got customers that would really

02:58.120 --> 03:03.440
like to use an equipment like this because they operate aircraft for in

03:03.440 --> 03:07.240
sort of pseudo military environment so for the United Nations and stuff like

03:07.240 --> 03:12.480
that and they upload their flight data over satellite phones so they would love

03:12.480 --> 03:17.040
a computer like this that they can open in the middle of Africa or Afghanistan

03:17.040 --> 03:24.320
where Sun is available almost all the time mm-hmm and yeah that bit of

03:24.320 --> 03:29.800
information isn't on here boy that is an interesting catch and of course one that

03:29.800 --> 03:34.480
once you think about it is sort of the critical piece of information I thought

03:34.480 --> 03:47.000
when we first heard about this it was gonna be an arm machine to the second

03:47.000 --> 03:52.160
issue I have with it with your live as far north as I do half the edits

03:52.160 --> 03:58.560
completely useless oh I don't know I'm an optimist Eric I like to believe it's

03:58.560 --> 04:06.600
funny I guess I don't know I like to think it's nicer in the Pacific

04:06.600 --> 04:11.360
Northwest than everybody thinks it is like I don't know I I find all these

04:11.360 --> 04:14.920
things to be supplemental what I really want is I'm waiting for the day when

04:14.920 --> 04:18.400
they can integrate a solar panel behind the LCD screen of my smartphone and then

04:18.400 --> 04:21.680
when I just have my smartphone down on the table or on my dash it's secretly

04:21.680 --> 04:25.760
like you know trickle charging it's absorbing the yellow Sun like Superman

04:25.760 --> 04:31.560
that's that's what I look forward to okay yeah okay sorry and I've heard some

04:31.560 --> 04:36.880
some stuff on science shows recently that they've got a completely clear

04:36.880 --> 04:43.560
glass that they are planning on putting in two new phones and new tablets I'm

04:43.560 --> 04:48.800
ready charger I'm ready for that whether it completely charges it or just keeps

04:48.800 --> 04:57.520
it from charging so fast did you find the charging info and I found the

04:57.520 --> 05:01.240
information so I'll read it back it says this really depends it says how long

05:01.240 --> 05:06.420
does it need to be in the Sun to be fully charged and it says this really

05:06.420 --> 05:10.960
depends on the exposure you're getting right in a fully sunny day it should

05:10.960 --> 05:16.360
take a couple of hours to get fully charged duration will change with

05:16.360 --> 05:21.560
conditions such as and this is they oh by the way this is our get out of

05:21.560 --> 05:27.160
clauses to why it's never going to work position of the Sun clouds location on

05:27.160 --> 05:33.760
the earth and even air pressure and temperature yeah that's basically it

05:33.760 --> 05:38.980
doesn't work it's never gonna charge the laptop that is everything you can

05:38.980 --> 05:43.320
imagine because where are you on the planet exactly I'm sorry you're not

05:43.320 --> 05:50.840
exactly on the equator on this specific aren't you gonna bake the components

05:50.840 --> 05:55.560
like aren't you gonna cook the laptop now you're really digging into this so

05:55.560 --> 05:59.560
now I'm gonna find temperature temperature operation the temperature

05:59.560 --> 06:07.760
conditions I guess I know I guess I like the idea of this being a feature on

06:07.760 --> 06:10.740
almost anything where there's some integrated self-charging you know like

06:10.740 --> 06:15.480
okay I'm not saying everything it comes down to Star Trek but it turns out seems

06:15.480 --> 06:18.400
like everything comes down to Star Trek and something the Enterprise D got

06:18.400 --> 06:22.080
really good if you look at the back area of the Enterprise D between the warp

06:22.080 --> 06:26.280
missiles that's all solar panels and it's not their primary source of power

06:26.280 --> 06:30.440
but it's like a solid trickle charge for their power cells and they could just

06:30.440 --> 06:33.440
you know they don't depend on it but it's just sort of supplements it's like a

06:33.440 --> 06:36.520
multiple different ways getting that power up and I look at the battery

06:36.520 --> 06:40.960
technology and I think these batteries are not getting better fast enough you

06:40.960 --> 06:44.520
know like they're they're just like I want to I want a phone that lasts two

06:44.520 --> 06:47.520
three days that's that would really be perfect for me or at least a solid two

06:47.520 --> 06:50.920
days but the battery technology doesn't seem to keep up but if they could have

06:50.920 --> 06:54.240
trickle charging like through solar and stuff like that to sort of supplement

06:54.240 --> 06:59.240
the battery shortcomings Chris I can solve that problem for you the thing you

06:59.240 --> 07:03.200
need is a Nokia 9660 there you go that will last you five days in a single

07:03.200 --> 07:08.240
charge network really the night Nokia that's the old in other words get away

07:08.240 --> 07:12.040
from your stupid smartphone that's what you're saying yeah that's well yeah go

07:12.040 --> 07:17.080
back to my old that was advertised as a smartphone but yeah back in the day I'm

07:17.080 --> 07:23.000
looking right now oh boy yeah yeah exactly that was too fast what I'm

07:23.000 --> 07:37.280
sorry what sorry Noah I meant to say okay thank you welcome to Linux unplugged

07:37.280 --> 07:42.440
your weekly Linux talk show that's already preparing its defenses against

07:42.440 --> 07:46.520
the con crud my name is Chris and my name is Matt hey man I'm taking like

07:46.520 --> 07:50.880
vitamins I'm trying to drink water I'm trying not to get sick when I go on this

07:50.880 --> 07:54.000
trip but I'm already paranoid because I've been sleeping very well and that's

07:54.000 --> 07:57.600
that lowers the defenses right there Matt oh boy I'm starting on a

07:57.600 --> 08:01.520
disadvantage so if if I get sick what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna implement a

08:01.520 --> 08:05.400
bubble quarantine it's gonna make Monday's Linux action show a little

08:05.400 --> 08:10.280
awkward so I'm gonna be in a bubble but we'll communicate over the microphones

08:10.280 --> 08:14.240
and headphones so you'll still be able to hear me however I am gonna need you

08:14.240 --> 08:18.480
to slip the bacon through a slot okay okay you know when it comes to slipping

08:18.480 --> 08:21.920
bacon I can do that okay good good all right well we got a good episode today

08:21.920 --> 08:26.680
episode 63 of the unplugged show we're gonna talk to the Linux grandma I went

08:26.680 --> 08:30.440
to a meetup recently of kabuntu users you know me Matt I'm a kabuntu guy oh

08:30.440 --> 08:35.680
yeah so I went to a kabuntu users meetup and met Valerie she's gonna join us today

08:35.680 --> 08:40.440
and chat about kabuntu KDE specifically the KDE project something neat I learned

08:40.440 --> 08:45.160
that the KDE group is doing it coming up right now and a few other things that

08:45.160 --> 08:48.320
come up and plus just a little bit about her blog as well plus we've got a ton

08:48.320 --> 08:53.720
of feedback and then Microsoft apparently quote-unquote hearts Linux

08:53.720 --> 08:57.200
we're gonna talk about that as well as a bunch of other things coming up later in

08:57.200 --> 09:01.040
the show so big show today accidentally did a big show I don't even know your

09:01.040 --> 09:06.760
show a huge show so let's start with some feedback from Sunday's Linux action

09:06.760 --> 09:11.840
show Dave wrote in and he wanted to kind of take us to the mat Matt get it oh

09:11.840 --> 09:16.160
boy I see how that works he's calling us out though he's like hey guys great show

09:16.160 --> 09:21.040
I've been a listener for a long time you ready for this Matt I use a Windows

09:21.040 --> 09:26.320
sysadmin oh I know a few of those that's okay they exist and that's why he likes

09:26.320 --> 09:29.860
listening to last because he likes to get info about all the OS's but he

09:29.860 --> 09:34.160
wasn't so hot on the negativity towards Docker on Windows he says I get a

09:34.160 --> 09:39.280
feeling from your and Matt's comments in last 335 you're irritated that Docker

09:39.280 --> 09:43.760
would dare roll out their products to Windows hey Windows Server guys want

09:43.760 --> 09:48.320
containers too why do you Linux guys got a hog all the good stuff I would love to

09:48.320 --> 09:52.040
be able to use containers instead of virtualization to keep applications

09:52.040 --> 09:56.120
isolated also you made it sound as if you could run Linux Docker containers on

09:56.120 --> 09:59.240
Windows that's not the case the container share the kernel so Windows

09:59.240 --> 10:01.760
Dockers only run a Windows containers I think we actually didn't make that point

10:01.760 --> 10:07.080
pretty clear so you know you know what it was Matt is we get these terms in the

10:07.080 --> 10:10.760
industry that just drive me crazy and I think Docker is turning into a buzz term

10:10.760 --> 10:15.800
almost because when you start taking out the Linux component of Docker doesn't

10:15.800 --> 10:19.280
seem like Docker anymore now it just seems like you're taking the concept of

10:19.280 --> 10:22.640
container ization and you're just calling it Docker all right pretty much

10:22.640 --> 10:26.200
I mean it becomes a branding thing it's yes that's what I was rolling my eyes at

10:26.200 --> 10:32.480
right I in a way it also shows like what a player Linux is right now in the

10:32.480 --> 10:38.420
market because not the first OS to do this right I think those BSD guys would

10:38.420 --> 10:41.240
have you check out something called jails and I think they're pretty proud

10:41.240 --> 10:45.320
of it in fact I think they think it's still a lot better so Docker comes along

10:45.320 --> 10:49.320
and it kind of does stuff that other things can already do except for it has

10:49.320 --> 10:52.880
this great Docker hub where you can pull down images and it goes from that to now

10:52.880 --> 10:56.040
it's this it's like the concept of container ization is just it's like when

10:56.040 --> 11:00.640
we started calling DVRs Tivo's and it's like no it's not a Tivo that is your

11:00.640 --> 11:04.600
cable company's DVR or that is a play TV you know it just that's what I was

11:04.600 --> 11:09.000
rolling my eyes at well and going from my perspective what kind of irritated me

11:09.000 --> 11:11.840
about the whole thing is that I have no problem with Microsoft getting on board

11:11.840 --> 11:15.320
with this what I have a problem with is the fact that as per usual they waited

11:15.320 --> 11:18.120
to the very last minute to where they didn't have to innovate anything then

11:18.120 --> 11:21.640
they kind of slopped they kind of belly flopped onto the platform out of the

11:21.640 --> 11:25.600
pool limped along a little bit and said oh hey look at this grand jewelry thing

11:25.600 --> 11:28.600
that we're coming up with it's so awesome and we're so innovative they

11:28.600 --> 11:32.560
just the entire experience that they're presenting had a very it just felt like

11:32.560 --> 11:35.080
that they were doing something unique and different it's like but that's not

11:35.080 --> 11:39.200
the case you're a me too product I'm sorry yeah and like like Linus Tech

11:39.200 --> 11:41.920
points out in the chat room I mean they're depending on LXC docker is built

11:41.920 --> 11:46.400
on that and we wanted to remind us of a little history right well yeah I mean

11:46.400 --> 11:50.200
open vz has been around for a long long time now and that was sort of the

11:50.200 --> 11:55.180
original Linux container platform and I've been using that successfully at

11:55.180 --> 12:00.040
work and I was a late adopter for about five years now so yeah docker is great

12:00.040 --> 12:04.360
I've had a go with it and I can see the advantages and how it extends on what

12:04.360 --> 12:11.440
open vz offers but then containers jail CH roots it's not new yeah I agree I

12:11.440 --> 12:15.400
mean I've got Proxmox here in the studio right and I've been using LXC on

12:15.400 --> 12:21.580
that but I think what my I think what my point is is a lot of times we as the

12:21.580 --> 12:27.200
technical crowd we see that the groundwork was already there and we

12:27.200 --> 12:31.720
failed to recognize the innovation in making it all work really simple in a

12:31.720 --> 12:36.760
way that a lot larger of an audience can grok and what what is different about

12:36.760 --> 12:43.400
docker is it broke into that gray area that's called DevOps where you've got

12:43.400 --> 12:49.400
developers who maybe didn't fully understand containers and namespaces and

12:49.400 --> 12:55.880
virtualization and kids and Zen and KVM and LXC but they get github right and

12:55.880 --> 12:59.920
they get that docker has this github like functionality and I can pull down

12:59.920 --> 13:06.760
this container and now it's just working and it from end to end it is presented

13:06.760 --> 13:11.040
in a product like fashion that you can completely wrap your brain around you

13:11.040 --> 13:15.600
understand what it is from a concept and so it's easy to talk about it's easy to

13:15.600 --> 13:18.600
understand and then you understand that has this github like functionality for

13:18.600 --> 13:25.240
images it clicks and I think we as as more technical users sometimes fail to

13:25.240 --> 13:29.680
fully appreciate sometimes just bringing it a little bit more polished bringing

13:29.680 --> 13:33.320
to that edge can really make the difference obviously look at that's what

13:33.320 --> 13:36.560
Apple really makes their money on right what's your number one comment you

13:36.560 --> 13:41.920
always see after a new iPhone or iPad is launched XYZ Android device had it first

13:41.920 --> 13:46.080
Apple pay is a great example of that right there's my Nexus 5 device is

13:46.080 --> 13:51.040
ancient now in the smartphone land sorta it's had wireless payments this entire

13:51.040 --> 13:56.600
time I've never used at once right that the difference is that final 10% gap

13:56.600 --> 14:00.520
closing that seems to be where you can make the difference and that's what

14:00.520 --> 14:03.800
docker did because there's other operating systems that have it as well

14:03.800 --> 14:08.160
so good for Windows I don't think Windows is a fantastic platform for

14:08.160 --> 14:11.200
service to begin with but that's probably too much of a surprise to

14:11.200 --> 14:14.480
anybody and so yeah I mean that's pretty much that's kind of where I'm at with

14:14.480 --> 14:17.400
it's like hey they want to go have a go with it that's great but you know lose

14:17.400 --> 14:20.560
the oh my gosh we're so are they're trying to be like Apple in this regard

14:20.560 --> 14:23.080
it feels like they're just it's like they it almost feels like they're

14:23.080 --> 14:25.360
saying they innovated this whole thing and it's like but you didn't really have

14:25.360 --> 14:30.160
any no you didn't I mean not really all right I wanted to open the floor to

14:30.160 --> 14:35.080
feedback on the Ubuntu 1410 review that we had in Sunday's Linux action show we

14:35.080 --> 14:37.800
got several different emails and comments about it but there wasn't any

14:37.800 --> 14:44.080
one particular theme that jumped out so just as a as an open door to the mumble

14:44.080 --> 14:48.920
room did anybody have any feedback follow-up corrections or arguments they

14:48.920 --> 14:52.320
want to make from our review of Ubuntu 1410 on Sunday show now is your chance

14:52.320 --> 15:01.280
for hold your or forever hold your going once going twice sold this style of it

15:01.280 --> 15:04.280
they they're looking at the different flavors you think that worked out with

15:04.280 --> 15:06.400
because that was kind of something new we were trying you think that worked out

15:06.400 --> 15:13.880
okay yeah at least for me it it feels like a deeper look into the different

15:13.880 --> 15:19.240
yeah the different flavors because I never liked the first Ubuntu I tried

15:19.240 --> 15:26.400
but I really love both Kubuntu and Ubuntu but there was little little less

15:26.400 --> 15:31.880
information from reviews and all that on those flavors right so maybe now

15:31.880 --> 15:34.840
somebody looking for more about Ubuntu will see that and learn about those

15:34.840 --> 15:39.560
other flavors and obviously Mate played a big role in our review so wimpy I used

15:39.560 --> 15:45.120
you want to give a chance to follow up on some of that well first of all thank

15:45.120 --> 15:50.200
you ever so much for covering Ubuntu Mate in your roundup not least because

15:50.200 --> 15:54.440
Ubuntu Mate is not an official flavor yet but also because it's really good to

15:54.440 --> 15:58.960
get good feedback so there was a few things that you mentioned in your review

15:58.960 --> 16:05.140
which if you dig into the Ubuntu Mate website little bit this is one of the

16:05.140 --> 16:09.800
links that isn't and top in the top there on the roadmap I've got a few

16:09.800 --> 16:17.960
things outlined that you touched upon so would you like me to okay so there was

16:17.960 --> 16:24.520
there was a few things obviously you'd gone all compies addict mode there and

16:24.520 --> 16:36.640
you'd you turned on wobbly windows never way way way back for one there was

16:36.640 --> 16:41.760
actually an Ubuntu Marte dash comp is meta package which was put together

16:41.760 --> 16:46.200
based on the feedback of one of the guys from the Ubuntu Marte compete community

16:46.200 --> 16:49.800
quickly worked out that this was going to require a bit more work than I had

16:49.800 --> 16:53.360
time to put in so I put that on the back burner but what we're going to do is

16:53.360 --> 16:59.280
comp is is never going to be a default option for Ubuntu Marte but it will be a

16:59.280 --> 17:06.240
meta package so a compass is still hugely popular in Marte community so I'm

17:06.240 --> 17:11.040
going to make a meta package available so that you can install compete via a

17:11.040 --> 17:15.840
single package you get a same set of default and you get that traditional

17:15.840 --> 17:20.440
compass experience for those people that love it now you know next thing you're

17:20.440 --> 17:22.960
gonna have people are going to ask for barrel support so that way they can get

17:22.960 --> 17:32.800
their crazy window decorations I love I love wobbly windows I draw the line at

17:32.800 --> 17:36.920
3d cubes but there is actually a practical application to all of this and

17:36.920 --> 17:40.320
that's with them talking to Jonathan NATO from the accessible computing

17:40.320 --> 17:49.960
foundation in his opinion the best desktop zoom application for individuals

17:49.960 --> 17:55.560
with low vision is the enhanced zoom plug-in from compass for all that for

17:55.560 --> 17:59.760
all the fun and games there is actually a practical application for for making

17:59.760 --> 18:04.240
comp is easily available you know I used to use I totally forgot about that I

18:04.240 --> 18:08.000
used to use that during shows to demonstrate something's on a specific

18:08.000 --> 18:15.800
area of the screen I would just zoom into it yeah yeah yeah so for all for

18:15.800 --> 18:19.840
all the wobbly windows fun there is actually practical application and a

18:19.840 --> 18:23.600
couple of other things you touched on was launches and docks if I actually

18:23.600 --> 18:28.040
sent you a screenshot of how I run Ubuntu Marte I think it'd make a lot of

18:28.040 --> 18:33.120
Ubuntu Marte or Marte users shriek because it's unconventional I have a

18:33.120 --> 18:36.760
dock at the bottom so I have a single panel at the top with your applications

18:36.760 --> 18:41.880
places and system yeah and a few few applets to tell me when the discs are

18:41.880 --> 18:46.720
rattling and all of that sort of stuff and then your system tray a dock at the

18:46.720 --> 18:52.760
bottom and I use plank for that yeah and then I have an oversized auto hiding

18:52.760 --> 18:58.280
panel on the left of the screen with a huge workspace switcher on it which is

18:58.280 --> 19:03.040
remarkably like what you find on the right hand side of the screen in GNOME

19:03.040 --> 19:10.320
3 with their workspace switcher so that's how I how I drive my system so

19:10.320 --> 19:17.720
I'm obviously looking at a way to integrate docks what what's so funny

19:22.400 --> 19:32.040
those Katie users don't listen to them I know I thought I was being all right

19:32.040 --> 19:39.600
I'll move on I'll move on very quickly then so again docks won't be a well they

19:39.600 --> 19:43.000
may be a default setting I'll ask you been to Marte community if they want as

19:43.000 --> 19:46.660
a default setting but one of the things I'm planning on working on is that the

19:46.660 --> 19:54.880
working title is shapeshifter so you can choose a workspace setup so not just the

19:54.880 --> 19:59.440
panel arrangements but also things like docks launches and and the general

19:59.440 --> 20:02.240
appearance so you know what are the other things we've been seeing a lot is

20:02.240 --> 20:05.240
people want to see that like the whisker menu or something like that that they

20:05.240 --> 20:09.440
can use yeah and that's and that's something else I'm looking at is some of

20:09.440 --> 20:14.240
the launches so I use synapse for example which gives me all of that stuff

20:14.240 --> 20:20.080
that you were looking for so you can yeah you can hotkey type TRM and hit

20:20.080 --> 20:28.440
return and there's your terminal yeah guys I mean I we've talked about synapse

20:28.440 --> 20:31.880
multiple times on the show obviously I know about and also gnome do although

20:31.880 --> 20:35.800
when I installed gnome do it locked my limit a session up but first can't shut

20:35.800 --> 20:40.840
me up about yeah we know about the thing is is I just wanted to find a project

20:40.840 --> 20:45.640
that was still active and I just haven't found yeah yeah so so synapse has got a

20:45.640 --> 20:51.800
PPA it's recently been restarted so that's under active development oh yeah

20:51.800 --> 20:57.320
yeah docky and plank of merged so if you look at the latest docking plank

20:57.320 --> 21:04.200
they're effectively identical awesome and in addition to synapse there's

21:04.200 --> 21:08.160
slingscold which is another launcher which looks very interesting and another

21:08.160 --> 21:11.760
one I think it's called the duck launcher and there's one other that I

21:11.760 --> 21:16.680
found so what we'll be doing is is looking at these having conversation

21:16.680 --> 21:22.240
with the community finding out which ones they like the most building some

21:22.240 --> 21:25.840
meta packages and some default configuration and then providing

21:25.840 --> 21:30.680
utility when you install them into my tape for the first time you can have a

21:30.680 --> 21:35.000
this is a visual representation of the different ways the desktop can be

21:35.000 --> 21:40.560
arranged and the tools that are on offer and you can say snap and go and in some

21:40.560 --> 21:46.180
little way that's available now so if you deeply deeply want a Windows XP

21:46.180 --> 21:51.800
classic look there's a Redmond panel layout and if you go to the Ubuntu mate

21:51.800 --> 21:56.960
website you'll find in the release notes the instructions on how to enable the

21:56.960 --> 22:01.840
Redmond layout and that's the first baby steps towards the shape-shifting

22:01.840 --> 22:07.320
create your desktop with a single click the way you want it to be oh I cannot

22:07.320 --> 22:11.480
wait to see that well I'm still running it here in fact I was just thinking

22:11.480 --> 22:15.560
today as I set up I really appreciated how snappy it was and I feel like even I

22:15.560 --> 22:18.080
don't know I feel like even my web browser start faster and I don't know

22:18.080 --> 22:21.360
why the desktop would make the difference I obviously granted it

22:21.360 --> 22:24.480
probably uses less resources but it's not like I'm starved for resources so

22:24.480 --> 22:30.040
yeah it's and it's not about saving resources it's about preserving

22:30.040 --> 22:34.720
resources for the things that matter so by having less resources allocated to

22:34.720 --> 22:38.880
your desktop you've got more resources available to your Steam client or your

22:38.880 --> 22:43.640
web browser for example good point good point less fluff less fluff well great

22:43.640 --> 22:48.720
work on the Mate edition and thank you and it was it was good for the Mate

22:48.720 --> 22:52.400
desktop team to see as well because this is an opportunity for that for them to

22:52.400 --> 22:57.600
see their work showcased as well sure well I look forward to keep checking out

22:57.600 --> 23:00.960
boy something sounds like some of those improvements are gonna be really really

23:00.960 --> 23:04.400
incredible alright so I think Valerie's been waiting long enough before we get

23:04.400 --> 23:07.600
to that I'll thank our first sponsor this week and that's Linux Academy here's

23:07.600 --> 23:09.720
where you need to go right now stop what you're doing oh my gosh what are you

23:09.720 --> 23:14.600
doing you got to go there right now Linux Academy comm slash Linux or slash

23:14.600 --> 23:18.960
unplugged I think both of those work but I like Linux boom why not right Linux

23:18.960 --> 23:23.040
Academy comm slash unplug to get you the discount I know that lock that in go to

23:23.040 --> 23:26.920
Linux Academy comm slash unplug to make sure you get the awesome discount you

23:26.920 --> 23:31.000
can get up to a 33% off and the great thing about that subscription is you

23:31.000 --> 23:34.080
just constantly get all of the new content you get access to everything

23:34.080 --> 23:37.640
pick and choose what you want to start with so have you heard about Linux

23:37.640 --> 23:41.320
Academy you should go check them out right now Linux Academy comm slash

23:41.320 --> 23:44.400
unplugged you can get step-by-step video courses they'll walk you through all

23:44.400 --> 23:48.200
kinds of things thing one of the things I like about Linux Academy too is I've

23:48.200 --> 23:51.760
used it to just sort of test the waters and see what topics interest me but you

23:51.760 --> 23:55.520
could absolutely surely use it to just sort of increase your skill level and

23:55.520 --> 23:58.960
whatever your industry is in or maybe get yourself up to that next level if

23:58.960 --> 24:01.760
you've been just thrust into a project and you've got to move from like a red

24:01.760 --> 24:04.720
hat box to a Debian box and things like that's one of the great things about

24:04.720 --> 24:07.560
Linux Academy is whatever course where you're taking you're gonna be able to

24:07.560 --> 24:10.320
choose from seven plus Linux distributions and then they structure

24:10.320 --> 24:13.800
all the courseware off the distribution you pick that's a great opportunity if

24:13.800 --> 24:16.640
you're moving between distributions or you need to refresh or you want to

24:16.640 --> 24:20.080
figure out maybe the way the other side does things and I'm showing you some of

24:20.080 --> 24:22.920
the courses you can take now if you take some of their Linux training it's

24:22.920 --> 24:27.720
awesome all kinds of things you can take all kinds of courses over there and one

24:27.720 --> 24:30.960
of the best parts is is they have these learning plans now they will

24:30.960 --> 24:35.440
automatically customize the amount of training time you have just based on the

24:35.440 --> 24:39.160
availability you select and it can send you reminders about courses and it gives

24:39.160 --> 24:41.760
you an idea in a snapshot okay it's gonna take you this long to get through

24:41.760 --> 24:45.040
this course when you log in and by the way you can download these study guides

24:45.040 --> 24:48.320
some of them are an audio and video and listen to them on the go Seth

24:48.320 --> 24:52.360
Scooby Sprite sometimes joins us during Linux unplugged or tech talk listens in

24:52.360 --> 24:57.200
the shower most people listen in the car but Seth listens in the shower and you

24:57.200 --> 25:00.280
know I realized I do some of my best thinking in the shower so maybe I would

25:00.280 --> 25:03.800
do some of my best learning in the shower like that could actually be total

25:03.800 --> 25:06.880
genius I don't know how cool how cool would it be to have like some sort of a

25:06.880 --> 25:09.960
shower proof whiteboard that if you're coming up with these ideas well quickly

25:09.960 --> 25:13.320
jot it down it's funny you say that he actually mailed me I'm not even kidding

25:13.320 --> 25:18.200
a waterproof notebook all of the pages in the notebook are waterproof and he

25:18.200 --> 25:21.400
hangs it I'm not even kidding this is not made up he hangs these in a shower

25:21.400 --> 25:26.320
and with the right pens and he takes notes in there and he sent me a set like

25:26.320 --> 25:29.400
this is what he does this is his system and it works for him this is what's

25:29.400 --> 25:32.400
awesome about Linux Academy is you can literally customize it to whatever your

25:32.400 --> 25:35.920
scenario is you know if I've gotten emails from people recently said you

25:35.920 --> 25:39.000
know Chris I'm gonna be a dad soon I'm a little worried about keeping my skill

25:39.000 --> 25:42.880
level up Linux Academy can customize to your availability or you know you're

25:42.880 --> 25:45.440
like Seth you're only free times when you're in the shower he still makes it

25:45.440 --> 25:48.600
work and finds value out of it they're constantly adding new things and they

25:48.600 --> 25:51.160
have scenario based training so you actually implement something so say you

25:51.160 --> 25:55.760
take an AWS course you'll implement the s3 back-end storage the ec2 front-end

25:55.760 --> 26:00.200
boxes the load balancing the DNS management you'll do all of that and as

26:00.200 --> 26:03.720
each part in that lab in that scenario based training not only will you be

26:03.720 --> 26:06.600
implementing and at the actual stuff the actual application so you'll have

26:06.600 --> 26:10.480
hands-on experience but they will spin up the service for you as you need them

26:10.480 --> 26:15.880
on-demand just part of their service it's really cool Linux Academy comm slash

26:15.880 --> 26:19.680
unplugged time to go do some more training it's always time to learn a

26:19.680 --> 26:23.240
little bit more and it's never been a better time Linux Academy comm slash

26:23.240 --> 26:29.160
unplugged all right well I would like to welcome Valerie to the show she is

26:29.160 --> 26:32.560
hanging out with Eric they might sound like they're at the bottom of a pool but

26:32.560 --> 26:36.040
they promised me they're not swimming right now but you never know with those

26:36.040 --> 26:45.760
two but you're just lounging sure how would we know it's an audio only show

26:45.760 --> 26:50.920
how would we know well Valerie welcome to Linux unplugged and I feel bad like I

26:50.920 --> 26:55.360
shouldn't call you the Linux grandma but that's what you go by isn't it I don't

26:55.360 --> 26:58.800
know I don't know but that's what you go by I go by you embrace and I think I

26:58.800 --> 27:06.600
love that you you break a lot of stereotypes that when we got we we met

27:06.600 --> 27:11.940
Valerie at a Kubuntu users meetup and when we got there Valerie showed up with

27:11.940 --> 27:15.960
the thumb drives preloaded with plasma 5.1 so that way we could all get

27:15.960 --> 27:20.080
installing if we didn't have you that's how that's how cool Valerie is and so I

27:20.080 --> 27:24.560
wanted to kind of start with your involvement in the KDE project and I

27:24.560 --> 27:28.200
don't know if you wanted to jump right into it but you told me about something

27:28.200 --> 27:31.520
that I didn't know KD he does it's kind of reminded me of the Google Summer of

27:31.520 --> 27:34.520
Code so you can start wherever you want what you do with the KD project probably

27:34.520 --> 27:39.000
a great place but I'd like to get there so tell us what you do for KD well

27:39.000 --> 27:45.920
Google Summer of Code I'm one of the administrators you're actually largest

27:45.920 --> 27:51.560
or one of the largest research and contributors I guess you would say

27:51.560 --> 27:56.560
because I don't know if your listeners know about Google Summer of Code oh

27:56.560 --> 28:05.200
sure yeah okay so Google puts up the money and then the free projects

28:05.200 --> 28:12.440
actually do the mentoring for the students and so the students work for

28:12.440 --> 28:22.000
summer and get paid for it and we possibly get new members of the

28:22.000 --> 28:26.960
community right like KD connect was started as a Google Summer of Code

28:26.960 --> 28:34.520
project right exactly yeah and all kinds of cool stuff and there are two other

28:34.520 --> 28:39.840
actually two other mentoring projects that we do one is called season of KD

28:39.840 --> 28:44.320
which has no money and we're just actually we're kicking it off late this

28:44.320 --> 28:50.680
year it's just kicking off now it'll go through the end of January participants

28:50.680 --> 28:54.800
get a t-shirt and a certificate and it's open to students it's really open to

28:54.800 --> 29:00.560
anybody who finds a mentor and wants to do it and then Google code in is

29:00.560 --> 29:04.280
relatively new I think Google's only been running it for four or five years

29:04.280 --> 29:10.960
that is for junior high and high school students it is awesome and our mentors

29:10.960 --> 29:20.080
come up with small tasks that students can do in a day and the top prize which

29:20.080 --> 29:28.120
I think about ten kids win is a trip to Mountain View for two or three days

29:28.120 --> 29:33.560
oh what a treat parents oh yeah and you can see that that's really awesome for

29:33.560 --> 29:39.280
Google because they get a first look at all of these uber smart uber driven kids

29:39.280 --> 29:45.800
of course it's wonderful for the projects when I got involved I had just

29:45.800 --> 29:55.720
started writing user documentation for Amarok and I set up a page for every

29:55.720 --> 30:06.880
little sub subject and then the students did wrote wrote the page did the media

30:06.880 --> 30:12.200
wiki coding and did the screenshots and all I had to do was point clean up after

30:12.200 --> 30:18.680
them it was wonderful and then years later up at Linux fest Northwest I met

30:18.680 --> 30:28.200
my prize student who was working for own cloud by then Wow yeah so it's just a

30:28.200 --> 30:32.360
win in every way that you can think of although the mentors work really hard

30:32.360 --> 30:37.160
and it's right during it's in the winter so are you are you serving as the as the

30:37.160 --> 30:41.760
interface like the go-between between the Google reps and the KD project like

30:41.760 --> 30:45.480
are you helping coordinate some of that people they're getting by me I'm one of

30:45.480 --> 30:51.040
the I'm one of the administrators yes so we get all the infrastructure set up we

30:51.040 --> 30:57.480
make sure that mentors are around to talk to their students how critical just

30:57.480 --> 31:01.600
whatever how critical to the KD project would you say the Google summer of code

31:01.600 --> 31:09.800
involvement has been I think that especially in India it has helped us a

31:09.800 --> 31:14.480
lot because it has spread the word because it's Google spreading the word

31:14.480 --> 31:21.200
and not just us spreading word and we have had we've had two KDE conferences

31:21.200 --> 31:26.080
in India that the students themselves started with like hundreds of students

31:26.080 --> 31:32.640
each and set the EV paid for you know KD people to fly over there and do the

31:32.640 --> 31:38.080
talks and stuff it was really cool but we've got we have some American students

31:38.080 --> 31:45.360
not as many as I would like but also lots of European students so that's

31:45.360 --> 31:47.920
pretty cool one place we're lacking is Africa I

31:47.920 --> 31:51.800
think the word is just not spreading and I also think that there's not good

31:51.800 --> 31:59.440
enough connectivity for African students to get involved well so let's talk a

31:59.440 --> 32:05.120
little bit about organizing a community and getting involved so we did this

32:05.120 --> 32:08.560
meetup it was fun it was what like eight or nine of us eight of us or something

32:08.560 --> 32:12.160
like that not very big you know I'm about to get on a plane and fly to Ohio

32:12.160 --> 32:15.320
Linux fest which I suspect are probably one of the larger Linux events of the

32:15.320 --> 32:18.880
year and it's such a huge like one-to-one difference it couldn't be two

32:18.880 --> 32:24.320
two more opposite sides of the spectrum however I kind of think there's probably

32:24.320 --> 32:29.280
we should be doing more of these small group meetups I feel like this is it's

32:29.280 --> 32:33.360
it was interesting because we we had we had a gentleman there from the visual

32:33.360 --> 32:39.000
design group at KDE we had the developer of KDE connect there we had yourself

32:39.000 --> 32:43.560
there and we had folks that are involved with you know deploying KDE on recycled

32:43.560 --> 32:47.920
machines and all a whole range of different areas and it was just a nice

32:47.920 --> 32:51.200
one-to-one conversation everybody had a chance to chat we didn't even we were

32:51.200 --> 32:53.760
we were we were having so much fun talking with each other we didn't eat

32:53.760 --> 32:59.920
the cake we forgot to eat the cake like we forgot to eat cake so that when does

32:59.920 --> 33:10.920
that ever happen can't waste it so what would you impart on pond is it is it

33:10.920 --> 33:14.800
just do you think part of the issue is is that we as geeks are just too

33:14.800 --> 33:19.160
antisocial so we won't just take the next step and organize the meetups what

33:19.160 --> 33:22.640
is holding us back with tools like meetup and on all these ways to organize

33:22.640 --> 33:26.720
why aren't we seeing more of these local events do you think well I think in this

33:26.720 --> 33:31.120
case Andrew I didn't even know him I had never met him before I'd never talked to

33:31.120 --> 33:37.560
him before I talked I was talking to KD connect guy and he's like I just moved

33:37.560 --> 33:41.440
to Seattle let's get together and I said okay well let's have a release party so

33:41.440 --> 33:46.720
he's like oh there's this meetup thing like what that you know a couple days

33:46.720 --> 33:51.760
before somebody had set that up so I think that it's just people taking the

33:51.760 --> 33:58.680
initiative yeah I years ago my first computer was an Coleco Adam and I didn't

33:58.680 --> 34:03.360
know how to use it so I started I started an atom users group and we met

34:03.360 --> 34:07.280
for about five years we became such good friends I mean we were meeting when none

34:07.280 --> 34:11.360
of us were even using the Coleco added anymore because you know 80k doesn't

34:11.360 --> 34:34.280
know you know I don't know how many people started a user group because they

34:34.280 --> 34:37.160
didn't know what they were doing but that's what I did I was like how else am

34:37.160 --> 34:45.040
I gonna find out let's find some experts here I know that there are some the

34:45.040 --> 34:48.120
internet came along we got hangouts we got mumble and we all just kind of stop

34:48.120 --> 34:51.680
going and meeting up in plate in in person you know you used to have to go

34:51.680 --> 34:55.320
to the computer store to get even your to get a box copy of your distro I try

34:55.320 --> 34:58.280
to figure out what it is because I'm just as guilty of it but I want to try

34:58.280 --> 35:02.080
to get out and see people more because it's neat to actually meet and discuss

35:02.080 --> 35:07.960
stuff and is true because remember the computer user newspaper yeah oh wait for

35:07.960 --> 35:11.720
that every month yeah and that's how we got users actually was advertising in

35:11.720 --> 35:16.640
there right yeah free advertising of course yeah um yeah I think part of it

35:16.640 --> 35:22.000
is time everybody seems so busy also a lot of people who started as teenagers

35:22.000 --> 35:25.960
are now getting married and having children right and that sort of puts a

35:25.960 --> 35:34.400
cramp in your style so you know here I am now I'm I'm retired and I have time

35:34.400 --> 35:38.840
that's really why I got involved in open source I had been using Linux for over

35:38.840 --> 35:42.760
ten years and I thought I have time now I should give back that was my next

35:42.760 --> 35:46.280
question for you because you know we just got through a couple of weeks of

35:46.280 --> 35:51.880
pretty tumultuous community drama and you know sometimes some of the KD

35:51.880 --> 35:54.400
community members are involved in some of the drama I don't think they were

35:54.400 --> 35:59.080
this last round but that can happen from time to time and I wondered like so when

35:59.080 --> 36:02.400
you get to the point where you're ready to retire and kind of just indulge a

36:02.400 --> 36:06.320
passion you got you go pretty far into the community you're in all the IRC

36:06.320 --> 36:09.720
rooms IRC rooms how do you deal with the drama does it bother you what's your

36:09.720 --> 36:18.200
approach to that in KDE I'm on the community working group and that that is

36:18.200 --> 36:23.520
a group that the EV got together to actually deal with conflict in the

36:23.520 --> 36:29.240
community and I am not scared of conflict I think that when people are

36:29.240 --> 36:32.560
fighting about things that means they're passionate there's energy there so

36:32.560 --> 36:37.040
what's usually happening though is that people are talking past each other

36:37.040 --> 36:41.680
rather than thinking together and if there's a lot of energy around a subject

36:41.680 --> 36:45.800
there's obviously a problem therefore we need to think together so rather than

36:45.800 --> 36:51.640
clashing we should be listening to one another and thinking together and trying

36:51.640 --> 36:55.760
to work our way through whatever the problem is yeah and I think sometimes

36:55.760 --> 37:00.320
what would help is if we stopped talking to each other through our blogs and talk

37:00.320 --> 37:09.440
to each other maybe chat or mumble or the phone yeah face-to-face to me there

37:09.440 --> 37:15.640
is at back to what you were saying the small groups there is absolutely nothing

37:15.640 --> 37:19.680
better than sitting and talking to somebody right you know it's funny too

37:19.680 --> 37:24.400
like for example in a face-to-face meeting you can have a bunch of Linux

37:24.400 --> 37:27.760
users and if one of those Linux users pulls out an iPhone nobody would say

37:27.760 --> 37:31.920
anything but on the internet if one of one of if you're having a group chat and

37:31.920 --> 37:35.000
somebody somehow figured out you had an iPhone they pulled out all of the Linux

37:35.000 --> 37:37.920
users would jump on that person say oh you have an eye you have an iPhone what

37:37.920 --> 37:40.800
are you doing like over the internet we're just we're just a little bit more

37:40.800 --> 37:43.800
sometimes of jerks to each other like we just don't quite care as much but in

37:43.800 --> 37:47.920
person you know we're nicer we're more understanding we listen a little bit

37:47.920 --> 37:57.280
better and part of the reason that I'm in KDE I mean KDE runs on Windows and it

37:57.280 --> 38:02.160
runs on Mac so we actually have as part of our community people who work oh sure

38:02.160 --> 38:08.280
on making sure everything works on Windows and works on Mac and it's true

38:08.280 --> 38:11.800
every once in a while they get disparaged no I shouldn't leave that I

38:11.800 --> 38:15.400
shouldn't leave up these BSD either but I was just making kind of a like a

38:15.400 --> 38:19.760
dramatic comparison because really yeah we're more critical over the internet

38:19.760 --> 38:23.520
than we are in person is really what happens and it's just I think that's why

38:23.520 --> 38:26.240
even these small meetups are really good because it can happen in small little

38:26.240 --> 38:31.680
doses too it doesn't have to be these huge events I think it's it's happening

38:31.680 --> 38:36.040
in our culture at large if you look at our politics and it's starting to

38:36.040 --> 38:40.960
happen not just in the US but around the world that we're getting these polarized

38:40.960 --> 38:46.240
groups and so we need to figure out how to you know and some people say that

38:46.240 --> 38:50.240
that's because people used to have more time and used to pull together mm-hmm

38:50.240 --> 38:54.760
and maybe maybe there's something to that I don't know well it all say what

38:54.760 --> 38:58.160
you're taught what you're saying is something that I am actually trained in

38:58.160 --> 39:02.980
is I have had a degree in leadership and everything that you're touching on is

39:02.980 --> 39:07.320
exactly what I was trained on in in terms of Chris you're mentioning these

39:07.320 --> 39:12.240
small groups but also you're mentioning getting together face-to-face you know

39:12.240 --> 39:16.800
talking on the phone over as opposed to over each other's blogs that speaks to

39:16.800 --> 39:21.120
everything that I was trained you voice communication and personal

39:21.120 --> 39:27.560
communication is so much more important than say oh just fighting over blogs

39:27.560 --> 39:32.280
that's just ridiculous yeah well fighting over fighting is generally not

39:32.280 --> 39:36.120
very constructive anyway but it does show you that there's there's a point

39:36.120 --> 39:40.560
around which there is a problem and there's energy that means it can be

39:40.560 --> 39:45.360
solved mm-hmm and seriously I have a lot of hope both in the political sphere and

39:45.360 --> 39:53.920
and you know look at all the energy that there is in free software we can we can

39:53.920 --> 39:58.760
get past these things and we can solve the problems mm-hmm I really do I like

39:58.760 --> 40:03.200
that it's optimistic too I like that all right well I'm gonna move you and

40:03.200 --> 40:06.120
Eric up into the into the main group here and we'll just move on with the

40:06.120 --> 40:09.200
show and Valerie and Eric stick around and we'll we'll chew through a few more

40:09.200 --> 40:13.720
topics and I'll open up the mumble room to any questions for Valerie as well we

40:13.720 --> 40:17.920
have a couple of emails that I want to help some folks with some some switching

40:17.920 --> 40:20.360
to Linux problem so everybody stick around don't go anywhere we got a lot

40:20.360 --> 40:24.600
more show but first I want to thank our next sponsor and that's ting ting is

40:24.600 --> 40:29.960
mobile that makes sense my mobile service writer man I tell you it's never

40:29.960 --> 40:33.080
been a better time to be a ting customer the Nexus 6 is gonna be coming soon to

40:33.080 --> 40:37.120
the ting network and you can switch right now and start saving start saving

40:37.120 --> 40:40.080
right now by switching your team because you'll only pay for what your users no

40:40.080 --> 40:44.520
contract it's a flat six dollars for the line and then just your usage on top of

40:44.520 --> 40:48.640
that ting just takes your messages your minutes your megabytes whatever your

40:48.640 --> 40:53.400
usage is that's what you pay so I've got three lines right now it's six dollars a

40:53.400 --> 40:58.840
line I was just last night looking around at another cellular carry to see

40:58.840 --> 41:03.480
what they charge when you add another phone and it is forty freaking dollars a

41:03.480 --> 41:09.600
month just for another line unbelievable and then they make you sign a two-year

41:09.600 --> 41:14.360
contract on top of that no none of that anymore stop it you know that's not the

41:14.360 --> 41:16.680
way it should be that's not where you're gonna get value from your mobile

41:16.680 --> 41:21.720
provider go with ting go to linux.ting.com linux.ting.com not only is that

41:21.720 --> 41:24.840
like a little quick way of saying yo thanks for supporting Linux unplugged

41:24.840 --> 41:29.320
but it'll also get you a $25 credit towards your first ting device take $25

41:29.320 --> 41:32.440
off your first ting device then you've got a ting service you're only paying

41:32.440 --> 41:37.440
for your usage there's no contract no early termination fee and you've got a

41:37.440 --> 41:42.240
real person who will answer the phone if you call them try it right now 1855 ting

41:42.240 --> 41:47.460
FTW anytime between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. business hours then they got a real

41:47.460 --> 41:51.600
person there and that real person solves your problem because they're geeks and I

41:51.600 --> 41:55.080
mean that in a loving way you guys know that over at ting they're geeks like

41:55.080 --> 41:58.160
we're geeks and they can solve your problem that's why when you go you want

41:58.160 --> 42:00.440
to call somebody you want somebody that's really into the phones that they're

42:00.440 --> 42:03.080
talking about that's what so I like their approach about that and their

42:03.080 --> 42:07.280
dashboard they just gave it a brand new upgrade and it's better than ever they

42:07.280 --> 42:10.280
have such a great ting dashboard that gives you a full oversight of where

42:10.280 --> 42:14.760
you're at so go to linux.ting.com and I was doing some digging around using big

42:14.760 --> 42:19.520
data you know man how I you know how man I'm a big data analyst did you know

42:19.520 --> 42:23.720
did it oh absolutely like your side gig yeah big data Matt big data so I was

42:23.720 --> 42:29.800
looking at the big data over what turns out Linux unplugged audience is sneaky

42:29.800 --> 42:33.640
they've been picking up the Moto G I don't know where I'm they probably find

42:33.640 --> 42:37.880
themselves a CDMA sprint compatible Moto G and they've been bringing over to the

42:37.880 --> 42:42.880
ting network and any on their own map they went to linux.ting.com they got a

42:42.880 --> 42:47.120
$25 service credit they found the ting user forum where there's Moto G users in

42:47.120 --> 42:50.240
there talking about how to get it to work I'm not exaggerating when I say the

42:50.240 --> 42:54.520
Moto G is one of the most popular phones among Linux unplugged audience members

42:54.520 --> 42:57.760
and it's not even a phone ting sells directly this is a super cool about ting

42:57.760 --> 43:01.920
is they have a support network in their forums where you'll find people that are

43:01.920 --> 43:06.080
trying out things like Firefox OS Sailfish OS on different phones and ting

43:06.080 --> 43:09.320
doesn't go in there and go shut up stop talking they don't stamp it down in fact

43:09.320 --> 43:12.000
sometimes you see some of the employees and they're giving a few tips it's

43:12.000 --> 43:14.960
awesome and it just gives you a little insight into ting's culture so go to

43:14.960 --> 43:20.200
linux.ting.com to get started no more contract my friends no more get out of

43:20.200 --> 43:23.840
that contract they also got an early termination relief program if you is in

43:23.840 --> 43:28.720
a contract they'll pay up to $75 per line you gots to get cancelled go to

43:28.720 --> 43:34.800
linux.ting.com and a big big thank you to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged

43:34.800 --> 43:40.120
okay so let's see if we can help and then we'll get into one of our topics so

43:40.120 --> 43:46.480
I want everybody get your heads together Jose writes in he says hola Chris and

43:46.480 --> 43:49.400
everyone in the JBU community I'm writing to see if there's a way you guys

43:49.400 --> 43:53.240
can help me out before I go on sorry if I get any of the technical terms wrong

43:53.240 --> 43:57.080
I'm a forensic psychologist and I've started to learn more about computers

43:57.080 --> 44:01.280
and tech stuff so naturally because he's gone down the right path he's wound up

44:01.280 --> 44:05.400
at Linux so here's this problem I want to switch to a Linux distro full-time

44:05.400 --> 44:11.160
currently I'm a Mac and Windows 7 user this guy I love him already Mac and

44:11.160 --> 44:14.560
Windows 7 user this is our bread and butter right here however I've been

44:14.560 --> 44:20.160
playing around with Mint Debian Arch and Ubuntu on VirtualBox so far I love it

44:20.160 --> 44:25.520
there's just one huge issue that's keeping me from doing the change I think

44:25.520 --> 44:30.960
it's my HP laptops hardware every time that I try to boot from an ISO the

44:30.960 --> 44:36.080
kernel starts up I see it's do its thing and after the screen goes black it never

44:36.080 --> 44:40.980
comes back I've tried Arch, Mint, Ubuntu, Manjaro, Fedora, you name it the only two

44:40.980 --> 44:46.560
that I've managed to boot up and install is Mint using combat compatibility mode

44:46.560 --> 44:50.560
and Manjaro with hot with the hardware detection tool the problem is after

44:50.560 --> 44:55.360
installing it happens again starts to boot up I see some kernel stuff and then

44:55.360 --> 45:02.200
black I got an HP Pavilion with an AMD Radeon HD he doesn't say

45:02.200 --> 45:05.760
specifically which eight gigs of RAM he's got a SATA 640 gig blah blah blah

45:05.760 --> 45:10.960
what can I do is this a stupid mistake can you help me he just wants to switch

45:10.960 --> 45:15.920
and I know I don't have an HP anybody in the Mumble Room have an HP Pavilion laptop

45:15.920 --> 45:18.620
that has experienced any problems with booting up getting their display

45:18.620 --> 45:21.720
showing I know it's not super uncommon but it's not a problem I've had for a

45:21.720 --> 45:26.720
while I haven't had that exact problem in an in an HP book but I've had that

45:26.720 --> 45:29.760
problem numerous times on other laptops and the way I've always fixed it is

45:29.760 --> 45:38.040
booting with the no-mode set yeah I were kind of discussing here that almost

45:38.040 --> 45:41.840
sounds like he's having a UEFI secure boot problem you just need side of

45:41.840 --> 45:46.520
disabled secure boot or something well we said it's Windows 7 right well Windows

45:46.520 --> 45:52.280
7 well he's a Windows 7 user but the system may not have come with Windows 7

45:52.280 --> 45:57.080
probably no so the thing is I mean I've tried no I have a HP laptop it's a

45:57.080 --> 46:00.440
pavilion that has that issue every once in a while and I've actually had a

46:00.440 --> 46:07.120
couple computers that have a problem where HP has this weird flaw in some

46:07.120 --> 46:11.600
laptops where it's the display is actually working perfectly fine but the

46:11.600 --> 46:16.240
brightness level is completely off yeah so you have to add you have to

46:16.240 --> 46:21.040
manually add the brightness higher but you can actually do a script that will

46:21.040 --> 46:25.240
also automate it so a dog Z and the IRC says he has an HP pavilion laptop no

46:25.240 --> 46:31.840
mode does work no mode set to get his gentoo yeah that's so you add so here's

46:31.840 --> 46:35.680
what here's the problem is is I think Jose kind of got that when he did like

46:35.680 --> 46:39.000
compatibility mode it probably like the you know the option and grub probably

46:39.000 --> 46:42.800
just appends no mode set but the issue that he's been running into well maybe

46:42.800 --> 46:47.960
not but like he got that far but the problem is is he maybe could append it

46:47.960 --> 46:51.240
to the to the live CD but then he has to remember to also once the systems

46:51.240 --> 46:55.640
installed he's gonna have to hit II at the grub menu there and append it to his

46:55.640 --> 46:59.300
installed boot menu to until he gets his graphic situation worked out and then

46:59.300 --> 47:01.840
maybe if he gets a new graphical environment stalls the proprietary

47:01.840 --> 47:07.360
driver I don't know at least Bantu and Fedora if you when you boot when you're

47:07.360 --> 47:10.360
going through the installer if you if you append no mode set or if in a bunch

47:10.360 --> 47:13.440
I think you can actually at f6 and there's a there's a thing for options

47:13.440 --> 47:15.960
and you can choose it it will automatically add it to your grub

47:15.960 --> 47:19.080
config so it's persistent can you do that in a bunch too yeah you can I

47:19.080 --> 47:24.400
believe so yeah yeah yeah I think it's f6 and it whatever it says modes at the

47:24.400 --> 47:29.240
bottom and then you can just check no so you're saying if you hit f6 and you add

47:29.240 --> 47:32.760
that and then you boot up the installer the installer will then append that to

47:32.760 --> 47:37.000
the final installed version of grub yes but don't quote me on the f6 quote me on

47:37.000 --> 47:40.480
whatever it at the bottom look from yeah like it when it boots up you see English

47:40.480 --> 47:43.760
hit English and then it will give you an option install or boot to live

47:43.760 --> 47:47.200
environment at the very bottom there's F keys and whatever one says mode you

47:47.200 --> 47:51.840
click on that I think it's f6 it should be f6 the last time I installed it was f6

47:51.840 --> 47:56.080
the other thing you can do is just add it to the kernel perimeters in etsy default grub

47:56.080 --> 47:59.640
right yeah if he's already got it installed could do that boot to elastin

47:59.640 --> 48:05.080
but okay so what though once he's up and going what do we think a proprietary

48:05.080 --> 48:09.080
graphics driver would solve the problem long term so once once X starts you'd

48:09.080 --> 48:12.600
at least get a desktop again because it's never coming back and if he puts it

48:12.600 --> 48:17.160
in no mode set won't that be like low resolution once X starts up no with an

48:17.160 --> 48:19.720
AMD card I would go I would go proprietary just because you're already

48:19.720 --> 48:23.160
dealing with a problem set up as far as I'm concerned I AMD cards especially in

48:23.160 --> 48:26.560
laptops are just a nightmare okay I would go proprietary based on the

48:26.560 --> 48:30.200
experience I've had with AMD cards on laptops and I banged my head on this for

48:30.200 --> 48:39.680
so many years I would if it was me yeah that is that is the thing right if it's

48:39.680 --> 48:43.760
an older Radeon yeah and Rekai has a great suggestion the chat room as well

48:43.760 --> 48:49.920
it might be an issue of function f3 to manually up the brightness oh yeah maybe

48:49.920 --> 48:54.120
yeah but I might like Tripoli my S is Tripoli I actually have to go in and

48:54.120 --> 48:58.880
code in there's an actual a grub information you have to add in to

48:58.880 --> 49:01.960
actually get it to any of your function keys to work at all I mean including

49:01.960 --> 49:07.600
your brightness I have an HP Pavilion can't remember it's like a 17 inch

49:07.600 --> 49:12.160
laptop with a Radeon 5800 something in there I can't remember if I have this

49:12.160 --> 49:15.880
problem so I if I might power it up tonight and so it would be no mode set

49:15.880 --> 49:21.040
I'll add that to the boot options and now here's a foolproof way to know for

49:21.040 --> 49:23.860
sure if it's an if it's a brightness issue or if you're truly getting a no

49:23.860 --> 49:27.120
display server you take a flashlight I'm dead serious about this go into a

49:27.120 --> 49:31.080
dark room and with it booted up shine on there you'll see whether or not if it's

49:31.080 --> 49:34.320
on or not yeah yeah a couple people yeah it's a brand because the pixels are

49:34.320 --> 49:40.100
there the backlight just doesn't shine bright and I actually actually the

49:40.100 --> 49:44.440
backlight inverts so like when it boots up it sets the backlight to a hundred

49:44.440 --> 49:57.960
you guys deal with this crap seriously Jose what you do is just stick stick

49:57.960 --> 50:01.480
with Windows until you can afford to buy a computer just a run no I'm kidding I

50:01.480 --> 50:04.800
don't know though I mean like killing about these issues it feels like we're

50:04.800 --> 50:09.720
back in the 90s all of a sudden and I guess but it does develop good skills I

50:09.720 --> 50:12.680
guess the other thing I was gonna suggest is I wonder if he couldn't just

50:12.680 --> 50:16.480
hook up I mean maybe just a troubleshoot and maybe look at logs and stuff like

50:16.480 --> 50:22.440
that an external monitor I'm sure probably especially depends whether or

50:22.440 --> 50:26.740
not if he's going like you know s-video HDMI or VGA a lot of depending on the

50:26.740 --> 50:30.040
age of the laptop it could be VGA or s-video I mean just really depends but

50:30.040 --> 50:34.040
if it's a VGA or HDMI it'll probably work if it's s-video shoot yourself in

50:34.040 --> 50:39.160
the foot right now yeah all right we got we got two two bigger thicker topics I

50:39.160 --> 50:45.280
want to get to but first I just I wanted to just talk about Steam OS for a second

50:45.280 --> 50:50.020
because you know we have no idea what's gonna happen there but I like to

50:50.020 --> 50:54.160
speculate and Zach the Penguin wrote in he says hey guys long time since I wrote

50:54.160 --> 50:58.000
I was messing around with Steam's whole steam from a Windows computer thing

50:58.000 --> 51:01.840
which is pretty awesome and the thought popped into my head what if the

51:01.840 --> 51:05.120
long-term goal here is for valve to stream games to steam boxes like on

51:05.120 --> 51:08.560
live did it would completely eliminate the Windows only problem and adds value

51:08.560 --> 51:12.480
to steam to serve it as a service I know right now it's only a local network

51:12.480 --> 51:15.760
deal but it might be possible for steam to do this from their own servers in the

51:15.760 --> 51:20.720
future so here's what he's suggesting is that perhaps the LAN steam streaming we

51:20.720 --> 51:24.440
see today is the early groundwork for something that valve would then deliver

51:24.440 --> 51:28.800
over the internet down the road so you buy a steam box you don't have to have a

51:28.800 --> 51:35.240
local Windows PC they go all on live on you and they stream the game let's say

51:35.240 --> 51:38.240
let's say this is valve and if they do it they're gonna do it right so let's

51:38.240 --> 51:41.320
just let's assume it's gonna work right let's just take that as a grant as a

51:41.320 --> 51:48.320
granted we'll see all the piping challenges gone right do you think a

51:48.320 --> 51:53.200
this is something valve would consider Matt and B would this sort of solve a

51:53.200 --> 51:57.840
huge problem for steam machines as then you get all of these great native Linux

51:57.840 --> 52:02.680
games and if you want a legacy Windows game from the quote-unquote PC era or

52:02.680 --> 52:07.320
whatever they would call it we'll stream it to you from the valve online service

52:07.320 --> 52:10.840
do you think that you would you see him doing only two ways I see this working

52:10.840 --> 52:15.120
realistically speaking if I'm valve the only way I would reliably do this

52:15.120 --> 52:18.000
especially with games that might require a little bit more back-and-forth data

52:18.000 --> 52:22.040
would be to team up with Google and the reason why is because then you know for

52:22.040 --> 52:25.800
a fact that you've got a partner who has a vested interest in connectivity that

52:25.800 --> 52:28.960
you guys can kind of sync up what's needed to get that data back and forth

52:28.960 --> 52:37.240
boy that's dirty though but yeah Joe blows ISP emporium you know they may not

52:37.240 --> 52:40.600
care they may be like oh yeah you want us to help you know saturate our network

52:40.600 --> 52:43.200
yet but you can go buy this we're not gonna help you yeah so that would be the

52:43.200 --> 52:48.600
downside otherwise lower end games maybe you know I don't know right vault

52:48.600 --> 52:54.720
vault you say Nvidia tried it and it didn't work yes they if I remember

52:54.720 --> 53:01.120
correctly they tried making a it was displayed during e3 or something I

53:01.120 --> 53:08.840
believe it was sort of like a cloud hosting for your games where it was

53:08.840 --> 53:13.680
speculated like oh you can put it at your ISP and ISP can actually deliver it

53:13.680 --> 53:21.480
to you hmm yeah and it they store it for you and then stream it to you yes sort

53:21.480 --> 53:27.600
of like that like the these people can or companies can be oh we want to buy a

53:27.600 --> 53:34.360
rack or something of these dedicated processing and then rent it off to our

53:34.360 --> 53:39.680
customers yeah I don't see if steam ever wanting to get into that kind of

53:39.680 --> 53:42.880
infrastructure investment to want to render all these games and stream it to

53:42.880 --> 53:46.640
people and all the ISP agreements it just sounds like so much bureaucratic

53:46.640 --> 53:50.960
telco BS I just don't see anybody at valve having the will to suffer through

53:50.960 --> 53:55.040
it and it will never ever be comparable to local gameplay and I think valve at

53:55.040 --> 53:59.440
the end of the day cares a lot about the local gameplay pay play experience and

53:59.440 --> 54:02.680
they know that people are willing to pay to have slightly more powerful systems

54:02.680 --> 54:06.520
if they want to play those kinds of games I think it is lit I think the steam

54:06.520 --> 54:11.040
streaming is what it is what it is it is a transitionary tool to migrate from

54:11.040 --> 54:15.080
your old crappy piece of junk Windows PC that has all kinds of problems into this

54:15.080 --> 54:19.360
nice new steam box now I think it was a little bit envisioned during the time

54:19.360 --> 54:22.040
when everybody thought the tablets were gonna rule the world and PCs were going

54:22.040 --> 54:28.520
away but I think it still has some potential that's tough yeah that's a

54:28.520 --> 54:32.240
tough one all right so we we do have some big topics including Microsoft

54:32.240 --> 54:34.680
announcing that they just full-on love Linux now

54:34.680 --> 54:40.200
Satya Nadella I'm not dude I don't know did you see the picture did you know he

54:40.200 --> 54:44.960
was up on stage doing a live stream in Satya Nadella behind him on the

54:44.960 --> 54:49.520
projector has Microsoft Hearts Linux I got I got a picture for those of you

54:49.520 --> 54:52.480
watching the video version right there is there a knife sticking out of Tux's

54:52.480 --> 54:56.480
back or oh I see it now okay yeah isn't that something Microsoft Hearts Linux so

54:56.480 --> 55:01.200
we're gonna talk about what that means and where Microsoft is going with that

55:01.200 --> 55:05.760
and then also you might have heard about the initiative to fork the Debian

55:05.760 --> 55:11.800
project or at least some veterans are considering it and then forking Fedora

55:11.800 --> 55:15.520
came up but that conversation ended fairly quickly we'll talk about that in

55:15.520 --> 55:20.040
just a moment but first I want to tell you about Digital Ocean head over to

55:20.040 --> 55:24.520
digitalocean.com right now and get yourself ready for this one you're never

55:24.520 --> 55:28.880
gonna guess it unplugged October that's the promo code right all lowercase one

55:28.880 --> 55:32.440
word unplugged October we'll get you a $10 credit over Digital Ocean you're

55:32.440 --> 55:35.760
like what is Digital Ocean Chris because I live under a rock and do not know

55:35.760 --> 55:40.520
about super awesome services that are blowing up like crazy well I'm glad you

55:40.520 --> 55:44.160
asked me Digital Ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering

55:44.160 --> 55:47.840
the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server some of you can get

55:47.840 --> 55:53.680
started in about 55 seconds some of you can get started in about 32 seconds 22

55:53.680 --> 55:57.080
seconds it's nuts send them to me take a screenshot email I'm Chris at Jupiter

55:57.080 --> 56:01.680
broadcasting.com you guys is crazy and by guys I mean guys and gals just a

56:01.680 --> 56:07.080
little disclaimer here's what you get for five dollars per month 512 megabytes

56:07.080 --> 56:13.640
of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD yeah they're all SSD one CPU and a terabyte of blazing

56:13.640 --> 56:17.600
fast transfer why because Digital Ocean has tier one bandwidth providers at

56:17.600 --> 56:21.280
their data centers in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam and London

56:21.280 --> 56:27.120
I blows my mind you guys I log in there and I like updating my system just

56:27.120 --> 56:31.160
because I like seeing download numbers that high I'm not even joking at all

56:31.160 --> 56:35.200
it's that awesome and one of the great things about Digital Ocean is that

56:35.200 --> 56:39.640
dashboard it is super simple and intuitive but yet extremely powerful

56:39.640 --> 56:44.520
you can take snapshots backup migrations move transfer droplets to different

56:44.520 --> 56:49.680
users DNS management one-click installs of the entire LAMP stack GitLab WordPress

56:49.680 --> 56:55.360
all sitting on top of KVM it's really slick and I think the best part is that

56:55.360 --> 56:59.760
API and you can use that API to take advantage of some of those services on a

56:59.760 --> 57:03.120
much larger scale and Digital Ocean right now for a little while I don't

57:03.120 --> 57:06.320
know how long because it's crazy to me I think this is nuts but I understand why

57:06.320 --> 57:08.960
they're doing it because they're crazy about getting the quality of their

57:08.960 --> 57:12.480
tutorials up crazy Digital Ocean I tell you what they're willing to pay you up

57:12.480 --> 57:16.160
to $200 if you write a tutorial for them and they have editors that will work

57:16.160 --> 57:19.880
with you so you don't have to be like a wordsmith you don't got to be a

57:19.880 --> 57:23.080
wordsmith they'll work with you if you've got a great tutorial they'll pay

57:23.080 --> 57:26.200
you for it and that's Digital Ocean's commitment to getting the tutorials up

57:26.200 --> 57:29.880
on their site the highest quality possible because their dashboard is all

57:29.880 --> 57:33.960
about getting you going the way you even fund your account is about making it as

57:33.960 --> 57:38.560
simple and out of the way as possible the API all of it everything is about

57:38.560 --> 57:41.520
making sure you can get your infrastructure up and running as fast as

57:41.520 --> 57:44.120
possible to get on to your work and that's why they're trying to have the

57:44.120 --> 57:48.480
best documentation as well digitalocean.com use the promo code unplugged

57:48.480 --> 57:54.240
October to get a $10 credit you can try out that $5 rig for two months for

57:54.240 --> 57:57.720
absolutely free and a big thank you to Digital Ocean for sponsoring Linux

57:57.720 --> 58:02.360
unplugged okay Matt put your crazy hat on because you're not even gonna believe

58:02.360 --> 58:08.120
some of the ridiculous shenanigans going down right now so our buddy friend of

58:08.120 --> 58:12.680
the show Satya Nadella was up on stage today talking about how great Azure is

58:12.680 --> 58:17.320
and how wonderful Linux is with Azure he says did you guys know it's like peanut

58:17.320 --> 58:20.480
butter and chocolate that's not actually what he said but isn't it more like

58:20.480 --> 58:26.560
peanut butter and motor oil I mean he did talk a little bit about how great

58:26.560 --> 58:30.400
Azure has become and I just wanted to touch on this because this is the new

58:30.400 --> 58:34.320
Microsoft this is the Microsoft that is now competing with Linux not on the

58:34.320 --> 58:39.720
desktop but in these service like infrastructure type ways so a Microsoft

58:39.720 --> 58:43.840
has rolled out 300 major new features and services in the last 12 months to

58:43.840 --> 58:49.560
Azure bullet point number one there are 10,000 new Azure customers per week there

58:49.560 --> 58:55.640
are currently 350 million active active directory users on Azure so they have

58:55.640 --> 59:00.120
active directory up on Azure over 2 million developers are using Visual

59:00.120 --> 59:06.760
Studio Online to connect directly to Azure and customers are using once we're

59:06.760 --> 59:10.640
only using basic Azure services 60% are now using higher level services and

59:10.640 --> 59:18.800
number one core OS is now supported in Azure the container optimized Linux

59:18.800 --> 59:22.200
distribution with a minimal memory footprint is available starting today in

59:22.200 --> 59:30.760
the Azure marketplace so they are all about Linux guys is this okay so I'm an

59:30.760 --> 59:33.520
old fart when it comes to Microsoft I grew up in Microsoft I grew up in

59:33.520 --> 59:37.720
Microsoft's backyard I've been in and out of there checking judge you know

59:37.720 --> 59:41.280
chatting with friends for years I've watched them for a long time and the one

59:41.280 --> 59:44.560
thing that I'll tell you that really stood out is they are some competitive

59:44.560 --> 59:49.480
SOBs over there at Microsoft and can I really trust that they're all in with

59:49.480 --> 59:54.960
Linux or is this embrace and extend again Matt I go to you first personally

59:54.960 --> 59:59.680
I feel like that yes in the sense that they've tried like butting heads with

59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.480
you know the Linux direction the Linux ideas the Linux all the all anything to

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:06.160
do with Linux they tried that it didn't work that's kind of the bomber air I

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:12.000
think in this case they realized that if they're gonna remain relevant 10 15

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.800
years forward they're going to have to start playing nicer with their

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:19.680
neighbors so I think it's legit I think it's legit for selfish reasons they're

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.720
not there to be your buddy they would soon as you know they're not they're not

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:26.840
there for nice reasons they're there out of preservation I think and you keep in

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:31.120
mind I know people that are Microsoft admins that work for Microsoft events

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.520
that put on you know that like some behind-the-scenes stuff yeah it is but

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.840
because they're being put there and they're not thrilled about having to

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.080
learn this stuff they're literally in lockdown mode learning stuff in a hurry

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:46.080
because they're suddenly this has become a thing long term you know they're

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.560
they're hoping that they're basically just trying to remain relevant I think

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:52.800
that's the big the big piece of it will it matter 10 15 years down the road I

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:57.560
don't know yeah I think it's legitimate but it's not legitimate for the reasons

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.120
why people might think oh they've changed their mind and they're being

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.880
nice now it's not it at all it's survival honestly it's it's being able

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:09.200
to remain competitive with things that are frankly it's a it's a pragmatic you

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:14.240
know it's a pragmatic Microsoft it pretty much wimpy why is it that you and

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.920
I kind of feel a little dirty when we talk about this what is it why are we

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:22.720
why do we have this bias what's going on well it just it feels uncomfortable this

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:30.000
is not this is not Microsoft's area I used to work as an enterprise architect

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.320
for Windows platforms and before that I was a Unix admin and since then I've

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:41.080
worked exclusively in Linux and these are not the same market spaces and I

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:46.520
would be really interested to know how sort of the Windows admins feel about

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.960
this statement from Microsoft that they love Linux they must be shitting their

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.280
pants right now that is a good point I didn't think about it from that

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:59.200
perspective let's ask Valerie since she has some perspective on the matter

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.080
Valerie do you do you buy the new Microsoft or are you skeptical oh she's

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:07.720
not in the room right oh what do you think you take it

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:14.240
with the whole Microsoft thing um Adela really wants to go towards for if the

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:19.480
cloud infrastructure sure he knows that Linux does better in cloud than Windows

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:25.580
server does so I just think he's come to the realization and the company is

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:31.240
coming to the point where they can't serve survive with just Windows Server

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:35.480
alone they have to start branching out and using something like Linux and yeah

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:39.280
I think I think he's trying to take the company in the right direction in terms

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:44.160
of the service market yeah I think it's interesting to watch and it's more

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.920
options for more deployments of Linux that seems like a good thing okay anybody

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.120
else want to comment on that before we go to the next kind of crazy thing that

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:56.120
I was like what this week that just made me kind of flat-footed alright next one

01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:01.920
did you guys see the roll up your sleeves we may need to fork Debian site

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:07.760
did you guys catch this and I'll just read the first paragraph here we are

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:12.040
veteran which is bolded by the way veteran Unix admins and we are concerned

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:16.360
about what's happening to canoe slash Linux Debian edition and they're

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:22.440
considering forking the project I want to stop right here okay I think that's a

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:28.360
great idea I think fork it like instead of instead of delaying the progress of

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.760
the distribution or the direction yeah fork it and go your own way that seems

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.240
like that actually seems like the right approach to take especially if you're

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.440
never going to be satisfied with the system D version of Debian you know that

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:43.760
seems like a pretty reasonable response and I I hope they do I think the

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.160
competition would be good the thing that I can't get past it seems like a lot of

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:52.200
other people have picked up on it is is the language used there veteran Unix

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.680
admins and bolded that what that does is sort of projects old farts and I'm not

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.720
trying to be derogatory I'm just saying like from a messaging standpoint people

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.480
are saying that makes you sound like a bunch of old farts and it people sort of

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:08.600
write it off wow what do they care a bunch of stick in the muds and it's sort

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:13.400
of like it immediately makes people not take it very seriously well you know

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:17.000
looking at from my perspective I think it's a combination of quote-unquote old

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.520
farts as well as people that are of the mind that if it isn't broke why fix it

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.280
at least from their perspective and so you might have an inner mixture of

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:31.080
individuals in that space wimpy do you think they're just crazy well they're

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:34.800
exercising their right to free speech and all power to their elbow and

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:38.320
everything and if they want to have a go at forking Debbie and then I think

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.200
everyone should just stand back and let them get on with it and let themselves

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:48.840
burn yeah just just let's just try to take those two words together fork

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:57.160
Debian okay forking is hard I have first-hand experience of forking really

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:04.880
small projects in the comparison with Debian so they want to fork Debian just

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:09.440
think about all of the infrastructure that's involved there and all of the

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:16.680
platforms and ever it's just crazy nonsense and Ian Jackson's obviously got

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:22.560
an opinion about this and he posted his thing to the mailing list to suggest

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:27.840
that this was you know evaluated one last time very expressly stating he

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:32.600
didn't want to turn this into a system D versus whatever in its system debate

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:38.000
and then the internet explodes with system D inferno again this is so

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.800
disappointing it's just it's just laughable and and if they want to fork

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:51.600
Debbie and yeah do that thing I'm all for it I'm gonna watch that gleefully

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:57.280
from afar yeah I would be pretty skeptical myself and vault you think no

01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:01.400
no don't fork don't don't do that we need more resources as it is not less

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:07.320
people working on the same stuff well that's obviously the but my actual

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:11.920
practical point is no don't fork it find a way to accommodate you know multiple

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:18.600
in its systems in Debbie and if you want to for Debbie and yeah go on to me if

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.240
they're never gonna be interested in being involved with the project in that

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.480
state then they should just fork it you're not really losing resources

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.080
because if they weren't gonna cooperate anyways you're not losing them they

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.760
already they're already lost so let them go off and do their own thing well no

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:34.840
the thing is is that no well yeah okay if they want to fork Debbie and fork

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:39.880
Debian but there's their system BSD there's useless day yeah there are

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:46.120
shims around system D if they were really serious about coming up with an

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:50.400
alternative they would be looking at those projects in terms of developing

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.880
them and supporting them within the Debbie and community rather than saying

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:58.520
we're gonna fork Debbie and which is frankly insane oh yeah you're talking

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:06.280
the biggest distribution there is the mother of most of our distributions yeah

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:11.400
that's a huge undertaking if you think would you do a would you do a complete

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:16.960
fork or would it be more like sort of a clone of straight-up Debbie and where

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:20.800
you're just constantly swapping out the system D parts for something else well

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:24.760
one thing that comes to mind that I want to point out here is that now last time

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:28.280
I checked most computers with blogging platforms attached don't have

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:33.520
breathalyzers ready so it's entirely possible they were fit-shaped and they

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:41.040
got on a year maybe no I'll tell you I'll tell you who's a little s-faced how

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:49.000
about this one how about this one fork fedora org shall we fork fedora not

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.040
really it's doing great maybe we're not veteran enough that's great that's

01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:01.000
really that is fantastic they sound like they're really housed you know what yeah

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:09.120
yeah they're really housed right yeah no Matt did prove that that he did

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.400
actually later up on G plus I think like ten people on the whole internet but

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:15.960
still we exist yeah that actually is getting housed as a term I don't it's

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:19.360
like got a ridiculous origin though or something I don't remember it's

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:30.760
abbreviated from you know okay but this fork business like shall we fork

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:36.040
fedora time to fork Debian I've never well actually we have the only time I

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:40.200
think we've ever seen the Linux community this riled up and just unable

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:45.760
to just move forward for a long time was like the Microsoft Novell deal where you

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.400
had boycott Novell prop up and you had all this stuff and there was such

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:55.240
decisive lines and it went on for like two years but really not I mean you know

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.480
it was it was not as bad two years but it really went on for a while and this

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:02.080
is like we haven't had a good old classic drama like this since then it's

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:07.240
like the good old days again who are all right I remember the old Novell thing

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:11.640
and I'm sitting there going thinking that's great I'm gonna go watch TV now

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.280
because I'm just like this is gonna be a week-long thing and people are gonna

01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:19.120
blow it over yeah that still cracks me up just all right wimpy go ahead ask the

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:27.320
question that's on everybody's mind well I'm putting myself out there again is

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:32.760
the bloke that says you know system D is really quite good but I I often wonder

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:37.760
reading what some of the people say about system D and also listening to

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:42.880
other podcasts and what they have to say about system D and I'm left with the

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:48.600
impression of you've never actually used it not only have you never actually used

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:53.280
it you've never actually sat down and written a unit file you're not a package

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.440
maintainer you haven't had to deal with init scripts and you haven't seen the

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:03.920
benefits of migrating package from an init script to system D and and the

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:08.640
many other benefits of system D now I can appreciate that people are very very

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.160
firm in their opinion that they like the way things are and and there's a place

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:20.800
for that but I think a lot of the speculation and commentary about system

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:25.120
D is being had by people who simply do not know what they're talking about now

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:30.000
I'm not suggesting necessarily that fork Debian falls into this camp they would

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.120
claim to be seasoned Linux administrators and every and veterans

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:40.480
quite so maybe they do know what they're talking about and they have legitimate

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.080
reasons as to why they feel system D is not going to to suit them but there are

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:49.200
some podcasts where I've heard them debating the the various init systems

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:54.280
and talking about the pros and cons and then admitting partway through there you

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:59.200
know slacking off of system D they've never used it yes think well how are you

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:05.320
qualified to have an opinion my my so my stance on the system D discussion I

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:09.240
think if you look over the history of this show has an arc where I'm pretty

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:13.160
neutral don't give a crap and then I become pretty pro system D and then I

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:16.520
get to a point where I was a little belligerent to people who didn't who

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:19.880
didn't seem to think going forward with system is a good idea because the reason

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.000
I've I don't know belligerence right word but I'll just label it that the

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.320
reason why I felt that way is because as as a sys admin of like 14 15 years there

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:35.480
are literally things that I see in system D that I think if I had that when

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:41.360
I was managing servers I would have hated my job so much less like it's not

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:46.320
just small stuff that I see in system D some of the things that system D brings

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.920
as a whole I see as fundamentally necessary for Linux to remain

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:56.080
competitive at scale like without those things and with and without those things

01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:01.440
free BSD could easily eat our lunch really because essentially we're we're

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:06.400
just as capable and but system D offers so many things and the problem is you

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:10.800
really don't know how important they are until you've deployed Linux at scale or

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:15.040
you have a you know a very network demanding thing or you have something

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:19.320
that has to be as absolutely minimal as possible and support socket activation

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:22.640
or you need something that's integrated with namespaces all these things that

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:27.480
are edge cases but together matters so much and may and are so important to

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:32.080
keeping Linux competitive not just on the server but also in mobile that when

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:36.600
you when you come when you argue against system D what you have to realize is you

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:40.680
have to really come with something that's extremely compelling because what

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:45.560
you are arguing for is essentially removing what I in my personal opinion I

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:48.360
and I'm not saying it's right but in my personal opinion are fundamentally

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.880
critical features to keep Linux competitive so if you're gonna say no

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:56.080
system do you've got to have an answer for those problems and and yeah I don't

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:59.640
think you and I can have a debate about this because I think we're clearly on

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.800
the same side of the fence and we've got we've got our personal opinions it

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:08.600
sounds like a largely similar reasons so really what we need is somebody to step

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:13.840
up and tell us why we're wrong and I I think part of it is some of the more

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:18.200
vocal people debating this are not the same people who are as impacted by it

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:21.600
like I think there's a group of people that care a lot but they're just not as

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:26.960
vocal about debating it I think I'm trying to because I get emails that seem

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.960
really well reasoned but I even then I've still not been convinced the

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:36.180
biggest things that convinced me that it might be a problem are always the what

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:40.080
if scenarios and I think yeah if that happens we could have a problem but

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:45.920
that's not a today problem that's a what-if problem anyway so how do we get

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.200
talking about oh yeah the forks yeah so there you go the system D conversation

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:52.680
once again has been stirred back up by these project forks and you know what's

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.760
interesting is you check the Linux forms like r slash Linux and just general

01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:00.720
discussion forums and people are constantly still asking about it it is

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.720
genuinely a topic that even though it seems like we've talked about it at

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:08.840
nauseam people still seem to care about I guess that's sort of the fun of being

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:13.000
a Linux user is you get to care about such nitty-gritty things like your

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.560
display compositor and system D and all that stuff so I guess that's why we're

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.480
that's why we do it all right well so you probably already know this but Linux

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:27.640
action show won't be live on Sunday it's gonna be on Monday and I think I don't

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:31.160
know if Ange told you Matt but I think we're gonna try start at two o'clock so

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:35.680
you probably want to get to the studio around 1 30 because then we're gonna try

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.200
to fit in a foe too and then we'll be able to show all the highlights from

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.760
Ohio Linux fest so if you're gonna be in Ohio this weekend come say hi to some

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.520
of us there some of the crew will be there and we'll be going out and getting

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.800
our party on in the evening so join us for that as well and then join us for

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.800
Linux action show Monday afternoons we'll have the time in your local times

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.760
and over at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar and Eric is reminding me

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.640
dutifully so that you can also say hi to him at seagull is there anything you

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:10.520
want to plug about that Eric say hi to Eric and Valerie at the sea it's seagull

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:16.160
right that's how you say it yes se a GL and you can find it at just google for

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.040
seagull but I think it's like seagull org and it's a it's a Seattle Linux

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:23.440
users group meetup right or who's put on it's a Seattle GNU Linux conference

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:28.000
thank you thank you I don't know why I can't remember that but anyways there's

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.600
a ton of stuff going on so come out and say hi to us Valerie thanks a bunch for

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.960
coming on and I can't wait for our next meetup maybe in December or something

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:41.360
like that yeah is there anything you want to mention before we wrap up we

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:47.920
have a like a couple of minutes you know what you know why is because we we we

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:51.920
talked about it quite a bit on Sunday show so we just kind of got our we just

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.120
kind of got our come into one but if there's anything you wanted to mention

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:59.560
or specifically with the 14.10 release have that we have the we have the

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:07.000
release it's going to be pretty stable now it's coming after a long-term work

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:13.520
but so we usually are wild and crazy this time we are doing an alternate ISO

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:19.480
for the plasma 5 stuff oh awesome people should not except expect that to be

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:25.360
completely stable but we sure would love to have some testing and we don't know

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:30.960
if it will be ready six months from now for a release and without testing it

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:36.640
won't be so it's actually that plasma 5 ISO is what I used for Sunday's review

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:41.340
when I did that so that's so it's reasonably stable some people have had

01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:45.280
some problems getting things to work getting it set up but once they get it

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:53.280
set up it's pretty cool awesome oh my god I need it and bug reports so and if

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.920
people wanted to connect with you online what's the best place for them to find

01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:07.480
you in IRC or Valerie at kde.org b a l o r i e dot k error at kde.org awesome

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:10.800
all right well I look forward to our next meetup and I'll remember to

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.360
schedule time for beers next time I will not make that mistake again Valerie I

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:20.080
will not make that mistake again all right well that'll wrap us up for

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:24.080
today's episode of Linux unplugged will be we our regular Linux unplugged time

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:28.080
next week I don't think the Ohio Linux fest will affect our our regular

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.320
scheduled Linux unplugged so should be on Tuesday which is at 2 p.m. Pacific you

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:36.360
go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar to get that converted to your

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:41.000
local time well Matt so it's gonna be a little extra longer as you're gonna have

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.560
to go an extra day before you get to see the hair again are you gonna be all

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:48.600
right I think I can get by you know what you need to do is just like marathon a

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.840
TV show you got Saturday and Sunday to just really pound through something and

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:56.960
just show up Monday ready to do a show all right everyone well thanks so much

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.960
for tuning this week's episode of Linux unplugged don't forget we really want

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:03.360
your feedback go to Jupiter broadcasting comm click the contact link choose

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:06.480
unplug from the drop-down Linux action show dot reddit comms another great

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:08.640
place to go all right everyone thank you so much for

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:38.480
tuning this week's episode see you right back here next Tuesday

01:18:38.640 --> 01:19:01.360
oh yeah oh oh yeah there we go all right so value will record the post show

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:05.200
too if there's any other couple into a bits you want to get in there while

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:08.120
everybody go to JB titles calm right now and vote JB titles calm everybody vote

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:37.960
all right so yeah there you go there you go once again we got in another system

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:44.280
D conversation where wimpy and I painfully agreed with each other we need

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:52.000
to encourage some people to have a rational argument for not system day

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.320
because I think both you and I have different similar but different reasons

01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:01.760
as to why it suits what we're doing and we really need somebody yeah well it's

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:07.000
quite a little bit isn't it oh I know there are alternatives and I'm familiar

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.520
with some of them and I've obviously used a lot of them but I need somebody to

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:20.840
remind me why is there better because I've forgotten do we really think oh one

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.760
second I want to spawn I'm good no no no the fork fedora thing was a joke it's

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:28.440
not it's just a joke but no we're not yeah I still want all right sorry I

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:32.320
didn't mean to interrupt go ahead I think I was just gonna say one of the

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:38.040
districts I tried recently was um Phoenix it's a live CD distributor that

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:45.480
uses run it that's right and it's very functional Microsoft Hearts Linux fork

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:57.240
you Debbie in fork it all I like that too yeah so I've used running in the

01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:02.040
past for some for some for demonizing some processes because it has some

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:06.800
features that traditional in it's didn't have so yeah that's very good

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:10.800
Valerie you should twist Eric's arm to leave the mumble info behind so you

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.560
could join us in the future whenever you feel like it yeah I actually did paste

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:19.160
that into the Katie could go into off topic chat room did I not oh good good

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.200
yeah so whenever there's anything kaboom to related that you want to get the word

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:28.000
out about or or Katie or anything you can you could always just pop in the

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:35.480
mumble room and we'll give you the floor for a couple of minutes okay so let's go

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:41.800
to JB titles and so are we liking for forks sake we like that not Katie or not

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:52.280
to fork Debbie in I like the wimpy is like think about that fork yeah quite

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:56.720
the task so tonight and you and I are gonna mail out hopefully a whole bunch

01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:01.360
of boxes of swag and stuff we're gonna bring to Ohio Linux fest so that should

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:05.560
be cool Colonel Linux are you in here I am oh you haven't said anything for so

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:10.680
long I thought maybe you left I missed you no I'm still here that's the base so

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:17.280
yeah so I didn't want to come off too strong in the recording but I'm like 100

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:22.120
percent sure that no modes that will fix that guy's laptop okay cool yeah and I

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:27.160
see I thought I see the reason why I for some reason I thought no meds no mode set

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:32.640
just sort of put X in the light crappy mode mmm it's funny I actually couldn't

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:45.000
tell you what it does it stops kernel mode switching happening it doesn't do

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.280
the resolution detection and auto resolution adjustment it just goes with

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:56.000
the basic BIOS so but why is it not being resolved when X starts if it's

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.880
that if it's the console resolution then how come when X is starting it's not

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:08.000
fixing the problem because wouldn't that whoa so that was the only thing I

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.280
wasn't sure about is it it seemed like to me that if no mode set would fix it

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:16.560
then it then it shouldn't be happening next that the only thing I thought the

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.440
only thing but I don't know I don't use no I don't really ever have to I

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:22.560
seriously have bought system 76 laptops for so long now that I haven't had to

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.840
fight with someone I tell you what here's here's how sure I am here's how

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:28.920
sure I am you put a filter on that guy's name if you send you another email

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:34.320
saying no mode set fixes it you pick out a beer you want I'll send you a 12-pack

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:40.320
no I'm looking right now there's other people talking about and talking about

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:44.120
no mode set on askabuntu.com too well here's here's the other thing like for

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:50.600
this is for my machine it will not run a kernel older than 3.12 efficiently 3.11

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:55.600
I have to use no mode set otherwise it doesn't render graphics at all several

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:58.640
people like Recon Chomper saying could be a brightness issue too so let's see

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:02.560
all right so for fork's sake is currently at the top here so we can just

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:06.560
go with that I suppose all right Noah Noah can I ask you a question about

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:14.400
your Ubuntu unity review yeah you you mentioned about crypt setup can you just

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:20.920
talk me through what you saw exactly because I've got some background in this

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:28.040
and I just want to hear what you saw precisely what I saw well okay so excuse

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.160
me if this is a little too dumbed down I apologize but so I opened my laptop I

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:38.040
clicked on my encrypted drive and it said unable to decrypt kernel Linux or

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:44.240
well slash media slash kernel Linux no crypt setup found and then I had to get

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.280
on to Wi-Fi pseudo apt-get install crypt setup and then I was able to then

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:54.720
decrypt my hard drive so so this wasn't at boot time when Plymouth should give

01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:00.360
you the password from put your passphrase in correct however the fact

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:03.960
that that option exists that I can encrypt my hard drive at boot time means

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:08.560
that the package which was I found out was all of like 4 megabytes is clearly

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:13.760
included in the install media so why not just install that what what possible

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:19.200
reason would I not want the ability to decrypt my decrypt encrypted drives like

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:27.000
what advantage does that serve it sounds to me like that's something he ain't a

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:36.360
few people to fix like ha ha if Popey was here as if so I've been chasing

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:40.560
people around at canonical for two months about this issue now and I've

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.720
been pestering Popey until he's probably bored of hearing from me because

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:48.960
anything I mentioned now is by the way you can't decrypt full disk encryption

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:53.040
with the new version of Plymouth and it's one of the things that I attempted

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:58.560
to fix in the current release candidate of Ubuntu Marte I have effectively fixed

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:03.480
it it's actually a Plymouth bug and I think canonical have just released a

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:08.400
fix for it this evening so Crip setup does get installed the issue is is that

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.160
Plymouth doesn't pass the passphrase through properly or wasn't passing it

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:15.600
through properly well in this the absolutely ridiculous thing is I

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:19.160
understand like so open SSH server doesn't doesn't come with default but

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:22.520
that I get right because there's a security implication I cannot think of a

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.360
one single reason of how having that package there other than the fact that

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:32.120
it occupies four megabytes of disk space which even even in today's world of

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:37.080
solid-state drives that are ridiculously small still is is negligible so it just

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:40.080
infuriated me I had four hours I couldn't get to any of my files and I'm

01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:47.640
like 12 before 1210 1304 and 1310 all had Crip setup installed by default I

01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:51.920
guess I didn't check it 1404 does but really like what the hell guys yeah Crip

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.280
setup is installed by default that's not the issue it's the fact that Plymouth

01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:01.760
doesn't invoke it correctly to decrypt your drive when you chosen to do full

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:07.080
disk encryption and like I say there's been three of us in the Ubuntu Marte

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:13.000
team aware of this for months and we've been adding logs and messages to I don't

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.480
know about eight or nine bugs in launchpad about this for months now and

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:23.040
it's just got fixed today well at the same time Plymouth has quite a bit of

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:29.120
breakage I mean even in arch like 0 9 0 the version that's on the AOR it's

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:33.160
broken in broken in fedora it's broken upstream it's frankly not fit for

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:42.600
purpose so I've back ported 0.8.8 and giving it a version of 0.9.0 plus really

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:57.000
0.8.8 yeah I switched to mate the Ubuntu mate edition I'm at a mate mate

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.880
hi dang it dang it all right maybe we should wrap but I wanted to leave with

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:06.440
this if anybody in the Ohio area who's listening to this knows of some great

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:11.640
places right around where the Linux fest is gonna be at that we could go to some

01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:15.840
holes in the wall or something like that tweet him at me at Chris Elias you got

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:18.720
it you're my intelligence network I need I need people on the ground is what I'm

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:23.280
saying I need like people there boots on the ground taking care of the situation

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:28.500
they're they're they're not combat boots though they're just there as advisors to

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:39.480
advise me about Ohio Columbus any boobs on the ground would be great too if it's

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:43.920
not if it's not right around the hotel that also should be okay because we have

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:50.880
vehicular transportation yeah all right so I so Chris yes before you dashed you

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.160
want do you want one little bit of inside information always but I'm

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:58.960
recording wait do I have to stop recording okay no no you can record you

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:02.120
don't put it out necessarily and it's me I'm not gonna give away any names because

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:07.080
I don't know them all yet all right but you remember the whole gun was buck

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:12.320
deployment on open Sousa and Marte and that good stuff yeah small town of 50,000

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:15.720
people and you asked me what I knew about that and I said I don't know very

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:20.480
much what I know about the next one the next one is going to be in Germany the

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.980
