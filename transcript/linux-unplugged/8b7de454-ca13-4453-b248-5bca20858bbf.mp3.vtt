WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.500
I'm already lightheaded because I'm so nervous.

00:02.500 --> 00:03.300
Nervous?

00:03.300 --> 00:06.100
Yeah, we should all just take a little moment before the show, you know?

00:06.100 --> 00:06.700
I am.

00:06.700 --> 00:08.100
Calm ourselves, get ready.

00:08.100 --> 00:09.400
I am legit nervous.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.600
Chris, you don't get nervous.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.500
Come on.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.000
I don't normally get nervous, but I-

00:13.000 --> 00:14.100
You got this.

00:14.100 --> 00:17.200
I don't know what it is, but every now and then, for me, it's-

00:17.200 --> 00:18.800
Well, yeah, no, I'm-

00:18.800 --> 00:19.900
We'll see if I make it through the episode.

00:19.900 --> 00:20.500
I'm pretty nervous.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.600
I probably might be stumbling all over myself.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.800
You got this for me, Wes?

00:23.800 --> 00:24.400
I'll do my best.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.200
You just jump in.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.600
Come on, you're a pro.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.800
No, no, I know, but-

00:28.800 --> 00:31.000
It's like getting in a new relationship.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.300
Mm-hmm.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.100
But we all get to watch.

00:34.100 --> 00:34.800
It really is.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.200
Like, there's a commitment.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.900
There's a huge commitment that goes on for a very long time.

00:39.900 --> 00:43.700
You will have to stay with this thing through good and bad.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.400
All right, let's just start the show.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.300
I'm just going to sit here and be a nervous wreck.

00:47.300 --> 00:48.500
I'll just sit here and dwell on it.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.700
No, I'm nervous.

00:50.700 --> 00:59.500
I'm sorry.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.600
Hello, and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

01:02.600 --> 01:06.400
that's being co-hosted by someone who's totally composed

01:06.400 --> 01:08.000
and really has their stuff together today.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
My name is Chris.

01:09.000 --> 01:09.800
I always do.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.400
My name is Wes.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.100
What about me, though?

01:13.100 --> 01:14.300
I'm saying me.

01:14.300 --> 01:15.700
You always do.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.000
Wes, I'm just going to let you take over if I go off the rails,

01:18.000 --> 01:20.200
but before we go any further into the show,

01:20.200 --> 01:23.000
which is I'm super excited about today.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.200
We have some huge news, but we also have a great topic.

01:26.200 --> 01:29.300
I want to give a shout out to both Mr. Cheese and Alex.

01:29.300 --> 01:30.000
Hello, gentlemen.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.500
Hey.

01:30.500 --> 01:30.900
Hello.

01:30.900 --> 01:32.000
How's it going, internet?

01:32.000 --> 01:32.600
Hello.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.300
Hi, nice to see you.

01:34.300 --> 01:37.000
And then I want to say time-appropriate greetings

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
to that virtual log.

01:38.000 --> 01:38.900
Hello, Mumble Room.

01:38.900 --> 01:40.100
Hello.

01:40.100 --> 01:40.900
Ho, ho, ho.

01:40.900 --> 01:41.600
Hello.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.500
Hello to Brent and Elle.

01:43.500 --> 01:47.900
And I'm going to say Stinky Karate?

01:47.900 --> 01:49.100
Tech Mav and Turf.

01:49.100 --> 01:49.900
Is that Stinky?

01:49.900 --> 01:51.700
I don't even want to know because that's too good.

01:51.700 --> 01:52.200
OK, yeah.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.100
Let's not fix it.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.800
For my defense, that screen is across the room.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.800
Oh, and Tech Mav just joining in right there at the end.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.300
Hi, there.

02:00.300 --> 02:01.300
Oh, and Carl, too.

02:01.300 --> 02:02.600
Well, hello.

02:02.600 --> 02:03.600
You guys are the best.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.700
Hello, everybody.

02:04.700 --> 02:05.900
Good to see you trickling in.

02:05.900 --> 02:07.600
We have a huge show today.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.300
I'm very happy to have you here.

02:09.300 --> 02:11.000
Let's start with some community news.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.300
There's some items that we want to cover.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.500
Recently, Linux has been getting a hard time

02:15.500 --> 02:17.600
for its low memory handling.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.200
Recently?

02:18.200 --> 02:20.400
I mean, haven't we complained about that for years?

02:20.400 --> 02:22.400
OK, well, forever.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.100
But I mean, just like recently, I saw two different people

02:25.100 --> 02:29.100
writing about how Linux falls apart in low memory situations.

02:29.100 --> 02:31.300
Particularly, these are server workloads

02:31.300 --> 02:34.100
where it's something that is just

02:34.100 --> 02:36.100
a massive load that is unexpected.

02:36.100 --> 02:38.600
And then even once you recover the memory,

02:38.600 --> 02:43.200
the system still never really comes back to its full performance,

02:43.200 --> 02:44.800
I suppose.

02:44.800 --> 02:49.300
Well, that may soon be a thing of the past, Mr. Payne.

02:49.300 --> 02:51.600
This is some good news.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.700
There is a project that has been started by an individual.

02:54.700 --> 02:57.500
I'm going to let you try to guess that pronunciation.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.000
Bastian, what do you think?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.100
I think you're spot on.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.500
You do not.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.500
You do not.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.100
You're just going to let me take it.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.000
I see how it is.

03:06.000 --> 03:06.500
I see.

03:06.500 --> 03:07.400
I'm on to you.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.900
Anyways, he's working on a project

03:08.900 --> 03:12.100
that's very similar to Android's low memory killer daemon.

03:12.100 --> 03:12.900
Yeah, absolutely.

03:12.900 --> 03:16.400
And just last year, Facebook released something similar.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.500
We talked about it on TechSnap377.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.900
They're out of memory daemon.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.800
And the idea is just try to be helpful.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.500
Don't totally rely on the kernel.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.100
Here's a little daemon that can look for, monitor,

03:28.100 --> 03:31.000
expect situations where there is this sort of system

03:31.000 --> 03:32.200
and memory pressure.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.000
And then fire off signals to let applications know,

03:35.000 --> 03:38.100
hey, if you have memory that you can give back to the system,

03:38.100 --> 03:39.900
now would be a great time to do so.

03:39.900 --> 03:42.900
Sort of seems odd that we don't have that.

03:42.900 --> 03:45.700
I guess we've always just relied on the kernel to go kill things.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.900
Yeah, I mean, we needed someone in the middle

03:47.900 --> 03:50.100
to sort of pass the note.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.500
Yeah, so you know what?

03:51.500 --> 03:53.000
The only thing I think this is lacking

03:53.000 --> 03:56.500
is a deep integration with systemd.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.000
Oh, just wait.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.400
OK, well, while we're talking about performance and stuff,

04:01.400 --> 04:03.800
I just had to squeeze this one in, too.

04:03.800 --> 04:07.300
It appears that Fedora is switching to the BFQ.io

04:07.300 --> 04:09.700
scheduler for better responsiveness.

04:09.700 --> 04:12.300
This is something that I've toyed with on and off.

04:12.300 --> 04:16.800
If you've ever experienced some odd leg in your desktop UI

04:16.800 --> 04:19.100
when you're, say, hitting your disk pretty hard,

04:19.100 --> 04:24.100
this is something that BFQ, I have been led to believe,

04:24.100 --> 04:25.400
can make a big difference with.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.300
However, I've never really noticed a massive difference

04:28.300 --> 04:30.000
myself when I tested it.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.900
Well, you know, there's some interesting quotes here

04:31.900 --> 04:32.900
of some numbers.

04:32.900 --> 04:36.800
Under load, BFQ can load applications up to 20 times

04:36.800 --> 04:39.700
as fast as any other I.O. scheduler.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.100
Soft real-time applications like video playback,

04:42.100 --> 04:43.700
that can benefit, too, if you ever, you know,

04:43.700 --> 04:47.000
stutter in while you're trying to write a USB drive.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.300
There's some interesting benefits.

04:48.300 --> 04:52.300
Although, if you already have a super fast NVMe drive,

04:52.300 --> 04:54.000
well, this isn't enabled for you.

04:54.000 --> 04:54.600
There's no point.

04:54.600 --> 04:55.600
You're already too fast.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.200
Yeah, that's probably what it is.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.300
Because my main OS drive is NVMe.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.200
But then, like, by large storage disk,

05:02.200 --> 05:03.600
some of them are still spinning REST.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.100
So maybe it'd be useful there.

05:05.100 --> 05:05.600
It is nice.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.600
This is one of the things that many interested sort

05:07.600 --> 05:10.700
of super users have been tuning, tweaking, playing with.

05:10.700 --> 05:13.100
Kind of neat to see Fedora actually adopting it,

05:13.100 --> 05:14.300
making it more mainstream.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.900
OK, well, let's talk about something

05:15.900 --> 05:18.500
that everyone on the crew is very excited about,

05:18.500 --> 05:20.700
and that is the Pinebook Pro.

05:20.700 --> 05:23.500
Pre-orders have been, well, there's been, like,

05:23.500 --> 05:25.100
one window already, Cheesy?

05:25.100 --> 05:28.800
Yeah, so there was the initial window

05:28.800 --> 05:31.300
where if you were a forum member,

05:31.300 --> 05:33.700
and you had been for the last three months,

05:33.700 --> 05:35.900
then you could get in the pre-order queue for the first

05:35.900 --> 05:36.800
round.

05:36.800 --> 05:41.200
Now they've opened it up so that anyone can get into the queue.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.000
You don't have to have been a forum member for x amount

05:44.000 --> 05:45.500
of months or anything like that.

05:45.500 --> 05:46.700
$199.

05:46.700 --> 05:49.100
They're coming a long way on the machine.

05:49.100 --> 05:52.300
It's a little different than the original Pinebook, obviously.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.500
It's a magnesium alloy casing.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.300
Keyboard's supposed to be a lot better.

05:56.300 --> 05:59.200
Not supposed to have that flex like it did before.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.200
An NVMe adapter for it, so you can

06:01.200 --> 06:05.200
toss an additional NVMe drive in there if you want to.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.100
But it's gotten a lot of attention,

06:07.100 --> 06:09.700
and I think that it's going to be a really great little machine

06:09.700 --> 06:11.200
whenever it comes out.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.600
I'm waiting on mine to ship.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.500
I think they said toward the end of October

06:14.500 --> 06:16.200
is when I'll receive mine.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.400
So I'm really looking forward to that

06:19.400 --> 06:23.900
and hoping that none of our American politics

06:23.900 --> 06:26.100
will affect me getting my Pinebook,

06:26.100 --> 06:29.100
because I'm going to be very frustrated if that happens.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.300
I want an unboxing video from you.

06:31.300 --> 06:32.700
I want a full cheese rundown.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.900
Yeah, I'll do it like Unbox Therapy for you.

06:34.900 --> 06:35.700
I'll be honest here.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.500
I've never really followed the Pinebook that closely.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.700
I just love a quick, too long, haven't followed.

06:41.700 --> 06:42.200
What is it?

06:42.200 --> 06:43.500
Why should I care about it?

06:43.500 --> 06:45.400
So it's essentially a single board computer

06:45.400 --> 06:49.200
that's thrown inside of a laptop.

06:49.200 --> 06:55.700
It uses the Rockchip 3399 SoC, which is a pretty powerful SoC.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.400
A little bit better, some may argue,

06:57.400 --> 07:00.300
a little bit better than what's in the Raspberry Pi.

07:00.300 --> 07:01.300
The Pi 4?

07:01.300 --> 07:07.400
Yeah, 4 gigs of DDR4, IPS display, 1080.

07:07.400 --> 07:11.500
It does have a hardware switch.

07:11.500 --> 07:15.600
The firmware in the keyboard is programmed

07:15.600 --> 07:20.000
to disconnect Bluetooth and wireless.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.200
Some say that the way that they're

07:22.200 --> 07:24.500
using their kill switch for their radios

07:24.500 --> 07:28.900
is actually better than, say, other distributors

07:28.900 --> 07:31.700
like the way Purism does it, where it's not

07:31.700 --> 07:35.100
necessarily a mechanical switch that could break on you.

07:35.100 --> 07:37.100
I think they're still working out a few kinks as

07:37.100 --> 07:39.900
far as if you turn the radios off

07:39.900 --> 07:42.700
and you put your machine into spin mode,

07:42.700 --> 07:45.200
getting back out of the spin mode and turning the radios on

07:45.200 --> 07:46.500
is kind of an issue right now.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.600
But essentially what it is is a single board computer put

07:50.600 --> 07:55.500
into the housing of a laptop with 4 gigs of DDR4,

07:55.500 --> 07:57.600
a pretty powerful CPU.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.400
Something that, in theory, if they get it down

08:00.400 --> 08:01.900
to what they're talking about, which

08:01.900 --> 08:07.500
is like 0.25 watt draw on suspend,

08:07.500 --> 08:11.000
then they say 100 hours of battery life,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.140
but I would just be stoked to get a good solid 8 or 10

08:14.140 --> 08:15.000
hours out of it.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.600
Worth noting, USB-C charging and the screen size 14.1 inches.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.200
Could be a great little remote machine.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.900
It also has video out over USB-C as well.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.400
So there's some demo videos out there

08:28.400 --> 08:31.800
that Lucas has recorded that I can link to in the show notes

08:31.800 --> 08:32.800
for people to go check out.

08:32.800 --> 08:34.100
It does play Quake 3.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.300
And so what's the price on that?

08:35.300 --> 08:35.800
Is it like?

08:35.800 --> 08:37.100
$199.

08:37.100 --> 08:37.600
Wow.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.400
That's pretty great.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.400
Yeah, it's very exciting.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.100
And this time it's an even better.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.300
That's why they're calling it Pro,

08:42.300 --> 08:45.200
with that magnesium casing, that IPS display.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.500
It's pretty compelling.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.800
I'm very excited to hear what you think of it, Cheese,

08:48.800 --> 08:51.300
because if you like it, I may end up ordering one.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.900
Well, I'm really looking forward to it.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.300
And I think, if anything, it'll be a great little companion

08:55.300 --> 08:57.000
machine to take along with me whenever

08:57.000 --> 09:00.900
I go to these conferences or our Sprint or anything like that.

09:00.900 --> 09:01.800
A little bit lighter.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.600
I'm not really concerned if, I mean,

09:03.600 --> 09:05.000
obviously I don't want anything to happen to it,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.500
but I'm not overly concerned if something does.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.200
Hey, over on the Linux Unplugged website, LinuxUnplugged.com,

09:10.200 --> 09:12.800
we have a blog you can click at the top of the site.

09:12.800 --> 09:16.700
And Cheesy just posted a summary of some of the fun things

09:16.700 --> 09:18.700
we did during our team sprint a couple of weeks

09:18.700 --> 09:21.600
that JB Summer Sprint, we had our full-time staff

09:21.600 --> 09:25.400
and full-time contractors all came into the Seattle area.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.500
And we worked on a lot of things, some of which

09:27.500 --> 09:29.400
you've seen in the extras feed, some of which

09:29.400 --> 09:32.000
we're about to talk about here in just a minute.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.100
To be honest with you, I am more nervous

09:35.100 --> 09:39.000
than I think I've been in 10 years about this.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.700
And I really encourage you to go check out this post,

09:41.700 --> 09:43.600
because Cheese did a great job of capturing

09:43.600 --> 09:47.400
some of the moments that were so great about the Sprint.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.200
Like the shot of us working on the ferry

09:49.200 --> 09:51.000
while we're having a team meeting,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.500
all in person for the first time.

09:52.500 --> 09:53.600
Yeah, that was great.

09:53.600 --> 09:59.000
On a ferry boat going across the Pacific Northwest,

09:59.000 --> 09:59.900
it's just so great.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.400
I mean, the only challenge was you

10:01.400 --> 10:03.900
had to not just get lost in the scenery floating on by.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.400
Which did happen from time to time.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.700
Like you can see there's a few shots of Cheesy in there.

10:07.700 --> 10:08.700
Oh, yeah.

10:08.700 --> 10:11.400
And our trip out to the Diablo Outlook,

10:11.400 --> 10:14.900
where I learned how to do night photography for the first time

10:14.900 --> 10:17.400
and talked my wife into driving up and down

10:17.400 --> 10:21.000
the side of the mountain so I could get a long exposure

10:21.000 --> 10:22.200
picture of her headlights.

10:22.200 --> 10:22.800
And it worked out.

10:22.800 --> 10:23.800
It did, didn't it?

10:23.800 --> 10:24.800
That was a lot of fun.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.700
You both had radios, and you were still on this overlook

10:27.700 --> 10:30.000
radioing to Hadia saying, no, wait, wait, wait.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.200
And then you missed the button.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.000
You say, oh, just turn around, honey.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.400
You know, it's no problem.

10:35.400 --> 10:40.200
Brent, you were a great mentor and handled my noobness

10:40.200 --> 10:43.300
with much ease and kind gloves.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.200
I thank you.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.100
Well, you're welcome.

10:45.100 --> 10:47.200
You were a great, great student.

10:47.200 --> 10:47.800
Hardly.

10:47.800 --> 10:48.500
Hardly.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.400
But I managed.

10:49.400 --> 10:49.900
I managed.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.200
Anyways, it was a really nice write-up.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.200
And the sprint was more than just about creating

10:54.200 --> 10:54.900
some new stuff.

10:54.900 --> 10:57.700
It was also about us getting a chance to hang out together.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.600
We did that, including going out to the ice caves

11:00.600 --> 11:04.200
and some epic drone shots of the ice caves in there.

11:04.200 --> 11:04.700
Hey-oh.

11:04.700 --> 11:05.800
Let's check that out.

11:05.800 --> 11:06.300
Yeah.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.700
That was pretty good.

11:07.700 --> 11:08.600
OK.

11:08.600 --> 11:09.100
All right.

11:09.100 --> 11:12.000
Now, there's a moment that we've really been building towards.

11:12.000 --> 11:12.800
Stop wasting time.

11:12.800 --> 11:13.300
I know.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.800
This is We Make News this week.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.500
This is still part of the community news.

11:16.500 --> 11:21.100
Because this week, a well-known podcast network

11:21.100 --> 11:23.900
in the open source community is launching yet

11:23.900 --> 11:28.800
another podcast that is totally free, handcrafted,

11:28.800 --> 11:31.000
and built just for our audience.

11:31.000 --> 11:31.900
I'm very excited.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.100
Alex, do you want to say it?

11:33.100 --> 11:33.400
Do you want?

11:33.400 --> 11:33.900
Come on, Alex.

11:33.900 --> 11:34.400
Say it.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.200
Say it, Alex.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.500
We are launching a new show called Self Hosted.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.400
SelfHosted.show.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.900
The teaser's up right now because we're

11:41.900 --> 11:44.200
filling out the RSS feeds.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.700
And we're really excited about this.

11:45.700 --> 11:49.500
In fact, so excited that we're holding a launch party coming

11:49.500 --> 11:51.200
up next weekend.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.200
Our buddy Wendell from Level One Techs

11:53.200 --> 11:54.600
is joining us at the meetup.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.400
Wendell's going to join us for episode two of Self Hosted.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.200
That's great.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.000
We've already recorded episode one.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.800
It's in the cam.

12:00.800 --> 12:05.100
It's going to be premiering on September 12

12:05.100 --> 12:08.200
to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Jupiter

12:08.200 --> 12:10.200
broadcasting joining Linux Academy.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.900
It's our birthday, and you're all getting a new podcast.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.800
So selfhosted.show slash subscribe.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.400
If you just want to get the RSS feed,

12:17.400 --> 12:20.400
so as soon as episode one goes live, you've got it.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.500
And then keep an eye out for episode two.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.100
We're going to travel to Wendell's lab

12:25.100 --> 12:27.300
and get in a conversation with him

12:27.300 --> 12:29.500
about why self-hosting matters.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.000
Yeah, so Chris is going to fly out

12:31.000 --> 12:32.500
to Raleigh, North Carolina, which

12:32.500 --> 12:33.900
is where I currently reside.

12:33.900 --> 12:36.600
And we're going to take a road trip through the North Carolina

12:36.600 --> 12:39.000
mountains up to Kentucky over the weekend, Labor Day

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
weekend.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.200
Yeah, it's an incredibly exciting opportunity.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.500
I'm very excited and really looking forward

12:46.500 --> 12:48.700
to the future with you, Chris.

12:48.700 --> 12:49.300
I am too.

12:49.300 --> 12:52.540
You and I have had a chance over the last couple of years

12:52.540 --> 12:54.400
to get to know each other pretty well.

12:54.400 --> 12:59.940
We met at Texas Linux Fest, and then at Linux Fest Northwest.

12:59.940 --> 13:02.560
Alex had a packed talk.

13:02.560 --> 13:07.340
The room was all standing room only talk about self-hosting,

13:07.340 --> 13:10.560
about getting control of smart devices on your LAN,

13:10.560 --> 13:13.580
about standing up services for your family and friends,

13:13.580 --> 13:15.300
or even business.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.260
And it was really, really well received.

13:17.260 --> 13:19.740
And afterwards, we started talking and saying,

13:19.740 --> 13:20.660
there's a show here.

13:20.660 --> 13:21.740
There really is a show here.

13:21.740 --> 13:23.200
And then we really refined the idea

13:23.200 --> 13:26.040
at this year's Texas Linux Fest and started working on it hard.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.900
And we've been working on it for a little bit

13:27.900 --> 13:29.780
because we really wanted to think

13:29.780 --> 13:32.740
about all the different ways we could do a show like this.

13:32.740 --> 13:34.540
And we wanted to come away with something

13:34.540 --> 13:37.300
that's the essentials of what you need from a podcast

13:37.300 --> 13:38.140
like this.

13:38.140 --> 13:39.620
And we're not anti-cloud.

13:39.620 --> 13:41.540
I think that's going to be an important aspect

13:41.540 --> 13:43.380
about the show is we're pragmatist.

13:43.380 --> 13:46.980
Really for us, self-hosting is about controlling your data.

13:46.980 --> 13:48.820
So if there's a way to intelligently leverage

13:48.820 --> 13:52.620
the cloud, maybe with encrypting your data or some other means,

13:52.620 --> 13:55.060
we're absolutely going to talk about that in the show as well.

13:55.060 --> 13:57.940
Alex's day job is OpenShift at Red Hat.

13:57.940 --> 14:01.460
So it's a huge part of what he does on a day-to-day basis.

14:01.460 --> 14:05.780
It's a huge part of my entire, quote unquote, Linux career.

14:05.780 --> 14:08.420
One of my other projects is linuxserver.io.

14:08.420 --> 14:11.460
And one of the most popular articles on that website

14:11.460 --> 14:13.580
has been the Perfect Media Server series,

14:13.580 --> 14:16.660
which is something I started writing in 2016.

14:16.660 --> 14:19.860
And this show really is just for me a way

14:19.860 --> 14:22.380
to pay it forward to all those that

14:22.380 --> 14:24.460
have helped me along my journey, but also

14:24.460 --> 14:26.780
to bring in a whole new swathe of people

14:26.780 --> 14:28.780
into self-hosting services.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.700
I think with the privacy implications

14:31.700 --> 14:34.460
of giving all your data to Google and Amazon

14:34.460 --> 14:38.860
and all these big companies, that the time to self-host

14:38.860 --> 14:41.060
has never been more prevalent than now.

14:41.060 --> 14:43.420
And the tools have never been better.

14:43.420 --> 14:46.700
That's what's blowing me away is we've had some resources now

14:46.700 --> 14:48.700
to have decent hardware and decent systems

14:48.700 --> 14:50.160
and experiment with different things

14:50.160 --> 14:52.300
and have time to deploy things and learn things.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.620
And it's been eye-opening for me this last year

14:54.620 --> 14:55.700
with Linux Academy.

14:55.700 --> 14:59.540
You have been converted to containers.

14:59.540 --> 15:01.300
It's been a fun journey to watch,

15:01.300 --> 15:04.860
because I've been listening to the network for a long time

15:04.860 --> 15:05.540
now.

15:05.540 --> 15:09.500
And you've been talking about Docker on Coda with Michael

15:09.500 --> 15:10.860
for years.

15:10.860 --> 15:12.700
But I knew you didn't use it, because I could just

15:12.700 --> 15:14.160
tell from the way you were talking.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.220
But now you do use it, and some of the stuff

15:16.220 --> 15:19.300
that Wes is doing on the back end with hosting

15:19.300 --> 15:20.780
all the sites and stuff.

15:20.780 --> 15:22.700
You just talk about it like a giddy school kid,

15:22.700 --> 15:24.340
and it's just wonderful, because you

15:24.340 --> 15:27.180
get my enthusiasm for this stuff, too, now, right?

15:27.180 --> 15:27.540
Oh, yeah.

15:27.540 --> 15:28.300
He really does.

15:28.300 --> 15:30.000
Well, and you and I have been discussing

15:30.000 --> 15:32.020
a lot about taking the smart devices

15:32.020 --> 15:34.420
that you get that the vendor drops support for

15:34.420 --> 15:35.420
and reflashing them.

15:35.420 --> 15:39.140
We're using things that just have plugins for them already

15:39.140 --> 15:40.900
and building up infrastructure.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.620
We're going to very early in the series on self-hosted,

15:43.620 --> 15:45.260
we'll just cover a few fundamentals, too,

15:45.260 --> 15:47.660
like port forwarding, reverse proxy,

15:47.660 --> 15:50.100
and the tools we use to do reverse proxy, right?

15:50.100 --> 15:52.860
Just so we have some of those fundamentals as well.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.380
That's all going to be in there.

15:54.380 --> 15:56.140
Very, very, very excited.

15:56.140 --> 16:00.500
It's going to be a twice a month podcast, self-hosted.show,

16:00.500 --> 16:01.940
launching September 12.

16:01.940 --> 16:04.180
And if you're not familiar who this Alex guy is,

16:04.180 --> 16:05.860
check out Linux server IO.

16:05.860 --> 16:10.660
And also, just released three or four minutes ago,

16:10.660 --> 16:15.020
extras.show slash seven is a chat with Brent and Alex,

16:15.020 --> 16:19.360
and you can meet Alex and his journey from Apple to Red Hat

16:19.360 --> 16:23.140
and from London to Raleigh and becoming a podcaster.

16:23.140 --> 16:25.580
It's some great background that I think you'll appreciate.

16:25.580 --> 16:28.580
So if you're curious about one of our new podcast stars,

16:28.580 --> 16:31.460
check out extras.show slash seven,

16:31.460 --> 16:32.540
A New Brunch with Brent.

16:32.540 --> 16:33.340
You cheeky monkey.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.780
You didn't tell me that was coming out today.

16:34.780 --> 16:35.660
Isn't that nice?

16:35.660 --> 16:37.740
Well, I figured you guys had such a great chat.

16:37.740 --> 16:39.580
And what a great opportunity for people

16:39.580 --> 16:41.180
to get to know who you are a little bit,

16:41.180 --> 16:43.020
because they hear you contribute to the show,

16:43.020 --> 16:47.300
but it's like we know you as a fully actualized person, right?

16:47.300 --> 16:49.580
And we know your wife, and we know your background,

16:49.580 --> 16:50.660
but the audience doesn't.

16:50.660 --> 16:53.420
And Brent is such a great conversationalist.

16:53.420 --> 16:55.820
It was just such a good opportunity for, I think,

16:55.820 --> 16:57.120
even people that are tangentially

16:57.120 --> 16:58.700
interested in what we might be cooking.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.340
Go meet Alex, extras.show slash seven.

17:01.340 --> 17:04.620
Brunch with Brent should be its own show, I'm just saying.

17:04.620 --> 17:07.180
Heard it here first.

17:07.180 --> 17:08.180
Start the campaign.

17:08.180 --> 17:09.020
Well, that's nice.

17:09.020 --> 17:10.180
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

17:10.180 --> 17:12.860
Alex and I had a great conversation.

17:12.860 --> 17:14.780
I listened to it three times already,

17:14.780 --> 17:17.940
because I might have it in my back pocket

17:17.940 --> 17:18.940
before it gets sent out.

17:18.940 --> 17:21.620
So I just keep enjoying the heck out of it.

17:21.620 --> 17:24.020
So Alex, thanks for sitting down with me and having a chat.

17:24.020 --> 17:25.660
And I think the audience is really going to love it.

17:25.660 --> 17:26.320
Well, thank you.

17:26.320 --> 17:27.060
It was a pleasure.

17:27.060 --> 17:28.700
Now, selfhosted.show.

17:28.700 --> 17:30.260
Again, the teaser is out.

17:30.260 --> 17:32.140
The feeds are getting populated now.

17:32.140 --> 17:34.500
It's selfhosted.show slash RSS if you just

17:34.500 --> 17:37.240
want to pop it into your podcast player of choice.

17:37.240 --> 17:41.080
Episode one, September 12, our Meetup with Wendell

17:41.080 --> 17:44.820
this weekend in Lexington, Kentucky, meetup.com slash

17:44.820 --> 17:46.660
Jupiter Broadcasting.

17:46.660 --> 17:50.300
Join Wendell, Alex, and myself at Goodfellas Pizzeria.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.880
Big thanks to Elle for booking that one.

17:51.880 --> 17:55.060
She picked this one out, and it looks fantastic.

17:55.060 --> 17:58.480
One final plug, if I may, it's the new hashtag

17:58.480 --> 17:59.480
that we're using.

17:59.480 --> 18:02.220
I want to make this into a two-way conversation

18:02.220 --> 18:04.620
and not just Chris and I talking about stuff.

18:04.620 --> 18:06.240
We've got a hashtag we're going to use,

18:06.240 --> 18:09.900
so you can use it on Twitter and or Telegram.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.000
Ask SSH is the hashtag.

18:12.000 --> 18:12.500
There you go.

18:12.500 --> 18:15.020
Ask SSH and then ask your question away.

18:15.020 --> 18:16.980
We'll try to work it into a future episode.

18:16.980 --> 18:19.480
We do have a couple in the can, and then we'll work them in.

18:19.480 --> 18:20.560
I am so excited.

18:20.560 --> 18:23.300
And today's episode of Linux Unplugged is on theme.

18:23.300 --> 18:25.540
It's really about self-hosting.

18:25.540 --> 18:28.260
I decided to recently self-host my password database

18:28.260 --> 18:30.180
with Bitwarden, but some of the guys on the show

18:30.180 --> 18:33.340
are using the hosted option, so we'll talk about that as well.

18:33.340 --> 18:35.260
So this is sort of on point.

18:35.260 --> 18:37.180
And then those kinds of things and a lot more

18:37.180 --> 18:39.100
from the self-hosted show once it kicks off.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.260
It's real now, Chris.

18:40.260 --> 18:41.460
We can't back out now.

18:41.460 --> 18:42.500
It's real now.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.220
I know.

18:43.220 --> 18:43.860
I know.

18:43.860 --> 18:45.580
We've been working on this for so long.

18:45.580 --> 18:47.900
We really wanted to be intentional,

18:47.900 --> 18:50.740
and I hope everybody likes what we've come up with.

18:50.740 --> 18:52.380
I feel like it's fresh.

18:52.380 --> 18:52.940
It's good.

18:52.940 --> 18:54.700
It's an important topic, and the area

18:54.700 --> 18:56.700
is getting so interesting.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.540
There's so many great free software projects out there

18:59.540 --> 19:01.900
right now that you think take all this time and effort,

19:01.900 --> 19:03.300
but really it's all manageable.

19:03.300 --> 19:04.840
And with just a couple of pointers

19:04.840 --> 19:07.260
or a couple of lessons we've learned,

19:07.260 --> 19:08.260
you're off to the races.

19:08.260 --> 19:10.540
So lots of potential.

19:10.540 --> 19:13.660
Now, I have something else for us before we go any further.

19:13.660 --> 19:16.540
We need to talk about odd camp, because that's also

19:16.540 --> 19:17.860
coming up really soon.

19:17.860 --> 19:20.180
October 19th and the 20th isn't that far away

19:20.180 --> 19:22.460
if you need to plan for travel.

19:22.460 --> 19:26.460
And believe it or not, odd camp is now 10 years old this year,

19:26.460 --> 19:29.180
which is amazing, because I remember when odd camp started.

19:29.180 --> 19:32.220
That makes me feel like I've been around for too long.

19:32.220 --> 19:34.540
But if you've never been or you've always gone,

19:34.540 --> 19:38.180
it seems like a pretty good one to go to October 19th and 20.

19:38.180 --> 19:40.100
I'm going to see if I can see if you think,

19:40.100 --> 19:41.980
see what you think of my pronunciation, Alex, of these,

19:41.980 --> 19:42.740
OK?

19:42.740 --> 19:47.460
At the Manchester Conference Center in the Pendulum Hotel

19:47.460 --> 19:48.900
near Piccadilly Station.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.060
Wow, very good.

19:50.060 --> 19:50.780
How'd I do?

19:50.780 --> 19:55.180
It was so close, so close.

19:55.180 --> 19:56.140
Hello, Povie.

19:56.140 --> 19:56.640
Hello.

19:56.640 --> 19:57.700
Which one was it?

19:57.700 --> 19:59.140
It was the Piccadilly Station, right?

19:59.140 --> 20:03.180
Yeah, it kind of went off at Piccadilly, but that's fine.

20:03.180 --> 20:06.740
So anyways, oddcamp, oddcamp.org if you're interested.

20:06.740 --> 20:09.100
And Joe had a real quick chance to sit down

20:09.100 --> 20:10.980
with Dan from odd camp to give us

20:10.980 --> 20:12.940
a little taste of what's coming.

20:12.940 --> 20:14.540
And we'll be right back.

20:14.540 --> 20:15.940
So welcome to the show, Dan.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.340
Thank you very much for having me.

20:17.340 --> 20:19.100
So you're here to talk about odd camp.

20:19.100 --> 20:21.540
What is it, where is it, and when is it?

20:21.540 --> 20:25.980
Yeah, so odd camp is a free culture and free software

20:25.980 --> 20:29.460
open source, bar camp, kind of hybrid, we call it.

20:29.460 --> 20:31.900
So it's a UK event.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.220
It's been running for 10 years.

20:33.220 --> 20:34.860
So this is our 10th anniversary this year,

20:34.860 --> 20:36.260
so it's quite a big one for us.

20:36.260 --> 20:38.660
And we've got four different tracks.

20:38.660 --> 20:40.540
We have one kind of scheduled track

20:40.540 --> 20:41.660
with some speakers on there.

20:41.660 --> 20:42.940
We've got some interesting stuff coming up

20:42.940 --> 20:45.540
with Andy Stanford-Clark and Roger Light

20:45.540 --> 20:47.260
are going to talk about Mosquito,

20:47.260 --> 20:48.940
which is a project they created together

20:48.940 --> 20:51.820
at the first odd camp 10 years ago, which is still going.

20:51.820 --> 20:54.860
And it's been quite popular in, you know,

20:54.860 --> 20:57.380
IOT kind of embedded fields as well.

20:57.380 --> 20:58.420
So that's cool.

20:58.420 --> 21:00.340
It's, yeah, so it's coming up in Manchester

21:00.340 --> 21:01.500
in October this year.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.000
It's our 10th anniversary, as I said.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.980
We're going to be at the Manchester Conference Centre,

21:05.980 --> 21:07.420
which is in the Pendulum Hotel.

21:07.420 --> 21:11.060
It's on the 19th and 20th of October.

21:11.060 --> 21:15.060
And tickets, well, you can give a donation of tickets

21:15.060 --> 21:16.180
or they can be completely free.

21:16.180 --> 21:17.660
It's whatever you think you can spare.

21:17.660 --> 21:19.980
So that's, you know, we want to keep it open to everyone.

21:19.980 --> 21:21.580
But we just want to get as many people together

21:21.580 --> 21:25.100
and have a, you know, a celebration of open source

21:25.100 --> 21:28.100
and all the kind of crazy goodness that's around that.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.060
Yeah, so the 19th and 20th of October,

21:30.060 --> 21:31.860
that's the Saturday and Sunday,

21:31.860 --> 21:34.480
but there is kind of an unofficial social event

21:34.480 --> 21:35.820
on the Friday night, isn't there?

21:35.820 --> 21:37.220
That's a very good point, actually, yeah.

21:37.220 --> 21:39.220
So on the 18th, which is the Friday,

21:39.220 --> 21:41.520
there will be a party in the hotel.

21:41.520 --> 21:45.660
I think it's about seven o'clock onwards in the main hotel.

21:45.660 --> 21:47.500
There's a bar there and we've got some,

21:47.500 --> 21:48.380
there's food available.

21:48.380 --> 21:50.940
You can order food and you can have drinks and stuff.

21:50.940 --> 21:51.980
And I know it's October,

21:51.980 --> 21:54.320
but there's a really nice courtyard outside.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.580
And it's got like nice outside seating and stuff.

21:56.580 --> 21:58.640
So fingers crossed, I know in Manchester it rains a lot,

21:58.640 --> 21:59.960
but fingers crossed it's not going to rain

21:59.960 --> 22:01.100
and it won't be freezing.

22:01.100 --> 22:02.780
And we'll be able to spread out into that as well

22:02.780 --> 22:05.300
and have a really good kind of, a good get together.

22:05.300 --> 22:07.260
Well, I remember a few years ago,

22:07.260 --> 22:09.340
up the road in Liverpool and that was at Halloween

22:09.340 --> 22:10.740
and I was walking around in a T-shirt,

22:10.740 --> 22:11.580
it was lovely weather.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.700
So fingers crossed, you never know.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.460
You never know, that's very true.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.620
Tickets are available now, as I said,

22:17.620 --> 22:18.860
so I should give you the address, shouldn't I?

22:18.860 --> 22:23.500
If you go to ogcamp.org, O-G-G-C-A-M-P.org,

22:23.500 --> 22:25.020
there's a link on there for tickets

22:25.020 --> 22:28.340
and you can easily sort all that sort of stuff out.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.620
And if anybody's interested in supporting the event,

22:30.620 --> 22:32.100
sponsoring or anything like that,

22:32.100 --> 22:34.060
that's still up there as well.

22:34.060 --> 22:35.700
And you can find out about the schedule

22:35.700 --> 22:38.180
and that'll be getting more stuff on there as we go along.

22:38.180 --> 22:39.820
It's gradually getting filled up.

22:39.820 --> 22:41.020
We're looking for crew now.

22:41.020 --> 22:42.100
There's all kinds of stuff on there.

22:42.100 --> 22:44.140
We're on Twitter as well, at Ogcamp

22:44.140 --> 22:46.460
and Master Don and various other things.

22:46.460 --> 22:48.380
If you search for Ogcamp, it's quite a unique name.

22:48.380 --> 22:51.260
So it'll come up in many places.

22:51.260 --> 22:52.300
Yeah.

22:52.300 --> 22:54.900
So what should people expect there then from,

22:54.900 --> 22:56.780
well, I suppose let's start with the schedule track.

22:56.780 --> 22:58.380
What should people expect there?

22:58.380 --> 23:00.660
Well, lots of interesting stuff coming up.

23:00.660 --> 23:03.260
As I said, we've got our kind of opening keynote this year

23:03.260 --> 23:05.780
is Andy Stanford-Clark from IBM.

23:05.780 --> 23:08.020
He's the CTO of IBM.

23:08.020 --> 23:12.740
He was largely responsible for creating MQTT,

23:12.740 --> 23:15.900
which is this messaging protocol,

23:15.900 --> 23:17.820
which I'm sure your listeners will know better than I do,

23:17.820 --> 23:18.660
to be honest.

23:18.660 --> 23:21.780
But yeah, people use a lot for reporting and messaging

23:21.780 --> 23:24.740
and stuff in IOT and embedded Linux

23:24.740 --> 23:26.540
and just embedded software in general.

23:26.540 --> 23:29.820
So he's gonna come talk about that and how that's changed

23:29.820 --> 23:33.340
and how the project that he created with Roger Light,

23:33.340 --> 23:36.540
he'll also be there, how that's changed.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.580
Then we've got all kinds of stuff.

23:37.580 --> 23:40.700
On the Saturday, there'll be a number of scheduled talks.

23:40.700 --> 23:42.300
We've got some stuff for beginners,

23:42.300 --> 23:44.940
introduction to Ubuntu.

23:44.940 --> 23:46.300
Anna is gonna tell us her story

23:46.300 --> 23:48.140
about how she got into Ubuntu.

23:48.140 --> 23:49.300
We've got other stuff there.

23:49.300 --> 23:50.340
As you'll know, Joe,

23:50.340 --> 23:55.140
we've got the podcast panel discussion extravaganza

23:55.140 --> 23:57.260
at the end there, which you'll be...

23:57.260 --> 24:01.060
Which is totally organized and completely final at this point.

24:01.060 --> 24:01.900
Excellent.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.340
So that'll be fun, that's always fun.

24:03.340 --> 24:05.740
And then there's a party on the Saturday night as well,

24:05.740 --> 24:07.820
because one of the big things about OgCamp,

24:07.820 --> 24:08.900
which you can probably attest to,

24:08.900 --> 24:10.540
is that we do like to take our parties

24:10.540 --> 24:12.620
as seriously as everything else.

24:12.620 --> 24:14.580
So we tend to have lots of social events around it.

24:14.580 --> 24:16.460
So there's another party in the evening.

24:16.460 --> 24:17.900
There's gonna be a band playing,

24:17.900 --> 24:19.300
Dev Nol and the Kernel Panics,

24:19.300 --> 24:22.420
who are a Linux band, if you wanna call them that.

24:22.420 --> 24:26.140
They're gonna be playing in the main room

24:26.140 --> 24:27.580
and there's the bar next door

24:27.580 --> 24:29.260
and there'll be more food and stuff.

24:29.260 --> 24:31.140
And on the Sunday, actually, I should mention,

24:31.140 --> 24:32.020
we've got our first...

24:32.020 --> 24:33.100
Well, actually, on the Saturday,

24:33.100 --> 24:35.340
we've got our first ever kids track as well, which is nice.

24:35.340 --> 24:36.900
So there's gonna be stuff to do for...

24:36.900 --> 24:39.060
If you've got family, you can bring them along.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.820
We're gonna have sessions for kids.

24:40.820 --> 24:42.140
We've got a special little kids room

24:42.140 --> 24:44.860
where there's gonna be people putting on sessions,

24:44.860 --> 24:47.780
like building little robots and doing cool stuff,

24:47.780 --> 24:51.100
which will hopefully get the kids interested in technology

24:51.100 --> 24:52.220
and keep them entertained.

24:52.220 --> 24:53.380
And there's an exhibition area.

24:53.380 --> 24:55.820
We're gonna have lots of various stuff going on

24:55.820 --> 24:56.780
in the exhibition area.

24:56.780 --> 24:58.940
Hacker Public Radio are there and lots of other people.

24:58.940 --> 25:00.140
I'm still booking that at the moment.

25:00.140 --> 25:01.820
So if anybody listening has a project

25:01.820 --> 25:04.180
and they think they'd like to be involved

25:04.180 --> 25:05.020
and they'd like to exhibit,

25:05.020 --> 25:07.620
you can just email contact.oddcamp.org

25:07.620 --> 25:09.540
and I'll sort that out with you.

25:10.420 --> 25:12.380
And we can get you on the exhibition.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.820
And then there's the Open Hardware Jam,

25:13.820 --> 25:15.980
which is gonna be in the middle of the exhibition space

25:15.980 --> 25:16.820
as well.

25:16.820 --> 25:17.740
There's gonna be people doing, again,

25:17.740 --> 25:20.740
cool stuff with making stuff with Arduinos

25:20.740 --> 25:22.980
and micro bits and Raspberry Pis

25:22.980 --> 25:24.900
and all that sort of stuff, which should be cool.

25:24.900 --> 25:26.900
And then on the Sunday, we've got our first,

25:26.900 --> 25:29.260
so we're linking up with an event called FloorCon,

25:29.260 --> 25:31.620
which was a security and open source event

25:31.620 --> 25:34.540
due to happen in Huddersfield, which sadly was canceled.

25:34.540 --> 25:37.820
And then we kind of said, do you wanna come and do,

25:37.820 --> 25:39.380
run one of the rooms for us during the day?

25:39.380 --> 25:40.220
So there's gonna be,

25:40.220 --> 25:41.340
I don't know what their content is yet,

25:41.340 --> 25:43.980
but it's gonna be lots of security-based talks.

25:43.980 --> 25:45.500
And they've got some speakers lined up as well,

25:45.500 --> 25:47.300
which I'll publish on the website

25:47.300 --> 25:48.740
as soon as I find out more.

25:48.740 --> 25:52.060
And then this all ends with the fabulous raffle cast,

25:52.060 --> 25:54.140
which goes on for a while,

25:54.140 --> 25:56.740
usually where we give away all the prizes that we've got.

25:56.740 --> 25:58.780
And then on the Sunday night,

25:58.780 --> 26:00.900
I suspect a few people will still be around

26:00.900 --> 26:01.740
on the Sunday night.

26:01.740 --> 26:03.300
So there'll be a few people in Manchester hanging around

26:03.300 --> 26:05.540
for probably food and drinks and stuff

26:05.540 --> 26:08.420
before we all crawl off to wherever we're from

26:08.420 --> 26:09.300
on the Monday.

26:09.300 --> 26:11.420
And it is also an on-conference, isn't it?

26:11.420 --> 26:14.460
So if anyone turns up wanting to speak,

26:14.460 --> 26:16.980
then there's a chance that they will be able to.

26:16.980 --> 26:17.860
They should be able to, yeah.

26:17.860 --> 26:19.420
So that's a really good point, actually.

26:19.420 --> 26:20.540
I should highlight that.

26:20.540 --> 26:24.340
If you have a topic that you wanna talk about,

26:24.340 --> 26:26.260
and actually something that we're trying to do this year

26:26.260 --> 26:28.780
as well, which we haven't done in the past is,

26:28.780 --> 26:30.980
so Lorna's in charge of the schedule

26:30.980 --> 26:32.780
and she's much more organized than I am.

26:32.780 --> 26:34.260
And she came up with a great idea,

26:34.260 --> 26:37.020
which was to have suggested topics.

26:37.020 --> 26:38.060
So if you're listening and you think,

26:38.060 --> 26:41.380
oh, I'd love to see a talk about Git, for example,

26:41.380 --> 26:43.740
but I don't know if there'll be one,

26:43.740 --> 26:45.380
we're gonna have a call for like topics.

26:45.380 --> 26:46.220
So if someone couldn't say,

26:46.220 --> 26:47.780
I wanna see a talk about Git,

26:47.780 --> 26:48.620
somebody else can go,

26:48.620 --> 26:49.780
oh, I actually know a bit about Git.

26:49.780 --> 26:51.100
I could probably do that.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.380
And then we can kind of put those things together

26:53.380 --> 26:55.780
and hopefully build the kind of, you know,

26:55.780 --> 26:58.060
the content that people actually wanna see

26:58.060 --> 26:58.900
and get involved in.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.460
And I think Lorna's also gonna do some,

27:00.460 --> 27:01.940
if you're nervous about talking

27:01.940 --> 27:02.900
and you haven't done it before,

27:02.900 --> 27:04.740
she's gonna run a couple of webinar sessions

27:04.740 --> 27:06.900
during September,

27:06.900 --> 27:09.420
helping people to get used to talking.

27:09.420 --> 27:10.380
She's an excellent speaker

27:10.380 --> 27:11.820
and she's gonna give some tips

27:11.820 --> 27:14.860
on how you can feel comfortable,

27:14.860 --> 27:16.500
do your talk and get the most out of it.

27:16.500 --> 27:17.420
All right, cool.

27:17.420 --> 27:19.100
And there's usually lightning talks as well

27:19.100 --> 27:21.420
for people who wanna just kind of dip their toes in.

27:21.420 --> 27:22.260
There will be, yeah.

27:22.260 --> 27:23.100
I should mention that.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.540
That's on the Saturday, I think on the main stage.

27:24.540 --> 27:26.980
There's five minute-ish talks usually.

27:26.980 --> 27:27.980
Yeah.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.740
Well, I'll be there, you'll be there.

27:29.740 --> 27:32.060
It sounds like it's gonna be excellent fun.

27:32.060 --> 27:34.380
So again, plug the URL for it.

27:34.380 --> 27:36.260
Yeah, go to ogcamp.org.

27:36.260 --> 27:39.340
That's O-G-G-C-A-M-P.org

27:39.340 --> 27:40.780
and all the information's on there.

27:40.780 --> 27:42.020
Quick plug for you then.

27:42.020 --> 27:43.580
Yeah, if anyone wants to find out what I'm up to,

27:43.580 --> 27:45.860
you can go to best place probably Twitter actually,

27:45.860 --> 27:48.700
which is at methoddan or danlynch.org,

27:48.700 --> 27:50.340
which is where my main website

27:50.340 --> 27:52.700
and you can find all the various podcasts

27:52.700 --> 27:53.860
and things that I do on there.

27:53.860 --> 27:54.700
Nice one.

27:54.700 --> 27:55.740
Well, thanks a lot for coming on the show then.

27:55.740 --> 27:56.940
No problem, anytime.

27:56.940 --> 27:59.580
And that panel they mentioned will be recorded

27:59.580 --> 28:01.620
and released in our extras.show feed.

28:01.620 --> 28:02.460
Oh boy.

28:02.460 --> 28:05.060
Yeah, so if you wanna catch that and you can't make it,

28:05.060 --> 28:06.580
we'll try to make that panel available

28:06.580 --> 28:08.180
cause we have that avenue now.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.260
Oh yes we do.

28:09.260 --> 28:11.060
So my friends, we are gathered here today

28:11.060 --> 28:12.980
to discuss Bitwarden.

28:12.980 --> 28:17.500
We all know that a password manager in 2019 is a must do.

28:17.500 --> 28:21.140
I've tried them, gone back to LastPass

28:21.140 --> 28:22.740
and I decided I was going to hang out

28:22.740 --> 28:26.300
and wait at LastPass until my subscription expired,

28:26.300 --> 28:28.540
which it expired this month

28:28.540 --> 28:30.140
and I have no intention of renewing it.

28:30.140 --> 28:31.900
So this is something that's been on my radar.

28:31.900 --> 28:33.260
You kinda have to move.

28:33.260 --> 28:35.820
You've been a key pass user for a long time.

28:35.820 --> 28:36.700
For a long time.

28:36.700 --> 28:37.540
I mean, I've already, you know,

28:37.540 --> 28:40.740
I always had sort of sinking infrastructure set up anyway

28:40.740 --> 28:44.220
and I don't, you know, I read a whole bunch

28:44.220 --> 28:46.140
and hardly ever write to this thing.

28:46.140 --> 28:48.460
So for a long time it was fine to just sort of sink it around

28:48.460 --> 28:50.300
and access it when I needed to,

28:50.300 --> 28:52.620
but I just have more and more passwords now.

28:52.620 --> 28:54.180
I thought, you know, it's been a while

28:54.180 --> 28:55.300
since I've tried something else.

28:55.300 --> 28:58.900
For me too, sharing my passwords with all of you

28:58.900 --> 29:01.900
on the team has become much more of a thing.

29:01.900 --> 29:03.860
Yeah, it's okay like, you know, once or twice

29:03.860 --> 29:05.500
if you give someone your account password,

29:05.500 --> 29:06.460
but that does not scale.

29:06.460 --> 29:07.980
Well, they're not really my passwords anymore.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.300
They're the team's passwords.

29:09.300 --> 29:10.620
I just have them in my database.

29:10.620 --> 29:13.220
And so I need like a team password database as well,

29:13.220 --> 29:15.100
but I still want it to be secure.

29:15.100 --> 29:18.660
I want us to host it because of the sensitivity of this.

29:18.660 --> 29:20.300
And we want it to work with mobile.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.020
We want it to have autofill.

29:22.020 --> 29:24.180
And I really was just sort of,

29:24.180 --> 29:25.500
without really saying anything,

29:25.500 --> 29:28.140
observing everyone just switching to Bitwarden

29:28.140 --> 29:31.060
and you were the last domino to fall now.

29:31.060 --> 29:33.100
And you switched over the weekend.

29:33.100 --> 29:35.340
And I was like, okay, this is time for us to talk about it.

29:35.340 --> 29:36.500
So ladies and gentlemen,

29:36.500 --> 29:38.820
I would like to introduce you to Bitwarden.

29:38.820 --> 29:41.420
It is developed by Kyle Speran.

29:41.420 --> 29:43.780
Kyle is the primary contributor to the project,

29:43.780 --> 29:45.220
but it is an open source project.

29:45.220 --> 29:47.460
It debuted in August of 2016.

29:47.460 --> 29:50.220
It does have mobile applications for iOS and Android,

29:50.220 --> 29:53.300
including an F-Droid store version of it.

29:53.300 --> 29:54.780
And it has browser plugins

29:54.780 --> 29:57.020
for your common browser platforms.

29:57.020 --> 30:00.780
You can use their hosted version or you can self-host it.

30:00.780 --> 30:03.420
And there is their version you can self-host,

30:03.420 --> 30:05.300
which they make available as Docker images.

30:05.300 --> 30:08.780
And then there's also a community compatible version,

30:08.780 --> 30:10.100
server side written in Rust.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.460
Yeah, I mean, so if you look at,

30:11.460 --> 30:12.460
and we'll have links of course,

30:12.460 --> 30:14.820
in the doc to all of this stuff,

30:14.820 --> 30:18.380
you can run it just like they do, up in the cloud,

30:18.380 --> 30:19.940
but that's gonna be like a whole bunch

30:19.940 --> 30:21.700
of database containers and a few other things.

30:21.700 --> 30:23.540
It's also based on.NET technology,

30:23.540 --> 30:27.180
which isn't always the most familiar to Linux users.

30:27.180 --> 30:30.620
So there is a community maintained Rust server implementation

30:30.620 --> 30:31.940
that is kind of geared at,

30:31.940 --> 30:33.900
you're not building a whole big infrastructure

30:33.900 --> 30:36.020
for many people, you're just hosting it yourself.

30:36.020 --> 30:36.860
So we'll get to that,

30:36.860 --> 30:39.580
because I had a chance to play around with that.

30:39.580 --> 30:41.340
And you also then, like I mentioned,

30:41.340 --> 30:43.660
have the option to just use their services.

30:43.660 --> 30:45.340
Their infrastructure, from my understanding,

30:45.340 --> 30:46.540
seems pretty solid.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.980
They encrypt before they send it up to their servers,

30:48.980 --> 30:50.860
so they just have an encrypted blob.

30:50.860 --> 30:52.940
Their systems run on Azure,

30:52.940 --> 30:55.820
so you have the security of the Azure platform

30:55.820 --> 30:57.740
be at what it is, probably pretty good.

30:57.740 --> 31:00.580
And on top of all of that, the best people could get,

31:00.580 --> 31:01.860
even if they compromise the servers,

31:01.860 --> 31:03.860
would just be that encrypted blob

31:03.860 --> 31:05.900
sitting in a SQL database somewhere.

31:05.900 --> 31:07.860
And Alex, so you elected to use

31:07.860 --> 31:09.420
their hosted infrastructure.

31:09.420 --> 31:11.660
I'm sure you've played with the self-hosted one too.

31:11.660 --> 31:13.980
What do you like about using the hosted version?

31:13.980 --> 31:16.780
For me, a password manager is something

31:16.780 --> 31:19.660
that has to have 100% uptime.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.820
I know that's not a realistic goal

31:21.820 --> 31:23.140
for a self-hosted service,

31:23.140 --> 31:25.940
because I'm not a data center, right?

31:25.940 --> 31:27.940
But the thing is, for me,

31:28.900 --> 31:30.500
particularly over the last 12 months,

31:30.500 --> 31:31.460
whilst I was emigrating,

31:31.460 --> 31:33.900
I didn't have a great way to run,

31:33.900 --> 31:37.820
unless of course I'd spent up on a droplet or something,

31:37.820 --> 31:40.020
I didn't have a great way to run this locally.

31:40.020 --> 31:45.020
And for me, I think it's $12 a year or something.

31:45.100 --> 31:48.180
That cost a buck a month is fine

31:48.180 --> 31:49.340
for the service it provides.

31:49.340 --> 31:51.700
I've been extremely happy with the experience

31:51.700 --> 31:53.700
as a Bitwarden user.

31:53.700 --> 31:57.780
And a lot of the integrations you can get on Android,

31:57.780 --> 32:00.860
like auto-complete and stuff like that are pretty nice.

32:00.860 --> 32:03.300
You can do Control-Shift-L in a browser,

32:03.300 --> 32:07.460
and that will auto-fill the form entries on a page for you

32:07.460 --> 32:08.940
if you've unlocked your vault and stuff.

32:08.940 --> 32:11.380
So, I mean, I'm a very happy user.

32:11.380 --> 32:14.060
I've been using it for well over a year at this point.

32:14.060 --> 32:16.820
I think it's sort of set up by default

32:16.820 --> 32:19.540
to use the hosted service when you go to log in.

32:19.540 --> 32:22.020
And if you were gonna throw it up on a VPS,

32:22.020 --> 32:25.900
you're probably better off using their hosted solution.

32:25.900 --> 32:29.380
For me, what was critical is I wanted it behind my LAN

32:29.380 --> 32:31.220
because of the nature of this.

32:31.220 --> 32:32.900
And if it's not available,

32:32.900 --> 32:34.020
that just means somebody on the team

32:34.020 --> 32:35.500
can't log into a service they have to.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.980
It's probably not the end of the world.

32:39.300 --> 32:41.900
And so I'm willing to run it on a box

32:41.900 --> 32:45.540
that could have 99.5% uptime for the year.

32:45.540 --> 32:47.020
Right, we can make arrangements too,

32:47.020 --> 32:48.820
with backups and spinning up new servers,

32:48.820 --> 32:49.740
stuff we have to.

32:49.740 --> 32:51.980
So it's really kind of your choice.

32:51.980 --> 32:53.620
You have the option.

32:53.620 --> 32:55.420
I like having the self-hosted option,

32:55.420 --> 32:56.420
and it's always a balance.

32:56.420 --> 32:58.540
Sometimes it makes more sense to use their infrastructure.

32:58.540 --> 33:01.620
I think that line for something like this is,

33:01.620 --> 33:04.220
if you already have several things you're running on a box

33:04.220 --> 33:06.860
and so you just have a machine that you are routinely

33:06.860 --> 33:08.660
keeping up to date and secure

33:08.660 --> 33:09.940
and following best practices,

33:09.940 --> 33:11.100
you're probably a good candidate

33:11.100 --> 33:13.780
to self-host this particular software.

33:13.780 --> 33:15.780
If you would just be spinning up something

33:15.780 --> 33:17.100
that would be set off in the corner

33:17.100 --> 33:18.740
that you would have to remember to log into

33:18.740 --> 33:20.500
and make sure it stays up to date,

33:20.500 --> 33:22.220
and it could be easily neglected,

33:22.220 --> 33:23.620
probably not a good candidate

33:23.620 --> 33:25.420
to host something like your password database.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.420
And you might also consider, in this case,

33:27.420 --> 33:29.980
that it is all available open source.

33:29.980 --> 33:32.260
So you might think of it as just a way

33:32.260 --> 33:33.900
to sort of fund that development

33:33.900 --> 33:36.660
if you also get a nice service out of it, you know?

33:36.660 --> 33:38.580
One other thing to consider as part of this,

33:38.580 --> 33:39.700
should I self-host it?

33:39.700 --> 33:42.100
Should I use the hosted version?

33:42.100 --> 33:45.900
Is what happens if your internet goes out in your house?

33:45.900 --> 33:47.580
You know, you have all of the passwords

33:47.580 --> 33:50.740
for everything in this database,

33:50.740 --> 33:53.220
and suddenly, okay, I can't log into Amazon right now.

33:53.220 --> 33:56.020
I can't buy this pot of dog food that I need to buy.

33:56.020 --> 33:57.540
Okay, well, I'll just go to Walmart instead.

33:57.540 --> 34:00.100
But there are other things that are more important

34:00.100 --> 34:01.300
that I need passwords for.

34:01.300 --> 34:04.340
And if my internet's out for half a day,

34:04.340 --> 34:06.660
for some reason, thanks AT&T,

34:06.660 --> 34:09.940
then, you know, I need to have access to these things.

34:09.940 --> 34:12.220
So for me, it's worth the price of admission.

34:12.220 --> 34:13.380
I think it's worth mentioning, too,

34:13.380 --> 34:14.540
that the software provides

34:14.540 --> 34:17.460
some pretty handy functionality outside of passwords.

34:17.460 --> 34:19.780
It'll offer secure credit card information storage

34:19.780 --> 34:22.300
and address book and secure note storage.

34:22.300 --> 34:23.900
It's just nice to have some organization

34:23.900 --> 34:25.180
kind of all in one place for that.

34:25.180 --> 34:27.420
And so to answer your question about offline,

34:27.420 --> 34:30.860
so last night, just to see how far I could push things,

34:30.860 --> 34:32.700
I decided to do a bunch of crazy stuff.

34:32.700 --> 34:34.620
And the way I was able to do this safely

34:34.620 --> 34:36.540
was I used a tool called Podman,

34:36.540 --> 34:38.020
but it's also available as a Docker image,

34:38.020 --> 34:40.940
and I Podman installed or pulled down

34:40.940 --> 34:43.340
the Bitwarden Rust implementation,

34:43.340 --> 34:45.740
set up something that only works on local host,

34:45.740 --> 34:48.540
so I just go to local host on my laptop,

34:48.540 --> 34:50.580
and I was able to play with all kinds of crazy features,

34:50.580 --> 34:54.060
like importing large swaths of my password database

34:54.060 --> 34:55.660
into a team database without risking

34:55.660 --> 34:57.900
actually exposing passwords and stuff.

34:57.900 --> 34:59.660
And the entire thing worked offline.

34:59.660 --> 35:03.860
I connected the mobile version of my phone to my laptop,

35:03.860 --> 35:07.660
and I was able to connect the Chrome extension

35:07.660 --> 35:09.460
to the local version on my laptop,

35:09.460 --> 35:11.740
and it all worked beautifully.

35:11.740 --> 35:13.260
Really, like you could run,

35:13.260 --> 35:15.700
if you just wanted something on your laptop all the time

35:15.700 --> 35:18.460
that only listened to local host, it works great.

35:18.460 --> 35:20.140
Or if you want something that only works on your LAN,

35:20.140 --> 35:21.420
and so you sync to your mobile device

35:21.420 --> 35:24.660
when you're on your LAN, you can absolutely do that.

35:24.660 --> 35:29.140
I want like mobile access too, but for experimenting,

35:29.140 --> 35:33.020
it was so nice to know that I could have this sort of safety

35:33.020 --> 35:35.900
of it only is accessed by local host.

35:35.900 --> 35:38.060
Whatever I do on this is only on local host,

35:38.060 --> 35:39.380
it won't go anywhere else.

35:39.380 --> 35:41.860
And if it's a failed experiment, just blow it away.

35:41.860 --> 35:44.020
Did you mess around with the Rust version as well,

35:44.020 --> 35:45.700
server-side, when you did look at self-hosting?

35:45.700 --> 35:46.620
Yes, I did.

35:46.620 --> 35:48.780
And what was your reasons for going

35:48.780 --> 35:50.780
with the community implementation

35:50.780 --> 35:52.940
versus the main project release?

35:52.940 --> 35:54.700
I just kind of wanted to experiment

35:54.700 --> 35:56.460
and see how well it compared,

35:56.460 --> 35:58.660
because I'd been using the upstream,

35:58.660 --> 36:00.780
I'm using their hosted service as well at the moment,

36:00.780 --> 36:02.660
and that is using the other version.

36:02.660 --> 36:04.420
So I wanted to see how much they matched

36:04.420 --> 36:05.820
if it felt like the same experience.

36:05.820 --> 36:08.020
And so far, yeah, I mean, it really does.

36:08.020 --> 36:09.260
Now, if you do want to play with the other one,

36:09.260 --> 36:11.020
they've got some instructions

36:11.020 --> 36:13.340
for manually getting all the right containers set up,

36:13.340 --> 36:14.260
because it's kind of a bunch,

36:14.260 --> 36:17.540
and they hook into Docker Compose to get it set up.

36:17.540 --> 36:18.820
I would suggest if you want to play with that,

36:18.820 --> 36:22.860
maybe just allocate a new virtual machine or VPS somewhere,

36:22.860 --> 36:25.380
because it kind of wants to do a whole bunch of things.

36:25.380 --> 36:27.980
Yeah, that's why I liked the community implementation.

36:27.980 --> 36:29.300
It's one single...

36:29.300 --> 36:30.140
It's just simpler, right?

36:30.140 --> 36:31.820
It's aimed at like a smaller deployment

36:31.820 --> 36:33.620
just for kind of running something small for yourself,

36:33.620 --> 36:34.900
and it's smoother to do so.

36:34.900 --> 36:37.940
And once it's up and running, you just go to the web URL,

36:37.940 --> 36:40.900
and you've got the administration front end right there,

36:40.900 --> 36:43.540
and all the software clients can connect to that.

36:43.540 --> 36:44.740
And it's very straightforward

36:44.740 --> 36:46.300
if you use the community REST version.

36:46.300 --> 36:47.740
One thing I'd like to point out

36:47.740 --> 36:49.740
is with the community version,

36:49.740 --> 36:51.340
they have a big disclaimer that says,

36:51.340 --> 36:52.900
whichever client you're using

36:52.900 --> 36:55.980
do not use the official support channels, come here first.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.220
Yeah, yeah.

36:57.220 --> 36:59.020
There's always that aspect of it.

36:59.020 --> 36:59.900
That's true.

36:59.900 --> 37:01.620
And as far as Bitward itself,

37:01.620 --> 37:04.220
it recently, well, I think it was about a year ago,

37:04.220 --> 37:07.180
almost, they went through an audit,

37:07.180 --> 37:09.340
and they found a few things, fixed those things.

37:09.340 --> 37:10.740
We'll have a link to the information about that.

37:10.740 --> 37:13.260
So it has been audited by a third party as well,

37:13.260 --> 37:15.100
even though it is a fairly new project,

37:15.100 --> 37:16.740
it seems really good.

37:16.740 --> 37:19.900
And it really does seem like it's...

37:19.900 --> 37:22.020
What I like about it is it's just absolutely everything

37:22.020 --> 37:23.540
I need and not much more.

37:23.540 --> 37:26.540
The team management stuff's just the right amount.

37:26.540 --> 37:28.060
Being able to autofill the credit cards

37:28.060 --> 37:30.100
or address information and store different profiles

37:30.100 --> 37:32.060
and identities, that's just right.

37:32.060 --> 37:33.820
The mobile apps are functional.

37:33.820 --> 37:35.380
They support some offline caching

37:35.380 --> 37:36.580
if you don't have a connection.

37:36.580 --> 37:38.620
Right, yeah, it looks like it's read only.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.220
I'm not sure you can add new entries,

37:40.220 --> 37:42.260
but that's all right with me.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.860
Yeah, you still get read only access.

37:43.860 --> 37:44.980
So be aware of that.

37:44.980 --> 37:47.700
But you're right, it's almost stupidly easy to get to.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.140
I was looking at the docs for the show

37:49.140 --> 37:51.460
and I'd just run the app image that they provide,

37:51.460 --> 37:52.740
but it's also, of course, packaged

37:52.740 --> 37:54.220
and it's flat packs and snaps.

37:54.220 --> 37:56.740
And basically, it'd be hard not to find it

37:56.740 --> 37:58.340
on your platform at this point.

37:58.340 --> 38:01.140
And the web interface works great too.

38:01.140 --> 38:01.980
Very nice.

38:01.980 --> 38:05.140
So what I'm getting from this is that I can actually use this

38:05.140 --> 38:07.060
to store my Apple Card credentials

38:07.060 --> 38:09.980
since I can't carry it in my wallet or my pants, right?

38:09.980 --> 38:11.740
Oh, too soon, Cheesy.

38:11.740 --> 38:14.580
That would be a great workaround, yeah.

38:14.580 --> 38:16.820
I kind of want to take the temperature of the mumble room.

38:16.820 --> 38:17.940
Popey, I saw you in there.

38:17.940 --> 38:19.500
Are you using any password managers?

38:19.500 --> 38:21.620
Have you tried out Bitwarden or LastPass?

38:21.620 --> 38:24.220
Yep, I exported everything out of LastPass

38:24.220 --> 38:26.660
and chucked it in Bitwarden a while ago.

38:27.700 --> 38:28.860
It's great, I love it.

38:28.860 --> 38:30.660
There's not much more to say.

38:30.660 --> 38:31.700
No, it just works, right?

38:31.700 --> 38:34.260
It's just simple and straightforward and clean.

38:34.260 --> 38:36.660
I did an export as well, and I'll link to a guide.

38:36.660 --> 38:38.740
There's just a couple of notes.

38:38.740 --> 38:40.700
It doesn't directly import the file

38:40.700 --> 38:42.220
like it does for other password managers.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.060
There's an extra step,

38:43.060 --> 38:45.220
but I'll have a link to that in the show notes.

38:45.220 --> 38:47.460
And yeah, it just totally works,

38:47.460 --> 38:51.220
really kind of in a unremarkable, remarkable way.

38:51.220 --> 38:54.700
And their organizational functionality is perfect,

38:54.700 --> 38:57.220
exactly what I needed to securely share passwords

38:57.220 --> 38:58.060
with the team.

38:58.060 --> 38:59.300
And we have it hosted in a way

38:59.300 --> 39:00.580
that the team can get access to it,

39:00.580 --> 39:02.300
but it's not publicly accessible.

39:03.340 --> 39:05.100
Pretty happy with the end result.

39:05.100 --> 39:07.580
And I think the last time I tried to switch away

39:07.580 --> 39:09.980
from LastPass, it was a total mess.

39:09.980 --> 39:13.660
And so I tried this process a couple of times.

39:13.660 --> 39:17.740
And I will warn you, if you have sketchy connectivity

39:17.740 --> 39:20.620
when you do the import of your LastPass database,

39:20.620 --> 39:22.980
for some reason, it will import all of the passwords,

39:22.980 --> 39:24.860
but it will drop all the folders.

39:24.860 --> 39:27.740
If that happens, you can essentially eject

39:27.740 --> 39:30.420
the entire password database and re-import again.

39:30.420 --> 39:31.620
So if the first time you import

39:31.620 --> 39:32.860
and you don't get your folders

39:32.860 --> 39:34.580
that you all have set up in LastPass,

39:34.580 --> 39:35.980
just drop it all and import again,

39:35.980 --> 39:36.980
and it will bring them in.

39:36.980 --> 39:40.620
In like three or four times that I did this,

39:40.620 --> 39:42.140
that happened to me once.

39:42.140 --> 39:42.980
Yeah, interesting.

39:42.980 --> 39:43.940
But I did a little Google search,

39:43.940 --> 39:45.220
and other people say it happens,

39:45.220 --> 39:47.100
and they say it's when you have intermittent connectivity,

39:47.100 --> 39:48.580
and I did at that time.

39:48.580 --> 39:50.980
Because it's like it's going out to resolve the favicons

39:50.980 --> 39:52.860
and stuff, and when that process dies,

39:52.860 --> 39:54.580
I guess it just doesn't create the folders or whatever.

39:54.580 --> 39:55.700
I didn't go any further than that,

39:55.700 --> 39:57.900
but it seemed to be the case, so keep an eye out for that.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.580
But otherwise, love it.

39:59.580 --> 40:00.660
Yeah, I was pleased.

40:00.660 --> 40:02.820
I had several different versions and generations

40:02.820 --> 40:05.320
and types of KeePass files from the different clients

40:05.320 --> 40:06.160
I'd used over the years,

40:06.160 --> 40:08.180
and all of them just sort of imported fine.

40:08.180 --> 40:10.340
The client version for Linux, the desktop application,

40:10.340 --> 40:13.300
is available as a snap and as a flat pack.

40:13.300 --> 40:14.140
And app image.

40:14.140 --> 40:16.220
Yep, and an app image, and it's sandboxed, I believe,

40:16.220 --> 40:17.420
as both snap and flat pack.

40:17.420 --> 40:18.260
I believe so.

40:18.260 --> 40:19.660
They're in a sandbox, so that's nice and safe

40:19.660 --> 40:20.500
for a password manager.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.780
They've also got a little CLI.

40:22.780 --> 40:24.660
It is node-based, so it's not the most lightweight,

40:24.660 --> 40:26.260
but they've got a little handy CLI client

40:26.260 --> 40:27.660
to interact with the vaults, too.

40:27.660 --> 40:29.540
Yeah, that's right, I wanted to mention that part,

40:29.540 --> 40:31.300
because that is actually pretty cool.

40:31.300 --> 40:33.100
It's nerd-friendly, right, but it also kind of

40:33.100 --> 40:35.160
is good enough to work for your family members

40:35.160 --> 40:36.220
if you're gonna go that route.

40:36.220 --> 40:37.940
We will have a link, again, in the show notes,

40:37.940 --> 40:40.940
linuxunplug.com slash 316, to an article I used

40:40.940 --> 40:44.460
where it's a one-line command that you copy and paste,

40:44.460 --> 40:46.380
and you can fire up an experimental container

40:46.380 --> 40:47.220
and play with this thing.

40:47.220 --> 40:49.500
We're not talking like it's a big investment.

40:49.500 --> 40:52.540
Really a big, high recommendation of Bitwarden

40:52.540 --> 40:53.620
from the team.

40:53.620 --> 40:55.500
I've been using it now for just a couple of days,

40:55.500 --> 40:57.380
but it was smoother than any other transition

40:57.380 --> 41:00.140
I've ever done, so I'm pretty optimistic,

41:00.140 --> 41:02.040
and you're using it, Alex is using it.

41:02.040 --> 41:03.500
I'm picking up a theme here.

41:03.500 --> 41:05.460
Chris is a little resistant to change,

41:05.460 --> 41:06.460
but once he does, he's like,

41:06.460 --> 41:07.980
oh my god, this is so much better.

41:07.980 --> 41:09.900
As long as it's good, it's gotta meet

41:09.900 --> 41:10.740
all the various needs of the fissure.

41:10.740 --> 41:12.340
Key paths just didn't do it for me,

41:12.340 --> 41:15.700
because for key paths, I then needed to rely

41:15.700 --> 41:17.300
on either Dropbox or Sync.

41:17.300 --> 41:18.740
There was all this extra stuff to it

41:18.740 --> 41:20.100
that didn't work for me.

41:20.100 --> 41:22.080
But this solves those problems.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.700
I was really sad to see LastPass be acquired,

41:24.700 --> 41:28.980
and the general posture of that acquisition

41:28.980 --> 41:30.700
didn't sit right with me,

41:30.700 --> 41:33.220
and finding Bitwarden was like an oasis

41:33.220 --> 41:34.300
in the desert at that point,

41:34.300 --> 41:36.660
and I'm really happy to see how this project

41:36.660 --> 41:38.900
has matured over the last couple of years.

41:38.900 --> 41:40.340
It's great.

41:40.340 --> 41:42.700
Now, if you're curious about their types of encryption

41:42.700 --> 41:45.540
that they use and whatnot, they have that explained, too.

41:45.540 --> 41:47.140
I'll have a link to that in the show notes,

41:47.140 --> 41:50.300
and also a link to the audit that they went through,

41:50.300 --> 41:51.300
so you can give that a read.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.360
It's always good to be paranoid

41:52.360 --> 41:53.200
about these kinds of things,

41:53.200 --> 41:54.560
so we definitely encourage being paranoid

41:54.560 --> 41:56.320
when it comes to your password manager.

41:56.320 --> 41:57.800
So check out, we've tried to really pack

41:57.800 --> 41:58.740
the show notes full of links

41:58.740 --> 42:00.760
to help everybody who's doing some research,

42:00.760 --> 42:02.500
but really good recommendation.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.080
If there's something wrong with it,

42:04.080 --> 42:05.260
we're all screwed at this point,

42:05.260 --> 42:07.180
because I'm putting our team passwords in there.

42:07.180 --> 42:08.220
Watch out!

42:08.220 --> 42:10.180
I do have one question about Bitwarden.

42:10.180 --> 42:13.420
Does it also support secure notes and stuff

42:13.420 --> 42:17.860
that are similar to the feature set that LastPass has?

42:17.860 --> 42:20.620
Secure notes, secure autofill.

42:20.620 --> 42:22.460
It also can do two-factor, too,

42:22.460 --> 42:23.600
if you enable those features.

42:23.600 --> 42:24.440
And I did.

42:24.440 --> 42:26.780
I turned on two-factor using Authy.

42:26.780 --> 42:28.940
It was really straightforward and simple,

42:28.940 --> 42:32.540
and took me two minutes, maybe, at most.

42:32.540 --> 42:34.200
Using even just my local installation,

42:34.200 --> 42:35.160
I didn't have to...

42:35.160 --> 42:36.820
It seems when you install it locally,

42:36.820 --> 42:39.340
it has identified you as a paid Pro user,

42:39.340 --> 42:42.300
because my stuff in my menu says Pro users.

42:42.300 --> 42:44.660
Maybe because I'm using the free implementation.

42:44.660 --> 42:46.340
But either way, yeah,

42:46.340 --> 42:49.180
really nice, smooth two-factor process.

42:49.180 --> 42:51.260
I'm like, okay, well, that's just great.

42:51.260 --> 42:53.180
Like, LastPass is kinda clunky.

42:53.180 --> 42:54.820
You gotta go through some process.

42:54.820 --> 42:56.620
I've never seen you complain about that.

42:56.620 --> 42:58.340
Ha ha, yeah.

42:58.340 --> 43:02.260
Is anyone familiar with any hardware sticks

43:02.260 --> 43:03.100
that you can use with this?

43:03.100 --> 43:03.920
Is it compatible?

43:03.920 --> 43:04.760
I imagine it is.

43:04.760 --> 43:06.100
It would be a fairly standard feature,

43:06.100 --> 43:07.740
but anyone have any experience with it?

43:07.740 --> 43:09.240
Believe it works with the Yuba key,

43:09.240 --> 43:12.860
and there's a few others that I'm not as familiar with.

43:12.860 --> 43:14.880
So that's definitely a route you can go.

43:14.880 --> 43:17.500
It can, although I don't really like to recommend it,

43:17.500 --> 43:20.540
also do two-factor via email.

43:20.540 --> 43:22.180
I think that's a bit of a stinker.

43:22.180 --> 43:24.400
And it can also do some recovery code stuff.

43:24.400 --> 43:27.020
So there's some nice stuff to dig into there.

43:27.020 --> 43:29.100
It seems like the project has some really good plans

43:29.100 --> 43:30.840
down the road for that area as well.

43:30.840 --> 43:34.160
But I think, I know it's a bit of a compromise,

43:34.160 --> 43:37.220
but the thing that I really appreciate about Authy

43:37.220 --> 43:40.660
is cross-platform, and I can move between devices

43:40.660 --> 43:42.820
and not lose my two-factor tokens.

43:42.820 --> 43:43.660
Right.

43:43.660 --> 43:45.900
And so it's just that bit of compromise

43:45.900 --> 43:48.740
between something that isn't absolutely as secure

43:48.740 --> 43:52.540
as like an RSA token, but, you know what I mean,

43:52.540 --> 43:55.660
or something that, but it isn't something

43:55.660 --> 43:59.300
that is just as dumb as like SMS text or email.

43:59.300 --> 44:00.120
It's like.

44:00.120 --> 44:00.960
And of course, I mean, if you're not,

44:00.960 --> 44:03.220
if something's not too unworkable,

44:03.220 --> 44:04.060
you're not gonna use it,

44:04.060 --> 44:05.800
and that's not getting you any security wins.

44:05.800 --> 44:08.300
Right, so the nice thing about Authy is

44:08.300 --> 44:11.380
it lets you have all of your two-factor services

44:11.380 --> 44:14.620
in one spot and it synchronizes them across your devices.

44:14.620 --> 44:16.600
It's like if you lose a phone or you switch devices

44:16.600 --> 44:18.640
and you forget to back up your two-factor stuff,

44:18.640 --> 44:19.900
you're not SOL.

44:19.900 --> 44:21.380
And so the fact that it works with that,

44:21.380 --> 44:22.580
works with my workflow,

44:22.580 --> 44:24.340
I'm not necessarily recommending it for everybody,

44:24.340 --> 44:26.320
but it is really nice.

44:26.320 --> 44:27.820
Now we have some feedback to get to.

44:27.820 --> 44:29.040
We don't do that too often in the show,

44:29.040 --> 44:30.900
but we just had some great notes on the subreddit

44:30.900 --> 44:33.340
from our Wayland episode.

44:33.340 --> 44:34.860
We spent the weekend with Wayland

44:34.860 --> 44:37.180
and got some good feedback.

44:37.180 --> 44:38.660
He says, you guys talked about Tilex.

44:38.660 --> 44:41.220
This is the hoot.

44:42.380 --> 44:44.740
It's not with threes and zeros.

44:44.740 --> 44:46.040
He says, you talked about Tilex,

44:46.040 --> 44:47.340
but I still recommend Guake.

44:47.340 --> 44:49.660
It's very stable and supports split windows these days.

44:49.660 --> 44:50.500
It does.

44:51.620 --> 44:54.120
And he thought he'd also mention backup tools.

44:54.120 --> 44:55.820
He doesn't like to trust companies like Google,

44:55.820 --> 44:57.640
Microsoft, or Amazon with any data,

44:57.640 --> 45:00.580
but Spider Oak One, I have to recommend, he says.

45:00.580 --> 45:02.580
Also was recommended by Edward Snowden.

45:02.580 --> 45:05.940
Also, Mr. Poot, I've recommended it too.

45:05.940 --> 45:08.660
I was gonna say, yeah, you used to be a big Spider Oak fan.

45:08.660 --> 45:10.500
I used to back up all my different cloud services

45:10.500 --> 45:11.620
to Spider Oak.

45:11.620 --> 45:12.460
I might do it again.

45:12.460 --> 45:13.300
It's pretty great.

45:13.300 --> 45:14.120
It's pretty great.

45:14.120 --> 45:15.060
Spider Oak's pretty solid.

45:15.060 --> 45:16.900
Anyways, oh, he signs it as Guybrush,

45:16.900 --> 45:19.340
which is much easier to read than the other one.

45:19.340 --> 45:22.540
And our last bit of feedback, One Tune More writes,

45:22.540 --> 45:25.860
the Wayland future is like electric cars are the future.

45:26.860 --> 45:28.500
That's kind of, I like this.

45:28.500 --> 45:32.120
For a very long time, they were good in theory,

45:32.120 --> 45:34.500
but recently they've been good for some uses.

45:34.500 --> 45:36.740
Now they're starting to be good for the masses.

45:36.740 --> 45:38.820
I think we said something similar in the show.

45:38.820 --> 45:42.940
He writes, what Wayland is, Wayland being smooth

45:42.940 --> 45:46.460
really means that Mudder has become really smooth.

45:46.460 --> 45:48.820
Since that's Gnome Shell's compositor,

45:48.820 --> 45:52.020
Mudder has to implement everything which Xorg used to do.

45:52.020 --> 45:54.220
So when you guys are talking about Wayland being smooth,

45:54.220 --> 45:56.600
you're really talking about Gnome Shell being smooth,

45:56.600 --> 45:59.300
which is a fair point and something they're working on.

45:59.300 --> 46:02.700
He writes, I'm predicting Mirror is going to be a huge deal

46:02.700 --> 46:04.580
in a few years.

46:04.580 --> 46:08.180
They are working with projects on standardizing protocols,

46:08.180 --> 46:11.500
for example, adopting a layer shell protocol from WL Roots

46:11.500 --> 46:13.460
and permitting shells built with Mirror

46:13.460 --> 46:16.140
to add protocols as extensions.

46:16.140 --> 46:18.700
Going forward, I predict new compositors and desktops

46:18.700 --> 46:21.660
will choose Mirror or WL Roots to build on,

46:21.660 --> 46:23.860
depending on whether they want to write a plugin

46:23.860 --> 46:25.780
for a pre-built display server like Mirror

46:25.780 --> 46:28.020
or control their own window management rules

46:28.020 --> 46:29.700
and behavior like WL Roots.

46:31.420 --> 46:33.380
Mirror is going to be a big part

46:33.380 --> 46:35.500
of a lot of projects' futures, he says.

46:35.500 --> 46:36.860
Hey, I think that's spot on.

46:36.860 --> 46:39.220
For a lot of projects that have to implement-

46:39.220 --> 46:41.700
Right, you need some helper framework

46:41.700 --> 46:43.300
because there's a lot to implement now.

46:43.300 --> 46:46.420
Today, I saw news about the next release of XFCE,

46:46.420 --> 46:48.580
which is expected in a year,

46:48.580 --> 46:50.860
and they're already saying no GTK, no Wayland.

46:50.860 --> 46:53.020
No GTK4, I should say, and no Wayland.

46:53.020 --> 46:53.860
Sorry.

46:53.860 --> 46:55.660
Yeah, I mean, it's not too surprising.

46:55.660 --> 46:58.220
Also, interesting technical detail about Flameshot.

46:58.220 --> 47:00.260
That was our screenshot tool that we recommended

47:00.260 --> 47:01.340
that we all really like.

47:01.340 --> 47:03.180
It doesn't actually use the Wayland protocol.

47:03.180 --> 47:04.500
It works with KD and Gnome Shell

47:04.500 --> 47:06.500
using Dbus for communication.

47:06.500 --> 47:07.620
Yeah, and they are clear about that.

47:07.620 --> 47:08.940
If you go look at the Flameshot docs,

47:08.940 --> 47:11.500
it's basically like, well, these two big guys

47:11.500 --> 47:12.340
gave us hooks.

47:12.340 --> 47:14.020
We're going to use them because it makes our stuff work.

47:14.020 --> 47:17.140
That's what that means, is that's your limitation.

47:17.140 --> 47:17.980
Yeah, yeah.

47:17.980 --> 47:20.540
So he says it'll be quite a while

47:20.540 --> 47:23.420
before we see the dust settle on all this Wayland stuff.

47:23.420 --> 47:25.780
Hey, it's an active project, right?

47:25.780 --> 47:27.100
Yeah, if you didn't catch our episode,

47:27.100 --> 47:29.300
we spent the weekend with Wayland last weekend.

47:29.300 --> 47:31.100
I actually am still using it.

47:31.100 --> 47:36.100
On my laptop, I, over the weekend, very proudly,

47:36.820 --> 47:40.820
played some No Man's Sky using Proton on Wayland

47:40.820 --> 47:44.060
using an eGPU with a Bluetooth headphones

47:44.060 --> 47:45.220
and a Bluetooth mouse.

47:45.220 --> 47:46.460
I think you have to be clear at this point.

47:46.460 --> 47:47.580
You did that on Linux.

47:47.580 --> 47:49.500
Yeah, I did.

47:49.500 --> 47:51.420
And the only downside is my,

47:51.420 --> 47:53.540
Bose headphones, they convert to phone mode

47:53.540 --> 47:54.380
when you use voice.

47:54.380 --> 47:57.340
And so I sounded like I was on a telephone call from 1920,

47:57.340 --> 47:58.660
but that wasn't Linux's fault.

47:58.660 --> 47:59.500
Yeah, no, no.

47:59.500 --> 48:00.780
And you probably sounded pretty good.

48:00.780 --> 48:04.300
Chris did a whole bit where he was 1938 World's Fair.

48:04.300 --> 48:05.420
Chris, it was very funny.

48:05.420 --> 48:06.260
Yeah, it was great.

48:06.260 --> 48:07.100
It really was great.

48:07.100 --> 48:10.420
Yeah, but that was the only downside.

48:10.420 --> 48:13.420
I mean, we played No Man's Sky for a long time,

48:13.420 --> 48:15.580
and I didn't have a single issue.

48:15.580 --> 48:19.540
I mean, this is one eGPU cable into my laptop,

48:19.540 --> 48:22.860
which only has Intel graphics, on Wayland

48:22.860 --> 48:26.620
playing a Windows game, okay?

48:26.620 --> 48:29.260
Using a Bluetooth mouse without lag

48:29.260 --> 48:30.580
with Bluetooth headphones

48:30.580 --> 48:32.380
where the sound is matched up with the gunfire.

48:32.380 --> 48:33.220
That's crazy.

48:33.220 --> 48:34.060
I can't even with that.

48:34.060 --> 48:36.180
We played for almost three hours or so.

48:36.180 --> 48:37.900
Flawlessly, I played flawlessly.

48:37.900 --> 48:41.140
You were playing on top of Wayland and never crashed,

48:41.140 --> 48:44.140
but I think Drew had a different setup

48:44.140 --> 48:45.580
and had crashed a couple of times.

48:45.580 --> 48:47.300
So I wonder what the difference there was.

48:47.300 --> 48:51.100
He has a slightly nicer AMD card than I have,

48:51.100 --> 48:52.900
and he seems to have all of the issues.

48:52.900 --> 48:54.740
He has a lot of problems.

48:54.740 --> 48:56.540
I wonder if it's just the support thing there

48:56.540 --> 48:57.940
on the AMD card then.

48:57.940 --> 48:58.980
Maybe.

48:58.980 --> 48:59.820
I kind of cheaped out.

48:59.820 --> 49:04.380
I got like a mid-range card since I figured it's in an eGPU.

49:04.380 --> 49:06.540
So why go like the top of the line?

49:06.540 --> 49:08.620
And it's just been super solid.

49:08.620 --> 49:11.300
The only downside is there's this AMD reset bug.

49:11.300 --> 49:14.140
So when the machine goes to sleep or anything like that,

49:14.140 --> 49:17.060
to get the eGPU, you have to go to the top of the line.

49:17.060 --> 49:18.900
Get the eGPU working again.

49:18.900 --> 49:22.540
I have to completely power down, physically power off the eGPU,

49:22.540 --> 49:24.180
and then power everything back up

49:24.180 --> 49:25.740
before my eGPU works again.

49:25.740 --> 49:27.860
It's just like the old days of pass through that.

49:27.860 --> 49:29.900
You used to have to do that with every single video card,

49:29.900 --> 49:32.860
never mind just a few specific ones.

49:32.860 --> 49:34.380
And there's some ways you can fix it,

49:34.380 --> 49:37.020
depending on the type of ROM that's on your card

49:37.020 --> 49:37.540
and all that.

49:37.540 --> 49:38.940
Sell it and buy the right card.

49:38.940 --> 49:39.700
That's the answer.

49:39.700 --> 49:40.060
Oh, yeah?

49:40.060 --> 49:41.900
There is a specific card where I won't even have to mess with

49:41.900 --> 49:42.180
it?

49:42.180 --> 49:44.220
Just find one that doesn't have the reset bug.

49:44.220 --> 49:47.500
And as we talked about in our VFIA episode a little while

49:47.500 --> 49:50.700
ago, the right hardware is almost more important

49:50.700 --> 49:51.780
than the right software.

49:51.780 --> 49:53.740
Really, it's truly remarkable that that whole stack's

49:53.740 --> 49:54.460
working, though.

49:54.460 --> 49:56.220
And you know, it's using X-Wayland in there

49:56.220 --> 49:57.460
to play the game and all that.

49:57.460 --> 49:59.980
It's just mind blowing.

49:59.980 --> 50:01.940
I want to share a pic before we go.

50:01.940 --> 50:03.260
USB top.

50:03.260 --> 50:05.340
It's like the top utility we all know and love,

50:05.340 --> 50:09.220
but it shows an estimated instantaneous bandwidth

50:09.220 --> 50:12.060
on your USB buses and devices.

50:12.060 --> 50:14.980
You can see who's hogging up all them USB bandwidths.

50:14.980 --> 50:15.700
How neat is this?

50:15.700 --> 50:16.620
That is neat.

50:16.620 --> 50:18.620
I gave it a little compile before the show.

50:18.620 --> 50:21.740
It seemed like maybe it's packaged in some repositories,

50:21.740 --> 50:23.660
but it wasn't available to me that way.

50:23.660 --> 50:27.260
It was easy to compile, and it does exactly what it says.

50:27.260 --> 50:28.820
You just sort of check, and you run it up,

50:28.820 --> 50:30.860
and then it shows you all your different buses

50:30.860 --> 50:33.540
and devices on them, and then if there's any activity.

50:33.540 --> 50:34.940
You do have to do a bit of legwork.

50:34.940 --> 50:35.580
You do.

50:35.580 --> 50:38.220
And you have to mod probe USB Mon, like all that kind of stuff.

50:38.220 --> 50:39.500
You had to do all that in a minute.

50:39.500 --> 50:40.020
Indeed.

50:40.020 --> 50:42.220
Yeah, but once you get it going, you

50:42.220 --> 50:43.980
don't even need to run it as root necessarily.

50:43.980 --> 50:45.680
As long as you're on a more modern Linux,

50:45.680 --> 50:48.060
you can just run USB top, boom.

50:48.060 --> 50:49.500
There's all your bandwidth hogs.

50:49.500 --> 50:50.500
It's pretty fun.

50:50.500 --> 50:52.340
So we'll put a link to that in the show notes.

50:52.340 --> 50:57.940
Good luck, because yeah, six months ago it was active,

50:57.940 --> 51:00.380
but I think the core code is about six years old.

51:00.380 --> 51:02.140
So good luck.

51:02.140 --> 51:04.100
Travel safely, but we believe in you.

51:04.100 --> 51:06.180
We'll have a link in the show notes for that as well.

51:06.180 --> 51:06.780
USB top.

51:06.780 --> 51:07.580
How about that?

51:07.580 --> 51:09.780
And I think it's really cool too for those little

51:09.780 --> 51:12.700
single-board computers where everything's on one bus.

51:12.700 --> 51:15.740
So if you are building a NAS with a single-board computer,

51:15.740 --> 51:18.220
you can actually kind of measure that throughput

51:18.220 --> 51:21.760
and know if you're getting enough throughput

51:21.760 --> 51:23.540
or if that's your bottleneck.

51:23.540 --> 51:25.020
This is amazing.

51:25.020 --> 51:26.380
I've never seen this before.

51:26.380 --> 51:29.660
And it's in Ubuntu after you install USB top.

51:29.660 --> 51:30.660
Jeez, come on, WestPen.

51:30.660 --> 51:32.060
What are you running over there?

51:32.060 --> 51:33.460
Aren't you running Ubuntu?

51:33.460 --> 51:33.940
Yeah.

51:33.940 --> 51:35.180
You didn't have to build it.

51:35.180 --> 51:37.460
You just did it.

51:37.460 --> 51:38.780
You're so funny.

51:38.780 --> 51:40.020
I didn't check because I'm on that.

51:40.020 --> 51:41.620
I mean, the search doesn't find it.

51:41.620 --> 51:43.060
But maybe I typed the right thing.

51:43.060 --> 51:45.260
Maybe Popey knows how to Ubuntu better, though.

51:45.260 --> 51:46.020
I'm sure he does.

51:46.020 --> 51:46.620
It's possible.

51:46.620 --> 51:47.180
I hope so.

51:47.180 --> 51:48.020
It's awesome.

51:48.020 --> 51:49.260
Well, it's good to have you back, Popey.

51:49.260 --> 51:50.860
And you didn't get a sunburn, did you?

51:50.860 --> 51:51.580
Nope, not at all.

51:51.580 --> 51:52.380
Didn't go outside.

51:52.380 --> 51:53.700
You didn't go outside.

51:53.700 --> 51:54.780
I know that's false.

51:54.780 --> 51:56.220
It's too damn hot outside.

51:56.220 --> 51:57.180
I'm not going outside.

51:57.180 --> 51:58.500
You can't help it.

51:58.500 --> 52:02.820
I got a sunburn walking from the hotel across a parking lot

52:02.820 --> 52:06.060
to a Mexican restaurant in Texas last time.

52:06.060 --> 52:09.100
Just the 10 minutes back and forth, I got a sunburn.

52:09.100 --> 52:11.700
I'm blessed with slightly darker skin than you, though, Chris.

52:11.700 --> 52:13.700
So I don't tend to get burned.

52:13.700 --> 52:15.180
You're blessed in many ways, Popey.

52:15.180 --> 52:16.660
But that's for another show.

52:16.660 --> 52:20.660
Anyways, go check out Ubuntu Podcast and User Air,

52:20.660 --> 52:21.620
two great shows.

52:21.620 --> 52:24.020
And while you're at it, if you're on Telegram,

52:24.020 --> 52:27.420
go get telecast with Popey, recently co-starring

52:27.420 --> 52:30.620
the one, the only Martin Wimpress from America's

52:30.620 --> 52:31.940
friendliest airport.

52:31.940 --> 52:32.660
Go check that out.

52:32.660 --> 52:33.260
It's great.

52:33.260 --> 52:34.500
Popey, thank you for joining us.

52:34.500 --> 52:35.020
Thank you.

52:35.020 --> 52:36.900
Everybody out there, thank you for joining us.

52:36.900 --> 52:39.980
I am so elated to announce the self-hosted podcast.

52:39.980 --> 52:41.900
Again, don't forget our meetup, meetup.com

52:41.900 --> 52:43.020
slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

52:43.020 --> 52:45.940
If you're in the Lexington area, come join us.

52:45.940 --> 52:47.500
And then check out selfhosted.show

52:47.500 --> 52:50.420
slash subscribe for the RSS feed.

52:50.420 --> 52:52.460
I should be live from Raleigh next Tuesday.

52:52.460 --> 52:54.420
So come see if I can pull that one off.

52:54.420 --> 52:55.980
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

52:55.980 --> 53:14.840
See ya.

53:14.840 --> 53:38.880
All right, all right, so here's the, it's just not an 1804.

53:38.880 --> 53:40.920
Newer versions have it.

53:40.920 --> 53:43.920
All right, you're off the hook, Wes.

53:43.920 --> 53:47.920
So Chris, what's this relationship thing we were going to post show?

53:47.920 --> 53:48.920
Oh yeah, right.

53:48.920 --> 53:53.120
Well, I mean, it really does, I don't know, like, okay, for example, I'm about to get

53:53.120 --> 53:56.840
on an airplane and fly down to Raleigh and then we're going to get in a car and drive

53:56.840 --> 53:59.120
for seven hours to go do something.

53:59.120 --> 54:04.720
Like a new show is very much like, kind of like a polyamorous relationship where you've

54:04.720 --> 54:09.780
already got a couple of wives and now you've got to work a new wife into the, or husband,

54:09.780 --> 54:11.280
or husband into the mix.

54:11.280 --> 54:14.120
Well, you've got to be fair, but you'd still have to, you know, sort of prioritize.

54:14.120 --> 54:15.120
Right.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.120
There's a lot of things to juggle.

54:16.120 --> 54:18.440
Well, it's true, because then I sit here and I think to myself, am I spending enough time

54:18.440 --> 54:19.640
with Linux unplugged?

54:19.640 --> 54:24.440
And now I've got this new show I'm doing, you know, like, it's a lot of pressure.

54:24.440 --> 54:26.360
We're a very jealous show.

54:26.360 --> 54:30.160
And the truth be told, like, I know that a new show needs a little bit extra of attention

54:30.160 --> 54:33.040
and it's just a lot to take on and I've got to be there when I'm sick.

54:33.040 --> 54:34.320
I've got to be there when I'm healthy.

54:34.320 --> 54:37.320
I've got to be there in tough and bad and hard and good times.

54:37.320 --> 54:42.840
Like it's, it is a different form of a relationship, but some, some weeks you won't have content,

54:42.840 --> 54:45.780
you won't know what to do, but you'll have to struggle through and you stick, we stick

54:45.780 --> 54:50.360
with it, you stick with it and it, it's, it sounds silly, but it's, it's so many ways

54:50.360 --> 54:51.960
there's a lot of analogies.

54:51.960 --> 54:57.280
And so when I'm like really getting committed to something, I freak out a little bit.

54:57.280 --> 55:02.000
I freak out just not that I have commitment issues, obviously I'm married, but I just

55:02.000 --> 55:06.280
kind of like, I actualize the amount of commitment I am making because this thing could go on

55:06.280 --> 55:07.440
for a decade.

55:07.440 --> 55:09.440
Can I, uh, can I pull out at this point?

55:09.440 --> 55:10.440
Is that an option?

55:10.440 --> 55:11.440
I know my freaking us.

55:11.440 --> 55:12.440
We're all in now, buddy.

55:12.440 --> 55:13.440
We're all in.

55:13.440 --> 55:19.440
I've already bought my tickets and I'm headed your way.

55:19.440 --> 55:37.520
I'm getting on a plane to London tonight.
