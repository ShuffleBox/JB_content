1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Hey, guys, I got into a bit of trouble last night.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,600
Last night, huh?

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,520
Well, it started during daylight hours

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,240
and then went deep into the night.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,120
And it all started when one of my power supplies

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,240
blew up while I was trying to use it.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,480
And you know that electronic smell we've all smelled?

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,160
Oh, yes.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,720
Oh, yeah.

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,080
You know instantly that something's wrong, right?

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,320
And I was like, oh, no.

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,480
It lingers for hours as well.

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,040
I think Brent's getting a new power supply for the holidays

14
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,360
is what's happening there.

15
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,760
I got a cascade of telegram messages from Brent.

16
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,960
As the evening progressed, they got progressively worse.

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,080
Alex may have woke up to some pretty sad Brent.

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,000
So I've got some computers to fix over there.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,760
I suppose we should ask if you're OK.

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,320
But all we care about is the tech.

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,640
I have a few like knuckle scrapes

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,640
from like frustrated screwing and unscrewing and screwing

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,280
and unscrewing.

24
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,640
But other than that, I think I'm going to get

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,200
some new computers this year.

26
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:06,480
Oh, hey there.

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,800
Welcome in to Linux Unplugged episode 334.

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,520
My name is Chris.

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,240
My name is Wes.

30
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,880
Hello, Wes.

31
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,640
Hello.

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,160
How are you feeling about today?

33
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,120
Oh, I'm a little nervous.

34
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,080
I don't think I did so well last year.

35
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,320
I don't think I did very, very well either, Wes.

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,760
But you know, there's no shame in learning from our mistakes.

37
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
There's a lot of shame.

38
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,480
But we will still learn from our mistakes.

39
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,440
To help keep us on the straight and narrow,

40
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,640
the judge has returned for his annual judging.

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,360
Hello, Joe.

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,080
Hello.

43
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,360
I'm going to keep you all in check.

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,160
That's right, on the straight and narrow.

45
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,800
And then, of course, to help us really kind of pile

46
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,680
onto our mistakes, Alex, Cheese, and Brent are here as well.

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,920
And then we need people to roast us.

48
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,560
Hello, gentlemen.

49
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,040
Hello.

50
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,720
Hello there.

51
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,480
Well, hello.

52
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,760
Happy holidays.

53
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,880
Thank you for joining us on this very special episode here

54
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,240
of the old program.

55
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,240
We are doing this one offline to make a special treat

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,480
for those listening at home, in the feeds.

57
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,240
You know, Wes brought a piano.

58
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,440
Oh, it's lovely.

59
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,560
God, you got so many talents.

60
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,000
Listen to this.

61
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,240
Good idea putting the mic on that, Wes.

62
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,160
So isn't he talented?

63
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,360
It's so impressive.

64
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,840
So before we get started, it's nice to sit a moment

65
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,000
with friends.

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,720
Here we all are at the end of the year,

67
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,320
and we're about to make fools of ourselves.

68
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,760
So why don't we just get a couple of business items out

69
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,240
of the way?

70
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,280
Because there's things we've got to talk about.

71
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
There's always a few things.

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,680
There's always a few things.

73
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,560
As we record this here and now, next week

74
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,920
will be our actual predictions for the year of 2020.

75
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,720
We decided to get the reviews out of the way,

76
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,880
own up to our mistakes before the next round of predictions,

77
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,680
in part to incorporate some of that learning

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,040
into our next predictions.

79
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,380
Though I don't think it will help.

80
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,520
No, it turns out this is just not really very easy to do,

81
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,000
is it?

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,640
This is like my hardest year to make predictions ever.

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,760
Despite it being, it's been a great year.

84
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,640
Yeah, oh yeah, no, for sure.

85
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,160
There's just been so much going on.

86
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,080
First of all, I haven't really had my head in the game.

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,560
And second of all, after listening

88
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,200
to previous year's prediction episodes,

89
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,320
I mean, it's just such a crapshoot.

90
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
You really have no idea.

91
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,800
That's part of why it's fun.

92
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,440
Yeah, yeah, except for every time

93
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,080
you kind of sound like a fool.

94
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,200
So I decided to have a little philosophy change this year

95
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,680
for my predictions.

96
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,580
For this episode, I'm going to go a little more out there.

97
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,040
I might be going for a little more

98
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,040
on the entertainment side than I am the actual prediction side.

99
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,000
This is going to be more like let's go for pie

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,240
in the sky kind of stuff.

101
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,080
Are you just saying that so you have something to sort of

102
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,320
soften the blow next year?

103
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,540
No, no, it's because I'm keeping all my serious predictions

104
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,280
for Linux Action News where I'm really

105
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,440
get competitive with Joe.

106
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,720
That's why I'm, that's what's going on there.

107
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,080
I realize it's like, oh, I've got

108
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,200
to keep all the really good ones for Linux Action News,

109
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,320
because Joe's going to get serious about this.

110
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,400
So I got to blow all of my crazy out there wild ones right now.

111
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,480
But I got some ones that I really hope turn out.

112
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,760
But you'll have to wait and see.

113
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,140
The predictions Linux Action News

114
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,880
is coming out soon in the feed.

115
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,720
And our predictions, all of ours,

116
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,080
will be out in the next episode.

117
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,340
But this one, this one we own up.

118
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,200
And before we do that, just a spot of housekeeping,

119
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,140
as our friends across the pond would say.

120
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,760
I'm not positive, but I think that's

121
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,280
how they would say it's a spot of housekeeping this week.

122
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,360
Number one, you may have heard recently about our big news.

123
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,480
We have been acquired by a cloud guru.

124
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,560
And they have big plans to make everything

125
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,240
bigger and better for everyone.

126
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,680
And a Q&A, including their commitment to future Linux

127
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,440
content, has been posted.

128
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,680
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

129
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,080
Go read up on that.

130
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,920
It's pretty cool.

131
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,760
Big, exciting news.

132
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,040
The future is going to be very bright and exciting.

133
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,140
Stay tuned.

134
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,320
Now, these programs here, they're not live right now.

135
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,560
We're doing the holiday thing.

136
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,160
So if you want to keep talking to us,

137
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,640
keep the conversation going, you can find us in the Telegram.

138
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,840
jupitabroadcasting.com slash telegram.

139
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,440
That's where you get that.

140
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,120
Get on that business.

141
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,680
It's not just the releases.

142
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,760
And then I want to make everyone aware,

143
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,520
because I've gotten several questions, that live stream

144
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,960
I did making Plasma basic to brilliant, where I was really

145
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,080
kind of not sure how that was going to turn out,

146
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,120
turned out great.

147
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
And it's been posted.

148
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,960
And we'll have a link to that in the show notes

149
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,040
if you want to try out Plasma and go through some

150
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,880
of the tips and steps and tricks that I

151
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,640
use to make my workstation pretty usable.

152
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,280
Why not give yourself the gift of a beautiful desktop?

153
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,640
That's right, from basic to brilliant.

154
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,720
Super neat side note about that.

155
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,560
The Plasma team and Jonathan Riddle watched the video.

156
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,960
And so they're going to implement

157
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,640
a couple of those suggestions of mine

158
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,760
as defaults in future releases.

159
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,480
And that some of the things I was tweaking

160
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,880
are already fixed in the next version of Plasma.

161
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,920
How cool is that?

162
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
What a great desktop.

163
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,640
Yeah, so they took some of that feedback

164
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,360
in, even though I was a little rough on the defaults.

165
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,040
And they took that in, and they're

166
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,520
going to implement some of it, not all of it, but some of it.

167
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,480
That's a pretty great outcome of that live stream.

168
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,240
It really is.

169
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,600
So it's about, it's actually an hour right on the nose.

170
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,960
But at the beginning of the video,

171
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,620
I lay out sort of the format.

172
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,500
So if you just need certain parts of the video,

173
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,100
it's pretty easy to jump around.

174
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,960
So you go get that at the show notes,

175
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,520
linuxunplug.com slash 3, 3, 4.

176
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,640
And that, that's our housekeeping.

177
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,000
Nice, tight, easy, clean.

178
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,560
Very easy.

179
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,680
You guys have been keeping it tidy,

180
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,200
so there's not a real, there's not

181
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,760
a need for a lot of tidying.

182
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,080
Don't make a mess for us now.

183
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,840
We're going to make a mess today.

184
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,080
Oh, Wes.

185
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
OK, are you ready for this?

186
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,520
As ready as I'm going to be.

187
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,360
OK, so last year, we made a bunch of bold predictions.

188
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,600
And right now, it's time for us to own up.

189
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,760
And what do you say you and I will go back and forth?

190
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,400
So I'll do one of mine, and we'll do one of yours.

191
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,040
Yeah, that sounds fair.

192
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
And then the judge will tell us if we got it right or not.

193
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,800
Uh-oh.

194
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,720
You ready, judge?

195
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,520
I'm ready.

196
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,600
All right.

197
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,520
Here is my first prediction from last year.

198
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,280
In 2019, Google will announce that you

199
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,360
can start testing your Android applications on Fuchsia

200
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,720
using their handy generic emulator.

201
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
I didn't see that announcement, I don't think.

202
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,840
No, no.

203
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,480
I can't believe.

204
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,880
That should have happened, right?

205
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,640
I mean, come on.

206
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,840
That's such an obvious move.

207
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
Sort of less Fuchsia news over the year than I expected,

208
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,440
really.

209
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,720
Other than just recently with the Flutter conference stuff.

210
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,320
True.

211
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,200
But yeah.

212
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,400
What's the word, judge?

213
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,800
I'm afraid that is a fail.

214
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,300
Fuchsia.

215
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,840
All right.

216
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,360
That's good.

217
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,840
That's fine.

218
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,480
Do you still think it's going to maybe come around soon?

219
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,000
I do.

220
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,480
Oh, I do.

221
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,440
I totally do.

222
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,240
I don't actually have it down as a 2020 prediction,

223
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,320
but maybe I should.

224
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,840
That's all right.

225
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,360
I'm sure one of these other ones are going to be winners.

226
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,120
So are you ready for yours, Wes?

227
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,960
Yeah, let's have it.

228
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,680
I wish this one would have happened.

229
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,680
In 2019, BcashFS will enter the mainline kernel

230
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,440
and be shipped in a distribution like Arch.

231
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,080
No dice on that one, that's for sure.

232
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,000
It's kind of a shame.

233
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,360
I mean, we've just pivoted back to using Flutter again,

234
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,800
so maybe we don't need it.

235
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,160
But it's a project I like.

236
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,800
I continue to support it, and I hope

237
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,680
to see it in a kernel sometime soon.

238
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,720
But it is pretty easy to get it going on Arch, right?

239
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,280
Yeah, you can just build the module and load it in,

240
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,200
no problem.

241
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,520
It's almost halfway there, but it's not mainstreamed.

242
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,600
No, I'm afraid it's got another fail.

243
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,440
It hurts my soul.

244
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,680
This is going to be rough, I feel like.

245
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,180
And like, that should have happened,

246
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,400
but I think it's just still too early.

247
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,680
We didn't even get Wirecard.

248
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,000
Right.

249
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,520
As we know, it takes a long time to get things there,

250
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,240
and rightfully so.

251
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,880
Once it's in, it will stay there, right?

252
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,480
Forever, yeah.

253
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,720
I'm sure this next one I got right.

254
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,320
Are you ready?

255
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,120
Oh, let's hear it.

256
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,880
In 2019, I thought it was all going

257
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,160
to be about the virtual desktop.

258
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,140
Turned out it's about virtual game streaming.

259
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,760
In 2019, Microsoft Azure or Digital Ocean

260
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,200
launches a Linux-based virtual desktop.

261
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
How did that not happen?

262
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,640
I don't know.

263
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm actually kind of a little surprised.

264
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,040
Come on, come on.

265
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,840
Somebody come to my defense on this one.

266
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,460
This should have happened.

267
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,920
It's so obvious.

268
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,360
It feels like something so easy for them to do.

269
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,400
Maybe that's because I don't realize what's

270
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,360
going on in the background, but this

271
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,120
would be so amazing to allow so many people to get advantage

272
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,000
of machines that are maybe more powerful than their own,

273
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,260
but you can just use like it's almost like a thin client.

274
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,560
It is, for sure.

275
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,360
I could definitely see it in terms of distance to storage.

276
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,960
That's where I think it gets used a lot on Amazon

277
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,560
is you're doing something that's with a large data set,

278
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,200
and that data set is on S3, or it's on Digital Ocean Spaces,

279
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,560
or whatever it might be.

280
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,640
And so instead of having to download it to a LAN somewhere

281
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,880
and then process it on a desktop PC,

282
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,360
people just get a cheap desktop PC,

283
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,560
and then they remote into the virtual instance on Amazon,

284
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,360
and it's essentially LAN access speeds to the data set

285
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,040
and plus the CPU scalability of AWS.

286
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,680
Well, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head a little

287
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,200
bit, too, with Stadia.

288
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,240
I mean, it's obvious that Google has the power

289
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,640
to do these types of things, and it's really surprising

290
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
that with Chrome OS and the popularity of Chromebooks

291
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,320
that this didn't come true, at least with what Google is now

292
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,480
offering with Stadia.

293
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,320
Right.

294
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,520
They could totally stream a Linux desktop, yeah.

295
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,040
So there is Windows on Azure, a Windows desktop.

296
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Is it just that Linux is command line friendly?

297
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
You don't need the GUI in the same sense?

298
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,800
It seems to be a very viable product for Amazon.

299
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,280
Like, it's a thing they're selling,

300
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,880
and that's why I made this prediction,

301
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,760
is I thought they would just sort of get

302
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,320
emulated by other providers.

303
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,160
Does Shadow count?

304
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Linus Tech Tips covered a service

305
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,720
called Shadow that does, I mean, it's aimed at gaming,

306
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,160
but it gives you a fully-fledged Windows desktop.

307
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,840
I guess that's the problem here, isn't it?

308
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,480
Really?

309
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,200
That sounds kind of handy for people

310
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,520
that don't want to bother with VMs or dual booting.

311
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,720
That's kind of neat.

312
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,480
No, no, I was really thinking it would

313
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,680
be one of the major providers.

314
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,600
I'll let the judge decide.

315
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,640
What do you say, Judge?

316
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,480
I'm afraid that it's a fail.

317
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,440
I'll take it.

318
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,280
Yeah, I'll take it.

319
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,240
But why am I not surprised that Alex wants

320
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,000
to self-host his own desktop?

321
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,880
Come on, it's all about the cloud, man.

322
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,600
Yeah, man.

323
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,640
I've done this.

324
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,760
Over the year, I did it.

325
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,720
You know, I really, it was self-serving for me.

326
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,840
I wanted to see it, because then I

327
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,160
could travel with like the thinnest, smallest laptop

328
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,160
possible and do all my work somewhere else.

329
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,480
Aren't you already doing that?

330
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,400
When you're traveling is when you have the worst internet.

331
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,880
Not when I go see you, Alex.

332
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,640
For now, yeah.

333
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,680
Yeah, there's some spots where you can get pretty good

334
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,200
at connectivity, but you would still want some local.

335
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,080
We're just not quite there yet.

336
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,480
How about another Westpane prediction already?

337
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,720
I think this one, you may have had some insider knowledge

338
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,120
on the direction things were going.

339
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,280
Me?

340
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,920
Never.

341
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,680
Westpane makes a prediction about my desktop habits

342
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,980
for 2019.

343
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,120
I predict that in 2019, Chris is using the Gnome desktop

344
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,440
on at least one production machine for 60 days or longer.

345
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,560
I sounded confident.

346
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,680
What do we consider a production machine?

347
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,760
Because I will note, all of the studio machines

348
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,640
are running plasma.

349
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,560
However.

350
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,200
Machines you do work on, not a test machine or a toy machine.

351
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,000
OK.

352
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,320
All right.

353
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,200
That's what I intended.

354
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,040
At 60 days or longer?

355
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,400
Yeah, that definitely happened.

356
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,000
Woo-hoo!

357
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,640
I think that's a pretty easy one, Judge.

358
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,200
Any issues there, Judge?

359
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,720
No.

360
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,040
I think that as long as it was on that office machine upstairs

361
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,640
at least, then it counts.

362
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,760
That's a win.

363
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,600
Yeah, it feels good.

364
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,680
That's probably my only one.

365
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,600
I'm going to savor it.

366
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,640
That's our first win right there.

367
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,160
That's good.

368
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,040
You're right.

369
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,400
Not only did I run it on my workstation up in my office,

370
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,160
which is where I prep many of the shows,

371
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,800
but I ran it until just very recently on my ThinkPad

372
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,920
on Fedora.

373
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,760
And now my ThinkPad is still Fedora,

374
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,440
but it is now Plasma, because that's how I do.

375
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,080
But that was a good prediction, Wes.

376
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,740
All right.

377
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,320
Let's see if I got this one.

378
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,960
I had a sense, and I think maybe I got this one right,

379
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,520
that Clear Linux would become a bigger deal throughout 2019.

380
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,360
2019, we'll see 50 publications about Clear Linux.

381
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,720
The Clear Linux hype will grow, excluding articles

382
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,320
from Ferronix and coverage from Linux Unplugged.

383
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,680
I shouldn't have excluded Ferronix.

384
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,720
I don't know why I did that.

385
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,120
I was just feeling really bold, I guess.

386
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,640
But I, at this time, had no idea that just a couple of months

387
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,680
later, Brent and I would be in Portland.

388
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,160
I was really impressed when we got to go down there

389
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,720
and hear them talk about the product directly.

390
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,760
It was super impressive.

391
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,160
And I think you and I left there with some pretty big smiles

392
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,680
on our faces.

393
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,160
They're doing some pretty impressive stuff.

394
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,760
Remind me what Clear Linux is again.

395
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,720
That's Intel's Linux that has a couple of really unique things,

396
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,760
other than just a whole suite of optimizations

397
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,720
for the Intel platform.

398
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,000
They also have a build system where

399
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,600
you can revert to any build of the OS that's ever existed.

400
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,120
They keep every version of every package, every build,

401
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,640
online available.

402
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,600
It takes terabytes and terabytes and terabytes of space.

403
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,480
And it's extremely fast.

404
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,840
And they have this concept of sort

405
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,520
of creating your own recipe of Clear Linux,

406
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:58,280
where when you roll it out, it's more bespoke to you

407
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,320
using a central automation system.

408
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,840
Right, it's still tied into the platform.

409
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,600
You just get to have more knobs to turn.

410
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,800
It's like solving the problem that Arch and Gentoo offer,

411
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,280
while still being maintained by A, Intel,

412
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,000
and B, still having a main reference to follow.

413
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,920
It's a pretty unique idea for people

414
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,320
that want super optimized server systems.

415
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,160
And we ended up down there at their Intel campus

416
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,960
at what became their first of a series of tours around the US

417
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,880
to talk to different Linux user groups about Clear Linux.

418
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,280
So I don't know.

419
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,080
This is a tricky one, I think.

420
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,580
There's another key word there that you forgot that they kept

421
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,240
mentioning is statelessness.

422
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,400
That was kind of the big umbrella

423
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,640
that they were presenting.

424
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Right, thank you, Brent.

425
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,740
That was one of the big deals about Clear Linux

426
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,200
is the idea that you could just wipe things out

427
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,280
and it would be stateless from a config standpoint.

428
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:58,440
And I think it's gotten a lot more recognition,

429
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,800
but has it gotten people outside of Pharaonix writing about it?

430
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,960
That single thing might have been what screwed me on this.

431
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,240
I mean, there are a few here and there,

432
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,320
but any of the searches I did was clearly

433
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,560
dominated by Pharaonix.

434
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,320
Yeah, and I read a lot of headlines every day,

435
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,720
and I've been keeping an eye out.

436
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
And apart from Pharaonix, there's

437
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,360
been very little coverage of it.

438
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,520
It feels like Michael Laravel is really ahead of the game

439
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,320
on this.

440
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,400
He's been following Clear Linux for what

441
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,840
feels like two or three years at least.

442
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,920
And every time he does any benchmarks, it always wins.

443
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,200
And it does seem to be like a really solid distro,

444
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,520
but for some reason, it just hasn't gained that popularity.

445
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:40,520
I did see it mentioned on OMG Ubuntu this week, actually.

446
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,760
Sweet.

447
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,720
There's one.

448
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,880
There's one.

449
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,160
It was in a list of distributions to look for in 2020

450
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,000
as voted by the readership.

451
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,600
And most of the questions were, why is this in this list?

452
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,440
And he defended it by saying, well,

453
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,600
tons of people mentioned it.

454
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,080
So I think maybe the hype is coming.

455
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,320
Maybe.

456
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,960
That was the same formula I was using, though,

457
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,760
at the end of 2018, because when you learn about it,

458
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,720
there are clear unique advantages.

459
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,160
There's also strange things about it from the outside,

460
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,560
controlled by Intel.

461
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,040
Why do we need another distro?

462
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,040
Why can't I just use X, Y, Z?

463
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,200
Obviously.

464
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,600
That's what's hard to predict, I guess.

465
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,440
There are advantages, but we see that all the time.

466
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,520
That doesn't mean anyone's really going to switch.

467
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,080
And sometimes the advantages just are not enough, perhaps.

468
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,360
But when you learn about it, you learn they are

469
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,480
bringing something unique.

470
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,160
I feel like it should have gotten more attention.

471
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,820
Well, it should have got more attention,

472
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,080
but unfortunately, it didn't.

473
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,920
So this is a fail.

474
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,080
Oh!

475
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
I tried to help you, Chris.

476
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,800
Thank you, Brent.

477
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,360
I appreciate it.

478
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,320
It's still a good trip.

479
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,160
I enjoyed our time.

480
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,960
And we got to stay at the Jupiter Hotel, which I get spammed

481
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,200
from almost on a weekly basis.

482
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,080
At least it's targeted.

483
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,680
Yeah, it is pretty awesome.

484
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,400
And we got a great photo.

485
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,240
All right, well, maybe a Westpane failure

486
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,200
will make me feel better.

487
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,400
This, actually, I thought you were probably

488
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,720
right about this one.

489
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,080
And I really hoped you'd get it wrong.

490
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,640
We just were really still processing

491
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,200
what the IBM acquisition meant for Red Hat.

492
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,240
And you were suspecting it might mean

493
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,720
a fairly important open source project would get dropped.

494
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,240
All right, I predict in 2019, Red Hat

495
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,320
drops support, either just explicitly or key people

496
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,200
leave, for one of these projects.

497
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,520
Network Manager, PipeWire, Stratus, Bolt,

498
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,720
or they just sort of delay any work on GTK4.

499
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,560
It just doesn't ship.

500
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,960
Now, I feel like that last part there is sort of a wild card.

501
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Yeah, true.

502
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,040
Because it definitely did not ship.

503
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,000
But I don't think it's stagnant, right?

504
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,720
Yeah, I don't know if it stopped.

505
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,920
And PipeWire didn't necessarily ship the way we expected.

506
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,800
But they sort of changed course a bit and still are on track

507
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,560
and have a release schedule and seem to be hitting it.

508
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,000
I think the other test here is that none of our coverage

509
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,800
over the year did we ask that question.

510
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,280
We were concerned right after the merger for that, I think.

511
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,080
But I don't remember really being concerned much this year

512
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,960
about it.

513
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,720
I think we need to cut live to our reporter

514
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,400
on the ground in Raleigh.

515
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,440
Alex, is Red Hat still there?

516
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,240
Yes.

517
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,040
Are you there, Alex?

518
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,440
Does Red Hat still exist?

519
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,120
And are the projects still alive?

520
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,240
Well, Chris, I hate to say this, but the winds

521
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,920
are coming in strong and the rain's beating down hard.

522
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,120
But it's looking good over here.

523
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,080
And back to the studio.

524
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,600
I think that's a fail then.

525
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,560
Thank goodness, right?

526
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,440
Yeah, I'm happy on this one.

527
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,680
Yeah, that very much is probably the one

528
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,520
that I'm the most happy about us getting wrong.

529
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,080
You know, the biggest news of this whole IBM Red Hat thing,

530
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,200
and I'm going to be very careful because it obviously

531
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,240
pays my mortgage here, is that nothing's really changed.

532
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,520
They haven't done anything.

533
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,200
The only thing I've seen is more collaboration

534
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,360
between the two companies.

535
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,920
So it's been a net positive so far as I've seen so far.

536
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,240
We might be witnessing, and I'll check back in with me

537
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,080
in about a year, but we might be witnessing

538
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,200
a new era of mergers where not disturbing

539
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,880
the community and the user base and the fans around the product

540
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,400
is priority number one.

541
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,800
And when you merge, you maintain what you've committed,

542
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,120
because keeping your most loyal user base happy

543
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,880
is what keeps value in the product.

544
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,400
And if you start losing customers and users

545
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,680
or listeners or whatever it might be,

546
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,200
you end up devaluing the very thing you just

547
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,600
spent all your money on.

548
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,160
And so I think maybe we are witnessing

549
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,520
a new era of mergers, but probably not.

550
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,400
But it does seem like that's the case, Alex,

551
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,040
from an observer standpoint.

552
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,400
Good, all right.

553
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,600
Are we ready for one of mine?

554
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,120
You ready?

555
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,880
Oh, yeah.

556
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,320
This is the one I have enjoyed all year long.

557
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,640
Hopefully, I didn't mess it up in one of the details,

558
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,560
but I think we've all been watching

559
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,520
this one happen right in front of our very eyes.

560
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,880
2019 will be the year of the web going dark mode,

561
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,720
and a major property like Google.com or the New York

562
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,760
Times will roll out to fanfare a dark mode.

563
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,800
Now, Gmail has gone dark mode.

564
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,640
Several Google products have gone dark mode,

565
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,440
including YouTube now has a dark mode option.

566
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,640
But the big things that I didn't include in there

567
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,360
that I should have, iOS 13, all about dark mode.

568
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,840
Android, all about the dark mode.

569
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,400
Cassidy and his friends at the free desktop

570
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,840
are pushing hard on a dark mode free desktop standard.

571
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,120
In the meantime, every single application, even

572
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,440
electron applications like Slack,

573
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,200
are scrambling to implement dark mode.

574
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,880
Dark mode, dark mode, dark mode.

575
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,520
Web browser extensions have come out

576
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,760
to enable dark mode for websites that don't have dark mode.

577
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,040
Although we had those, we mentioned those last year.

578
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,240
OK, all right.

579
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,600
Very good, I'm sure we did.

580
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,920
It was a thing, for sure.

581
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,480
I think we need the judge on this one,

582
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,520
because you were kind of specific at the end there.

583
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,400
Stupid Chris.

584
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,440
Yeah, I'm just looking at Google.com now,

585
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,760
and it's blinding me with the bright white.

586
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,480
And the New York Times, again, yeah, that's bright white.

587
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,200
Oh, you're not, you are going to rob me of the dark mode.

588
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,000
The way you were specific about it

589
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,080
was that you said it was on the web.

590
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,160
And OK, there are some web properties

591
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,080
that have gone dark, but it's been much more about apps and.

592
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,600
OSs, yeah.

593
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,120
I did say properties like Google,

594
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,600
which I did not specifically mean Google.com.

595
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,560
And I think YouTube and Gmail.

596
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,720
But I did also say something like the New York Times.

597
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,080
I was pretty specific there, but also vague at the same time.

598
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,440
I switched my telegram to dark mode.

599
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,160
Does that count?

600
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,680
Oh, yeah.

601
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,640
Oh, everybody did.

602
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,560
I mean, everybody that doesn't mind dark mode.

603
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,960
There clearly has been people that have come out now

604
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,760
this year that are like anti-dark mode.

605
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,600
More power to them.

606
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,800
Different things work for different people,

607
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,920
so have at it.

608
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,160
But I defer to the judge.

609
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,320
Even though it clearly was the year of dark mode,

610
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
I admit I was too specific.

611
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,960
So it's judge discretion.

612
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,120
I think that because he said properties like,

613
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,200
I'm going to allow it, and it is a reluctant win.

614
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,840
No way.

615
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,160
I did not expect that.

616
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,840
No way.

617
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,160
I was totally braced for a total failure.

618
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,760
All right.

619
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,560
OK, I'll take it.

620
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,320
I'll take it.

621
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,160
You know what's funny is when you see a screenshot

622
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,160
from Telegram, and they're not using dark mode,

623
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,280
and you're thinking, what?

624
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,200
What's wrong with you?

625
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,680
I know.

626
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,160
It really is something looking at screenshots just

627
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,440
from a year ago.

628
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,760
How many things have switched to dark mode?

629
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,800
I was silly, but I was looking at screenshots

630
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,120
at GNOME files this morning.

631
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,560
As one does, reminiscent.

632
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,280
I was going all the way back to when

633
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,160
it was Nautilus built by Easel, and I

634
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,800
was looking at the different iterations

635
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,000
to see when things went away via screenshots.

636
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,760
Oh, yeah.

637
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,600
It was actually pretty interesting.

638
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,240
That's great.

639
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,880
And it's clear that in the last year,

640
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,120
screenshots are all like dark, dark, dark, dark, dark.

641
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,560
Everybody just went dark theme.

642
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,720
It's been pretty intense.

643
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,240
For those that don't like it, it probably

644
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,600
hasn't been a great year.

645
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,440
I feel bad for them.

646
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,040
But thankfully, light themes are right.

647
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,560
And most of the time, you get an option at least.

648
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,640
Also, a lot of different platforms

649
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,560
have introduced a night shift or color change mode

650
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,600
for reducing blue light at night or full-on automatic night

651
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,200
mode switching.

652
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,560
My Vivaldi browser does that.

653
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:26,840
Right.

654
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,480
I mean, clearly, there's recognized

655
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,920
that we're not going to get off of our devices before bed.

656
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,800
So they're going to help a little bit.

657
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,320
All right, Wes.

658
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,520
Are you ready for your last prediction of the year?

659
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,720
Lay it on me.

660
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,360
I really, really hope this one's true.

661
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,600
But I have a bad feeling.

662
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,440
And we still, we've managed.

663
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,720
We've pushed forward.

664
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,760
In 2019, a Linux distribution older than three years

665
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,040
will ship a pre-compiled ZFS Linux kernel module.

666
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,720
Older than three years, you said?

667
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,360
As in, the distro's been around for longer than three years?

668
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,360
Right.

669
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,200
We were trying to not let it have

670
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
to be an established, legitimate distro, not

671
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,760
some tiny new startup.

672
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,000
OK, so?

673
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And obviously, I guess it wasn't captured there.

674
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,720
But having listened to the last year's episode,

675
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,680
I wonder who doesn't care.

676
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:10,920
Why?

677
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,440
Why?

678
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,760
Because that had already happened.

679
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,960
This is like a new distro.

680
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,720
Had it?

681
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,320
Yeah.

682
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:15,800
Really?

683
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,120
Mm-hmm.

684
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,040
It was experimental in 1804?

685
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,600
Is that what?

686
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,040
Well, they just had it in the kernel.

687
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,680
It wasn't being used, necessarily.

688
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,720
But you had access to the pre-compiled driver.

689
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,640
I thought you got this.

690
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,840
Because I was thinking 1910 was really Ubuntu ZFS moment.

691
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,600
But you're right.

692
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,280
They shipped the ability to use ZFS in 1804.

693
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,160
They just didn't bake it into the installer.

694
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,640
So I was really hoping that after them not getting sued

695
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,880
this whole time, some other distribution might step up

696
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,600
and also offer a pre-compiled.

697
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,280
What the hell happened?

698
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,840
Is everybody so chicken-ass that they won't do it?

699
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,760
It seems like what everybody wants.

700
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,920
There does seem to be demand.

701
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,240
And BSD, in the meantime, is going

702
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,960
to roll in and just deploy it everywhere.

703
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,880
Yeah.

704
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,440
It also could be, in part, because it

705
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:02,280
is a legal gray area, A. And B, it's really not that hard.

706
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Yeah.

707
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,920
ZFS on Linux is doing great.

708
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,200
It's easy to get going.

709
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,920
Basically, any distribution, you can get

710
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,400
it going within 15 minutes.

711
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,080
Remind me how long it takes to reboot

712
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,560
that Arch server of yours?

713
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,920
Next episode, we're going to do a live update in the episode

714
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,440
just to see.

715
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,680
So you'll find out.

716
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,040
How long does it take?

717
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,360
Well, the problem is those cards.

718
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

719
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,800
The HBA cards take a long time to initialize, don't they?

720
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,280
Yeah.

721
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,560
So just, I'll tell you the answer,

722
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,400
just enough to make you extremely anxious.

723
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,120
That's how long it takes.

724
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,760
That's a good answer.

725
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,160
So, Judge, what do you say?

726
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,480
Did Mr. Payne get this one, or is it a miss?

727
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,800
I'm afraid it's a miss.

728
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,280
So that's only one win each?

729
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,040
It's not good odds.

730
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,080
No shutout, though.

731
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,760
That's true.

732
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,320
I actually was braced for a full fail.

733
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,720
Yeah, and you would have got half a point for clear Linux

734
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,880
if we were counting.

735
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,720
OK, that's all right.

736
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,960
Yeah, half a point.

737
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,600
Yeah, all right.

738
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,720
So I thought what we could also do here

739
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,000
is, since we're doing this as sort of an offline holiday

740
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,400
special, sipping on our hot toddies,

741
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,940
we don't have the Mumble Room with us.

742
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,200
We miss them, big part of the show.

743
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
It's just not the same.

744
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,040
So we collected a few predictions

745
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,600
that were kind of a sum of a couple of other,

746
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,040
like a few along the same lines.

747
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,520
You know what I'm saying?

748
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,360
Like people that predicted essentially the same thing.

749
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,760
But you did hire three people from the Mumble Room

750
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,600
this year.

751
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,720
Ha, ha, ha, that's true.

752
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,560
Yeah, that's what we're doing.

753
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,480
We're just slowly hiring the Mumble Room.

754
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,200
That way we're here all the time.

755
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,240
It pays to be in the virtual lug.

756
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,320
All right, so speaking of that virtual lug,

757
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,240
Popey made a prediction about MacBooks

758
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,680
that I heard echoed by a few other community members.

759
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,320
Let's give this one a spin.

760
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,240
In 2019, Apple will announce and launch

761
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,680
a line of laptops called MacBook Air, which

762
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,120
will feature ARM-based processors and no x86 processors.

763
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,640
Wow.

764
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,280
Well, as our resident Apple guru there, Chris, did that happen?

765
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,600
Hold on, let me check my backpack of MacBooks here,

766
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,080
Wes.

767
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:07,560
Let's see, x86, x86, x86, x86, x86, x86, x86.

768
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,960
I got a lot.

769
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,440
Yeah, they're all x86 there, Wes.

770
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,720
It's a very specific prediction, though,

771
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,560
because the MacBook Air is an existing product line.

772
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,920
I think they'd probably, if they're going to switch to ARM,

773
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,840
come up with some new product line.

774
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,040
Yeah, I think what was going on here

775
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,880
was the iPad Pro had just been announced.

776
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,920
And everybody was like, whoa, they really

777
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,640
put a lot of performance into a tablet.

778
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,560
That actually could go into a laptop.

779
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,160
So then the foregone conclusion was

780
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,800
if they were going to move an existing product line to ARM,

781
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,200
they'd probably start at the most portable battery

782
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,640
conscious line, which would be the Air.

783
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,080
And so I think Popeye's line of thinking was just

784
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,860
a whole new generation of Air MacBooks would land,

785
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,480
and they'd feature their in-house ARM processors.

786
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
A lot of people were thinking that at the time.

787
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,400
At the end of 2020, what they've ended up doing

788
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,720
is shipping a massive x86 monster called the Mac Pro.

789
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,400
Ironically, it's the exact opposite.

790
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,680
Apple have had a really killer last quarter

791
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,560
to their Pro customers, haven't they?

792
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,320
With the 16-inch MacBook Pro, the Mac Pro.

793
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,400
Yeah, they seem like they're doing a much better

794
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,000
job with the hardware than they were this time a year ago.

795
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,240
It's still very locked down, still extremely expensive,

796
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,080
and I think Mac OS is limiting.

797
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,040
But as far as responding to what Pro users want

798
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,720
from a hardware platform, I think

799
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,680
they're doing a lot better.

800
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,880
Yeah, Pro users definitely want to spend $400

801
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
for a set of whales.

802
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,240
Yeah, no doubt.

803
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,560
And don't forget $1,000 on a monitor stand.

804
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,200
Yeah.

805
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,960
I think it was right, though, for them

806
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,360
to announce a new Mac Pro just because there

807
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,800
was such a demand for it after the trash can failure

808
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,120
that they had.

809
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,700
They had to reinvent themselves and provide something

810
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,680
that Pro-level users would want to use.

811
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:55,120
But yeah, at $1,000 stand for a display and $400 wheels,

812
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,320
I could literally buy four tires for my small pickup

813
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,120
truck for the price of the wheels of the MacBook Pro

814
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,140
or the Mac Pro.

815
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,760
No kidding.

816
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,600
I went out Christmas shopping, and I

817
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,080
was looking at artisan furniture just

818
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,520
because there's this great store in a local town

819
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
where this guy, his whole life is making

820
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,520
this beautiful wood furniture.

821
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,000
And so we just go in there to gawk at it

822
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,440
because it's so gorgeous.

823
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,920
Handcrafted furniture for less money

824
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,000
than one of these Mac Pros.

825
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,360
I'm going to need the address of that after the show.

826
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,200
Now, let me tell you something.

827
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
We make fun of it, but I actually

828
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,760
think it's a pretty decent value when

829
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,560
you get towards the higher end of the configuration,

830
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,840
excluding the monitor, excluding the wheels, obviously.

831
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,600
But a couple of things Apple has done here

832
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,320
is they've shipped a machine with a metric ton

833
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,940
of open RAM slots.

834
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,360
You can actually put third party GPUs.

835
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,780
They even included the power headers

836
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,040
so you can properly power them.

837
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,120
I mean, they've really made something

838
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,560
that is a decent product.

839
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,800
It's built well.

840
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,320
It's specced well.

841
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,480
It's extremely expensive.

842
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:57,960
But let's say.

843
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,080
If you're in the market for a computer that

844
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,080
costs as much as a car and is that powerful, you're right.

845
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,280
I mean, it delivers on that.

846
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,080
iFixit rated it as their most repairable computer in years.

847
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,840
Yeah, and it's silent.

848
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,280
Even under massive load, it's silent.

849
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,840
Have you been watching all the YouTubers that got sent them,

850
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,620
like Justine and Linus Tech Tips just bought one, apparently.

851
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,920
But also, Jonathan Morrison, he has

852
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,120
been doing a lot of tests with the afterburner stuff.

853
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,720
He's done a bunch of really cool videos

854
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,080
around audio editing, which I know you've watched.

855
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,720
I haven't seen anyone try and install Linux on it yet, though.

856
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,400
So this is where I was going to go with this.

857
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,160
That's why we're talking about this.

858
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,800
Let's just accept a couple of premises.

859
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,080
Number one, let's just say whatever employer you have,

860
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,920
whatever work, quote unquote, is paying for this machine.

861
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,240
So it's not coming out of your personal pocket.

862
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,040
And work, quote unquote, comes to you and says,

863
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,760
all right, Westpain, you can have a Thalia workstation

864
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,560
or a Mac Pro workstation.

865
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,520
And also, as part of this conversation,

866
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:05,640
let's just say Linux is running on the Mac Pro at this point.

867
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
Which would you choose?

868
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,320
That would be a tough call.

869
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,160
I mean, I'd have to go spend some time sort of playing

870
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,000
with the configurations.

871
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,700
But you're right.

872
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,280
I mean, if it ran Linux well, I don't

873
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,040
see why I wouldn't have the Mac Pro as a contender.

874
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,680
Yeah, I think that's it.

875
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,520
What about you, Alex?

876
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,440
Red Hat comes to you and they say,

877
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,840
we're going to buy you a workstation.

878
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,720
You can have this configuration of Thalia.

879
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,680
You can have this configuration of Mac Pro.

880
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
They're both pretty nice.

881
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,400
They're both going to run Linux equally well,

882
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,740
which obviously is not the case.

883
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,920
But just for the sake of this conversation.

884
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,560
I don't know.

885
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,060
I mean.

886
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,900
Can it dual boot?

887
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,080
That's your question.

888
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,040
Well, see, I try to look at things

889
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,760
from a pragmatic standpoint.

890
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,800
Can it run the Adobe Suite for all my personal photography,

891
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
drone footage editing needs?

892
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,280
Can it do pass-through of a graphics card

893
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,920
and that kind of stuff?

894
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:58,280
I settle on a nice system at the moment that can do pass-through.

895
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,360
A Linux system that can do pass-through, I don't know.

896
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,680
Mac OS is kind of close, but there's

897
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,440
no one operating system that fulfills

898
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,000
every single one of my use cases.

899
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,120
So I've just accepted long ago that I have to triple boot.

900
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,480
What about you, Brent?

901
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,720
If quote unquote, which is kind of funny situation for you,

902
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,840
work came to you.

903
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,560
That's me.

904
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,280
I know that's why it's funny.

905
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,400
But for the sake of argument, somebody came to you

906
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,680
and said, we're going to get you a computer.

907
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,780
I think that choice actually is really easy for me.

908
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,680
I would choose Thalio 100 times out of 100.

909
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,240
Really?

910
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Yeah.

911
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,040
And the reason is that I'm totally

912
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,520
OK to have slight performance hits or whatever

913
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,760
if it means that I'm supporting a project or a business that

914
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,560
is based on Linux.

915
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,600
The stuff System76 is doing for Linux and the open source

916
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,920
community is massive compared to what

917
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,800
Apple has done recently, right?

918
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,800
So I feel like those would be dollars that I would

919
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,920
be happy to put their way.

920
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,000
They're different.

921
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,880
WebKit, Swift.

922
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,120
I would say the scale, right?

923
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,960
The proportion is better for System76.

924
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,080
The area we're interested in too.

925
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,320
All right, Joe, what about you?

926
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,360
Audio production might be really nice on a Mac Pro.

927
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,620
I think I would go for the Mac Pro just to check it out,

928
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,040
just because I'm genuinely curious.

929
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,680
I've seen a Thalio in the flesh, but I

930
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,720
haven't seen the Mac Pro.

931
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,640
So just out of curiosity, I'd go for that.

932
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,320
Fair enough.

933
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,280
Yeah, I think that would be an interesting experience,

934
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,120
especially all the things you'd have to buy,

935
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,640
different cables and whatnot.

936
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,020
All right, Cheezy, you and me are the last here,

937
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,640
because I feel like you and I have a similar conflict.

938
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,280
Every now and then, it's nice to get After Effects or Photoshop

939
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,640
for some work.

940
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,320
You can get 95% of the work done on the Linux platform,

941
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,320
but every now and then, there's somebody on the wider team

942
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,000
that needs support, and that's an After Effects file.

943
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,320
So what would you pick?

944
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,160
And here's what's even harder for you,

945
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,800
is you've been to System76.

946
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,680
You've got a Thalio.

947
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,880
You know how great it is.

948
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,400
But somebody comes to you, and they say,

949
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,520
you're going to have to tell Emma that you got the Mac Pro.

950
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,200
Yeah, and Emma finds out, whatever your choice is,

951
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,000
she finds out.

952
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,080
What would you choose?

953
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,320
You know, that's a really tough one.

954
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,960
The reality, though, is as much as we talk about the repairability

955
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,360
and the expandability of the new Mac Pro, which is,

956
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,840
like Alex stated, probably the best when

957
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,800
it comes to adding additional drives,

958
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,160
adding additional graphics, card power, and things like that,

959
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,080
the one thing that it doesn't have going for it

960
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,840
that the Thalio does, in my opinion,

961
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,360
is the Thalio is actually fully open.

962
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,560
So all of the CAD files are there.

963
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,640
If you wanted to make your own and you owned a laser cutter,

964
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,200
you could.

965
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,520
So as far as repairability, expandability,

966
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,200
you're not going to get that from Apple.

967
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,520
Ain't got nothing on the Thalio.

968
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,480
Absolutely not.

969
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:49,400
And not that I would necessarily want to with my Thalio,

970
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,840
but if I did need access to the Adobe Suite,

971
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,920
I could always dual boot the Thalio,

972
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,640
though I feel that would just taint the Thalio

973
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,000
and make it a little dirty.

974
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,460
Your buddy Alex would probably help

975
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,960
you set up some pass-through VM action if you ever needed it.

976
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,760
Absolutely.

977
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,040
But you know, that being said, I'm fine working on a MacBook.

978
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,520
I don't produce 8K movies.

979
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,680
So I don't need this ridiculous display.

980
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,640
I don't need the power that one might

981
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,840
need for rendering out video like that

982
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,520
or doing anything like that.

983
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,280
So to me, the MacBook still works fine for my needs.

984
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,840
Maybe in the future, if they drive down

985
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,080
the price from the maxed out Mac Pro, which I think

986
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,800
was like $56,000, $57,000, I might consider it.

987
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,080
But for me, and along the same lines with Brent,

988
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,600
I'm happy to support System76.

989
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,060
They do good work, and all the work they do,

990
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,880
they throw it out there for everyone to grab onto

991
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,120
and improve and make it better.

992
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:00,280
So I think going forward, we'll see new Thalios, better Thalios,

993
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,840
and I'm anxious to see what the community ends up

994
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,100
coming up with too.

995
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,200
I kind of see it a similar way.

996
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,440
The power of that Mac Pro is clearly

997
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,440
for people that are in the industry of creating

998
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,680
very high resolution video, not an area I'm into.

999
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,160
Even if I was making 1080p videos for YouTube,

1000
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,280
it'd be too much.

1001
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,520
It would be way too much.

1002
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,880
And I've got a really nice system upstairs

1003
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,280
that I barely even take full advantage of today.

1004
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,720
I'm just not there.

1005
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,400
And I noticed now in comparison, the Thalio

1006
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,280
looks like a fantastic deal.

1007
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,480
I spec'd out a Thalio last night.

1008
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,040
Not that I've been comparing them,

1009
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,100
but I spec'd out one last night, and it was like $4,300.

1010
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,280
And it was like multiple drives, nice GPU,

1011
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,520
upgraded CPU, and that's cheap.

1012
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,480
That's cheaper than the starting price of the cheapest Mac Pro.

1013
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,000
But the reason why I wanted to have this conversation

1014
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,560
is as they continue to improve their hardware,

1015
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,960
I think more people will be asking themselves

1016
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,500
that question as they get around to buying their next computer.

1017
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,560
If Apple is able to maintain decent hardware,

1018
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,840
even if it's a few select models in the line,

1019
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,720
the rest are all kind of sleepers, stinkers, I guess.

1020
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,200
If Apple is able to maintain this Pro line, the iMac Pro,

1021
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,080
the MacBook Pro 16-inch, maybe a Mac Mini Pro,

1022
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,360
I think it will cause more consternation in the community

1023
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,040
trying to decide.

1024
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,920
Because right now, you kind of just

1025
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,460
were tapped out with their hardware.

1026
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,520
If you wanted a Mac that could run Mac OS

1027
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,880
and it was an official Apple box, it wasn't a Hackintosh,

1028
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,600
you just didn't have a lot of options in terms of anything

1029
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
that was all that good.

1030
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,660
Easy answer now.

1031
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,000
You have the FIO.

1032
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,200
You buy the Dune Pro case off of IndieGoGo,

1033
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,820
the clone case that the Verge covered.

1034
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,520
And then just whack a couple of Xeons in there

1035
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,400
and you're good to go.

1036
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:45,900
Boom.

1037
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,000
I like it.

1038
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,860
OK.

1039
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,680
How about we get to another kind of common prediction

1040
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,560
from the community that Drifter put into terms.

1041
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,680
Everybody thought something would happen with SUSE.

1042
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,480
I think that in 2019, SUSE and TPG in specific

1043
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,240
will be in discussion with Microsoft

1044
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,720
in the purchase of SUSE.

1045
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,960
Microsoft purchasing SUSE.

1046
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,260
Now, SUSE may have gotten passed around again.

1047
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,460
I can't keep track anymore.

1048
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,460
I don't think anyone can.

1049
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,400
No, but I know it didn't get bought by Microsoft.

1050
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,560
What do you say, Judge?

1051
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,120
No, I'm afraid this is a fail.

1052
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,480
The Microsoft buys X, though, is like in the back

1053
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,560
of everyone's mind.

1054
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,640
It came up a lot last year.

1055
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,360
I mean, they're doing a lot with Linux.

1056
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,680
Might be handy to have a provider of it.

1057
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,240
Kind of along that same line, another one

1058
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,640
that was on people's minds a lot was something happening

1059
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,360
with Canonical, either a purchase or,

1060
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,440
bit and thought, perhaps, an IPO.

1061
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,520
So my prediction for 2019 is that Canonical will get IPO'd.

1062
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,360
Never happened.

1063
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,040
It did not.

1064
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,680
Canonical did kind of reform into a meaner, leaner beast

1065
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:04,960
and evolved that over 2019, but no IPO, no purchase.

1066
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,520
This might be our worst batting average ever.

1067
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,960
Is it because I made you all be so specific last time?

1068
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,280
Well, that doesn't help.

1069
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,800
You know, I mean, maybe it just means we got up our game

1070
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,480
a little bit.

1071
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,480
But Chris talked himself out of the dark mode one.

1072
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,800
You didn't make him do that.

1073
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,280
I feel like I did over-specify with that one.

1074
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,920
I really did.

1075
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,200
There's a couple.

1076
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,960
It's a trick to getting the level right there.

1077
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,640
Got to get the balance right.

1078
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,960
It really shows you how hard it is to nail down this community.

1079
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,920
I predict on the third Tuesday of April

1080
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,680
that Canonical will be acquired.

1081
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,920
Yeah, right.

1082
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,440
Very good.

1083
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,840
Well, you got to save that for next episode.

1084
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,360
Oh, yeah.

1085
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,640
We'll do our.

1086
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,120
Do you think that Seuss wasn't acquired

1087
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,520
because they were kind of passed around this last year?

1088
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,360
They weren't acquired by someone like Dell

1089
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,600
or some larger company similar?

1090
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:57,440
Because they're just not maybe as stable as Red Hat or Canonical?

1091
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,040
They just don't have a container play, I think.

1092
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,720
They're not sexy at the moment.

1093
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,640
Yeah, they've tried.

1094
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,000
They've definitely tried to make noise about their Kubernetes

1095
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,240
distribution.

1096
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,920
They've given it a real go, but it's not gaining any traction.

1097
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,280
It seems like it's a steady approach.

1098
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,320
The users that have a need to run Seuss are sticking around

1099
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,680
with it, but I don't really see them growing.

1100
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,800
You don't really see very many cloud providers that make it.

1101
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,160
There's more now.

1102
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,120
There are, yeah.

1103
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,920
There are more, but not many.

1104
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,600
And when they do offer it, it's usually

1105
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,920
not exactly the version of Seuss that you want.

1106
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,720
It's kind of a funny, like I've noticed it's

1107
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,520
a kind of mix of implementations.

1108
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,160
And I think that hasn't helped.

1109
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,200
It seems like it would turn off larger companies like Dell

1110
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,480
if this one company that they're potentially looking at acquiring

1111
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,680
has been bought and sold and invested in

1112
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,160
and different things have gone on throughout the year

1113
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,400
that they might take a step back from that

1114
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,560
and pause from making an acquisition like that

1115
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,880
just because, if it's been bought and sold

1116
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,320
and passed around, then something isn't working, right?

1117
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,880
Well, and isn't the reality, unfortunately, a little bit

1118
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,280
that the world really does kind of settle into Coke and Pepsi?

1119
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,840
iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Red Hat, Ubuntu.

1120
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,640
It's just easier, and it seems to naturally

1121
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
gravitate to those two.

1122
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,880
And then when you have markets that are outside the US

1123
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,400
and other areas, it can vary, obviously, a bit,

1124
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,360
but those areas aren't large enough

1125
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,780
where it really makes a big impact

1126
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,140
on the overall global conversation.

1127
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,480
Maybe we'll see something change in 2020,

1128
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,080
but that was devastating, guys.

1129
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,720
Let's pick it up.

1130
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,760
Let's do a bonus round of picks to make us feel better here

1131
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,720
because these are fun.

1132
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:53,400
Two really, really fun picks to impress the neighbors,

1133
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,520
your friends at work, and I don't know, maybe your spouse,

1134
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,600
with your Linux terminal, two really great picks.

1135
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,480
You found No More Secrets, Mr. Bacon.

1136
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,600
Tell me about this.

1137
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,880
You know, I'm a huge fan of these older hacker movies

1138
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,240
and even Mr. Robot that's out there today.

1139
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,560
But in 92, the Sneakers movie was released,

1140
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,140
which some of you may remember.

1141
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,600
Some of the young listeners out there

1142
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,880
may have no idea what I'm talking about.

1143
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,160
So No More Secrets, or NMS, is a command line tool

1144
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,720
that recreates the famous decryption effect that was

1145
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,760
used in the movie Sneakers.

1146
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,480
So if you just want to impress your fam,

1147
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,040
yeah, you could definitely throw this on and pipe NMS out

1148
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,800
to basically anything, an LS or anything else,

1149
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,120
and really look like a legitimate hacker,

1150
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,960
impress the fam.

1151
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,040
So do that.

1152
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,840
Check it out.

1153
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,960
Jeez, for those of us who may not

1154
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,080
know what you're talking about, could you give us

1155
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,440
a description of what's going on?

1156
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,240
What, you don't know, Brent?

1157
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,160
Brent, have you seen The Matrix?

1158
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,280
Alex and I watched it this month, actually.

1159
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,480
Yes, we did, Brent.

1160
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,600
And it was glorious.

1161
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,640
You two are so freaking cute.

1162
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,960
We watched it together.

1163
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,880
Have you seen the screensaver for Linux

1164
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,060
that is the Matrix-inspired screensaver?

1165
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,000
Yeah, that was real hot, like 10 years ago, right?

1166
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,560
Well, that's kind of where this is from.

1167
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,220
This is from the 90s, yeah.

1168
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:25,120
Imagine all of the text on the screen slowly decoding.

1169
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,960
It starts out as a total jumble of characters

1170
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,000
and weird symbols.

1171
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,040
And then over time, it all kind of

1172
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,600
renders into text on your screen.

1173
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,240
It's like a super cool, nerdy, as

1174
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,840
if this is how decoding worked, when really it's just happening

1175
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,280
in the background and then outputs.

1176
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,600
But in Hollywood, it happens in real time,

1177
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,480
and it all kind of comes in on the screen.

1178
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,360
That's what this does.

1179
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,560
I just fired it up right now.

1180
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,200
My CPUs jumped to 75%.

1181
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,880
Well, it's a lot of work to decrypt it.

1182
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,480
It is actually encrypting a little bit.

1183
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,960
There's actual encrypting happening.

1184
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,960
It's just doing it in a quick little buffer.

1185
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,320
Please tell me someone's tried to pipe in this into the old

1186
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,280
cat.

1187
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,920
I tried to run HTOP through it.

1188
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,360
Yeah, how did HTOP look?

1189
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,240
It just sat there.

1190
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,040
I think the interactive application's weirded out.

1191
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,040
It has to be something that's giving standard output.

1192
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,760
So you could make it work, but it was really cool.

1193
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,200
Now, there's another command line application

1194
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,240
along these lines.

1195
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,440
It's a little more effort to get going,

1196
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,600
although it's probably in the AR.

1197
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,300
And it's called Hollywood.

1198
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,080
This is made by Dustin Kirkland, formerly of Canonical.

1199
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,460
He made this back when he was at Canonical.

1200
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,600
And it actually has starred in television programs

1201
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,720
like NCIS and others.

1202
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,160
And there's a snap of it, too, a Hollywood snap.

1203
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:36,920
I don't know if it works anymore.

1204
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,560
It appears to be in the Ubuntu repos as well.

1205
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,760
Yeah, oh, really?

1206
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,020
Oh, that's so great.

1207
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:45,960
And this just sets up a totally fake,

1208
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,840
like you would see on television, terminal screen

1209
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,520
that makes it look like your computer is

1210
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,440
doing all kinds of cool stuff.

1211
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,720
So cool, in fact, that, like I mentioned, it ended up on TV.

1212
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,480
Because it does what it says.

1213
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,080
It's that good.

1214
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,040
Have you installed it?

1215
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,000
You should totally install it, Wes.

1216
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,600
I kind of want to install it, too,

1217
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,360
and just have it up on the screen so then when our,

1218
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,600
you know, like, uh.

1219
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,000
If anyone stops by the studio.

1220
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,560
Yeah, when any of our visitors stop by,

1221
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,480
we'll have this up on all of our studio screens.

1222
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,800
They'll be like, wow, that's a high-tech studio.

1223
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,920
So it's called Hollywood.

1224
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,760
Oh, yep, here we go.

1225
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,840
Got it going.

1226
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,360
Look at that.

1227
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,440
That is legitimately frickin' awesome.

1228
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,680
Look at how busy I am.

1229
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,640
You are doing so much stuff right now.

1230
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,360
You're a real multitasker, Wes Payne.

1231
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,240
So we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

1232
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:34,320
Linuxunplugged.com slash lucky334.

1233
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,480
Those are, you know, that's what Linux is for right there.

1234
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,600
Right there.

1235
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,080
Not all this other stuff.

1236
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:45,280
You know, I love that we still really love having fun.

1237
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,320
That's the spirit of Linux that I really appreciate.

1238
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,400
It's like we can get all this work done, obviously,

1239
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,040
and do some impressive stuff.

1240
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,080
But there's always a little hint of some fun in there.

1241
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,120
So I love it.

1242
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,640
It's kind of one of the first things you find, right,

1243
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,280
when you come to Linux, like, oh, look at all this weird

1244
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,120
stuff and all these repos I can find.

1245
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:00,960
It never stops.

1246
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,680
Can I give you a tip to zhuzh it up a little bit?

1247
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,800
Run those, those two picks, under cool retro term.

1248
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,640
Oh, yeah.

1249
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,760
Cool retro term and those picks together,

1250
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,560
full screen, you're welcome.

1251
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,760
That's all I have to say on that.

1252
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,520
And gentlemen, with that, it brings us

1253
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,240
to the end of this special holiday edition

1254
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,000
where we all walk away as sore losers.

1255
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,280
I guess we both got one right, Wes.

1256
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,920
We better practice our skills before we

1257
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,640
have to make the next set of predictions.

1258
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,920
Well, OK, better get practicing because that's

1259
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,480
coming up next, Wes.

1260
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,160
Thank you, everyone, so much for tuning in.

1261
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,480
Hope you had a great 2019.

1262
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,600
This show will continue on.

1263
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,120
We're not live, but there's still new episodes

1264
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,440
in the feeds at linuxunplug.com slash subscribe.

1265
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,640
Thanks so much for joining us.

1266
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,600
Check Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

1267
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,960
for when we are back.

1268
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,760
Why don't you make it a 2020 goal to join us?

1269
00:46:52,760 --> 00:47:20,040
We'll see you in the future.

1270
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:33,520
Well, that stings a little bit.

1271
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,880
That's a humbling experience.

1272
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,880
You know what I really hope, man?

1273
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,640
I really hope that somebody takes this NMS and this Hollywood

1274
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,400
script and is working in IT and they run it

1275
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,760
and across the room, one of their co-workers notices

1276
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,320
and is like, what in the hell are they doing?

1277
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,880
Man, if I were in IT, I'd put this up on a virtual desktop,

1278
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,720
and whenever the old Bosque use one, I'd swap it.

1279
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,440
Do you remember an MSN messenger back in the day?

1280
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,320
Control space to hide all your windows.

1281
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,400
Boss mode's still a thing in a few apps, yeah.

1282
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,560
It still exists out there.

1283
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,000
I mean, how many different ways can you browse Reddit?

1284
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:25,320
Boss mode or parent mode, take your pick.
