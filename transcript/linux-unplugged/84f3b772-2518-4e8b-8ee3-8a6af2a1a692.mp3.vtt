WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.720
What was that really easy clustering that was originally just on live CD? What was that called? There was a super dead simple

00:08.440 --> 00:14.680
Clustering software for Linux for a while. There was only like in the two kernel two dot something kernel maybe and

00:17.240 --> 00:19.240
You know you booted off a Debian live CD

00:19.240 --> 00:24.120
you have a master controller and then you'd boot up all the other ones and say that they we should look for the master and

00:24.200 --> 00:29.080
Then you could you could distribute tasks between all of them like the like they had a floating

00:29.080 --> 00:31.080
Process table, I can't remember

00:31.760 --> 00:37.840
Wonder what it was called. It was the coolest way to do clustered stuff, and it was so straight called heartbeat. No

00:40.160 --> 00:44.080
It's not around anymore, so it's gonna be hard to find because it relied on stuff

00:44.080 --> 00:46.880
That was like I think sunset a long time ago in the kernel

00:48.880 --> 00:52.760
So it's probably gonna it's probably impossible to find it now. It's I'm so old

00:52.760 --> 00:58.780
That's that's the problem well the reason I said yes at heartbeats because that articles from 2002

01:00.360 --> 01:03.440
That's almost old enough. It's not a bailiff cluster

01:06.920 --> 01:12.720
Nice tech man yeah, that would play rust that would play rust tech man that would definitely play was it mozziex

01:13.660 --> 01:15.660
Was it open mozziex was that it I?

01:16.480 --> 01:18.520
Think I just I think I just found it

01:18.520 --> 01:26.400
Open mozziex. Yeah, and cluster not picks. That's the live CD thing I was talking about so this was originally for from mozziex in

01:26.800 --> 01:33.060
2002 open mozziex was stable on Linux kernel 2.4.x for the x86 architecture

01:33.080 --> 01:38.520
But porting it to the 2.6 kernel remained in the alpha stage and support for 64-bit

01:39.040 --> 01:41.400
architecture only stayed in the 2.6 version on

01:42.160 --> 01:47.240
July 15 2007 it was announced the open mozziex project would each it would reach end of life

01:47.240 --> 01:52.880
Due to decreasing need for SSI clustering and low-cost multi-core processors becoming more available

01:53.200 --> 01:58.480
but so this was particularly useful for running parallel applications, so this is another great way to build or

01:59.480 --> 02:03.080
It would actually worked really well is if I had centralized storage I

02:04.080 --> 02:07.600
had a couple of users that would just slam a samba server and

02:08.000 --> 02:12.340
I could actually move that process around to a system that wasn't as busy. It was really cool

02:12.340 --> 02:18.620
And you could just when you needed a system. You would just add it to the cluster by booting off of clustering optics

02:18.620 --> 02:22.380
It would detect the cluster, and it would just get added as resources and when you were done

02:22.380 --> 02:25.900
You would reboot it so at night. I could go reboot a whole bunch of systems into this

02:26.820 --> 02:33.260
Gosh, this is so cool. Oh, man. It was clustering optics. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Well. It is a gen 2 derivative. I

02:34.020 --> 02:35.460
I

02:35.460 --> 02:37.460
Really had fun with that stuff

02:37.460 --> 02:41.980
It'd be really cool to set that up again sometime. Yeah, that does sound fun kernel 2.6

02:43.500 --> 02:47.940
No and 2.4 my time 2.4 if you want the good stuff

02:48.820 --> 02:53.320
That's what an optics in that. This is what the KDE desktop look like back in the day look at that

02:54.420 --> 02:59.420
That KDE one or two. I don't know I don't remember, but I do remember that digital clock

02:59.420 --> 03:02.200
I had all of my KD desktop set to use that digital clock

03:02.200 --> 03:06.360
You know this clock did you the one thing I'll say about this version of KD is this panel was rock-solid

03:06.360 --> 03:10.480
I have my panel crash on plasma sometimes now and this panel never crashed like that

03:12.840 --> 03:15.320
It's probably all just one process or something but

03:16.840 --> 03:22.080
Boy that was a totally different time. Yeah, right. That's funny to think about last version was September 1st 2004

03:22.080 --> 03:26.320
It is possible that you might be able to do it on modern kernels because apparently

03:26.320 --> 03:40.320
OpenMozics was forked in their Linux PMI and is currently developed. Hmm OpenMozics auto-discovery new nodes automatically join the cluster cluster management tools OpenMozics user land and OpenMozics every node has root access to every other node via SSH

03:41.560 --> 03:43.960
Yeah, that was the other thing I loved about is they just talked SSH

03:45.280 --> 03:51.040
MFS DFS a to support every node can have a full-blown X or console only for more memory

03:51.760 --> 03:53.760
So what is would you say is still in development?

03:53.760 --> 03:59.480
Linux PMI, I think but Linux PMI, huh? Sounds like something else the website might

04:00.400 --> 04:05.840
Yeah, Katie, too. Yeah, I think so a project with a lot of potential 2009. Yeah

04:06.840 --> 04:08.840
a lot of potential

04:08.960 --> 04:13.400
This is Linux unplugged episode 200 and 22 for November 7th

04:13.400 --> 04:26.400
2017

04:26.400 --> 04:33.320
Oh, welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that survived Chris's new rust obsession, and I'm that Chris. Hello

04:33.320 --> 04:36.520
My name is Wes, you know, you know beard

04:36.520 --> 04:41.320
I kind of blame you because you kind of got me into rust so the beards here too, but you know

04:41.320 --> 04:45.400
I'm not here next week. You can blame him. Oh, I gotta fill in for me. Okay, I'll be here. Anyway

04:46.400 --> 04:50.880
All right. Yeah, I think he's playing rust over there right now in the corner despite that

04:50.880 --> 04:53.640
We still managed to put together a pretty good show this week

04:53.640 --> 04:58.680
It's it's gonna be packed with a lot of community news and a story too

04:58.680 --> 05:03.160
We got a little anecdote that we that I think resulted in a pretty good app pick this week

05:03.560 --> 05:08.480
Desktop environment. We don't often talk about very much and then Starcraft 2 for Linux

05:08.480 --> 05:10.760
well

05:10.760 --> 05:12.760
Well, we'll explain what's going on there

05:13.320 --> 05:15.880
Dan's here from elementary OS tells what's going on with granite

05:15.880 --> 05:20.680
Which I think is one of the coolest things about elementary OS and maybe you'll find out why and then

05:21.080 --> 05:28.120
There's a spat herd around the community right now, and there's a lot of crazy speculation. Everybody's got conspiracy theories

05:29.640 --> 05:31.640
I'm gonna give you a breakdown of

05:32.280 --> 05:36.280
What's going on between the software Freedom Law Center and the software Freedom Law Center?

05:36.280 --> 05:40.440
And the software Freedom Conservancy a hype free conspiracy free

05:41.480 --> 05:46.640
Concise breakdown of what's going on and the projects will be impacted by this dispute

05:46.640 --> 05:51.440
Why we actually care the actual open source projects the code that you and I all use on our day-to-day

05:52.400 --> 05:59.120
Adventures what's actually getting screwed over by all this shenanigans. We'll get into that and then to make everybody feel better

06:00.000 --> 06:05.720
We're gonna wrap it up with one badass-looking command-line utility that helps you straighten out

06:05.720 --> 06:12.760
You stress the heck out of your Linux box and then visualizes the whole thing for you on the terminal so whoa yeah

06:12.760 --> 06:13.720
I really like this tool

06:13.720 --> 06:16.440
So we'll talk about that to kind of pick up the mood before we get out of here

06:16.440 --> 06:24.380
But you know if if there was ever morale officers to be had it's those in our virtual lug time appropriate greetings mumble room

06:25.000 --> 06:26.200
Hello

06:26.200 --> 06:31.660
We will do our best to be guiding you through those morals. Oh, thanks morale's not morals

06:31.660 --> 06:33.540
I

06:33.540 --> 06:39.340
Thought you said more we'll take both actually no morals. You know what that's true. That's very true. I'll take that

06:39.340 --> 06:41.880
I'll take it you guys can help us with both. That's probably very useful

06:42.100 --> 06:44.540
So let's get into some interesting news

06:44.540 --> 06:51.580
Just to sort of loosen us up a little bit because there could be ups and downs in this episode dramatic moments things that no one

06:51.580 --> 06:53.580
saw coming

06:54.100 --> 06:57.060
But in the meantime let's talk about Gladys a

06:57.060 --> 07:01.140
Raspberry Pi powered intelligent open-source home

07:01.940 --> 07:03.940
assistant

07:05.980 --> 07:08.500
Yeah, okay, so Gladys is new

07:08.500 --> 07:12.300
It's designed from the ground up to act as a central hub that interacts with a variety of smart

07:12.700 --> 07:18.940
IOT that's Internet of Things devices. I know I'm sorry smart speakers other devices light bulbs

07:18.940 --> 07:23.100
But it has a couple other tricks that a lot of your average assistants don't

07:23.100 --> 07:27.620
and Gladys or Gladys can communicate with low-cost

07:28.740 --> 07:34.220
433 megahertz door magnetic contacts and wireless motion sensors through RF

07:34.780 --> 07:36.220
430

07:36.220 --> 07:41.220
433 megahertz transmitters which and receivers which I was just thinking I believe that's the stuff that Noah really likes to oh

07:41.580 --> 07:43.580
That's the stuff. He likes to install

07:43.700 --> 07:50.420
and of course as all the other kind of fancy things and they have a they have a demo video where someone has a Bluetooth a

07:50.420 --> 07:54.500
Bluetooth low-energy switch and they're able to activate a light and music scene by

07:54.740 --> 08:00.860
Pressing that switch and then talks to the Raspberry Pi 3 and it implements their commands and you can see they do have a GUI

08:00.860 --> 08:02.860
That's nice. It's definitely

08:03.500 --> 08:10.060
For geeks because you put in your for your home for your parameters your home your address your city your postcode your longitude your latitude

08:10.060 --> 08:15.780
You know those guys things that all average a home user setting up today's IOT devices have off the top of their head

08:15.780 --> 08:20.700
I keep them just on my tattoo right here. Yeah, of course you do. Of course you do and they've got bots

08:20.900 --> 08:26.380
that's the one thing I do like if you don't want to do anything else, you can just text it like a like a

08:26.700 --> 08:31.100
Text message and Gladys bot will respond to it. I know you're pretty hyped about this, right?

08:31.100 --> 08:33.100
We call you're probably gonna be deploying this. Oh, yeah, totally

08:33.580 --> 08:35.580
100% definitely

08:37.100 --> 08:41.500
Okay, all right, well I wanted to start with something weird but apparently nobody gives a shit about it

08:41.500 --> 08:44.860
That's right. I mean you didn't bring no on the show. He'd love it

08:44.860 --> 08:49.500
Yeah, maybe cuz it's talking his 433 megahertz RF. Well, and it's self-hosted

08:49.940 --> 08:54.460
Yeah, Dan you play with any of these like like I got a couple of echoes you play with any of these kinds of things

08:54.460 --> 08:58.480
I need like smart switches and stuff, but you know, not really just cuz I'm in an apartment

08:58.620 --> 09:01.880
So there's not much modding that I feel comfortable doing here

09:02.020 --> 09:06.060
Yeah, I think I think the smart switches are a good way to sort of dip your toe in there

09:06.060 --> 09:10.160
It's useful for me in the winter when it's cold. I know I'm an old man, but I have my heaters on it

09:10.160 --> 09:14.140
It's nice. It is nice. I think for this we just really have to see you know, duh

09:14.140 --> 09:18.940
Is there any adoption or there are people doing novel things with it that are passionate about it until then?

09:19.220 --> 09:26.460
Yeah, one of the the interesting things about this is you can expand it to add additional protocols by adding like the Z wave USB dong

09:26.460 --> 09:27.700
Yeah, yeah

09:27.700 --> 09:31.060
Yeah, this is I sort of put this actually in here a secret

09:31.060 --> 09:36.340
I secretly put in here to just sort of test to see what the interest was because I'm thinking people are burning out pretty bad

09:36.340 --> 09:40.540
On these is what my sense is and so I wanted to see how that would play out. I I

09:40.860 --> 09:43.180
Think it is kind of the case. I think it is kind of me

09:43.180 --> 09:48.020
I think it's but I what's interesting is I think it does have some mainstream broader appeal

09:48.020 --> 09:49.060
Yeah, I think so

09:49.060 --> 09:52.620
But also probably comes and goes and waves to you, you know people buy a bunch of it

09:52.620 --> 09:55.700
They have it that you guys do it and then it's like you're done spending your money for a bit

09:55.700 --> 10:01.020
You're done spending your money and like only so many new types of interactions come online and you know the certain rate

10:01.020 --> 10:04.480
So at some point you're like, well, I turn all my lights and my heaters off and now the other thing is

10:04.480 --> 10:07.700
Maybe the people that are buying this are doing it to make stuff easier

10:07.700 --> 10:10.940
and so you go with the tools like your echoes and

10:11.220 --> 10:17.300
Your home assistants and your hues and stuff like that that are all really easy to use because that's why you got it in the first

10:17.300 --> 10:18.100
place

10:18.100 --> 10:24.700
Right and geeks are like we want full-fledged solutions. And so it's not a real appealing market to us. Yeah

10:26.260 --> 10:30.340
Have that said I find it to be a nice I find it to be and it is actually

10:30.340 --> 10:35.660
How did I say that one of the reasons I've stuck with it more than more of the automation is because it's had a high

10:35.660 --> 10:40.740
Degree of family appeal spousal approvals and children like my kids like they all get it

10:40.740 --> 10:43.300
They all know how to use it and it works well with that for them

10:43.940 --> 10:45.940
Which is one of the reasons why it's stuck

10:46.220 --> 10:52.820
So, okay, maybe something more toward niche then what do you think about this guy's signal is now available as a standalone desktop app

10:52.980 --> 10:59.820
It's an electron app, but but you can get on your your Linux or your your Mac's or your Windows now all of them

10:59.820 --> 11:05.360
Yeah, and the setup process is kind of interesting. So you download it that gets their shipping as a deb right now

11:06.380 --> 11:10.780
And you can't do jack with it until you have it set up on your mobile device, too

11:10.780 --> 11:13.900
And then once you have signal configured on your mobile device

11:14.020 --> 11:19.060
There's a process and signal where you add a new device and you scan a QR code and you just tell this app

11:19.060 --> 11:22.940
Okay, I've set it up on my mobile device. I'm ready now. So it displays the QR code

11:22.940 --> 11:26.220
You scan that with your phone and it links them up. It's pretty similar to telegram then

11:26.220 --> 11:32.420
Well, no, no, so well, I mean in that it's useless until you set it up in your mobile device. Yes. Yeah

11:32.940 --> 11:38.220
But what's different than telegram is it syncs all of your messages in your contacts?

11:39.260 --> 11:41.340
From the other device not from the server

11:41.820 --> 11:46.740
So once it's once you've paired them it then does this moment where it says alright, hold on there boss

11:46.740 --> 11:50.460
I got to pull down all your contacts and all your messages and sync it to sync these two things up

11:50.460 --> 11:54.640
Let me ping your device and so instead of having all this stuff sitting on telegram servers

11:54.640 --> 11:56.640
It just blasts down to a new telegram install

11:56.660 --> 12:01.740
This stuff has to sync between your your own encrypted device and before they do that they each set up a key

12:01.780 --> 12:02.260
Yeah

12:02.260 --> 12:07.020
They have a little they have a little chitchat back and forth to negotiate and then they and then they do the sync

12:07.260 --> 12:09.300
so that was interesting but

12:10.060 --> 12:12.060
You know, you're not gonna have your I

12:12.060 --> 12:17.940
Ironically, I'd say it's not even nearly as doesn't feel nearly as integrated even as telegram does which is like some QT app that uses

12:17.940 --> 12:25.740
Their own thing their own black magic. I'm disappointed that they don't have a snap and only sports distros that use apps. That's what they say

12:25.740 --> 12:30.660
Yeah, Linux distribution supporting app like Ubuntu or Debian. Yeah, I bet you send a you are already actually

12:32.820 --> 12:37.520
What do you guys think don't bother them about it when you install it on arch anybody the moment room a signal user

12:37.860 --> 12:43.740
Are we all just a bunch of telegram bitches now? Everybody just all telegram. Yeah, we are we look at the telegram

12:43.740 --> 12:47.380
No, buddy signal you do. Yeah, I do occasionally do

12:48.340 --> 12:52.860
All right import your app MMS messages into it and actually have it as your default

12:53.420 --> 12:56.960
Texting app on your phone so you can use it as your messenger

12:56.980 --> 13:03.340
You can only you know, you can enable extra features for signal protocol to work its magic

13:03.820 --> 13:10.580
But yeah, it's just a texting app. I just checked there are six different signal a you are Wow

13:10.580 --> 13:16.060
Oh, so that's why do you use signal say over telegram is a different contacts you separating them out is a different features

13:16.580 --> 13:19.660
You know, I don't use it a ton. I have a way more people on telegram

13:19.660 --> 13:24.180
So I do use telegram as like day-to-day, but I have a couple people on signal and you know

13:24.180 --> 13:26.500
I do I do have more trust for it and it's I do

13:26.820 --> 13:33.080
So when I do have conversations, I'd like to keep private. That's my choice now heavens

13:33.080 --> 13:36.340
Do you also have any other ones that you could compare it to are you just a signal user?

13:36.340 --> 13:40.060
I've used telegram too, but not as much

13:40.620 --> 13:45.680
Telegram is more of an app and signal is more of a replacement text messenger

13:46.500 --> 13:52.800
Okay, fair enough. That's how I would compare it really they both have the same encryption features where you can enable

13:53.140 --> 13:56.320
you know one-to-one communication, but

13:56.980 --> 14:02.860
signal actually replaces the MMS app which or where a telegram is just a

14:03.820 --> 14:05.780
third party

14:05.780 --> 14:08.420
Program just another app on the phone. Yeah. Yeah, it really is

14:08.420 --> 14:13.420
So in that context the signal would be more equivalent to hangouts, which you can do the same thing. Mm-hmm

14:13.420 --> 14:19.220
I wish I bet you don't get that that integration on on the Apple iOS on that

14:19.780 --> 14:21.780
Stone isn't even it's not even

14:22.300 --> 14:27.340
That comparable either because hangouts doesn't exactly replace your MMS app even though it can

14:27.900 --> 14:29.900
but it doesn't have

14:30.300 --> 14:33.740
integrated encryption into it at least with a protocol which is

14:33.740 --> 14:35.740
Vetted

14:37.980 --> 14:40.780
It looks like a pretty nice app and they're steadily adding features

14:40.780 --> 14:45.580
They just recently the beginning of October started beta testing read receipts

14:45.580 --> 14:50.260
which is something that can be nice for some folks and then at the end of October you we got the desktop app and

14:50.820 --> 14:55.580
Now they're working on expanding things like doing gif searches to include in text

14:55.580 --> 14:57.980
You know the jiffy kind of stuff that people love all that kind of stuff

14:57.980 --> 15:03.380
So they're they're slowly just checking off features that a lot of other systems have but what did impress me about it

15:03.380 --> 15:08.000
Was I really felt it felt it felt more secure than telegram

15:08.000 --> 15:11.060
It felt like it didn't feel like Vladimir Putin was reading my messages

15:11.060 --> 15:13.660
Yeah, right when tell it every time I'm using telegram I go

15:13.660 --> 15:17.940
Yeah, yeah Putin could read this one and this doesn't seem that exciting but the you know

15:17.940 --> 15:19.840
The Chrome app version of it

15:19.840 --> 15:22.960
I think that was off-putting to a lot of people and so having like real first-class

15:23.420 --> 15:27.460
As long as you're willing to consider like John real but regardless having first-class desktop support

15:27.460 --> 15:31.740
I think makes it a lot easier for me to make this the case to others that hey you should jump on here

15:31.740 --> 15:33.740
so man speaking of

15:34.220 --> 15:41.380
Crossover and Chrome. I mean speaking of Chrome Crossover has a Chrome OS version now Crossover office

15:41.860 --> 15:44.180
Folks that always hacking away at wine and then yeah

15:44.580 --> 15:50.480
They make their commercial their commercial version that I've I've almost bought every single version of now because they just think it's it's a nice

15:50.480 --> 15:52.020
Way to manage your wine

15:52.020 --> 15:56.220
Installs if nothing else and there's been other things that come along like gaming on Linux and other things

15:56.220 --> 16:00.700
But nothing's nothing's nearly as good as crossover and now they're talking about a version for

16:00.700 --> 16:02.100
Chromebooks

16:02.100 --> 16:06.840
This is gonna be huge potentially if it if it even half works

16:07.060 --> 16:11.420
They have a video should we risk it you want to do a little hope how to install

16:11.420 --> 16:14.220
Oh, this is how you install crossover. I do like the music

16:15.420 --> 16:17.820
Stage one had this music. We would be there. Oh

16:18.440 --> 16:20.260
Yeah, we got it. We'll figure that out

16:20.260 --> 16:24.140
You think we'd have do you think we could figure that out by the end of the show no no no if we're gonna do

16:24.140 --> 16:30.380
The whole VM thing yeah, okay, but next time yeah, so anyways stay tuned for news on that because it's been announced

16:30.380 --> 16:34.600
It's there. They have a beta right now. That's good. So does that change things for you?

16:35.100 --> 16:41.260
No, make a Chromebook anymore if you know it, but it does it does probably make it more appealing for a lot of people

16:41.780 --> 16:46.060
You know how we used to speculate is the Windows subsystem for Linux gonna keep some people on Windows

16:46.060 --> 16:50.140
I know for a fact now it has I've heard from several Windows users who are considering switching

16:50.140 --> 16:54.580
Yeah, and they were considering switching to Linux, and they're like I don't need to know I mean it does make sense

16:54.580 --> 16:57.300
Right if you're just a casual. You don't really care you haven't bought into the whole

16:57.300 --> 17:02.940
Open-source free software thing you don't use it you haven't so this realized what if this is that move

17:02.940 --> 17:05.180
What if this is that move on Chrome OS? Yeah?

17:06.380 --> 17:11.900
Maybe that means only the true Linux users will remain kind of see the writing on the wall for that like a mile away

17:12.300 --> 17:13.900
You know

17:13.900 --> 17:17.380
You know you I'm saying yeah, yeah, it's probably only gonna

17:17.380 --> 17:20.360
I bet you only works on certain Chromebooks, so so you got it okay here you go

17:20.360 --> 17:27.920
Here's the requirements has to be a Chromebook with an Intel processor. Oh you have to have Google Play services available and enabled for it

17:27.920 --> 17:30.040
So that probably means a Chromebook that can run Android apps, right?

17:31.080 --> 17:33.080
That might be how they're doing this

17:33.840 --> 17:39.400
And then 200 megabytes of free disk space and 2 gigs of RAM and if you got if your Chromebook meets those

17:40.120 --> 17:43.560
Requirements then you could potentially run Windows applications on your Chromebook

17:45.280 --> 17:49.080
So speaking of messaging applications does anybody care that Skype has

17:49.080 --> 17:50.360
made

17:50.360 --> 17:53.920
Made that Skype for Linux version that new crazy Skype desktop version

17:53.920 --> 17:58.160
That's now officially the main Skype desktop version

17:58.160 --> 18:03.800
Oh yeah for Mac for Windows 10 real official Windows 8 Windows 7 and Linux are all now switching over to that

18:03.800 --> 18:07.960
Electron version of Skype the one that we've been beta testing in the studio and

18:09.880 --> 18:12.440
Sorry to report guys that the

18:13.240 --> 18:17.920
Feature that I know you all wanted really badly in your Skype. It's been delayed on the desktop version

18:17.920 --> 18:20.680
I hate to break it to you, but snapchat style stories

18:21.280 --> 18:28.600
Didn't make it to the desktop version of sky. I know I know I know you wanted to have snapchat like stories in your Skype

18:28.600 --> 18:29.920
I really did

18:29.920 --> 18:31.920
Did they manage to port ads?

18:33.000 --> 18:36.840
They did. I think they did manage. Yeah, they didn't have reliability

18:39.160 --> 18:41.160
They hate that

18:41.680 --> 18:46.120
Microsoft declined to say how many total active Skype users they have today so TechCrunch speculates

18:46.120 --> 18:48.120
That means it's probably still around 300 million

18:48.320 --> 18:54.780
But the company did give some details Microsoft said that Skype now has surpassed a billion downloads on Android

18:55.320 --> 18:59.820
Geez generated 2 trillion minutes of video calls since 2006

18:59.820 --> 19:06.860
I think half of those are text naps and today's users make up to 3 billion minutes of calls per day

19:07.160 --> 19:11.640
3 billion you can multiply anything by the number of users you have it sounds pretty good

19:11.640 --> 19:15.960
It's funny how how much more

19:17.280 --> 19:24.080
This new version looks like and has the features of discord and slack. Yeah and slack there and they've been doing bots

19:24.080 --> 19:28.580
They're doing bots too. They're really trying to everybody's trying to be so they've got their reactions

19:29.240 --> 19:31.240
Everybody's trying to be slack and it's so annoying

19:31.560 --> 19:33.480
Can't slack just be slack

19:33.480 --> 19:36.780
Like like at least when matrix did it they did something unique there, you know

19:36.780 --> 19:39.080
But like Skype if you go look at this

19:39.080 --> 19:42.640
We'll have a link in the show notes you look at the screenshot in that article. It's what you would almost think

19:42.640 --> 19:48.160
It's slack at first. Maybe someone wrote how to write an electron app. That's like scat slack and then

19:48.920 --> 19:50.920
Everyone else is just like, all right, this is easy

19:50.920 --> 19:55.280
Everybody's just looking at the source code to the slack app and going, you know, this is great about electron apps

19:55.280 --> 19:57.280
It's all just right here. Let's just take it

19:57.680 --> 20:02.000
I don't like the problem is that a lot of times people look at and they go oh, you know

20:02.000 --> 20:04.080
This is the leading solution. Let's compete with that

20:04.080 --> 20:09.460
And instead of looking at this is the problem that they tried to solve and that's how they came up with a new competitive

20:09.460 --> 20:14.020
Product. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you know what? I'd like here's how I'd like the Skype folks to think about it

20:14.380 --> 20:20.580
Why do people want to use Skype over slack for video and audio calls and whatever reasons those are?

20:20.580 --> 20:23.160
let's get really even better at those get even better because

20:23.980 --> 20:27.740
slack is adding pretty decent web RTC video calling and

20:28.200 --> 20:33.120
I if I if I wanted to just use slack with that had video calling I would just use slack and

20:33.120 --> 20:35.960
So Skype needs to ask the questions to themselves

20:35.960 --> 20:41.320
Why would somebody still choose to use Skype over slack now that it has those features and double down on that stuff?

20:41.320 --> 20:43.560
they're just making they're just watering down their feature set and

20:44.240 --> 20:47.520
Unfortunately, and I hate to be this guy so typical of me

20:48.000 --> 20:52.040
Really just so disappointed in myself even but we all are don't worry

20:52.120 --> 20:55.880
And you will you will you you have to back me up on this because you witnessed it firsthand

20:56.040 --> 21:02.440
We have legitimately had considerably better audio and video performance under the old Windows version than we have

21:02.440 --> 21:04.880
With the new Skype beta. Yeah, that's true

21:04.880 --> 21:10.360
it pains me to say it but you are right like we tried for weeks to get video working properly in a way that didn't

21:10.360 --> 21:15.320
Suck on tech snap and and then we eventually just for on a whim like well

21:15.320 --> 21:19.240
Let's reboot into Windows 7 use the old version of Skype. See what happens and it was bulletproof

21:20.320 --> 21:25.760
Ever since and it sounds better too. And that's really that that just pisses me off now. I wonder now

21:25.760 --> 21:31.480
I don't I wonder which version Dan was using like I wonder if it's any better if it's the modern electron on both ends

21:31.480 --> 21:32.600
Yeah

21:32.600 --> 21:34.320
Probably I do find you to be better

21:34.320 --> 21:38.060
So on Koda radio if both my Mike and I are on the electron version

21:38.060 --> 21:41.080
It's better and if he's on like a non electron version

21:41.080 --> 21:45.200
I have to reboot into an OS that has that okay version interesting and then it sounds better. It works better

21:45.200 --> 21:49.080
The two do not still I don't think work as well together and I'm just you know

21:49.080 --> 21:51.080
Just listening to with my ears recording these shows

21:51.080 --> 21:55.800
I maybe other people getting different results, but for the my is my broadcaster bad ears of yours

21:55.800 --> 21:58.800
Well, like a kid screaming them a lot. So they're not as good as I used to be

21:58.800 --> 22:05.880
All right. Let's talk about a desktop environment that doesn't get as somebody put it enough love on this show recently and that's enlightenment

22:06.480 --> 22:10.160
Enlightenment has a brand new release 22. How about that?

22:10.720 --> 22:14.640
Did you even know did you even know after one year and 1500 patches?

22:15.280 --> 22:21.680
200 tickets on their issue tracker and a whole bunch of new features. We get a little 22 and one of the headline features is

22:22.760 --> 22:25.440
greatly improved Whalen support

22:25.440 --> 22:33.320
Adding support for all kinds of stuff including some of the pointer stuff that was really broken and improved support for ex Wayland as well

22:34.000 --> 22:41.720
Which is enlightenment was one of the first desktops to actually implement Wayland protocol support because of their compositor

22:42.240 --> 22:49.000
Design they had I imagine that they had to have as well update their protocol support

22:49.120 --> 22:52.720
In order to get up-to-date, but they were one of the first yep

22:52.720 --> 22:57.800
Yep, they they definitely were and they just had they just had to get they had to get caught up essentially

22:58.080 --> 23:03.000
They've made some improvements to how their windows tile and they have per window now pulse

23:04.880 --> 23:10.620
Right there in these so you have your title bar where you have your application icon you have in the middle of the window

23:10.620 --> 23:16.160
You have the name of the app and then you have your window controls like your maximize your minimize in your clothes on the far

23:16.160 --> 23:19.420
Right, but on the far left next to like the icon

23:19.420 --> 23:23.220
they put volume control for that specific application if

23:23.860 --> 23:29.460
That's not if that's not the most brilliant thing. I've ever seen it brings it to me

23:29.460 --> 23:33.840
I'm saying saying enlightenment 22. That's what's going on the studio machine

23:35.500 --> 23:39.660
Systems reloading all these systems. It does actually make me want to try it next to go

23:39.660 --> 23:43.740
I don't know if it would work an X to go but it if it if it did it would that would be pretty great

23:44.420 --> 23:47.300
They've also worked. I remember their gadgets were really cool

23:47.300 --> 23:50.580
they've been that they've improved the gadget infrastructure as they put it and

23:50.900 --> 23:56.380
They've also created a improved GUI for like pseudo prompts and SSH password prompts. That's nice

23:58.100 --> 24:02.740
Obviously, I'm not it. I'm not a daily user. So I can't speak authoritatively on it. But I

24:04.020 --> 24:08.500
Mean, I'm a little enlightenment curious. Yeah, I am as well. Maybe I can install it on gentoo later

24:08.580 --> 24:11.980
Yeah, if you ever get that gentoo working West, I'm sorry

24:11.980 --> 24:18.060
Just one job. Just one. You know what West just just know it

24:18.060 --> 24:23.940
No, it couldn't have said it better myself. No, okay. The FL is way faster to compile than the no more

24:25.780 --> 24:30.860
Yeah, no kidding that actually be a shortcut when you get to that stage you should do that yeah, why not

24:30.980 --> 24:33.700
Yeah, all right. Well, let's let's keep going here

24:33.700 --> 24:37.580
I got a I got an app pick as it were based off of a little support call

24:37.580 --> 24:41.900
I wound up in before the show so I thought why not share it with the whole class

24:41.900 --> 24:48.820
You're so generous speaking of class Linux Academy comm slash unplugged go there and sign up for a free seven-day trial

24:48.820 --> 24:54.180
It's a platform to learn all about Linux really any DevOps topic and then any of those huge platforms

24:54.540 --> 25:00.140
Around Linux like like OpenStack or or AWS or Azure. There's just a big OpenStack summit and

25:02.500 --> 25:05.420
Lots of news I almost put some of it in the show

25:06.020 --> 25:08.300
But I figure if people are open stack curious

25:08.300 --> 25:14.020
They could just go to Linux Academy Linux Academy comm slash unplugged you support the show you sign up for a free seven-day trial

25:14.020 --> 25:19.060
They have a great system with hands-on scenario based labs. They have instructors real humans that can help you

25:19.060 --> 25:21.060
They have a course scheduler when you're busy

25:22.020 --> 25:25.620
learning paths with your series of courses and content planned by instructors and

25:26.300 --> 25:33.540
Then they have a community that's full of your fellow Jupiter broadcasting listeners because they've been a sponsor for quite a while Linux Academy

25:33.540 --> 25:39.200
Comm slash unplugged. It's a great platform. That's always getting better. They're always adding new value adding new content

25:39.420 --> 25:46.020
Fixing up and improving and going back and rephrasing and based on feedback or addending things based on new commands. It's

25:46.740 --> 25:52.100
It's a great system Linux Academy comm slash unplugged go there sign up free seven-day trial

25:52.100 --> 25:54.100
You'll get a sense of the system also

25:54.100 --> 26:00.140
Enjoy the offline content you can download and take some study guides with you and Android and iOS apps to listen and study on-the-go

26:00.140 --> 26:05.980
an audio that you can kind of take in like an audiobook it's pretty nice system Linux Academy comm slash

26:06.380 --> 26:10.260
Unplugged you might say they paint a great picture in your mind

26:10.260 --> 26:14.120
I do and speaking of painting a great picture the lady

26:14.540 --> 26:20.380
My lady my lady friend came to me last night and said I tasked one of my employees

26:20.380 --> 26:26.100
Her name is Christina with setting up an image editor on our front front workstation

26:26.100 --> 26:32.300
Okay. Now Christina is a lifelong Windows user and the front workstation is an Ubuntu 1604

26:32.900 --> 26:34.900
system with unity 7 on it and

26:35.300 --> 26:36.860
I

26:36.860 --> 26:39.060
Immediately my heart sunk because I'm like, oh god

26:39.060 --> 26:43.020
how could this have possibly gone because what is she gonna do first she's gonna go to Google and

26:43.460 --> 26:47.060
Best case scenario and no disrespect to the game project

26:47.060 --> 26:53.900
But best case scenario is she somehow after all of her research online because this guy loves to research. She's very diligent

26:53.900 --> 26:58.500
Mmm, she winds up at GIMP somehow figures out how to get GIMP installed on the Ubuntu box

26:58.500 --> 27:03.660
And then they go to just they want to create some signage because they haven't marked they have a marketing thing coming up and they need

27:03.660 --> 27:07.180
Some digital billboards. They just need to mock together some signs for it to show the artists what they want

27:07.180 --> 27:12.340
That's all they're looking for. And so if they can they can paint would do the job, right? And of course as

27:13.100 --> 27:18.300
Luck would have it they wound up at GIMP and they got GIMP installed to their credit which good work

27:18.300 --> 27:21.420
I wish I could have had like a camera on that to see how all that went down

27:21.420 --> 27:27.740
They got like a Linux badge. They can give them just like a good job. You've installed GIMP. That's a rite of passage

27:27.740 --> 27:31.660
I actually was very impressed. So they got that installed and then they opened it and

27:32.580 --> 27:36.980
That's where it didn't work out. I'm like whoa, and it's funny

27:36.980 --> 27:37.260
You know what?

27:37.260 --> 27:43.380
Their first reaction was and it was so classic it couldn't have been more classic because I had no influence on the conversation

27:43.600 --> 27:45.600
Well, this is nothing like Photoshop

27:45.600 --> 27:51.920
Oh, oh my god, damn it. Damn it. I'm like, come on. Come on. Okay

27:52.360 --> 27:54.360
Well, have you heard of GIMP shop?

27:54.640 --> 27:58.620
So I yeah skin. Yeah. Yeah, I I thought about it

27:58.620 --> 27:59.720
I did but you know

27:59.720 --> 28:04.600
there's another app I've mentioned it once before on the air and I think was years ago and

28:05.120 --> 28:09.600
Linux action show and it's just such a great basic app and it's it's it's pinta

28:09.600 --> 28:15.560
P I N T a and it's painting made simple and they have a PPA available for Ubuntu

28:15.560 --> 28:19.280
So at first I had to try to install it through the software center

28:19.280 --> 28:22.000
But it wasn't working for so, you know, you know what?

28:22.000 --> 28:26.040
You know what is always the easiest is just give people commands have them open the terminal

28:26.120 --> 28:30.840
It's just it's it's it's binary they type it in and it either works or it doesn't work and there's no like

28:30.840 --> 28:32.840
What are you seeing on your screen?

28:33.000 --> 28:39.200
Where is that button that like it's just describe where the menu and right did the prompt come back or did the prompt not come?

28:39.200 --> 28:42.720
Back, that's all I have to know and so I I was able to with three commands

28:42.720 --> 28:43.840
She got the PPA set up

28:43.840 --> 28:48.520
We got a repos update and then she got it installed and they're up and working with with Pinta P I N T a

28:48.920 --> 28:54.360
It's a free open source program for drawing and image editing and it's it's just powerful enough

28:54.360 --> 28:58.280
It's more powerful. It's more like a paint net if you ever use paint on windows

28:58.280 --> 29:04.880
I used to use that and it's more like paint net. It's got layer support. It's got histories. It's got tabs

29:04.880 --> 29:07.120
It's got lots of basic image editing

29:07.120 --> 29:08.680
and

29:08.680 --> 29:13.640
It's just it's just really doesn't come with the cute dog picture because I don't think so

29:13.720 --> 29:19.640
If you're looking for something simple as well, I'd also give a shout out to my paint. Yeah. Yes

29:19.640 --> 29:24.520
My paints also really good, right? That was the other one that I had. I knew there was another one

29:24.520 --> 29:27.080
I was forgetting my paint is also what I like

29:27.920 --> 29:30.280
So my paint org is where you can find that one

29:30.280 --> 29:33.240
And then yeah gimp shop as heaven mentioned is if you just want to use gimp

29:33.240 --> 29:38.120
But just have the arranged in a way that makes it look more like Photoshop, which is something I've enjoyed

29:38.400 --> 29:41.960
Because I had used Photoshop previously because my mom was a graphic artist

29:41.960 --> 29:46.720
And so she's been using Photoshop literally since version 1 and so it was always in our household

29:46.720 --> 29:50.280
Yeah, so I grew up with from version 1 and then I stopped using Photoshop

29:50.800 --> 29:52.240
heavily around

29:52.240 --> 29:53.440
7

29:53.440 --> 29:56.040
But I still use it on and off frequently

29:56.640 --> 30:01.520
With our JB has a creative cloud subscription and I still find it to be a better layout than GIMP

30:01.520 --> 30:04.120
I probably you know, I'm probably equal in my usage there

30:04.120 --> 30:08.200
And so if I could just make gimp look more like Photoshop, I think I'm gonna do it again

30:08.200 --> 30:10.440
I think I'm gonna try to gimp shop it up again. I used to do it

30:10.440 --> 30:13.560
I think I'm gonna do it again and I'm on unity. I'm gonna gimp shop it up. I'm going all in

30:14.600 --> 30:21.600
Because a lot of people that know Photoshop know that Photoshop has plenty of obscure features that but they would probably never know

30:21.680 --> 30:29.360
For years unless they were an expert and so they expect new features to pop up and gimp shop does give them that

30:29.360 --> 30:31.360
experience of

30:32.000 --> 30:33.200
discovery

30:33.200 --> 30:38.200
And if you want something else that's advanced, that's not the GIMP then

30:38.760 --> 30:43.400
There's also Krita. Yeah, which I think is maybe more for drawing but yeah

30:43.400 --> 30:45.600
Yeah, I know that Albert likes create a lot

30:45.920 --> 30:52.080
So there there's a lot of there's a lot of hubbub today about this Starcraft that came out for Linux Starcraft 2

30:54.360 --> 30:57.040
Give me started on it. Yeah, it's just a headless thing

30:57.040 --> 31:00.280
it's a headless thing, but it kind of it might be a cool way to run like

31:01.280 --> 31:07.680
The Starcraft server remotely on a Linux box somewhere. Is that what I'm getting here? Well, that's I'm aware of it's the protocols

31:07.840 --> 31:09.840
so as long as the protocols are

31:11.360 --> 31:13.360
Network capable. Yeah, and not just

31:14.120 --> 31:20.200
Local network capable then you should be able to run a Starcraft client on a remote server and have it

31:20.200 --> 31:28.320
Relay all of the commands back and just play locally. He's so yeah, I'm pretty excited digital open digital

31:28.320 --> 31:30.320
Yeah, right, right

31:30.940 --> 31:36.040
Now we just need somebody to write an open source front end right to talk to that. I know

31:36.540 --> 31:41.740
Yeah, can you play Starcraft 2 on Linux? I've never tried so don't know and under whiny. Oh you can

31:42.780 --> 31:44.780
You can hashtag rust life. I

31:45.500 --> 31:49.020
Don't know. All's I know is rust. I've been every free minute. I log into rest

31:49.020 --> 31:52.860
There's a Starcraft 2 arch wiki entry. So that says something I'll save it for user

31:52.940 --> 31:58.940
We're gonna have to talk about rust on user this week because I had such a hoot with wimpy and poppy last week

31:59.100 --> 32:04.020
They got me they sucked me in and I came in at the right time and it's been a blast

32:04.020 --> 32:09.740
So check out this the checkout user later this week for the I gotta I gotta start also poppy if you're listening to this

32:09.740 --> 32:11.740
I think you might be a psychopath. Sorry

32:11.780 --> 32:14.180
All right, moving on. We got a question that came

32:14.180 --> 32:16.180
Oh

32:18.260 --> 32:24.860
We go back for just a second sure sure I'm looking at the the downloads for the Starcraft 2. Yeah. Yeah, it's password

32:24.860 --> 32:29.980
It's in a password protected file and the password is I agree to the EULA. Yeah

32:32.020 --> 32:37.260
Yeah, I looked around too for licensing stuff and it was pretty I don't know people are pretty jacked up about it

32:37.260 --> 32:42.540
I look down again. Okay, looks like under wine. It's platinum though. It is a parody good. Oh, it's the game is yeah

32:42.540 --> 32:46.140
Oh, it is apparently under the AI and machine learning license

32:47.700 --> 32:53.420
Well, I know where all my hard work hard-earned money is going which is a blizzard specific license

32:53.420 --> 32:54.340
I tell you okay

32:54.340 --> 32:57.980
I'll tell you if you boy if you want to if you want to try out a few life theories like

32:58.220 --> 33:01.380
Should I have been a member of the collective should I've gone out on my own?

33:01.380 --> 33:05.340
Could I live after the collapse? You should play rust Eric. It's a it's a good

33:05.340 --> 33:08.840
It's just a good mental exercise and just try out a few different life scenarios

33:08.840 --> 33:13.840
All right, so we got a question that came into the show and maybe Dan might help us with this one because I bet he

33:13.840 --> 33:20.200
Has thoughts and I bet so he says guys what distro should I be using to get high DPI support on my laptop?

33:20.200 --> 33:25.880
I recently bought a Dell XPS 15 and I've been having a hard time finding a distribution

33:26.400 --> 33:29.280
That doesn't look like crap on my high DPI display

33:29.960 --> 33:31.960
anything running XFC

33:33.240 --> 33:34.600
Not that

33:34.600 --> 33:36.600
What do you think though Dan because I know

33:36.600 --> 33:41.440
High DPI is something that the elementary project has some opinions on and I

33:42.120 --> 33:48.000
Recall one of my first out-of-the-box high DPI just working by default distros was elementary OS

33:48.000 --> 33:50.280
So I'm gonna put that down for you as a recommendation

33:50.280 --> 33:54.400
But high DPI thoughts in general is there things to look out for or things he can look for

33:54.960 --> 33:58.080
yeah, I mean high DPI is pretty complicated right now actually and

33:58.640 --> 34:04.640
I think the first big question to ask is are you gonna be using this with an external display is

34:04.640 --> 34:08.040
If you are then you definitely want a distro that's running Wayland

34:08.720 --> 34:13.120
Is mixing DPI's is not something that X does well

34:14.520 --> 34:20.760
Definitely that is you'll get the weakest link in the chain basically on that external monitor and it's a bummer

34:20.760 --> 34:23.920
Yeah, yeah, then the next question after that is

34:25.000 --> 34:30.360
What scaling does your display attempt to do normally because Windows does?

34:30.360 --> 34:37.880
of non integer scaling and so a lot of these manufacturers are putting out displays that are built for non integer scaling whereas

34:39.040 --> 34:45.500
Most high DPI ready desktop environments in the Linux space right now only handle integer scaling

34:46.120 --> 34:50.320
Wow, I barely even understand is that right the fractional scaling. Yeah, that's yeah

34:50.680 --> 34:51.200
Yeah

34:51.200 --> 34:55.700
So so if your display is looking for like a 1.25 or 1.5 scale

34:55.840 --> 34:58.720
Like you're gonna have a pretty pretty bad time, right?

34:58.720 --> 35:04.520
And unless like unity has some stuff for that like the latest gnome added some stuff for that

35:04.520 --> 35:10.240
But that's still like you still probably want to be on Wayland for that and you're talking like the really latest version of gnome

35:10.240 --> 35:13.880
Yeah, so if you get past those two things and you're like, oh

35:13.880 --> 35:19.160
I'm only gonna do integer scaling on my laptop and I'm not gonna attach to an external display

35:19.280 --> 35:22.720
Then you can pretty much go with anything. That's ggk3. Yeah

35:22.720 --> 35:29.160
I have I will say I have pretty good success with elementary OS and I have great success with unity 7

35:29.160 --> 35:32.320
You have to go manually do it in unity 7 like an animal

35:32.320 --> 35:37.140
I have to squinted my screen and I that's where you have the magnifying glass in your in your desk drawer

35:37.480 --> 35:38.360
Right for that

35:38.360 --> 35:43.480
But the nice thing is you just hit the super key you type in display enter and then it's to the only slider on that

35:43.480 --> 35:47.340
window is the one you need to move and you just slide it up to like a 2 in my case and

35:47.340 --> 35:52.100
Mm-hmm looking good and I bet that's the case for the XPS 15 too. I bet it just be a 2

35:53.060 --> 36:00.880
Remember for them they have to remember that it's the disc or desktop environment that does the DPI scaling not the distro, right?

36:00.880 --> 36:05.080
Right. Yeah, that's important. Yes. Yes. Yeah, the question to what did say distro didn't it?

36:05.660 --> 36:10.700
So you could yeah you yeah, you really need to focus more on the desktop environment. So the latest gnomes

36:11.660 --> 36:13.460
plasma can do this to

36:13.460 --> 36:15.460
an elementary

36:15.460 --> 36:19.660
And and you know, I'm gonna be that guy miss a unity 7-2. Mm-hmm

36:19.660 --> 36:22.940
Yeah, definitely unity 7 you got to kind of stick to that stuff for right now

36:22.940 --> 36:27.060
And if anybody has any other tips, please leave a comment. Let us know

36:27.620 --> 36:33.660
So Dan the real the really tough stuff about that though is you're gonna run into like apps like Steam that don't scale

36:33.660 --> 36:39.820
Oh, you're like OBS or like a lot of the really important apps that you're gonna want don't support. I'd be I yet

36:39.860 --> 36:43.300
Yeah, you know surprisingly my daily driver at home

36:43.300 --> 36:48.540
I've wound up on a high DPI display and not didn't even really just that's the laptop I ended up taking home for a bit

36:48.540 --> 36:49.500
and

36:49.500 --> 36:51.960
That's really where it stands out the most is Steam

36:52.300 --> 36:57.380
otherwise, it's pretty good like my day-to-day apps that I use Chrome and Firefox and the terminal and

36:57.900 --> 37:01.800
My editors they all look really good now

37:02.020 --> 37:07.180
so it's it's those things like Steam or it's old X applications that

37:07.180 --> 37:13.660
Like an old Java app or something that just look like real hell. Yeah, or sometimes like some proprietary stuff

37:13.660 --> 37:16.500
Like that the Dropbox UI doesn't look quite right

37:16.500 --> 37:19.580
But it essentially looks right and telegram has support

37:19.740 --> 37:24.700
You can go in there and you can tell telegram to zoom its UI up a little bit and then it looks then telegram looks

37:24.700 --> 37:25.740
fine, too

37:25.740 --> 37:30.900
So good luck. So Dan why we're chatting. Why don't we talk a little bit about the new release of granite and

37:30.900 --> 37:37.460
And what's new there and and maybe I know we've talked before maybe even on this show about it

37:37.460 --> 37:41.460
Maybe not but kind of like a quick recap of what the heck granite even is

37:42.780 --> 37:45.380
Yeah, so if you're not familiar with what granite is

37:45.940 --> 37:52.300
basically, we we had this problem when we started out where we're making a lot of apps with not a lot of people and

37:52.980 --> 37:57.100
Realizing that we had a lot of common design patterns that we were spending a lot of time

37:57.100 --> 38:05.300
Rewriting over and over and over again, so we made this library on granite and it's a companion library for GTK plus and GLI and

38:05.940 --> 38:11.620
Granite basically is just a way for us to not repeat ourselves. It contains like common

38:12.100 --> 38:14.100
utilities and widgets and

38:14.220 --> 38:19.260
Design patterns that we've used all in our different apps that you can use in your apps, too

38:19.260 --> 38:22.260
And it makes it really easy to write nice

38:22.260 --> 38:29.900
elementary HIG compliant apps very quickly and so this has got a I got to imagine helped with the app store

38:30.460 --> 38:36.020
Adoption that we talked app centered adoption. We talked about last week over 50 native applications

38:36.020 --> 38:40.240
I mean a lot of them are maybe all of them using granite to get set up. I

38:40.880 --> 38:44.360
Don't know if all of them are but but I'm sure like a fair number more

38:44.360 --> 38:48.720
I don't have that stat actually handy, but I can tell you that we're over 60 apps now

38:48.720 --> 38:50.720
Hey

38:50.880 --> 38:56.400
Thanks, I think this is I think the reason why I've always praised this is because it's a

38:57.200 --> 39:02.600
It's the easy button for developers. Yeah, it's it just it does a lot of the hard work that they don't really want to do

39:02.600 --> 39:03.360
Yeah, okay

39:03.360 --> 39:06.920
Maybe I could learn how to do this right and the thing is is like it takes care of UI

39:07.080 --> 39:12.920
Elements that you don't have to worry about and by using these it looks consistent and well integrated with the rest of the entire

39:13.960 --> 39:16.840
Operating system and so it looks like it's part of an ecosystem

39:16.840 --> 39:22.100
So I really I really think that every distribution should have this I think

39:22.800 --> 39:25.580
Canonical would have had this with unity 8 once they were done

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
I think Gnome

39:28.000 --> 39:34.500
Started to go in this direction with gnome builder. They started down this path, but there's all there's there's so much work to be done

39:34.500 --> 39:35.720
here and

39:35.720 --> 39:41.800
Now we have an iterate another it of release. It's a 0.5 release of granite. What's what's new?

39:41.800 --> 39:45.740
What's what do you what lessons have you guys learned recently? That's been sort of integrated into this release

39:45.740 --> 39:49.560
So there's a there's a couple big things in this release. One of them was

39:50.120 --> 39:52.880
Not only what's new but what we got rid of

39:53.540 --> 39:57.580
There's a ton of stuff that we built out in granite that is now

39:58.400 --> 40:05.300
Available in GTK or has become features of GTK. So we're able to pull out a bunch of stuff and make it way leaner code base

40:06.320 --> 40:10.360
But we also went in and we redid the whole demo app

40:10.360 --> 40:15.840
so it's way easier to find out like hey what utilities and widgets are actually supplied by granite and

40:16.320 --> 40:22.660
Then with some new utilities for a date time though. We have a new relative date time utility

40:22.660 --> 40:28.200
So you can give this utility a time and then it'll say oh that time

40:28.200 --> 40:33.520
It'll give you a natural language string back like oh that's in five minutes. That's in three hours. That was yesterday

40:33.520 --> 40:35.120
That was last week, you know

40:35.120 --> 40:40.600
It'll give you like a natural language response. You can use in like your messaging app or scheduling or things like that

40:41.840 --> 40:47.200
Nice. Yeah, I'm going through the post right now. It just looks looks so clean

40:47.200 --> 40:49.560
I really like this demo app because as a as

40:49.960 --> 40:55.620
As somebody who's maybe not familiar with what what all granite does bring you can just sit down here and basically tab through this

40:55.760 --> 41:00.520
Application and see all the different stuff that it brings and it's the range is is pretty big

41:00.720 --> 41:03.480
Actually, it's quite a bit quite a quite a lot of stuff

41:03.480 --> 41:09.440
Do you I guess so this is 0.5 and I'm sure you're not gonna want to speculate about the future

41:09.440 --> 41:11.840
But am I gonna someday see things on here?

41:11.840 --> 41:15.800
like maybe like some sort of cloud related service on this tab or some kind of

41:16.480 --> 41:20.400
Something that's unique to elementary OS like a like what other things?

41:20.400 --> 41:25.080
Do you think down the road could be added to the sidebar of options that granite lets you integrate with your application?

41:26.520 --> 41:30.240
Um, I mean, I guess the scope of granite is pretty big

41:30.240 --> 41:34.840
Because it is just like whatever common widgets and utilities are in there

41:34.960 --> 41:40.840
one of the one of the next widgets that I want to get in there is we built this sharing menu for

41:41.600 --> 41:44.520
App Center so you can share links to apps and App Center

41:44.520 --> 41:50.080
And so I really want to build that into a proper granite widget with a great API so that you can just say

41:50.280 --> 41:51.300
like hey

41:51.300 --> 41:56.880
I've got a string that's this many characters and it has a link and it's an image and then the popover will figure out like

41:56.880 --> 42:01.920
Oh, like these are the social networks that accept all those parameters and then you know, like that's one widget

42:01.920 --> 42:04.680
I really want to get in there. Very cool. I like that

42:04.680 --> 42:04.880
Yeah

42:04.880 --> 42:10.960
this is this is a nice write-up with with great pretty pictures too and I have it linked in the show notes if you guys

42:10.960 --> 42:12.960
want to check it out and

42:13.360 --> 42:19.080
I I would think it's got a it's got to help lead to the success of those 60 apps the fact that they're actually there

42:19.080 --> 42:20.960
I mean if you stop and think about

42:20.960 --> 42:25.400
The the hard work a lot of times on Linux is getting the UI right for developers

42:25.400 --> 42:30.340
A lot of times we have a lot of really great applications and the UI is just a little rough

42:30.400 --> 42:33.380
Well, I like it seems like that's kind of sometimes the barrier to like, okay

42:33.380 --> 42:34.880
Well, I know how to make all the back end work

42:34.880 --> 42:38.800
But to make it usable to you, I need to have like it doesn't have to be beautiful

42:38.800 --> 42:45.200
But I just need a usable UI. So if this can make that trivial, that's awesome. Yeah, and it's not it's not electron, right?

42:45.200 --> 42:47.480
See, that's the thing like that's that that would mean like, okay

42:47.480 --> 42:51.080
Well, if I can just integrate this whatever else I was doing I don't have to jump to the electron band

42:51.080 --> 42:56.440
Yeah, the other day. These are I mean correct down at the end. These are essentially GTK applications that are being produced

42:56.800 --> 43:01.840
Yeah, it's all it's all GTK 3 and and yeah granite uses GTK behind the scenes

43:01.840 --> 43:04.780
So it's they're all just GTK widgets that are kind of prefab

43:05.360 --> 43:06.960
And one of the things that's super awesome

43:06.960 --> 43:11.200
I think is that we've been able to get a developer ecosystem that's excited about

43:11.360 --> 43:15.340
GTK CSS and providing like easy style classes for them to use

43:15.480 --> 43:19.240
You'll see like a ton of the apps and App Center have nice brand colors

43:19.240 --> 43:24.280
And they do interesting things with GTK CSS to look really nice. Mm-hmm

43:24.640 --> 43:30.360
Well great work and nice post to good job on the write-up. It was a good read. So thank you very much

43:30.360 --> 43:34.880
Thank you. Come on explain Matt. It's nice to pick your brain on that. Go ahead. Oh

43:35.760 --> 43:42.000
Granite is built upon Fala, isn't it? Yeah, it is. Okay, and Valor is built upon GTK

43:42.000 --> 43:46.200
So it might be an indirect, but that's why it's built upon GTK

43:46.200 --> 43:50.960
But Valor really gives you a lot of power when it comes to scripting and it's ease of use

43:51.600 --> 43:58.900
Doesn't it? Yeah, it's built. It's built purpose-built 4g object though. It feels really native to write

43:59.200 --> 44:00.800
GTK with Vala

44:00.800 --> 44:06.200
Hmm, that's what I've heard and I have looked into it before but I haven't bothered with it

44:06.560 --> 44:09.400
You should give it another chance if you're familiar with C sharp

44:09.640 --> 44:13.400
Then you'll be able to jump into it super easy. Like the syntax is buttery smooth

44:13.400 --> 44:21.080
It's way easier than trying to write GTK with like C. Oh, yes G object all raw G object is

44:21.600 --> 44:23.600
Brutal makes my eyes bleed. I

44:26.080 --> 44:30.360
Every time we talk Vala, there's always some hater that comes along and talks bad about it

44:30.360 --> 44:36.280
But every time I hear about it, it sounds like it sounds like a great way to go and it is a good intermediary

44:36.280 --> 44:40.400
Yeah, exactly. And it's I mean the proof seems to be in the pudding more and more

44:40.400 --> 44:43.680
There's some great apps and we've been talking about apps in the App Center

44:43.680 --> 44:48.200
but of course elementary OS ships just with a bunch of great apps that are built around this and

44:48.480 --> 44:51.880
Vala already installed out of the out of the ISO

44:52.600 --> 44:54.680
So it's not just the things in the App Center

44:54.680 --> 44:57.320
It's also the apps that have been getting shipped on and revved on now for years

44:57.880 --> 45:02.880
Yeah, and the whole de to our desktop environment is all GTK 3 and Vala

45:02.880 --> 45:07.840
I think I think we use more GTK in our desktop environment than gnome does these days. I

45:07.840 --> 45:09.600
I

45:09.600 --> 45:14.640
Now that I'm back on the 1604 bandwagon like never before I should I should give it another go, Dan

45:14.640 --> 45:18.320
I should really take another look cuz damn if it doesn't all just look super appealing all the time

45:18.320 --> 45:24.120
I like it and I'm liking 1604 a lot. It can't am I allowed to talk about that? Is that okay?

45:24.120 --> 45:28.960
Okay, can I talk about well, so last week I I admitted that

45:30.240 --> 45:33.600
after the whole 1710 excitement was over I ended up going back to

45:33.600 --> 45:40.400
Ubuntu 1604 and then realizing that unity 7 was actually pretty great for my particular use case and

45:40.880 --> 45:42.880
Then like a madman

45:43.000 --> 45:50.360
Proceeded to just wipe all my systems and put up into and unity 7 with the exception of the OBS machine just because the capture

45:50.360 --> 45:51.240
cards

45:51.240 --> 45:54.080
and I'm all in and it's um

45:54.680 --> 45:58.400
I'm loving it and I I think it's the new XFCE and

45:59.080 --> 46:00.420
I

46:00.420 --> 46:03.920
Thought I would get a truckload of shit for saying that last week

46:03.920 --> 46:10.240
I was really expecting people to harp on me and I got a ton of people saying they were doing the same

46:10.600 --> 46:18.560
Thing and they agreed really? Yeah way more than I expected. Yeah on all the all the feedback mechanisms. It was really

46:20.040 --> 46:23.520
Surprising to me. It was like when I admitted that I like nano more than vim

46:23.520 --> 46:27.040
I you know vim and I keep my vim skills active

46:27.040 --> 46:32.640
But if I'm if I'm choosing I just prefer I prefer nano

46:32.640 --> 46:37.120
I like the bottom area of nano where it just lays out the commands for me gotta hit them

46:37.120 --> 46:41.480
I know that it prints. I just don't know how to use it. Oh, yeah. Yeah, and then of course and me

46:41.480 --> 46:46.880
I'm a nanotech w that's I'm a nanotech w guy and I've been rocking that now for you know

46:46.880 --> 46:48.600
Everybody always says here's the bullshit

46:48.600 --> 46:57.280
Here's the bullshit emacs vim propaganda that you get fed as a sysadmin is every server you log into is always gonna have VI

46:57.280 --> 47:02.880
So you just learn VI. Well, you know what? That's not true. Every server has vim first of all second of all

47:03.520 --> 47:09.560
second of all it I have yet to meet a system that doesn't have like nano or pico or or

47:10.160 --> 47:16.000
Joe or some other non vim editor. I just I don't I don't work on those systems

47:16.000 --> 47:21.000
I know there's systems out there. I understand that I don't work on those systems. Sure. And so I've always had nano

47:21.000 --> 47:23.400
I've always enjoyed it. I've always thought it's been pretty great

47:23.400 --> 47:26.000
and so one day on the show I finally came out and I said I

47:26.160 --> 47:30.400
Like nano and I'm a nano user and I got a ton of people that said I also like nano

47:30.400 --> 47:33.440
and I'm not saying Vim's bad or emacs and

47:34.840 --> 47:36.280
Now I'm saying this with unity

47:36.280 --> 47:40.520
I like unity and I think it's pretty good and I'm gonna use it for a while

47:40.520 --> 47:43.120
And I thought I thought it'd be the same thing

47:43.120 --> 47:48.560
I get flamed ton of people came back ton of telling people came Joe Collins made a YouTube video about it on his YouTube channel

47:48.560 --> 47:55.620
About how he's going to you know, he's sticking with 1604 in unity. There's something about the LTS releases is when you when you

47:56.960 --> 48:03.960
When you become an LTS user West you realize that all the other releases are just beta tests for the LTS

48:03.960 --> 48:13.240
And they can call it 1710, but it really should be called 1804 beta. Yeah, where's that ding soundboard effect? Oh, oh

48:13.400 --> 48:15.080
Man, I don't know what's happened to me

48:15.080 --> 48:17.960
I feel like I feel like I've had some sort of like a

48:18.280 --> 48:23.080
Psychedelic Linux experience and I've come out on the other side of it as a changed man is what happened to me

48:23.080 --> 48:25.080
You'll be back large drug in six months

48:28.000 --> 48:33.160
Unity there's one gripe that I cannot accept that there's a lot of its desktop

48:33.160 --> 48:38.520
Functionality is implemented in Python and that's against my morals

48:39.200 --> 48:41.120
Yeah, I can you know, I can see it

48:41.120 --> 48:45.960
I can see switching for moral reasons and I tell you what if if I felt like that ever caused it to be slow

48:45.960 --> 48:52.760
Or pokey or crashy I'd probably bail but so far. Yeah, you wouldn't care what was making it slower crashy. You just get out

48:52.760 --> 48:56.360
Oh, yeah, the old XFC menu. It was based on

48:56.360 --> 49:03.120
Python no, it wasn't the XFC menu. It was that desktop that was recently implemented in C

49:03.160 --> 49:05.160
But it wasn't Python before

49:06.560 --> 49:09.720
Goodness gracious does anyone remember? No

49:10.920 --> 49:14.960
Okay. Anyway, I might have been a budgie. It might have been the budgie men. Oh, yeah

49:14.960 --> 49:17.760
It used to be a mint menu. Okay mint menu is based on Python

49:17.760 --> 49:24.000
They re-implemented it in C and it was way faster. Sure. I think but he's bitten written in every language

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Yeah, that's

49:28.800 --> 49:33.120
Minimum and then you I can only hope unity goes down in flames, but I like nano

49:33.120 --> 49:39.240
You know it as long as it's all small batch organically sourced 100% locally produced code

49:39.440 --> 49:46.340
I'm okay with that. I would like to try unity and the new gnome with the Ubuntu shell. Yeah on the same system

49:46.360 --> 49:49.800
I haven't done. Yeah, like do a little a B skis. Yes, that's I

49:49.800 --> 49:53.520
Used unity at work all the time. I'm kind of like, okay. I wonder maybe I should try that

49:54.000 --> 50:00.520
Try the new version out. See what that looks like. I feel like unity's faster having ran it on some of the same systems, but

50:01.320 --> 50:04.240
Then again, what do I know? What do you what the hell do I know?

50:04.480 --> 50:07.920
There's something about the fact that my doc isn't some extension

50:09.200 --> 50:15.140
QML JavaScript, you know the quick like that doc here in unity. I don't know. It just feels really solid

50:15.160 --> 50:17.160
It doesn't ever flicker. It doesn't ever

50:17.160 --> 50:20.480
You saying you want to flicker in unity plug-in?

50:20.480 --> 50:25.360
So I've just been on the gnome desktop long enough where my doc's just totally taking a shit. It's gone away and then I'm like

50:25.360 --> 50:26.600
oh, so

50:26.600 --> 50:28.480
Right. Okay, so I don't have that anymore

50:28.480 --> 50:33.320
and then and then what it was is of course it was well gnome updated and the

50:33.820 --> 50:39.400
Doc I had installed was from the repo but the repo package for the doc extension hadn't been updated yet

50:39.600 --> 50:44.360
so I updated the gnome desktop the extension so then I had to uninstall the

50:44.360 --> 50:51.480
Distros version of the extent of the extension then go to then then go then go to the gnome extensions website and

50:51.560 --> 50:56.840
Install the extension separately see if you just don't install the doc extension then that's all right

50:57.320 --> 51:01.840
But I take your point. I find it particularly useful just to have my sets of icons right there

51:01.840 --> 51:05.400
I don't you know, I'm not a big doc guy. I doesn't have to be a bar. It doesn't have to be a doc

51:05.400 --> 51:07.360
I don't care what you call it. Just call whatever you want

51:07.360 --> 51:09.360
I can't don't have to get bigger when you hover on them

51:09.760 --> 51:14.140
Microsoft got it right in Windows 7 when they added the quick launch down there. Yeah, they got it, right

51:14.140 --> 51:16.140
and I

51:16.720 --> 51:23.040
Ever since that I essentially try to get that and I just want I want my launcher and my searcher and I want my quick

51:23.040 --> 51:24.720
launch icons and

51:24.720 --> 51:28.720
That's what I go for and unity 7 does a pretty good job with that in a way that doesn't make me feel like I'm using

51:28.720 --> 51:32.920
Windows at all, but still gives me that same kind of functionality. So it doesn't really make me think about it

51:32.920 --> 51:39.100
That's what I like because that's the problem with mate and both with XFCE is like I'm like using Windows over here

51:39.100 --> 51:40.600
I'm using Windows again

51:40.600 --> 51:45.240
Digital ocean comm go over there and create an account and then use our promo code do

51:45.720 --> 51:50.200
Unplugged you get a $10 credit and and with that $10 credit you could try their

51:50.600 --> 51:55.560
object storage for two months for free so you can stack them and I don't know what maybe build some sort of

51:55.880 --> 52:00.680
Media empire in like two months because with digital ocean you got their fast connection

52:00.680 --> 52:03.280
You got their dashboard for days. You can deploy in seconds

52:03.320 --> 52:07.200
everything's SSDs and you can choose the distro that best suits you or

52:07.200 --> 52:15.040
Or even Alan Jude's free BSD and for me besides the object storage the block storage is it's just great

52:15.040 --> 52:17.160
It's been around for a while and what I love about it

52:17.680 --> 52:21.160
Is it shows up to the operating system as if it was just a block device?

52:21.240 --> 52:26.960
So you can look in d-message you'll see it show up there and then you can go in FS tab and you can actually just

52:26.960 --> 52:30.160
Mount it to a folder on your file system and it's just like dev

52:30.160 --> 52:33.200
So can we install Gentoo on that thing? Is that our solution?

52:33.200 --> 52:37.880
Boom boom, you know, I am thinking maybe you're not up for this challenge anymore

52:39.760 --> 52:43.520
We'll see maybe you're the one that's supposed to be looking into that right now, that's true

52:44.280 --> 52:50.260
Google that for us. Okay back to digital ocean digital ocean's also got monitoring and alerting and they have team support

52:50.360 --> 52:53.160
Which is really great and then they got private networking

52:53.200 --> 52:58.080
Which is fantastic because it doesn't count against your transfer when you use that private network

52:58.080 --> 53:02.320
And that's great for like proxies or if you got a database or a backup server

53:02.320 --> 53:05.800
Which I should probably do that. I should probably do that

53:05.800 --> 53:09.520
I've got a new digital ocean droplet that has some pretty important data on there

53:09.520 --> 53:14.560
So I even put that out on the public net just put put on the private one and then just let my droplets talk to

53:14.560 --> 53:18.120
Each other digital ocean comm use our promo code do unplugged

53:19.160 --> 53:25.480
Create the account apply that get the $10 credit and then you're off to the races digital ocean comm promo code do unplug

53:25.480 --> 53:31.200
Hugged yeah, I wonder if you could do you think you could do you think you get that?

53:31.200 --> 53:34.680
You think you get that gentoo working on a droplet. I'm right. I'll give it a shot

53:34.680 --> 53:39.160
That's me. You could do that. Yeah, that would be pretty interesting. I would say it'd be interesting to try it

53:39.160 --> 53:42.560
I was thinking of EM, but a triplet would be pretty dang cool

53:43.120 --> 53:45.300
It'd be pretty cool. Okay, so

53:46.120 --> 53:47.960
There is a story

53:47.960 --> 53:49.080
That we're going there

53:49.080 --> 53:54.160
We're gonna go to and I want to be really careful because this thing is gonna have big ramifications

53:54.160 --> 54:00.280
and it's one of these stories that is very easily turned into clickbait and it's very easily gonna

54:01.000 --> 54:04.840
It's gonna be it's be it'd be simple to set the tone of the conversation in the wrong direction

54:05.080 --> 54:09.960
On this particular story and I think it's too important of a story for that, but I also I

54:10.840 --> 54:15.800
Don't want to ignore important things that are going on just because I'm afraid of screwing up the discussion

54:16.440 --> 54:18.440
so we're gonna start with

54:18.480 --> 54:21.280
what's going on between the Software Freedom Law Center and

54:21.280 --> 54:28.680
The Software Freedom Conservancy two separate projects. I'm gonna refer to them as Law Center and Conservancy just to try to get yeah

54:28.680 --> 54:33.800
That's that's a good idea. Yeah, the background between these two organizations is the

54:35.120 --> 54:40.160
They well by all public appearances seemed to be two cooperative organizations

54:40.160 --> 54:46.680
In fact, the Law Center helped establish the Conservancy early on was involved with that process and provided counsel

54:46.680 --> 54:51.480
So they've been working they had a publicly appeared to be working in tandem

54:52.520 --> 54:54.440
for quite some time

54:54.440 --> 55:01.360
I don't know exactly about the people running the two different organizations if they were working in tandem necessarily, but we'll get to that perhaps

55:02.600 --> 55:04.600
on September 21st

55:04.600 --> 55:05.800
2017

55:05.800 --> 55:13.020
Eben Moglen on the Software Freedom Law Center's blog posted a rather long post that addressed IRS

55:13.020 --> 55:20.360
Service changes now under the Trump administration versus the Obama administration and it restructured

55:21.660 --> 55:22.700
how

55:22.700 --> 55:28.540
the Software Freedom Law Center could move around essentially provide services for open source projects and

55:29.180 --> 55:34.060
in this they they say this is game-changing for them and that the

55:34.460 --> 55:41.220
they have they've been waiting for these developments and that the gives them and their clients the best of both worlds that

55:41.220 --> 55:43.940
essentially, there's a new market that's going to be opening up for the

55:44.580 --> 55:47.780
Freedom Law Center, they don't really kind of give any more detail than that

55:48.740 --> 55:52.340
But shortly after that, I think it was on the 27th of September

55:52.900 --> 55:56.620
We have more details concise and accurate details in this week's Linux action news

55:59.100 --> 56:02.460
The Law Center sent a trademark

56:02.460 --> 56:09.100
Notice to not not to not to the Conservancy

56:09.100 --> 56:15.620
but like the patent office saying or whatever the trademark office saying we're concerned that there's confusion between the Software Freedom Law Center and

56:16.540 --> 56:21.540
The Software Freedom Conservancy and I agree there is there is some confusion between the names

56:21.540 --> 56:25.180
It is hard to to keep them straight. That's why I'm trying to say Law Center and Conservancy

56:25.900 --> 56:27.020
and

56:27.020 --> 56:31.340
It appeared that perhaps the Law Center was sort of gearing itself up to become more competitive

56:31.340 --> 56:38.620
Then on Friday, November 3rd fast forward to Friday, November 3rd the Software Freedom Conservancy the

56:39.580 --> 56:44.820
Which I believe is probably Karen Sandler and Bradley Coon. I think is his last name probably co-wrote this

56:44.820 --> 56:48.700
I'm not sure but it's the staff they have they have assigned the staff and

56:49.260 --> 56:55.060
They write a month ago the Software Freedom Law Center the non the not-for-profit law firm which launched the Conservancy in

56:55.060 --> 57:01.260
2006 took the step of filing a legal action in the United States Patent and Trademark Office seeking

57:01.420 --> 57:05.460
cancellation of the Conservancy's trademark for our name the Software Freedom Conservancy

57:08.020 --> 57:11.660
And they say in here that this is this is really weird because you know

57:11.660 --> 57:19.380
We're all where the community has recently all come together and decided that we're all about taking every other approach first before legal action

57:19.380 --> 57:22.620
that's what the Linux kernel enforcement statement was recently about and

57:22.620 --> 57:27.940
They say yes, we sometimes disagree publicly about policy issues

57:28.420 --> 57:32.740
But we're both sort of working for the same interests. So they were disappointed that

57:33.420 --> 57:40.500
essentially public resources or community resources were being wasted on this action and it didn't really sound like there was any attempt to work with

57:40.500 --> 57:46.180
Them it sounded like on September. Oh September 22nd that when when the petition was filed

57:46.180 --> 57:52.660
That the process just started there was no communication before that is what is what the impression you would get by reading this

57:53.260 --> 57:58.780
They say yesterday we provided an answer that defends the of the list of defenses that we plan to use

58:00.840 --> 58:04.260
Now the element of this is this really something is this post was made

58:05.380 --> 58:12.220
During an event that was being held by the law center that the the the people that are filing the petition

58:12.220 --> 58:15.140
That's when this post went live was during this event and

58:15.700 --> 58:20.140
My understanding is Karen was at that event. She she was there when this went public

58:23.420 --> 58:25.420
Now the Conservancy is

58:26.140 --> 58:27.660
home to about

58:27.660 --> 58:31.340
46 member projects and you have to understand that this is

58:32.060 --> 58:38.380
This isn't just membership. This is sort of like a governance a financial financial governance and

58:38.380 --> 58:44.100
Copyright governance the copyright can be transferred in some cases and maybe all cases to the Conservancy

58:45.940 --> 58:47.940
So this is an umbrella

58:48.100 --> 58:53.700
Organization that is essentially home to some of the intellectual assets for these open source projects

58:53.700 --> 58:56.700
And there's a bunch on their list core boots on the list

58:57.540 --> 59:00.860
Debbie and copyright aggression project ether pad is on the list

59:00.860 --> 59:04.740
That's where a bunch of closure projects are hosted get is on the list

59:04.740 --> 59:08.900
The GPL compliance project for linux developers is on the list homebrew inkscape

59:10.140 --> 59:17.300
There's a lot on this list. There's you know, it's a php my admin is on here outreach eqm you Samba

59:19.380 --> 59:26.380
Some pretty important projects that this is essentially the home for this is the this is the legal structure for the copyright holder

59:26.820 --> 59:28.820
Wine is also on that list

59:29.620 --> 59:31.620
And so it's surprising that

59:31.620 --> 59:37.260
That even Mowgli's organization who used to be part of the Free Software Foundation that ended about a year ago

59:37.980 --> 59:42.620
Rather quietly that his organization who's funded by the linux foundation

59:44.580 --> 59:49.300
Would be aggressively going after the Conservancy for trademark violation

59:50.060 --> 59:53.420
When they helped them set up the organization in the first place

59:54.140 --> 59:57.140
The law center helped launch the conservancy

59:57.140 --> 01:00:07.140
in 2006 and they served as the Conservancy's law firm until 2011 and never had any trademark issue during this time

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:14.140
That seems pretty bizarre that seems pretty bizarre doesn't it

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:21.700
And people are raising all kinds of conspiracy theories because the law centers one of the law centers funders

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:29.460
Is the linux foundation and one of the linux foundation's biggest members is VMware and one of the companies that the Conservancy is actively going after

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.460
For GPL violation is VMware

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:40.500
So some people have drawn conspiracies there, although I wouldn't necessarily put any stock in any of that and I would say we should all definitely

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:46.020
Wait until way more information comes out because this really could come down to personality nuances

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:56.020
Between the people that run these different organizations because on Monday our rather bizarre post was made by the software freedom law center

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:58.020
By even Moglen's organization

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:03.020
And it's hostile. It's it's aggressive and it's

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:09.020
It feels like unnecessary like they would have been better saying nothing. I'll read a few highlights

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:17.020
So the law center responds to the blog post made by the Conservancy on Friday

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:27.020
And they write on Friday we were while we were putting on our annual conference at Columbia Law School a puff of near apocalyptic rhetoric about us was published

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:33.020
By the software freedom law center's former employees Karen Sandler

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:41.020
And Bradley Coon who now manage the Conservancy which was originally established and wholly funded by the law center and still bears our name

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:45.020
We were busy with our conference when this happened which seems to have been the point

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:53.020
We were glad to have the chance now after a little much needed rest to help everyone avoid unnecessary hyperventilation

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:57.020
And then they go into several different things

01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:05.020
They claim that they attempted to make some contact they say we've asked intermediaries friends business associates comrades in the free software movement

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:12.020
Other alumni of the law center to stress to Bradley and Karen the importance of opening negotiations

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:18.020
One would think that this unless one would think this was unnecessary with people who talk so frequently about the importance of communication

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:21.020
And opening connections with respect to compliance

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:31.020
And enforcement but there when the shoe is on the other foot no efforts on our part have gotten us the slightest progress and bringing about discussions to resolve these differences

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:41.020
Friday's response to the Conservancy's management is grossly disproportionate and in view of their long maintained refusal to communicate with us irresponsible

01:02:41.020 --> 01:03:01.020
The entire piece and all of the outrage hangs on one thing and that is supposedly Karen and Bradley always said they were too busy or always too busy these are direct quotes to have time to talk

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:06.020
Sometimes we were not with sometimes we have not even been offered so much as the courtesy of refusal

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:20.020
But when wouldn't a law center know that they should probably be talking to the lawyers of the Conservancy shouldn't be lawyer to lawyer shouldn't they be reaching out to the representation of the Conservancy not to Karen and Bradley directly

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:28.020
Well I'm not so sure because if they filed the trademark action I imagine that would involve the lawyers right like you don't have to call the other law firm if you file a petition in court court delivers

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:44.020
But if you're so hell-bent on establishing communication before this action wouldn't you have tried to reach out to the representation you would think so yeah yeah I don't know what do I know it's really you know me all right but this is

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:57.020
This is one of these messes that on the surface looks like the law center wants to be in a new market and essentially take over the Conservancy's gig which it felt like it wasn't capable of doing because of rules

01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:10.020
That they as they put the Obama administration put into place that tied their hands and so it was necessary for them to create these umbrella organizations like the Conservancy out of out of these restrictive IRS rules

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:19.020
And now now that Trump's in and all these guys are out new guys are in these rules are gone and so we don't need the Conservancy anymore we don't need them

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:31.020
So let's just have everybody come back over here to law center and we'll be your representation will be your copyright holder will be your umbrella organization will be a one-stop shop everybody's happy the only problem is people don't understand it because the name differences

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:42.020
So let's just get them to change their name so we can compete it's what it seems like on surface to some people and that is dirty because the reality is the Conservancy the software freedom Conservancy

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:56.020
Should be something that is not subject to the political whims of the United States when when the when the political what they call it pendulum swings to the other side and different people come in running the IRS then what are we going to do

01:04:56.020 --> 01:05:09.020
Then the Conservancy will matter and when you have projects like wine that have been around for decades they're going to they don't want to be swung around by the different politics of the US and and moved around all the time the Conservancy offers a stability

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:34.020
And a home that is safe and from that political turmoil it's part of the whole spirit of the open source projects that we want to support in this thing and the you know the thing is like the Conservancy and I'm I you know I really don't have a dog in this hunt but just going off recent news the Conservancy seems to have been working with Colonel developers to come up with this enforcement statement statement that everybody seems to like and the thrust of it was legal action as a last resort

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:46.020
Which having talked to people who write Colonel code that's what they want that's what the people who write the Colonel want is they want legal action as a last resort only to be initiated when other community efforts have failed.

01:05:46.020 --> 01:06:01.020
That's what people making stuff want and if that and if that's what the Conservancy is also agreeing to then they seem to be representing the wishes of the Colonel developers and that seems to be a good thing in my estimation seems to be like the Conservancy had recently just made a good move and then.

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:05.020
Now this whole thing's breaking.

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:18.020
It's really it's really it's really interesting and I I don't want to speculate much because I think I feel like we've done plenty I've tried to represent what everybody's different theories are on this while still giving you the base fundamentals of when these things all went down.

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:37.020
I wouldn't I if I could give anybody any advice on this story don't participate in speculation online don't don't stoke these conspiracy fires because this stuff is all going to be an a long suit so super boring legal process that will eventually all be played out for us.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:55.020
And it'll all be documented what exactly happened and we don't need to speculate if we're just patient the information of it'll eventually just tell the story the terror the story will tell itself and so I encourage all of us to try to tone down the speculation tone down the rhetoric or the clickbait.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:07:12.020
What do you call it you know if you people are going to be incentivized to tweet and blog post and make YouTube videos about this story and I encourage people not to do it because it's it's a nothing story so far it could literally come down to personality conflicts at the end of the day and it could represent tearing up tons of open source projects.

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:14.020
So there's a lot of better stuff to talk about.

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:28.020
Yeah. But the thing is we can talk about it but we can also just wait it'll all play out in the courts and everything will be right there in public record for us to review and we don't have to speculate if we're just patient. So that would be my be my advice said my piece.

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:30.020
I think it's a fascinating story.

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:45.020
Yeah right. I mean it's certainly important but like there's going to be enough bad and maybe good coverage of it there's going to be plenty of drama and other things that come out of it for better or worse probably worse. And so we pay attention but we don't have to create a whole hype machine.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:08:01.020
In the meantime I just hope the open source projects of these different organizations represent aren't screwed up with this I hope you know they're like their money isn't taking from from protecting or financing them or running them I hope that those funds don't have to be like redirected to fight this kind of thing like I hope nothing like that happens.

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:04.020
That's what I hope for. And then we just sit back and wait.

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:16.020
But if anybody in the number wanted to chime in you or have any questions because I know that was a lot to kind of unpack again I'll just make another plug for Linux action news because we did a much better job just breaking it down concisely and accurately.

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:30.020
But the development the response post wasn't out when we recorded Linux action news the software the law center the software freedom law centers post was wasn't posted until Monday.

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:38.020
Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. OK. Yeah. You good. You good. Yeah I'm good. You good. I'm good.

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:49.020
It's it's rough stuff. That's rough stuff. That's why I said we're going to have this really cool app pick at the end of the episode because this thing's not only is it look beautiful runs on the terminal but it helps you kick your Linux box.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:09:02.020
Box boxes but there somewhere I can speak I swear we're kicking but that's what matters. But it's gonna be kicked. It's a way to stress test your system. I know we have someone in our discord room who has a new oryx on the way.

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:07.020
And so this will be a great pick for him because he can throw this on his new oryx and kick the tires.

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:23.020
And then I'll just show you. I'll show you anyways. So let's let's take a moment and thank Ting for sponsoring the unplugged program go to Linux.Ting.com Linux.Ting.com $25 off a device or if you bring a device they'll give you $25 in service credit.

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:27.020
Nice. CDMA and GSM networks. So you can probably bring a device.

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:31.020
I'm a GSM guy myself. I have been for a long time now.

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:34.020
But I started out on CDMA and there's nothing wrong with that.

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:40.020
See people when they listen like CDMA what does it matter with you guys. Guys in the Pacific Northwest we got a lot of trees.

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.020
So many trees.

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:48.020
CDMA can punch through those trees in a way that GSM just does not seem to. I can't I can't explain it. I'm not a I'm not Neil deGrasse Tyson.

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:53.020
I can't explain it. But I can tell you this. You can play around. You just go to Linux.Ting.com to try it out.

01:09:53.020 --> 01:10:00.020
You pay for what you use six dollars a month for the line and then your usage and Uncle Sam's cut.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:06.020
Whatever that might be in your area. He's got to always get his piece Wes.

01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:09.020
But that's why he's going to pay his Ting bill.

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:12.020
You know what I'm saying though. That's why you got to start with the six dollar a month line.

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:19.020
Because that's just like that is at that price level where if I get that on a MiFi and I don't use it much one month I'm not feeling too guilty about that.

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:22.020
And the fact that I don't have to worry about how many minutes I may or may not use.

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:27.020
I love that. And they've got a great dashboard to manage it all. Tons of nice devices you can buy directly.

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:33.020
And then the best customer service in the whole industry. Check it out. Linux.Ting.com.

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:37.020
Big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the unplugged program.

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:42.020
All right. So it's stress terminal UI. It's kind of a it's kind of a complicated name.

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:48.020
So just shorten that to s t u i s dash t u i and it's nice looking.

01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:53.020
Now I don't want to trigger I don't want to trigger heaven because it may be written in Python.

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:58.020
I didn't double check before I put it in. You install via pip. I'm sorry heaven.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:02.020
I didn't mean to trigger you but I didn't realize that but it is a Python app.

01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:07.020
But it's a command line Python app not a gooey Python app. So is that. Are you cooler with that.

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:13.020
Are we good. He's not talking to me now. You see that. That's how many he's cursing in the background.

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.020
It's funny so many won't talk to me now. Unbelievable.

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:19.020
So the stress terminal UI for your CPU is a great little way to.

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:28.020
Not only do you get CPU information but you get temperature and power usage information all visually graphed and represented for you.

01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:32.020
You display the performance dips that are caused by thermal modeling monitoring.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:41.020
Like you can actually see like when thermal when thermal like limits get hit you can really see it on this graph which is really cool for testing laptops.

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:44.020
That's why I mentioned the or interesting. Yeah that's not something a lot of other tools really highlight.

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:50.020
No you might see it like something like the XPS 13 or maybe the Gallego but you're I don't think you're going to see that on the Oryx at all.

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:53.020
You may not see it on other systems too but you can always try and find out.

01:11:53.020 --> 01:12:06.020
And then they have a stress operation mode for really just running the CPU into the ground for as long as possible which I kind of like that too when I'm trying to get a laptop really hot to feel like get a sense of what the fan noise is like for a review.

01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:09.020
It's pretty cool. And you can also turn off different areas that you don't want to see.

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:17.020
So if you just want a nice simple display and you have this is the thing that really I think makes it look the best is it has this fancy graph smoothing option.

01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:23.020
And I just something about really smooth fancy graphs on the command on the command line dude.

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.020
You know what I'm all about it. I just can't help it.

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:32.020
You start putting pretty graphs like that on a command line all of a sudden it like it's like the future meets my childhood and I can't help but love it.

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:40.020
So S-TUI and it's available via PIP and it could be a fun way to kick tires on a VPS too. It doesn't have to be like a laptop.

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.020
Oh yeah. Super easy to get going. Here we go.

01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:44.020
Oh dude it looks really good on there.

01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.020
It does look really nice.

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:48.020
That's with the window all maximized like that it looks even better.

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:50.020
Purple bars.

01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:54.020
I got to say this is probably one of the slickest looking end curses I've ever seen.

01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:57.020
I'm going to have to take a look at the look at the source there.

01:12:57.020 --> 01:13:02.020
They've done a really impressive job. That was actually what originally drew it to me and then I was like gosh I always am looking for ways.

01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:09.020
I have like a I have like a little toolbox now of ways that I abuse review systems that are just like torture chamber tools.

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:12.020
Well you want to know. You know you only have a short time with the system.

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:18.020
I do. And I should give a I should give a plug to the open benchmark site and the Ferronix test suite because isn't that just the funniest thing.

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:25.020
You open that up and you go to the game section and sure enough if he's not keeping that thing pretty update to like most recent games.

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:34.020
As whole automated scripts will download it from steam and install it on your system and then play the game for a little bit and benchmark the whole damn thing like geez Louise.

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:38.020
If there isn't just an incredible incredible amount of work into that Ferronix test suite.

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:42.020
That's true. That's another way to bang on your system a little bit but this is just a nice quick way.

01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:47.020
You could just load this if you got Python already on your system and it'd be easy to do on a VPS too.

01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:50.020
Oh which I like that so and it just looks so good.

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:53.020
I should kind of a weird name.

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:55.020
Stewie?

01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:59.020
I should put it on my yeah I should put it on my X to go system and just keep it going for a while and see how that does.

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.020
See how it see how it performs.

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:05.020
Boy that does seem like a nice way to like maybe benchmark some different VPS things.

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:12.020
Maybe it's just like a backwards Family Guy reference and it's just Stewie.

01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:14.020
Terminal user interface.

01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:16.020
Yeah let's do I do like Stewie. That's it. That's a good way.

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:19.020
Sounds like a user interface designed to stress the user.

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:21.020
Yeah we should that we already have that perfected.

01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:25.020
So I think we're looking at the recording right now.

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.020
Yeah.

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:31.020
We're definitely so we're trying to come up with a way to do the Gentoo challenge.

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.020
We're going to we're going to really try to get it in the show.

01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:36.020
We are going to try to get to this. We're going to try to get this in the show.

01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:38.020
It's going to take forever man.

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:40.020
So but we have we have an approach we're working on.

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.020
I don't think we've totally nailed it down yet.

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:44.020
We were discussing the pre show.

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:47.020
So if you joined us live you kind of heard what our current thoughts are.

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:53.020
And so after the show Wes and I are going to compare notes and see which way we think would be the best to pull it off.

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:57.020
And then we have hopefully by next week's episode we'll have our game plan for the Gentoo.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.020
I'm excited.

01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:03.020
But I think what we should plan for for the focus of next week.

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:07.020
So it's not going to be the Gentoo review but we're going to tell you our plan for the Gentoo review next week.

01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:08.020
See what we're doing here.

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.020
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.020
I don't.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:11.020
You know what what happened was.

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:14.020
Listen we'll call this a stage zero install.

01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:15.020
Yeah that's right.

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:26.020
So here's the thing is this like New York thing happened and then like this Ubuntu 1710 thing happened and then next Tuesday the Fedora 27 lands.

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.020
So I feel like we're going to have to talk about Fedora.

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:29.020
That's next week.

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:31.020
Next week's episode we got to talk Fedora 27.

01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:34.020
So I'm going to be installing that to give that a go.

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.020
Back on to Gnome for one week.

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:38.020
I don't know what system I want to take off of Unity though.

01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:40.020
I've got to go through that whole thing now.

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.020
It's going to be rough.

01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:43.020
It's going to be so rough.

01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:44.020
You're going to hate it.

01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:47.020
So if you get a chance Wes install Fedora 27 the next few days.

01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:48.020
Yeah. All right.

01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:49.020
Kick the tires a little bit.

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:50.020
We'll talk about it on next week's episode.

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:51.020
I always love installing a new Fedora release.

01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:56.020
And that invite extends to the virtual lug and those of you listening on your own.

01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:05.020
If you want to check out Fedora 27 before episode 223 kick the tires with us and then we'll all come back and compare notes and talk about it or listen along.

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:06.020
It'll be like a co-review.

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:07.020
You like that?

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:08.020
I like that a lot.

01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:11.020
So we have a Discord room dedicated to this show now.

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:16.020
Go to Discord.me slash Jupiter Colony for the main link to the server.

01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:18.020
And then once you get in there look for the Linux Unplugged channel.

01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:22.020
And I'll mention in this because we're using this during our live shows.

01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:28.020
So even if you can't make it live you can still go back after the show and see some of the stuff people talked about.

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:29.020
Some of the links people shared.

01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:32.020
And you know maybe beat new community members too that might still be there.

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.020
It's like a live archive.

01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:34.020
Yeah.

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.020
Yeah.

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:39.020
So it's kind of a cool way if you see something go by the video that you want or if you just want to check it in.

01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:43.020
If you listen to the audio version you're like I want to just go see what the Discord room is talking about.

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:44.020
You can go over there.

01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:45.020
We do still have that mumble room.

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.020
We're still doing mumble for the audio.

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:50.020
That's where our virtual lug still at is on our mumble server.

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:53.020
So still totally looking for people to join us there every single week.

01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:54.020
Please. Yeah.

01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:55.020
All right.

01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:58.020
Guys is there anything else we want to include in this week's episode?

01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:59.020
I don't think so.

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.020
Well very good.

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:02.020
Where should people find you throughout the week Mr. YS?

01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:03.020
At Westpane.

01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:04.020
You crazy SOB.

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.020
That's me.

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.020
Also check him out on the TechSnap program.

01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:07.020
Oh please do.

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:08.020
What about you Beardsley?

01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:09.020
Wrecked and done it.

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:10.020
There you go.

01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:11.020
Nice and simple.

01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:12.020
Easy peasy.

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:14.020
Find me tomorrow on the Unfilter Show.

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:17.020
Going to be a huge show.

01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:18.020
Huge huge show.

01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.020
You better be preparing right now.

01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:21.020
And then I'm going to share a little rust shenanigans.

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:24.020
A little rust shenanigans in User Air.

01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:27.020
So check out User Air this week if you're curious about that and it's a lot of fun.

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:32.020
Otherwise just grab our live time over on our calendar page and then join us next week if you can.

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:39.020
Otherwise grab the feed and we'll see you then.

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:16.020
I think it's wasted effort.

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:18.020
Who snuck him in there?

01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:19.020
Let's figure out this, Todd.

01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:20.020
We've got to get this thing figured out.

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:21.020
Oh gosh we do.

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:22.020
Come on now.

01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:23.020
We've got to get this.

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:24.020
Let's get this thing printed out.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:25.020
Let's get it out of here.

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:26.020
It's going to be dark here in just any minute.

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:27.020
Come on now.

01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:28.020
Come on now.

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:29.020
Let's go.

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:30.020
Let's go.

01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:31.020
JBtitles.com.

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:32.020
Perfect.

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:33.020
Fine.

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:36.020
I didn't get a hit of America compiling Gentoo.

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:37.020
Winner winner chicken dinner.

01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:39.020
Winner winner chicken dinner.

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:40.020
Ed is all you need.

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:41.020
Nice.

01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:42.020
Nice.

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:43.020
Dude where's my C?

01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:46.020
The division inside open source.

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:48.020
A community divided.

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:51.020
Token Ring has been killing it with the titles today.

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:52.020
He's getting deep is what he's doing.

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:56.020
He's reaching deep into his emotions and he's coming out with these real winners.

01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:59.020
I do want to do a Windows unplugged.

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:00.020
I'm not going to lie.

01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:02.020
We could do it.

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.020
Conservient rust.

01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:08.020
I was hoping we could just bang this out real quick.

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.020
I know.

01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:10.020
I thought this would be a quick one.

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:11.020
I thought okay this is the week.

01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.020
We're just going to be.

01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:13.020
We came in with a lot of energy.

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:14.020
We get it.

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:15.020
But that didn't work.

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:16.020
That has already backfired I can tell.

01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:17.020
I can already tell.

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:18.020
I'm burned out.

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:19.020
Yeah.

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.020
Yeah.

01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:21.020
We're tapped out.

01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:22.020
We're tapped out.

01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:27.020
Well you and I need to go on a sabbatical for five years and then come back and do one

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:30.020
episode doing just one really good episode and then retire.

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.020
Right?

01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:32.020
I'm in.

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:33.020
I'm in.

01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:34.020
Yeah.

01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:35.020
Done.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.020
I don't think so.

01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:37.020
I don't think it works.

01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:38.020
Maybe I'll buy my own lady jubes.

01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:39.020
Yeah.

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:40.020
There you go.

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:41.020
We'll go caravanning.

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:42.020
Yeah.

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.020
Caravan.

01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:44.020
Actually the dream would be to caravan and still podcast.

01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:48.020
That would be a lot of fun.

01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:50.020
We'll just do road shows the whole time.

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:51.020
That sounds great.

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:52.020
Go around and do Linux meetups.

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:53.020
Either great or entirely exhausting.

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:54.020
Yeah.

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:57.020
We'd be both of those things.
