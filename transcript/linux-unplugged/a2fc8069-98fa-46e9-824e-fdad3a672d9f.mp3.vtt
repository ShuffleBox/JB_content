00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 36 for April 15th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:42.380
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's stuck between two studios.

00:42.380 --> 00:43.380
My name is Chris.

00:43.380 --> 00:44.380
My name is Matt.

00:44.380 --> 00:45.380
Hey Matt.

00:45.380 --> 00:51.360
So I'm, this week I'm recording Linux Unplugged somewhere I've never, ever recorded it before.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.360
So it's a little weird.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.080
So it's gonna, it's gonna, everything's gonna be a little different.

00:55.080 --> 00:59.240
I'm actually in the regular studio that, hi, see I'm right here.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.440
If you're watching the video version, I'm in the regular studio that we do the Linux

01:01.440 --> 01:02.440
action show.

01:02.440 --> 01:06.000
I'm usually not in the studio, but we're this week, we're beginning the transition to our

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
new studio.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
So please forgive, pardon the dust as the old saying goes, because Matt, this week I

01:11.000 --> 01:14.340
still want to try to have a great conversation about something that's sort of been brewing

01:14.340 --> 01:15.600
over the last few episodes.

01:15.600 --> 01:20.320
Last week we had Chase on and he talked about what kind of has been his blockers to switching

01:20.320 --> 01:21.320
to Linux.

01:21.320 --> 01:24.760
And one of the things he talked about is way too much choice and how, how that was really

01:24.760 --> 01:26.480
a big part of the problem.

01:26.480 --> 01:31.920
And I want to sort of just float the idea, playing devil's advocate, if you will, that

01:31.920 --> 01:38.040
maybe suggesting the underdog distro to folks is doing them a disservice and hurting Linux

01:38.040 --> 01:39.040
adoption.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.040
And I want to talk about that.

01:40.040 --> 01:46.480
And then if we have some time after that, I want to discuss that here we are Tuesday

01:46.480 --> 01:51.080
and it is still open source is getting a beating over this Heartbleed bug and everybody is

01:51.080 --> 01:57.600
condemning open source, the model for open source software, your buddy, Paul Throt, took

01:57.600 --> 02:03.040
the web and said that this proves that the all eyes are on the source code philosophy

02:03.040 --> 02:06.960
is bogus and that open source security is not any better.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.920
And it's just, you know, people are piling on.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.120
So if we have time, yeah, I know I've been harping on this one, but I want to talk about

02:12.120 --> 02:13.120
a little bit.

02:13.120 --> 02:17.440
If we get through the underdog distro discussion, that's all first.

02:17.440 --> 02:19.400
So it should be a pretty good show this week.

02:19.400 --> 02:23.720
And you know, the other thing is, too, while we're talking about this underdog situation,

02:23.720 --> 02:28.960
it's kind of in the shadow of Ubuntu 14.04's release, which comes out between now and Linux

02:28.960 --> 02:30.880
action show on Sunday.

02:30.880 --> 02:34.480
And the 14.04 is getting a lot of praise right now.

02:34.480 --> 02:39.640
And it's the epitome of the big dog desktop distro when we talk about underdogs, like

02:39.640 --> 02:44.120
Ubuntu is on the absolute opposite end of that spectrum.

02:44.120 --> 02:48.440
And so this conversation is happening with all of this with their release on Sunday,

02:48.440 --> 02:49.520
and then we're going to have that review.

02:49.520 --> 02:53.200
It's just kind of a very interesting time, so I hope folks stick with us for that.

02:53.200 --> 03:00.280
But I wanted to give a quick, like, you know, just update about GNOME 3.12.

03:00.280 --> 03:05.880
GNOME 3.12 hit the Arch repo stable since Linux action show on Sunday.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.800
And I've got my main machine upgraded to GNOME 3.12 now.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.720
And I wanted to pass along a little helper I found.

03:12.720 --> 03:16.680
If you're having troubles with GNOME Terminal after upgrading to GNOME 3.12 on Arch, I have

03:16.680 --> 03:19.160
a link in the show notes that does a pretty quick fix.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.840
I didn't have any issues.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.120
It runs really good.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.520
GNOME 3.12 runs really great.

03:23.520 --> 03:24.720
I'm really happy with this release.

03:24.720 --> 03:30.240
And you know, one of the things that I've joked about, and I'm kind of actually serious,

03:30.240 --> 03:34.960
is I started using GNOME 3.10 in anticipation of GNOME 3.12.

03:34.960 --> 03:40.480
I was like, I'm going to spend the GNOME 3.10 release, I'm going to spend that time just

03:40.480 --> 03:44.600
like totally learning GNOME, and then I'm going to, I'll be ready, my body will be ready

03:44.600 --> 03:46.460
when GNOME 3.12 lands.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.560
And I think that worked out.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.200
I think that's pretty much where I'm at.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.200
But I'm really happy with it.

03:52.200 --> 03:57.200
And so at the same time, a new Cinnamon release came out this week.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.560
And I'm thinking, well, it's worth checking out.

03:59.560 --> 04:04.440
What I'm really interested in is how is Cinnamon handling these new client-side decorations

04:04.440 --> 04:09.880
that the new GNOME apps, you know, like gEdit and Roller, and a lot of these, Nautilus,

04:09.880 --> 04:14.800
a lot of these apps are, and in some cases, you know, Cinnamon Desktop has their own replacements,

04:14.800 --> 04:19.840
NEMO, for example, to replace Nautilus, but there's, inevitably, on a Cinnamon Desktop

04:19.840 --> 04:24.920
now, you're going to run a GTK app that has these client-side decorations, these new toolbars

04:24.920 --> 04:25.920
that GNOME apps have.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.320
And I'm really curious how that works, because I know they did some kind of support in the

04:30.320 --> 04:35.520
new version of Cinnamon to support client-side decorations, but I'm not really, I'm not really

04:35.520 --> 04:38.960
hip on how it actually works, I haven't tried it yet myself.

04:38.960 --> 04:44.440
And then on the other side of all that, you know, I should grab the person's name, because

04:44.440 --> 04:49.720
I don't know if it's the same guy, or if it's a couple of people, but they have been awesome

04:49.720 --> 04:54.460
at submitting the KDE Design Group's Monday updates to our subreddit, like, they're just

04:54.460 --> 04:58.160
on it, yeah, so, Euro Topman, is that you?

04:58.160 --> 04:59.880
Are you out there, Euro Topman?

04:59.880 --> 05:02.360
I don't know if you're the guy that's been doing all of them, but I want to thank you,

05:02.360 --> 05:06.160
because it's really been helping me keep in touch with what the KDE Design Group is up

05:06.160 --> 05:10.200
to, remember we had their lead designer on last couple weeks ago.

05:10.200 --> 05:14.800
When he unveiled their, kind of the prototype, this is a mock-up, or, I don't know, not a

05:14.800 --> 05:19.640
mock-up, because there's actual code out there you can get, but this is an early design iteration,

05:19.640 --> 05:22.920
it's very flat, Matt, I don't know if you had a chance to look at the new KDE design

05:22.920 --> 05:25.760
shots, but some people in our subreddit are calling it very metro-looking.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.760
Oh, really?

05:26.760 --> 05:30.000
No, I haven't actually had a chance to look at them yet.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.400
They're very, I think they're very nice, as somebody who's enjoying GNOME 3.12 right now,

05:34.400 --> 05:36.680
I think these actually look pretty great.

05:36.680 --> 05:40.800
I'll put a link to this in the show notes, but it's a brand new theme that they're working

05:40.800 --> 05:44.240
on, it's not going to replace any other themes, it's just going to be an option.

05:44.240 --> 05:48.560
I think it's the cleanest-looking KDE theme I've ever seen.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.840
I don't know, what say you, chatroom?

05:50.840 --> 05:55.920
I'm curious what you guys think, but it's just a very interesting time right now for

05:55.920 --> 06:03.760
all of this stuff, because we've got the latest version of Unity launches on the 17th, KDE's

06:03.760 --> 06:09.200
working way at this new design and on their new version of KDE, and GNOME 3.12, it's a

06:09.200 --> 06:12.440
crazy time, man, it's a crazy time to be doing a show.

06:12.440 --> 06:17.160
So alright, well I wanted to get to some feedback from last week's episode, we got a lot of

06:17.160 --> 06:18.160
good stuff.

06:18.160 --> 06:23.280
We had Chase on, if you guys didn't catch last week's episode, and he was talking about

06:23.280 --> 06:27.340
his challenges switching to Linux, and so some of these touch on that, some of these

06:27.340 --> 06:31.000
touch on a few of the other aspects that we got to in last week's episode, so we'll start

06:31.000 --> 06:32.200
with this.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.680
Our first one comes in from Kerry, and he says, hi Chris and Matt, I've been listening

06:35.680 --> 06:40.440
to LAS and CodeRadio and TechSnap from the beginning, I just started listening to Linux

06:40.440 --> 06:41.440
Unplugged.

06:41.440 --> 06:45.100
On the subject of Windows users coming to Linux, I wanted to give the perspective of

06:45.100 --> 06:49.200
someone who recently, newly came to Windows.

06:49.200 --> 06:54.560
The only time I've encountered Windows was using a Windows 95 box for gaming when I was

06:54.560 --> 06:58.640
young enough not to remember using Windows, and just for Word documents at school.

06:58.640 --> 07:03.320
Otherwise, I've been using KDE and OS X, and now mainly Ubuntu.

07:03.320 --> 07:07.560
It was only a couple of years ago that I received a laptop that an office was throwing out that

07:07.560 --> 07:11.800
I actually used Windows for the first time and I ran into many roadblocks that I've seen

07:11.800 --> 07:15.520
other Windows users run into that they just brush off and don't care about, and he has

07:15.520 --> 07:17.880
a couple of examples here.

07:17.880 --> 07:22.760
The file manager, it's difficult to navigate, what's the difference between pictures and

07:22.760 --> 07:23.760
my pictures?

07:23.760 --> 07:28.080
I have no idea why no one else knows either.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.080
Very true.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.080
Yeah, very true.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.960
Navigating the settings menu is difficult.

07:31.960 --> 07:35.680
When an app crashes, Windows will try to resolve the problem for several minutes.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.880
Sometimes the problem resolving Windows will start to freeze up as well.

07:38.880 --> 07:44.000
When this first happened to me, it was really upsetting and I asked around, what to do if

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
this happens?

07:45.000 --> 07:48.600
People told me, yeah, it happens when you just wait for it to, you wait it out.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.220
He says it's insanity.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.780
All the apps are awful.

07:51.780 --> 07:55.480
If they aren't installing malware or a toolbar, then they use ads or annoying pop-ups.

07:55.480 --> 08:00.040
I use Microsoft recommended PDF reader and I still use sneaky tactics to make the experience

08:00.040 --> 08:01.560
awful for me.

08:01.560 --> 08:04.620
There are so many more things, but these are just the kinds of problems that I never have

08:04.620 --> 08:07.840
to deal with when I'm using Linux or OS X, and these problems should be pointed out to

08:07.840 --> 08:11.680
any Linux newbie of the things they won't have to deal with anymore.

08:11.680 --> 08:15.360
Gnome 3.12 was light years ahead of Windows when it comes to ease of use, and I didn't

08:15.360 --> 08:18.160
realize that until I started using Windows.

08:18.160 --> 08:22.800
PS, when Linux Unplugged was launched, I couldn't find it in iTunes, so I didn't listen to it.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.640
But after a while, I stumbled upon the feed again.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.400
You should remind the audience that the feed does now actually exist.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.340
Well, point well taken, Kerry.

08:29.340 --> 08:31.320
How funny is that to get it from that perspective?

08:31.320 --> 08:32.320
Like the...

08:32.320 --> 08:37.080
That's a fascinating perspective because it kind of proves that it's all in the eyes of

08:37.080 --> 08:38.080
the builder.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.080
Yeah, yeah.

08:39.080 --> 08:45.160
I find it funny too, because I feel the same way when I now use Windows.

08:45.160 --> 08:51.520
It feels very frustrating to me, and I think it's people that are switching have never

08:51.520 --> 08:53.620
really experienced that phenomenon.

08:53.620 --> 08:59.240
So if you're coming from Windows to something, you've never done that before, so you don't

08:59.240 --> 09:00.720
realize it's actually...

09:00.720 --> 09:06.700
You don't realize how much that familiarity plays into what you perceive to be usable.

09:06.700 --> 09:09.720
And I think until you've switched around and hopped a few distros and desktops, then you

09:09.720 --> 09:10.720
start to realize it.

09:10.720 --> 09:11.720
Right.

09:11.720 --> 09:12.720
No, I definitely agree with that.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.480
I think it's something that really kind of makes us think twice about stuff.

09:15.480 --> 09:19.440
It certainly makes us rethink what we've been reading in the media.

09:19.440 --> 09:20.440
Kenny writes in.

09:20.440 --> 09:23.320
He says, hi Matt and Chris, and Chase.

09:23.320 --> 09:27.840
I was a little surprised the discussion regarding switchers to Linux went so long before someone

09:27.840 --> 09:32.320
mentioned Linux distros are built around software centers or repositories.

09:32.320 --> 09:36.440
This is the first thing that I explain to potential new users of Linux, and it's easy

09:36.440 --> 09:37.440
to do.

09:37.440 --> 09:41.120
It's critical to starting them off in the straight and narrow, and is a straightforward

09:41.120 --> 09:42.120
advantage.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.120
What?

09:43.120 --> 09:45.920
You don't want to have to go racking around the internet and shoot off to PC world and

09:45.920 --> 09:47.760
spend a fortune on new software?

09:47.760 --> 09:48.760
Nope.

09:48.760 --> 09:51.680
When I tried Linux for the first time circa 2008, it was because I couldn't afford a Windows

09:51.680 --> 09:53.560
upgrade from Windows ME.

09:53.560 --> 09:57.240
What had kept me from doing it earlier was not that there was too much choice or confusion,

09:57.240 --> 10:00.600
but that I thought I completely borked my precious computer during the installation

10:00.600 --> 10:02.160
of Windows.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.880
Microsoft likes to impress you that you need to be an expert or crazy to actually want

10:04.880 --> 10:06.160
to install your own OS.

10:06.160 --> 10:10.240
The first time around, I got stuck between I didn't know what home and swap partitions

10:10.240 --> 10:11.240
were.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.800
But after some Googling, I was able to sort that out.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.280
So here's my advice for Chase.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.660
You can only do so much reading or research on a subject before you just have to try it.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.480
Pick one of the larger distributions.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.320
Go with the default desktop and settings.

10:22.320 --> 10:27.120
And during installation, ensure you create a separate root or home and swap partitions.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.520
Check on the official distro's website as to which proprietary drivers or codecs you

10:30.520 --> 10:32.400
might want to add and how to install them.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.400
And you're off!

10:33.400 --> 10:36.400
Anyhow, Chase, good luck with the move and I'm sure it won't be long before you're feeling

10:36.400 --> 10:37.400
right at home.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.400
Great show as always.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.120
I'm really looking forward to the how-to show.

10:40.120 --> 10:43.200
I think his point about sometimes you just got to jump in is exactly right.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.720
That takes a kind of adventurous person.

10:45.720 --> 10:49.860
Yeah, I would tend to agree with that because I think you can only read about it so much

10:49.860 --> 10:50.860
as they pointed out.

10:50.860 --> 10:54.360
I think you definitely have to kind of stop running your face against the wall and walk

10:54.360 --> 10:55.960
around and actually try some stuff.

10:55.960 --> 11:00.640
Now that's why Chromebooks, I think, are doing so well because you don't have to really...

11:00.640 --> 11:03.680
Your choice is what kind of screen you want, what kind of keyboard you want, the battery

11:03.680 --> 11:05.720
life you want, and then you just buy it.

11:05.720 --> 11:10.240
And I think that's why it's super appealing to a lot of XP switchers.

11:10.240 --> 11:14.320
And then Linux becomes an implementation detail, which if you remember what Linus said in his

11:14.320 --> 11:16.480
recent Q&A, that's perfectly fine with him.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.480
That's how he likes it.

11:17.480 --> 11:18.480
He doesn't care at all.

11:18.480 --> 11:23.720
And that's why I think it's funny, you know, there are certain people, certain Microsoft

11:23.720 --> 11:29.460
pundits out there that like to boast about how it's Linux, you know, users will never

11:29.460 --> 11:32.480
care about Linux and they never have cared about Linux.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.680
And you're silly to think otherwise.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.580
What Paul is forgetting is that that's exactly how it should be.

11:36.580 --> 11:37.960
That's what we expect.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.680
Linux is the implementation detail.

11:39.680 --> 11:46.240
Now it is a massive detail that we spend our lives here thinking about, but it is to the

11:46.240 --> 11:48.160
user, it is but a detail.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.160
And that's how it should be.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.120
And that's how Linus thinks it should be too.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.600
And we've heard him say it.

11:52.600 --> 11:56.720
So that's why I'm warming up to the idea of Chromebooks, which I was initially pretty

11:56.720 --> 11:58.080
cold on.

11:58.080 --> 12:01.440
And I don't judge anybody who thinks that's the machine they should be running.

12:01.440 --> 12:05.040
Just like I think Chase got hung up on choice.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.640
I think the Chromebook solves that problem.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.440
But I think as a community, we can help solve that.

12:09.440 --> 12:13.880
And that's what I want to talk about in the second half of the show today is kind of that

12:13.880 --> 12:17.640
hang up and exactly what our last email just sort of touched on is, you know, pick one

12:17.640 --> 12:20.000
of the big ones to start with, at least.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.960
And so often I see in the community advice in the other direction given.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.800
Before we talk about that, before we get to the rest of our feedback, I want to thank

12:26.800 --> 12:28.040
our first sponsor this week.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.040
And that is Ting.com.

12:29.040 --> 12:32.360
Go over to linux.ting.com.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.360
Now what is Ting?

12:33.360 --> 12:34.920
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.620
It's my mobile service provider, and it's Matt's mobile service provider.

12:38.620 --> 12:41.560
And I got to tell you, what I love about it, and I think what Matt probably loves about

12:41.560 --> 12:43.980
it too, is you only pay for what you use.

12:43.980 --> 12:48.960
And if you're a work at home kind of guy, or if you're in an office that has Wi-Fi you

12:48.960 --> 12:52.860
can jump onto, this is such a value.

12:52.860 --> 12:56.360
Because you can use your phone when you need to make that actual call.

12:56.360 --> 13:00.140
But 90% of my data usage is on the Wi-Fi.

13:00.140 --> 13:05.640
So why would I pay into some massive plan that I, you know, I might need four gigabytes

13:05.640 --> 13:09.800
one month out of the year, maybe three months out of the year, maybe more or less, you know.

13:09.800 --> 13:14.600
And so every single month I pay into that large plan in the off chance that I might

13:14.600 --> 13:15.600
need that.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.320
Whereas with Ting it's like, okay, I'm just going to pay for it when I actually need it.

13:19.320 --> 13:23.880
And otherwise I get full advantage of being on Wi-Fi when I'm on Wi-Fi, and I just pay

13:23.880 --> 13:25.840
for the usage and there's zero stress.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.800
When I'm out on the road, when I'm setting up the new studio, I don't have to worry about

13:28.800 --> 13:29.800
overages.

13:29.800 --> 13:34.900
I don't have to worry about getting $15 every gigabyte like some of the other big blue logoed

13:34.900 --> 13:36.080
mobile carriers do.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.080
Dang it.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.080
I have to tell you.

13:38.080 --> 13:42.240
You can support it by going to linux.ting.com and you'll save $25 off your first device.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.940
If you already have a device and you want to bring it to the Ting network, check out

13:44.940 --> 13:46.840
their BYOD page.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.680
They support lots of great devices.

13:49.680 --> 13:53.080
It's a great way to get started because then they'll apply that $25 credit to your bill.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.280
And if you're like me, your first bill is going to be free.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.600
They just recently also added support for the iPhone 5.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.400
98% of people would save money with Ting.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.900
And one of the things that's different about Ting is go to linux.ting.com.

14:02.900 --> 14:05.160
That registers your interest.

14:05.160 --> 14:08.760
It thanks them for supporting this show because they see that you came there because we sent

14:08.760 --> 14:09.760
you there.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.080
So linux.ting.com and then check out their blog.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.840
And tell me you didn't wish your mobile carrier was as transparent and awesome as this.

14:15.840 --> 14:19.120
Ting is constantly updating their blog with behind the scenes interviews that are real

14:19.120 --> 14:20.480
and legitimate.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.160
They have app comparisons that are really great apps.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.080
We covered one on Linux Action Show.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.820
They did a Heartbleed update because they had a lot of people send in and ask what the

14:27.820 --> 14:30.840
status of Ting's Heartbleed security was.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.560
And this is a great one too.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.200
They're posting a little reminder about their personal shopper service which just turned

14:35.200 --> 14:37.840
one years old.

14:37.840 --> 14:41.760
You can go to Ting and be like, hey Ting, this is what I want from a device.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.460
I don't want to buy it new.

14:43.460 --> 14:46.120
But I still want to take advantage of the fact that when I get a device from you, I

14:46.120 --> 14:47.120
own it outright.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.120
It's mine.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.680
And if you could find me a device that meets these specifications, then I could switch

14:51.680 --> 14:52.680
to you.

14:52.680 --> 14:57.440
And on average, in two days, Ting will find you a used mobile device that you can get

14:57.440 --> 15:00.200
refurbished and then help you get it connected to the Ting network.

15:00.200 --> 15:04.280
It's another great way to get started and really take advantage of Ting's value.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.880
So go over to linux.ting.com to get started.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.920
And finally, get out of your contract.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.560
Never worry about early termination fees.

15:10.560 --> 15:14.800
And by the way, if you are in an early termination fee, they have an ETF relief program.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.920
You can find more about that at ting.com slash ETF.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.880
They're going to pay you up to $75 per line that you have to get canceled.

15:19.880 --> 15:20.880
That's a really great deal.

15:20.880 --> 15:24.500
And then you're just going to start saving money from the now linux.ting.com and a big

15:24.500 --> 15:29.560
thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged and their great support of the Jupiter Broadcasting

15:29.560 --> 15:30.560
Network too.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.000
We really appreciate it.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
So Quickie writes in.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
That's a great name.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.240
And he says, you guys were talking about the terminal versus the GUI last week.

15:37.240 --> 15:41.880
And some of you were floating the crazy arse idea that the terminal might actually be better

15:41.880 --> 15:45.360
for new users in the GUI because you can give them the commands over the phone.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.240
He says, hey, Chris and Matt, time zone sucks.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.160
I wish I could have joined you live.

15:49.160 --> 15:53.080
About the terminal versus GUI topic, yeah, it's a personal choice really, but nothing

15:53.080 --> 15:54.080
is better than the other.

15:54.080 --> 15:57.920
I developed GUI applications for Linux, but they aren't as powerful as the terminal since

15:57.920 --> 16:01.840
text gives you a lot of advantages like almost infinite permutations and the ability to compose

16:01.840 --> 16:03.400
features together.

16:03.400 --> 16:07.000
About the text support part, though, it's harder to explain where to click.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.540
But I don't think that is something that makes the GUI inferior to the command line.

16:10.540 --> 16:14.160
It just points out bad design decisions of the GUI.

16:14.160 --> 16:17.560
Try to explain to someone to change the default application for the document type on Windows

16:17.560 --> 16:19.000
and elementary OS.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.040
In Windows control panel, you go to the control panel, then you go somewhere and you right

16:24.040 --> 16:27.640
click on that file and you go to open with and you select, he gets lost, and you can

16:27.640 --> 16:31.920
eventually get them depending on the version of Windows to check the default application.

16:31.920 --> 16:36.480
But in a more well-designed operating system like elementary OS, it's simple as pie.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.700
You go to applications, system settings, defaults, and then you just select the application.

16:39.700 --> 16:40.700
It's right there.

16:40.700 --> 16:44.840
I think UI dictates the usability of the GUI, not command line versus GUI.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.240
Interesting point.

16:46.240 --> 16:49.600
And I agree, too, that we got some other people that are like, yeah, see, when you try to

16:49.600 --> 16:53.160
read somebody a command over the phone, you never know if they're typing it in right and

16:53.160 --> 16:55.920
they don't always read back the return right to you.

16:55.920 --> 16:56.920
True.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.880
Each their own, Matt.

16:58.880 --> 16:59.880
Okay.

16:59.880 --> 17:05.840
Before we get to our Valve update, Kyle wrote in and he says there was a big point that

17:05.840 --> 17:08.760
we missed in last week's episode and I kind of agree with him.

17:08.760 --> 17:16.200
We were talking about how Linux is especially right now in 2014, really better suited for

17:16.200 --> 17:20.280
geeks, for technical people that want to switch away from Windows for various reasons and

17:20.280 --> 17:21.280
there's a lot of them.

17:21.280 --> 17:25.440
And it's not just XP going away, there's a lot of reasons why technical users who have

17:25.440 --> 17:29.640
been Windows enthusiasts for years might want to move over to the Linux platform.

17:29.640 --> 17:32.560
And we were trying to discuss the best way for that to happen and he says the point that

17:32.560 --> 17:36.480
you missed, and though I enjoyed your conversation with Chase in the last show, is since I think

17:36.480 --> 17:40.760
it dealt with the topic that all of us want to promote Linux, we struggle with this.

17:40.760 --> 17:44.440
However, I think that you missed out on the biggest and most obvious point that you should

17:44.440 --> 17:45.600
have considered.

17:45.600 --> 17:49.520
I think that despite your claims to the contrary, that you remain stuck on the topic of the

17:49.520 --> 17:54.400
mythical first time PC user or the grandma and grandpa user who have no technical knowledge.

17:54.400 --> 17:58.400
If you truly believe that technical users are most likely to switch to Linux, you should

17:58.400 --> 18:02.280
recommend experimenting with Linux in a VM.

18:02.280 --> 18:07.680
The immediate objection to this idea will be that VMs are too complicated for new users.

18:07.680 --> 18:11.360
However, complexity of using Linux on a VM is mostly handled in the host OS where the

18:11.360 --> 18:16.220
technical user is already comfortable with the GUI and the software, not in the guest

18:16.220 --> 18:18.360
where they are out of their element.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.320
What is the biggest advantage with experimenting in a VM?

18:20.320 --> 18:23.080
Snapshots are external to the guest OS.

18:23.080 --> 18:27.320
They can be restored from the GUI and that is what the user is comfortable with.

18:27.320 --> 18:31.520
This is a set of training wheels or water wings that a new user who wants to go nuts

18:31.520 --> 18:33.360
with an experiment needs.

18:33.360 --> 18:36.240
Want to remove Ubuntu desktop and try to install Ubuntu?

18:36.240 --> 18:37.360
No problem.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.520
Once you run into problems, just restore your last snapshot.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.640
Feel like maybe you want to try another distro, but worry you might lose your work you've

18:43.640 --> 18:44.640
put in so far?

18:44.640 --> 18:46.060
No problem.

18:46.060 --> 18:48.160
Just create a new VM yourself.

18:48.160 --> 18:52.680
You yourself have often used VMs in the past to demo distros, so why wouldn't a technical

18:52.680 --> 18:54.000
user?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.920
This was the method I used to get into Arch Linux.

18:55.920 --> 19:00.240
My first two attempts at installing the OS were a total catastrophe, but eventually with

19:00.240 --> 19:05.440
some determination and a few snapshot rollbacks, I started to feel at home with it and now

19:05.440 --> 19:07.600
I've installed on a number of real computers.

19:07.600 --> 19:14.440
For most of my distro hopping needs, I still use VMs and if a user like Chase really wants

19:14.440 --> 19:18.940
to maximize benefits they get out of their hardware, well, they can do that once they

19:18.940 --> 19:22.240
get used to the basics of Linux.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.240
Next, Kyle.

19:23.240 --> 19:27.600
What do you think, Matt, for technical users is trying it out in a VM first a viable idea?

19:27.600 --> 19:31.800
Well, I think if you have the resources that will support it, I think that's fine, but

19:31.800 --> 19:35.320
I think that's a pretty iffy situation for most people.

19:35.320 --> 19:36.800
Yeah, I think Chase could.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.000
I think he has pretty good PCs.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.920
Oh yeah, Chase could do it, but I mean for Joe average, just someone who maybe is not

19:41.920 --> 19:45.800
a Windows power user, that might not be such a great thing.

19:45.800 --> 19:50.120
I do agree with Kyle in the sense that I am surprised when we're talking about tech users

19:50.120 --> 19:55.920
that the VM doesn't come up more because that is his point where the management of the VM,

19:55.920 --> 20:00.240
like the snapshotting, all of that is done in the native OS that they're familiar with,

20:00.240 --> 20:03.700
so like they are comfortable with pushing those boundaries.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.680
That actually makes a lot of sense to me.

20:05.680 --> 20:09.960
So when I think about it that way, I kind of feel like bad on me for saying, hey, if

20:09.960 --> 20:13.600
you're a technical user, like Chase, for example, when we start how to Linux is going to make

20:13.600 --> 20:18.180
that switch and I've been racking my brain, like I think the best way to get him to use

20:18.180 --> 20:21.360
Linux is to make him run it to do a lot of things, right?

20:21.360 --> 20:24.200
Say, hey, Chase, when you know you're doing your regular day-to-day stuff, do it in this

20:24.200 --> 20:25.200
machine.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.760
Don't default back to your Windows box or your Mac box.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.440
And I was trying to think like, well, what am I going to do?

20:30.440 --> 20:33.520
Am I going to like rent him a laptop, you know, am I going to set up a PC at his house

20:33.520 --> 20:36.680
and then like I read this and I was like, yeah, he could just run a full screen VM.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.600
I know he's got a machine nice enough to do it.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.600
That would make sense.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.160
I mean, I think in his case that definitely matches for sure.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.160
Yeah.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.160
All right, Matt.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.480
Before we get into the main discussion in our show this week, I do want to have a little

20:48.480 --> 20:49.480
valve update.

20:49.480 --> 20:54.920
We got to talk about this because the valve news hasn't been making it in the big show

20:54.920 --> 20:59.080
as much, but I try to keep up to date in Linux Unplugged and we've got a release date on

20:59.080 --> 21:00.080
that valve controller.

21:00.080 --> 21:03.240
Now you don't have to have a steam box to use the valve controller.

21:03.240 --> 21:07.640
I know you've been doing some Let's Play videos, Matt, so you've been looking at controllers.

21:07.640 --> 21:10.440
You'll be able to, so I don't know if you've seen the latest version of the valve controller,

21:10.440 --> 21:12.960
but it looks much more like a regular controller with regular buttons.

21:12.960 --> 21:17.520
It still has those, the areola controllers, I don't know what else.

21:17.520 --> 21:18.520
Those are still pretty cool.

21:18.520 --> 21:19.520
Those are still there.

21:19.520 --> 21:24.200
And I guess it's October or November is when the steam controller is going to be available

21:24.200 --> 21:28.120
with, right now they're saying over 500 compatible games.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.760
And then I would think anything that really supports a controller.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.000
So there you go.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.760
If you want to get yourself a steam controller, you'll be able to pre-order it soon.

21:37.760 --> 21:38.800
I'm going to get one.

21:38.800 --> 21:39.800
I'm going to get one.

21:39.800 --> 21:40.800
Are you?

21:40.800 --> 21:41.800
Oh well, I've got to, right?

21:41.800 --> 21:43.800
I'm going to get one on the show.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.280
And I play with the controller quite a bit anyways.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.080
I'm already playing with a 360 controller.

21:48.080 --> 21:51.160
I'm not going to lie, it feels dirty every time I plug it into my bonobo.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.920
I feel like I'm committing some sort of crime or something.

21:53.920 --> 21:54.920
I don't know.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.200
So yeah, I think I'm going to get one.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.360
I'm looking forward to it as a matter of fact the more I think about it.

21:58.360 --> 22:02.480
I'm just a little worried it's not going to work as great because the thing is, the dirty

22:02.480 --> 22:07.000
little secret, actually it's not that dirty of a secret, the Xbox 360 controller works

22:07.000 --> 22:08.480
outrageously well under Linux.

22:08.480 --> 22:13.320
Like you just plug it in, it works out of the box on every game that I've tried.

22:13.320 --> 22:19.040
And Valve even just recently updated the kernel support for the controller so it's even better.

22:19.040 --> 22:23.120
So the Xbox 360 has turned into the perfect Linux game controller.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.320
And on top of that, it's not a bad controller to begin with.

22:25.320 --> 22:28.280
It's one of my more preferred controllers anyways.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.840
So I've never tried the one, so I don't know.

22:29.840 --> 22:34.160
But the 360 controller, well I guess I have tried the one, it seems the same to me.

22:34.160 --> 22:39.760
So I don't know, as ridiculous as it sounds, I think on my Linux box, Valve's biggest competition

22:39.760 --> 22:41.400
is Microsoft's 360 controller.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.400
I feel dirty.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.400
Dirty thunk it.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.400
Ugh.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.720
All right, well before we get into our main topic this week, I want to thank our second

22:47.720 --> 22:50.240
sponsor and that is Digital Ocean.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.880
You guys, if you've been listening to the show a little bit, you know how much I love

22:52.880 --> 22:53.880
Digital Ocean.

22:53.880 --> 22:56.240
But if you're new to the show, let me tell you a little bit about them.

22:56.240 --> 23:03.120
Digital Ocean is growing and exploding and they are probably both concisely put, consider

23:03.120 --> 23:06.600
them to be simple cloud hosting, dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

23:06.600 --> 23:08.320
to spin up a cloud server.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.880
And if you just think about like if you need to spin up a system, like I was just having

23:11.880 --> 23:14.640
a little pre-show chat about a new server I needed and it's like, oh yeah, that would

23:14.640 --> 23:18.240
work great as a Digital Ocean instance and here's the great part.

23:18.240 --> 23:23.080
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds, however, however in our subreddit right now,

23:23.080 --> 23:24.960
the record is 43 seconds.

23:24.960 --> 23:29.320
And then I got an email today, this morning, saying, hey man, hey man, my record, if you

23:29.320 --> 23:32.700
listen to like episode 26 of Unplugged, my record's 40 seconds.

23:32.700 --> 23:37.040
So we've got people competing right now, 55 seconds is the average benchmark, but we have

23:37.040 --> 23:42.780
people that can create an entire cloud server instance in 40 seconds in Digital Ocean as

23:42.780 --> 23:46.600
data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore and Amsterdam.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.680
And part of the reason why people can make these cloud servers so fast is because their

23:49.680 --> 23:53.640
interface is simple, they have an intuitive control panel and power users can replicate

23:53.640 --> 23:59.080
that on a larger scale with their straightforward API, which I've been told is quite beautiful.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.760
And their dashboard is really great and one of the things I love about Digital Ocean is

24:01.760 --> 24:06.320
once they implement a feature, they don't just leave it alone, they continue to do really

24:06.320 --> 24:09.320
smart logical iteration.

24:09.320 --> 24:13.200
You can see the evolution of not just the product features, but the design and how you

24:13.200 --> 24:14.840
use the product.

24:14.840 --> 24:19.680
Like I have watched them really mature the resize image stuff, you know, they've added

24:19.680 --> 24:25.680
in some really great DNS management, the snapshot interface has never been better, their HTML5

24:25.680 --> 24:29.720
console access to your droplet, you get HTML5 console access.

24:29.720 --> 24:33.360
And they have one button install of WordPress and Ruby on Rails, and they're using Doku

24:33.360 --> 24:37.400
on the backend, which is an open source project that they created that they sponsor that works

24:37.400 --> 24:40.160
with Docker to deploy applications.

24:40.160 --> 24:46.200
And listeners of Coderadio, if they use the promo code UnpluggedApril, of Linux Unplugged,

24:46.200 --> 24:52.120
UnpluggedApril, you can get two months for free when you get the $5 droplet.

24:52.120 --> 24:57.520
If you use the promo code UnpluggedApril, two months for free, that's a great deal.

24:57.520 --> 25:01.020
And you can try out that $5 rig for a little bit and see what you can do.

25:01.020 --> 25:05.080
I'm constantly finding new uses for mine, and we have a G Plus community thread where

25:05.080 --> 25:08.040
they've been talking about all of the great things that they're using their DigitalOcean

25:08.040 --> 25:09.040
droplets for.

25:09.040 --> 25:13.480
So go over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code UnpluggedApril to check them out.

25:13.480 --> 25:18.400
And an outrageously huge thank you to DigitalOcean for not only supporting the Linux Unplugged

25:18.400 --> 25:21.040
podcast, but for just being so awesome.

25:21.040 --> 25:26.600
I love your SSD drives, I love them, and I love your tier one bandwidth.

25:26.600 --> 25:31.480
Tell you what, Matt, if you wanted to refresh some server hosting skills, or you wanted

25:31.480 --> 25:35.260
to do a little MP3 stream or something like that for yourself, or maybe your own cloud

25:35.260 --> 25:41.600
instance or a Minecraft server, or if you're like Michael Dominic on Coderadio, he uses

25:41.600 --> 25:45.280
DigitalOcean to host the backend infrastructure for the apps that he sells to clients.

25:45.280 --> 25:49.080
And some of the biggest sites on the web use DigitalOcean.

25:49.080 --> 25:53.980
So the scalability is so awesome, and what we talk about all the time, we've talked about

25:53.980 --> 25:58.360
it on this show specifically, is the technologies that are doing this are the technologies

25:58.360 --> 26:01.480
that we are watching in front of our very eyes evolve.

26:01.480 --> 26:07.100
Like Docker, like KVM, and all of this stuff is coming together, SystemD, it's all coming

26:07.100 --> 26:12.880
together to work as a platform for DigitalOcean to make a whole new generation of servers

26:12.880 --> 26:15.720
that are available to folks at unbelievable value.

26:15.720 --> 26:19.520
And that's what's so exciting because we're actually seeing the realization of the stuff

26:19.520 --> 26:23.200
we've been talking about in DigitalOcean, and they're blowing up.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.200
They're hiring right now.

26:24.200 --> 26:25.200
You can go over to their website.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.200
You can get a job.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.200
They just got a great round of funding.

26:28.200 --> 26:33.080
They have an awesome video series on TechCrunch that goes into their office and kind of gives

26:33.080 --> 26:36.120
you a little bit of behind the scenes about their culture.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.660
They're a really cool company, and I'm really happy to have them on here.

26:38.660 --> 26:43.860
So go over to DigitalOcean.com and use that promo code unpluggedapril to thank them.

26:43.860 --> 26:48.480
And check it out for yourself and see what's so cool about having your own SSD-powered

26:48.480 --> 26:49.480
droplet.

26:49.480 --> 26:55.760
Okay, Matt, so I wanted to talk about the underdog a little bit, and I really don't

26:55.760 --> 26:56.760
mean to...

26:56.760 --> 27:02.140
I don't want this show to be ranty, and I don't want to get anybody offended that works

27:02.140 --> 27:03.640
really hard on their distribution.

27:03.640 --> 27:05.400
That's not my goal here.

27:05.400 --> 27:09.960
So I want to give you the background on this, and then we'll go from there.

27:09.960 --> 27:14.000
So recent discussions that we've had on Linux Unplugged, I think pretty much prompted by

27:14.000 --> 27:19.120
the demise of XP, have really made me thinking about getting more people to switch to Linux.

27:19.120 --> 27:23.120
And really, the scope of the problems that we have there.

27:23.120 --> 27:27.640
And so many of those problems are really outside our ability to control.

27:27.640 --> 27:31.560
They're OEM, or they're distribution channel problems, or whatever it is.

27:31.560 --> 27:35.280
They're really just as regular, at the end of the day, regular Linux users, they're outside

27:35.280 --> 27:36.280
our scope.

27:36.280 --> 27:40.040
So I've been trying to think more of what's actually legitimately in our scope to solve.

27:40.040 --> 27:46.040
And a lot of times that comes down to community, support infrastructure, helping onboard people

27:46.040 --> 27:49.640
who are already maybe interested in making the switch, and maybe trying to find ways

27:49.640 --> 27:53.120
to outreach to people who haven't made the choice yet.

27:53.120 --> 27:57.160
And I think some of this is honestly in the shadow, some of this discussion we're going

27:57.160 --> 28:02.360
to have about underdog distros is legitimately in the shadow of the 14.04 release, which

28:02.360 --> 28:03.880
we're talking about soon.

28:03.880 --> 28:11.880
And so I've been running Ubuntu again, and I'm once again on a distribution where when

28:11.880 --> 28:16.800
you run it, you can genuinely feel that it is the wider used platform, like it's unquestionable

28:16.800 --> 28:21.780
that the most people running Linux on the web are on Ubuntu because so much that you

28:21.780 --> 28:25.720
find on the web is just automatically tailored for Ubuntu.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.680
And that really comes through when you're using it.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.480
It's got me thinking about this a lot more.

28:29.480 --> 28:35.000
And so I think what I want to kind of pitch to you into the Mumble Room is, are we doing

28:35.000 --> 28:40.220
a disservice to new users when we recommend these boutique distros, which I think are

28:40.220 --> 28:44.960
great for experienced users, but essentially you're sending them down a path where they

28:44.960 --> 28:51.080
become part of a niche of a niche, because Linux is already a niche desktop environment,

28:51.080 --> 28:55.840
and then you send them onto a distro that is a niche of that already small slice of

28:55.840 --> 28:56.840
pie.

28:56.840 --> 28:59.920
So the support community is automatically out of the gate smaller.

28:59.920 --> 29:03.120
Even if it's really sharp where it's sharp, it's smaller.

29:03.120 --> 29:06.800
And the other thing that it's one of these unpredictable things that you can't account

29:06.800 --> 29:12.040
for, but it always smacks new users right in that face, is that random, poorly crafted

29:12.040 --> 29:16.800
Google search, you know, where they're just, they're less likely to get results for their

29:16.800 --> 29:17.800
own distro.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.040
Like I don't know if it was in the pre-show, I think, or I know it was in the post-show

29:20.040 --> 29:25.120
I think of last week's Linux Unplugged, but Chase decided after using 14.04 for the whole

29:25.120 --> 29:27.120
episode to try to install Steam.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.120
So he went to Google.

29:28.120 --> 29:31.120
He didn't even think about going to the package manager because that's a totally new concept

29:31.120 --> 29:32.120
to him.

29:32.120 --> 29:37.080
So he went to Google and he searched for Steam installation and he got a link for Fedora,

29:37.080 --> 29:40.920
and he started downloading an RPM like he was off on a completely wrong course because

29:40.920 --> 29:43.960
the title of the article was install Steam on Linux.

29:43.960 --> 29:48.680
And you got to think about when these guys are searching for this stuff, if you have

29:48.680 --> 29:53.600
them off on some boutique small distro, and I have a lot of respect for some of these

29:53.600 --> 29:57.720
smaller distros that we've had on the show and talked to, but that right there is setting

29:57.720 --> 29:59.680
them up for some level of failure.

29:59.680 --> 30:04.320
Then you have to ask what's the long-term viability of any really small team.

30:04.320 --> 30:07.800
There is a good shot it'll work out, but it's always questionable.

30:07.800 --> 30:12.440
Larger distros like Ubuntu or OpenSUSE or Fedora, even if they're corporate backers

30:12.440 --> 30:16.440
or their community pulled out completely, that code would still go on.

30:16.440 --> 30:21.080
There would be a fork in the open source community that would maintain that for at least some

30:21.080 --> 30:22.440
point in time.

30:22.440 --> 30:26.280
But with these smaller distributions, sometimes when they shut down, they shut down.

30:26.280 --> 30:30.120
And Matt, I know you've seen that, you've watched that happen, and we've seen these

30:30.120 --> 30:33.040
smaller guys where they just kind of go away.

30:33.040 --> 30:36.960
Well I also think that, it's a little bit like I was saying previously, that I feel

30:36.960 --> 30:40.600
that if you're starting someone out for the first time, they should be starting out with

30:40.600 --> 30:44.720
an Ubuntu base, whether that's Ubuntu with Unity or whether it's one of the other desktop

30:44.720 --> 30:45.720
environments.

30:45.720 --> 30:51.000
But I think by sticking to that, that actually provides you with enough flexibility to try

30:51.000 --> 30:55.920
some new stuff, but you're pretty well grounded in not ending up in an experimental land,

30:55.920 --> 30:58.200
which is where most people end up with boutique distros.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.400
Later on you can try out the boutique distros.

31:00.400 --> 31:04.040
Let me ask Crash Bandicoot, because I believe he recently switched somebody new to Linux

31:04.040 --> 31:08.480
and he chose Korora 19 or Korora 20, is that right Crash?

31:08.480 --> 31:17.080
Yeah, that's right, it's a friend of mine who, he's one of my housemates, and so I put

31:17.080 --> 31:22.960
him on that because I figured, you know, every time he needs anything done, he just comes

31:22.960 --> 31:25.880
to me and says, oh I need this done, all that done, what do you want me to do?

31:25.880 --> 31:27.520
He's got the proximity advantage.

31:27.520 --> 31:34.840
Yeah, so that's why I ended up actually switching him to Intergas, just because there was a

31:34.840 --> 31:37.840
few things going wrong with Fedora, it was just running slow and stuff.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.840
So you moved him to Tegra?

31:39.840 --> 31:45.120
Yeah, because like I said, you know, I have SSH access to his machine, so updates and

31:45.120 --> 31:48.320
stuff I just do every week or so, I just do it.

31:48.320 --> 31:53.800
But I actually have another friend who, he came to me and he said, oh you know, I've

31:53.800 --> 31:57.000
been looking at Harry's computer and it's really cool because, you know, Gnome Shell

31:57.000 --> 31:59.680
and all the rest of it, and he wanted to give it a try.

31:59.680 --> 32:04.560
And so I pointed him towards Ubuntu and he's had no problems with that at all, like he

32:04.560 --> 32:09.920
just installed it, he used the Gnome Shell remix because he wanted Gnome, and he just

32:09.920 --> 32:13.840
installed it and he's been loving it, like he's had no issues at all.

32:13.840 --> 32:21.160
Whereas the guy that I'm sort of managing his system, if he was by himself, I'd probably

32:21.160 --> 32:24.680
have pointed him towards Ubuntu as well for that exact reason that you mentioned with,

32:24.680 --> 32:29.320
you know, if he Googles how to do something, he's going to get a guide for Ubuntu, he might

32:29.320 --> 32:34.280
get a guide for Arch or whatever else, but he's definitely going to get a guide for Ubuntu

32:34.280 --> 32:36.080
that works.

32:36.080 --> 32:39.920
Now Crossroads, you were going to say that we should maybe consider custom tailing it

32:39.920 --> 32:40.920
for each user.

32:40.920 --> 32:43.600
That doesn't sound very scalable to me, to be honest with you.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.880
Also, um, sorry.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.880
Go ahead Riley.

32:47.880 --> 32:55.600
Well, I was going to say, uh, there is an issue with Ubuntu, even still though, is because

32:55.600 --> 33:01.080
a lot of the time you'll find outdated PPAs and like you'll find info, but it'll be

33:01.080 --> 33:03.560
retaining like 804 or something.

33:03.560 --> 33:04.560
It's way off.

33:04.560 --> 33:07.600
So you got to be careful what you're searching for too.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.600
Well, that's very true.

33:08.600 --> 33:09.600
Yeah.

33:09.600 --> 33:13.400
But it's also easier for Ubuntu anyway, cause it's like most time people will, the stuff

33:13.400 --> 33:14.400
will be updated.

33:14.400 --> 33:18.400
Like the forum, if you go to Google to something, a lot of the times the form doesn't show up

33:18.400 --> 33:20.280
anymore and it's Ask Ubuntu now.

33:20.280 --> 33:22.840
So that's an improvement.

33:22.840 --> 33:25.180
Well that was a conscious decision actually.

33:25.180 --> 33:31.480
We had a, uh, George Castro, a great talk at one of our, um, developer summits and, uh,

33:31.480 --> 33:35.680
it was all about going through the wiki and deleting pages cause we're doing a disservice

33:35.680 --> 33:41.760
to our users and our friends when we leave like some wacky how to from 804 detailing

33:41.760 --> 33:45.560
how to use Endis wrapper, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, we should get

33:45.560 --> 33:49.680
rid of that page because it's no longer needed and point people at Ask Ubuntu.

33:49.680 --> 33:50.680
Hmm.

33:50.680 --> 33:56.560
Well, I guess, so here's what happens is people for whatever reason, uh, and I don't know

33:56.560 --> 33:59.920
if I consider myself in this camp or not, I'm undecided, but people for whatever reason

33:59.920 --> 34:01.560
sometimes hesitated recommending Ubuntu.

34:01.560 --> 34:06.080
I mean, we just saw this New York Times article that we covered in the Linux action show and

34:06.080 --> 34:09.120
the author of the New York Times article, the number one distro at the top of his list

34:09.120 --> 34:11.960
was Bodai Linux and it was also the one he had the most praise.

34:11.960 --> 34:16.320
Uh, I think Ubuntu was three on the list after Mint.

34:16.320 --> 34:20.280
And so Mint is the one you hear like thrown around the most often is an alternative to

34:20.280 --> 34:21.280
Ubuntu.

34:21.280 --> 34:25.800
Uh, I want to, so I think if you guys are buying, it sounds like you guys are all kind

34:25.800 --> 34:31.080
of buying off on this philosophy that if, if it's a, if it's a random new user who you're

34:31.080 --> 34:35.360
not holding his hand or her hand and installing that Linux for them and then by proxy also

34:35.360 --> 34:38.160
being their support, then Ubuntu is a good choice.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.680
All right, so if we accept that, yeah, okay.

34:40.680 --> 34:44.480
So if we accept that, do we also accept that about Mint?

34:44.480 --> 34:46.720
Yes, but slightly different.

34:46.720 --> 34:49.240
So I would, I would argue why is it any different?

34:49.240 --> 34:54.140
Like so for me, then you get into the question, well, but cinnamon and mate are again onto

34:54.140 --> 34:55.560
an island of their own.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.340
They're not something that's super common.

34:57.340 --> 34:59.700
They're not something that, you know, what the longterm prospects are, although they

34:59.700 --> 35:00.700
look good.

35:00.700 --> 35:04.540
Uh, and you know, you don't know if they've been as banged on as the rest of the desktops

35:04.540 --> 35:07.880
that have maybe a larger user base because they're on more distributions or they just

35:07.880 --> 35:09.240
have more users.

35:09.240 --> 35:13.600
So what is the difference between a boutique recommending a boutique distribution and recommending

35:13.600 --> 35:14.600
a boutique desk?

35:14.600 --> 35:20.040
Well, well, they're not boutique and longterm support, but there's also not boutique like

35:20.040 --> 35:21.040
Mint's not boutique.

35:21.040 --> 35:26.960
I mean, it's, it's become a, just as popular as Ubuntu, but it benefits when having Ubuntu

35:26.960 --> 35:27.960
support.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.000
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't buy that.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.240
I don't buy that for a minute.

35:30.240 --> 35:32.680
I'm not talking about, I mean, I think it's a great distribution.

35:32.680 --> 35:34.400
I don't, I don't buy, I don't buy that.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.240
It has nearly the install base that Ubuntu does.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.240
It doesn't.

35:37.240 --> 35:42.920
I'm talking about like you're, you're talking about the consideration of like, uh, as far

35:42.920 --> 35:48.160
as like popularity goes, Mint has as much popularity, popularity, but out, but outside

35:48.160 --> 35:52.840
of Linux community, it's, it's much lower and outside of servers, it's basically, you

35:52.840 --> 35:54.640
know, there's, there's nothing.

35:54.640 --> 35:59.720
But when you look into it, like just usability wise, people are going to suggest Mint purely

35:59.720 --> 36:03.760
for the fact that Cinnamon is very user friendly to Windows people.

36:03.760 --> 36:04.760
Yeah.

36:04.760 --> 36:07.000
Whereas Ubuntu is like completely different paradigm.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Right.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Right.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.240
So there's, there's, there's reason why Mint is picked because instead of Ubuntu, not because

36:13.240 --> 36:14.240
Ubuntu is bad.

36:14.240 --> 36:19.640
I mean, the people who bash Ubuntu, I think are a little crazy, but when you have, um,

36:19.640 --> 36:24.760
the, the, the paradigm of the usability such drastically different, there are some people

36:24.760 --> 36:26.620
who would be turned off by that.

36:26.620 --> 36:31.040
When you give them Cinnamon, they, they look at it like, oh, okay, it's kind of like Windows.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.320
So that has a benefit there.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.320
Yeah.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.320
I don't know though.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.720
I mean, look, we just heard Crash Benedict's anecdote about somebody wanting to switch

36:36.720 --> 36:37.720
because of Gnome.

36:37.720 --> 36:41.740
And this has never been a problem for the Mac since time of inception.

36:41.740 --> 36:47.280
That is never, the Mac OS 10 has never gotten a single switcher because it looks like Windows.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.480
And I don't know if that's a requirement.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.680
I think it just has to work and make sense.

36:51.680 --> 36:57.760
Also, you know, forgetting to the whole desktop thing is Unity is going to be having some

36:57.760 --> 37:03.640
pretty big changes in 1310 and, uh, we're not talking to, but 1410 and so on and so

37:03.640 --> 37:07.240
on, but it's going to be a little, in Gnome, pretty changes every other month.

37:07.240 --> 37:08.240
Yeah.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.240
Yeah.

37:09.240 --> 37:10.240
Yeah.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.240
And Cinnamon has consistently remained the same.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.240
I mean, since its beginning.

37:12.240 --> 37:13.240
Paradigm wise.

37:13.240 --> 37:14.240
Yeah.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.240
Yeah.

37:15.240 --> 37:19.080
It has, it's, it's had a very casual evolution, so it keeps people feeling safe.

37:19.080 --> 37:22.920
It just adds some user friendly settings into it and that's very good for new users.

37:22.920 --> 37:26.440
You could argue that, that Unity has not changed that much usability though.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.440
Right.

37:27.440 --> 37:31.160
And Unity won't change that much in 14.04, it's an LTS, remember, five year support.

37:31.160 --> 37:36.400
So you put your user on, yeah, and I'm saying you don't need to, you don't, you don't have

37:36.400 --> 37:37.400
to upgrade.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.920
There's no, there's no one with a gun to your head saying you have to upgrade.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.200
You can just stay on 14.04.

37:42.200 --> 37:47.040
And also that, that is precisely what Windows XP users would be looking for, right?

37:47.040 --> 37:50.160
Because they've been using the same operating system for going on 13 years now.

37:50.160 --> 37:51.160
Yeah.

37:51.160 --> 37:52.160
And that's what they want to replace.

37:52.160 --> 37:53.160
Yeah.

37:53.160 --> 37:54.160
That's what they want to swap out.

37:54.160 --> 37:55.160
And that's the paradigm they're familiar with.

37:55.160 --> 37:56.160
That's what, that's how they think of it.

37:56.160 --> 37:59.160
They just want their security updates and just keep on rolling.

37:59.160 --> 38:05.320
And the only, the only place where I see where, where Mint has, has an argument is, is that

38:05.320 --> 38:11.640
the, the desktops it provides offer a familiar user environment that a Windows switcher would

38:11.640 --> 38:17.080
be comfortable with, whereas Ubuntu is, is different enough to require, require them

38:17.080 --> 38:18.080
to think.

38:18.080 --> 38:21.920
Well, the issue is like the XP users are typically people who have never thought of updating

38:21.920 --> 38:25.440
and they don't, they just, they're afraid to update, they don't want to change anything.

38:25.440 --> 38:29.760
So those people going to Ubuntu, that paradigm switch might be too much.

38:29.760 --> 38:34.880
The only reason I would suggest like people from Windows, it would be Windows XP users

38:34.880 --> 38:38.880
to Cinnamon would be very friendly to them.

38:38.880 --> 38:42.660
But if you did, somebody who's just a regular user for, and who's like, who has a computer

38:42.660 --> 38:46.080
that can handle it, they not necessarily care at all.

38:46.080 --> 38:50.640
So Ick, you wanted to make a point that maybe just offering folks what they already have,

38:50.640 --> 38:52.240
isn't that, that appealing?

38:52.240 --> 38:53.240
I don't think so.

38:53.240 --> 38:56.200
I think when people want to switch, they want to switch to something that might be a little

38:56.200 --> 38:58.720
bit different than what they're used to.

38:58.720 --> 39:03.760
I mean, you know, Windows is Windows, Mac is Mac, let's let Linux be Linux.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.800
They want it, they want their hassle to feel like it was worth it.

39:06.800 --> 39:13.200
Yes, they want, they, they're going to want it to not necessarily feel familiar, but to

39:13.200 --> 39:18.720
get to know something that feels a little bit different so that they, you know, it doesn't

39:18.720 --> 39:20.480
have to always be about familiarity.

39:20.480 --> 39:27.160
I, my biggest pet peeve is when I see us trying to copy what Microsoft or Apple has already

39:27.160 --> 39:28.160
done.

39:28.160 --> 39:33.080
And, you know, we've need to brand our own brand.

39:33.080 --> 39:34.940
We have too many brands to brand.

39:34.940 --> 39:35.940
That's the problem.

39:35.940 --> 39:40.320
But I think Crossroads has a good point in the sense that if you have, you're going to

39:40.320 --> 39:43.640
have to, we're going to, we're going to be the people telling people to switch so we

39:43.640 --> 39:46.600
could just give them an example of what they could look like.

39:46.600 --> 39:50.720
And I think the best option to get people to switch would not be here's what you should

39:50.720 --> 39:54.880
use and not even give them distros, just don't even mention the distros, just get like a

39:54.880 --> 40:00.240
grid of, or here's like a slide show of here's what you could get, here's what GNOME looks

40:00.240 --> 40:03.760
like, here's what Unity looks like and then just let's say which one do you like the best

40:03.760 --> 40:05.760
and then focus on the distro after that.

40:05.760 --> 40:06.760
Huh.

40:06.760 --> 40:07.760
That's a great idea.

40:07.760 --> 40:08.760
So is that me?

40:08.760 --> 40:12.400
Go ahead, you said your sister switched because of Unity?

40:12.400 --> 40:20.800
Yeah, actually, when I was actually first getting into Linux, I was running Ubuntu off

40:20.800 --> 40:25.400
a USB stick and she saw it and she's like, oh, that looks awesome.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.720
Can I have it?

40:26.720 --> 40:28.680
And so I set her up with a dual boot.

40:28.680 --> 40:35.240
She actually only uses Windows for Netflix, but and she uses it all the time.

40:35.240 --> 40:36.240
She loves it.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.240
Yeah.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.240
Yeah.

40:38.240 --> 40:39.240
Yeah.

40:39.240 --> 40:40.240
I don't doubt it.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.240
That's just funny to me.

40:41.240 --> 40:42.240
So Matt, I want to ask you something.

40:42.240 --> 40:46.520
This is a very general, reasonable conversation about different desktop options, about why

40:46.520 --> 40:49.840
Cinnamon makes sense, about why Unity makes sense, why Ubuntu makes sense.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.440
These are all very logical.

40:51.440 --> 40:58.360
So why is it you still hear so many people recommending some off the wall distribution?

40:58.360 --> 41:02.600
Like I mean, I don't mean to label Bodhi as off the wall, but you know, in the grand

41:02.600 --> 41:05.400
scheme of like support when you're searching the Internet, you're not going to get a lot

41:05.400 --> 41:06.400
of Bodhi results.

41:06.400 --> 41:11.020
Why are we seeing this, Matt, when Ubuntu seems, or Mint maybe, seems like a pretty

41:11.020 --> 41:12.320
practical choice?

41:12.320 --> 41:15.040
Well, I think it depends on who's doing the recommendation.

41:15.040 --> 41:19.200
There's usually two separate groups that do the recommendations for a distribution.

41:19.200 --> 41:23.600
The Linux users themselves, which they either love or hate Ubuntu, there's not a lot in

41:23.600 --> 41:24.600
between.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.480
So you have that person with their vested interest.

41:26.480 --> 41:30.320
The second group of people is generally the folks that are doing articles, speaking to

41:30.320 --> 41:31.560
someone that writes articles.

41:31.560 --> 41:36.480
If you're not writing about Ubuntu, you're not writing because no one's going to hire

41:36.480 --> 41:37.480
you.

41:37.480 --> 41:38.480
That's just reality.

41:38.480 --> 41:42.720
I hate to be the one to break that to everyone, but welcome to reality, kids.

41:42.720 --> 41:43.720
That's what people want.

41:43.720 --> 41:45.200
It's open source and Ubuntu.

41:45.200 --> 41:49.200
Yeah, it just seems so mono, it seems so monotone.

41:49.200 --> 41:52.720
Now unless it's enterprise stuff, then you can use Ubuntu, but otherwise it's Ubuntu

41:52.720 --> 41:53.720
or open source.

41:53.720 --> 41:54.720
That shows you though, right?

41:54.720 --> 41:56.080
That shows you what the interest of the reader is.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.160
Yeah, it really is.

41:57.160 --> 41:58.760
And that's, and quite frankly, that's what ranks.

41:58.760 --> 42:00.760
I mean, that's what people are searching for.

42:00.760 --> 42:04.400
And for why that is, is debatable, but the point is, is that's certainly what's going

42:04.400 --> 42:05.400
on.

42:05.400 --> 42:08.080
So I think you have those two groups of people that generally you have to work with.

42:08.080 --> 42:12.080
It doesn't necessarily mean, that doesn't necessarily mean that those other distros

42:12.080 --> 42:13.280
shouldn't be suggested.

42:13.280 --> 42:21.160
I mean, if the computer is old enough, I mean, Ubuntu might not be a solution purely because

42:21.160 --> 42:22.880
Unity needs a decent hardware.

42:22.880 --> 42:27.080
I feel like the elephant in the room here and heaven's revenge is like thinking like

42:27.080 --> 42:28.120
I don't read the chat room or something.

42:28.120 --> 42:31.680
I think the elephant in the room here is it's SUSE, right?

42:31.680 --> 42:34.600
I mean like where does open SUSE fit in?

42:34.600 --> 42:37.560
Is it, is it something that is for the enthusiast?

42:37.560 --> 42:40.200
Is it something that is for these new switchers?

42:40.200 --> 42:42.880
They've got their evergreen release now.

42:42.880 --> 42:48.400
I'm very surprised that there's been no open SUSE representation at all here at the moment.

42:48.400 --> 42:51.400
That's all representing Ubuntu right now.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.640
Well, except for the shirt I'm wearing.

42:53.640 --> 43:00.480
Well, it's just as big or even bigger than Canonical in terms of corporate power.

43:00.480 --> 43:05.120
They also have a one for the windows power use and their distro when it comes to major

43:05.120 --> 43:09.560
release upgrades have never screwed up like a Ubuntu upgrade as for me.

43:09.560 --> 43:10.560
Yeah.

43:10.560 --> 43:13.160
And they have a good presence in enterprise and they have a lot of partnerships there.

43:13.160 --> 43:15.440
So there's a lot of folks who would be using it in an IT setting.

43:15.440 --> 43:16.680
They might want to use it on their desktop.

43:16.680 --> 43:18.840
They could be a great windows candidate switcher.

43:18.840 --> 43:20.260
Here's the reality.

43:20.260 --> 43:24.200
And I've had a lot of open SUSE experience over the years and I have never not had at

43:24.200 --> 43:28.440
least one major groundbreaking issue with every single solitary installation I've ever

43:28.440 --> 43:29.440
had.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.440
On their own software?

43:30.440 --> 43:32.800
Always, always, always something breaks.

43:32.800 --> 43:33.800
It just happens.

43:33.800 --> 43:35.160
I mean, it happens for everybody.

43:35.160 --> 43:36.800
I'm just saying from my own experience.

43:36.800 --> 43:39.800
So when I'm going to then experience that and then recommend it to somebody, it's kind

43:39.800 --> 43:41.520
of like, it's really pretty.

43:41.520 --> 43:42.520
I like it.

43:42.520 --> 43:46.680
I love what they do with a lot of their features and stuff, but at the end of the day, it's

43:46.680 --> 43:47.680
an RPM distro.

43:47.680 --> 43:48.680
I'm sorry.

43:48.680 --> 43:49.680
I just can't.

43:49.680 --> 43:50.680
I agree with you, Matt.

43:50.680 --> 43:51.680
I agree.

43:51.680 --> 43:52.680
Yeah.

43:52.680 --> 43:56.520
The only issue I've ever had with is the DILD service failing every once in a while.

43:56.520 --> 43:58.800
That's a different thing though.

43:58.800 --> 44:01.400
I've had open SUSE break more often than Arch.

44:01.400 --> 44:02.400
I don't know how it's that.

44:02.400 --> 44:03.400
Seriously.

44:03.400 --> 44:09.280
I mean, I'm willing to work at it, but my God, it's like, I remember just basic sound

44:09.280 --> 44:10.280
issues.

44:10.280 --> 44:11.280
I was finally like, screw this.

44:11.280 --> 44:12.280
I'm done.

44:12.280 --> 44:17.280
I've had a few things where open SUSE is great, but there are certain aspects that it's kind

44:17.280 --> 44:23.160
of falls behind because they push a lot of interesting ideas and they're innovative.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.160
Some of them are awesome.

44:24.160 --> 44:25.160
The SUSE studio is awesome.

44:25.160 --> 44:26.160
The DILD service is awesome.

44:26.160 --> 44:27.160
Yeah.

44:27.160 --> 44:28.160
DILD is awesome.

44:28.160 --> 44:29.160
I like DILD.

44:29.160 --> 44:30.160
I have no problem with that at all.

44:30.160 --> 44:35.400
One of the things they have a lot of awesome ideas, but they have some fundamental issues

44:35.400 --> 44:37.600
that they just don't address.

44:37.600 --> 44:41.280
I've never been to an issue that I've never been able to solve, ever.

44:41.280 --> 44:44.160
Well, you haven't been able to solve.

44:44.160 --> 44:46.240
That's based on individual user experience.

44:46.240 --> 44:50.100
That doesn't mean that everyone around you is also having that experience as well.

44:50.100 --> 44:52.560
I think everybody's mileage is going to vary.

44:52.560 --> 44:57.000
I definitely give you all the benefit of the doubt that you are as capable as I am.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.880
That's very gentlemanly of you, sir.

44:59.880 --> 45:06.840
But also, in KDE, you can simply right-click that menu and get a nice XP-looking menu.

45:06.840 --> 45:09.480
It doesn't have to be the Lancelot paneling menu.

45:09.480 --> 45:10.480
It can be XP-ish.

45:10.480 --> 45:11.480
Yeah, sure.

45:11.480 --> 45:12.480
Yeah.

45:12.480 --> 45:13.480
Yeah, but it's still KDE, though.

45:13.480 --> 45:18.600
KDE is a pretty big barrier if you don't know what you're doing.

45:18.600 --> 45:21.520
I tried showing that to people, and they're just like, why the hell would I use that?

45:21.520 --> 45:24.120
You know, whatever the hell they call that.

45:24.120 --> 45:25.120
Oh, activities?

45:25.120 --> 45:26.120
Activities, yeah.

45:26.120 --> 45:28.360
It's like, it's a cool idea if you're really geeky.

45:28.360 --> 45:29.360
It's awesome.

45:29.360 --> 45:30.360
Yeah, but I've tried it.

45:30.360 --> 45:32.280
Anyone else that's actually ever been outside?

45:32.280 --> 45:33.280
It's not.

45:33.280 --> 45:34.280
Some use it.

45:34.280 --> 45:35.280
So I'm like, no.

45:35.280 --> 45:38.040
I've seen people use workspaces when I just introduced them, and then they're like, oh,

45:38.040 --> 45:39.040
that's awesome.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.040
And they'll jump to it.

45:40.040 --> 45:44.300
But I think it goes back to the whole, there's so many options and so many things that we

45:44.300 --> 45:50.360
just have to say, here's what the easiest thing to do if we can't talk to them, and

45:50.360 --> 45:51.840
that might be Ubuntu.

45:51.840 --> 45:55.580
And then they even turned off workspaces by default, I'm pretty sure, unfortunately, before.

45:55.580 --> 46:02.060
So there's certain things that if, like, Ubuntu might be just like, we should, if you can't,

46:02.060 --> 46:05.280
you know, you can't help them out, you can't find out what it might fit them perfectly,

46:05.280 --> 46:08.100
like a YouTube video, it could be Ubuntu.

46:08.100 --> 46:13.080
That might be the best option, because you got the upgradability, you got the ease of

46:13.080 --> 46:14.080
use.

46:14.080 --> 46:15.080
You got the Google tools.

46:15.080 --> 46:17.000
Well, Crossroads wants to disagree with you.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.060
Crossroads, what do you think?

46:18.060 --> 46:23.080
You think the software at opensusa.org and KD and Yast, specifically maybe Yast, do you

46:23.080 --> 46:25.680
think that's the advantage for the Windows switcher?

46:25.680 --> 46:32.680
Well, I mean, yeah, Yast is much like the Windows control panel.

46:32.680 --> 46:43.320
And software.opensusa.org appeals to the Windows users being used to searching it on the web

46:43.320 --> 46:46.240
and then being able to install it just like a.exe file.

46:46.240 --> 46:49.960
Yeah, but I would argue that a lot of people would ignore the control panel completely,

46:49.960 --> 46:52.780
like an average user would just never touch the control panel.

46:52.780 --> 46:56.200
But I think what I've been trying to get to and what I've been trying to wrap my brain

46:56.200 --> 47:03.480
around on this whole discussion is, I think, you know, Ubuntu has had a pretty bumpy road

47:03.480 --> 47:10.120
in terms of PR and community perception.

47:10.120 --> 47:14.640
And so my question was, as I'm looking at the 14.04 release, right, I'm looking at this

47:14.640 --> 47:21.880
and I'm thinking, how relevant is Ubuntu's role today in the general Linux desktop and

47:21.880 --> 47:23.560
those people coming to Linux?

47:23.560 --> 47:28.640
And to me, what I'm hearing from you guys is that it is just as relevant today as it

47:28.640 --> 47:31.680
was the day 12.04 was released.

47:31.680 --> 47:32.680
If not more so.

47:32.680 --> 47:33.680
Yeah.

47:33.680 --> 47:34.680
I really, I really feel that way.

47:34.680 --> 47:35.680
And even though I might personally...

47:35.680 --> 47:36.680
I don't even use it on a daily basis.

47:36.680 --> 47:37.680
Right, exactly.

47:37.680 --> 47:42.400
Like even though I personally am really glad I'm on Arch today because I have GNOME 3.12

47:42.400 --> 47:49.160
and that makes me a happy boy, I can't help but acknowledge the still significant role

47:49.160 --> 47:52.000
that Ubuntu plays in its piece.

47:52.000 --> 47:56.360
And maybe you could still argue that it's, for the desktop user, the most significant

47:56.360 --> 47:57.360
role.

47:57.360 --> 47:58.360
Probably.

47:58.360 --> 48:02.640
I think another thing, like, I just went to the, I mean, I know this is just Reddit,

48:02.640 --> 48:03.640
but I went to the Linux subreddit.

48:03.640 --> 48:08.560
It's got a list of the most popular distributions in it and I opened the subreddits related

48:08.560 --> 48:09.800
to each specific distribution.

48:09.800 --> 48:10.800
I just grabbed some.

48:10.800 --> 48:18.760
And if you look at the numbers, Debian has 7,000 readers, Fedora is 4,000, SUSE is 1,000,

48:18.760 --> 48:23.240
elementary is 2,000, and Mint is 5,000.

48:23.240 --> 48:31.840
And then Ubuntu is, sorry, yeah, sorry, Mint is 5,000, and then Ubuntu is 45,000.

48:31.840 --> 48:40.200
And that, it definitely makes a big difference when you can go anywhere and you don't even

48:40.200 --> 48:43.400
have to be in a Linux-related context.

48:43.400 --> 48:48.440
Like you could be on some forum, like I was on HarlowCP the other day on their forum,

48:48.440 --> 48:51.720
and somebody had said something about, oh, you know, I was trying to do this or that

48:51.720 --> 48:54.480
or whatever in Linux and it didn't work.

48:54.480 --> 48:58.880
And some other guy posted, oh, you should try apt-get, da-da-da-da, and that worked

48:58.880 --> 49:02.280
for him because of the fact that they were both on Ubuntu.

49:02.280 --> 49:03.280
Yeah.

49:03.280 --> 49:09.060
They, I mean, of course it's not necessarily a good thing that people think Ubuntu is Linux,

49:09.060 --> 49:10.060
as we know.

49:10.060 --> 49:11.060
Right.

49:11.060 --> 49:12.440
But the fact of the matter is that people do.

49:12.440 --> 49:16.280
And so if they're on a completely different forum, a completely, you know, they can be

49:16.280 --> 49:20.400
on a forum about CAS or something and mention they're on Linux, the other person who responds

49:20.400 --> 49:23.160
to them is likely also going to be running Ubuntu.

49:23.160 --> 49:24.160
And look at that.

49:24.160 --> 49:25.160
And they might even assume that they're running Ubuntu.

49:25.160 --> 49:28.080
Look at that, the top of the Ubuntu subreddit.

49:28.080 --> 49:29.680
Windows XP refugees start here, right?

49:29.680 --> 49:32.960
I mean, that's exactly the kind of landing pad I've been talking about.

49:32.960 --> 49:38.120
I mean, the subreddit for Ubuntu actually has more users than Linux, doesn't it?

49:38.120 --> 49:39.120
All the Linux subreddits.

49:39.120 --> 49:40.120
I mean, like the Linux subreddit itself.

49:40.120 --> 49:41.120
Yeah.

49:41.120 --> 49:42.120
No, no.

49:42.120 --> 49:43.120
45,000.

49:43.120 --> 49:44.120
No, it has 100.

49:44.120 --> 49:45.120
Yeah.

49:45.120 --> 49:46.120
42.

49:46.120 --> 49:47.120
42.

49:47.120 --> 49:48.120
Yeah.

49:48.120 --> 49:49.120
No, the Linux one, the Linux subreddit is much more popular.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.120
Ubuntu subreddit is actually pretty friendly.

49:50.120 --> 49:53.120
I mean, even if they disagree with you, they're not all ripping on you.

49:53.120 --> 49:54.120
Yeah.

49:54.120 --> 49:55.120
Yeah.

49:55.120 --> 49:56.120
I'm not too big a fan.

49:56.120 --> 50:01.400
So I think what's interesting is, so our email area, and I agree, is does that make Ubuntu

50:01.400 --> 50:03.880
the ultimate distro that shames all others?

50:03.880 --> 50:04.880
No.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.960
But it makes it a hell of a damn good choice for switchers.

50:06.960 --> 50:10.760
And people just need to get over themselves, stop rooting for the underdog in all cases,

50:10.760 --> 50:14.720
run the underdog yourself, let them run Ubuntu for a while, let them get used to the terms,

50:14.720 --> 50:17.720
let them get used to the command line if they need to, let them get used to the ecosystem,

50:17.720 --> 50:19.920
and then let them expand out.

50:19.920 --> 50:23.080
It doesn't diminish the other distributions, it just means that perhaps those aren't the

50:23.080 --> 50:24.840
best landing spots when they're switching.

50:24.840 --> 50:28.360
And that's, I think that's what, does anybody disagree with that?

50:28.360 --> 50:32.400
I would say that it's good, it's probably the best landing spot for someone you can't

50:32.400 --> 50:33.400
help.

50:33.400 --> 50:37.160
But if it's somebody who you can help, it might not be, because you can put them out

50:37.160 --> 50:40.020
to, if there's an issue, they would come to you anyway.

50:40.020 --> 50:46.760
And for example, like Bodhi, or Bodhi, I don't know, that would be a good distro for someone

50:46.760 --> 50:54.240
who has a low resource hardware, because then they don't have to worry about the, you know.

50:54.240 --> 50:55.240
The overhead of Unity.

50:55.240 --> 50:56.240
Yeah, the overhead.

50:56.240 --> 50:59.560
But that's the same thing with Lubuntu and stuff.

50:59.560 --> 51:04.320
That have actual other desktops that are still Ubuntu-based anyway, if you put lbuntu on

51:04.320 --> 51:05.320
it, it'll run.

51:05.320 --> 51:06.320
Well Bodhi's Ubuntu-based.

51:06.320 --> 51:07.320
Yeah.

51:07.320 --> 51:08.320
Oh, okay.

51:08.320 --> 51:12.440
Well technically, Bodhi's, I think it was like, there's like three different levels.

51:12.440 --> 51:16.040
It was based on something else, which was also based on Ubuntu, so technically, yeah.

51:16.040 --> 51:21.040
So what would be the advantage between that and Sail, like some of the other desktop options

51:21.040 --> 51:22.040
for Ubuntu?

51:22.040 --> 51:23.040
It's Enlightenment, I suppose?

51:23.040 --> 51:24.040
I think it's just Enlightenment.

51:24.040 --> 51:25.040
Yeah.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.040
Enlightenment.

51:26.040 --> 51:27.040
Okay, that's good.

51:27.040 --> 51:28.040
Yeah, I mean it's fun.

51:28.040 --> 51:30.560
Enlightenment runs pretty great on, that was the point of the article, was that Enlightenment

51:30.560 --> 51:32.160
runs pretty good on lower-end hardware.

51:32.160 --> 51:35.040
Which you're gonna have from an XP to a switcher.

51:35.040 --> 51:36.040
Yeah, exactly.

51:36.040 --> 51:37.040
Yeah.

51:37.040 --> 51:39.320
There's a lot of stuff in Enlightenment and LXDE and stuff like that, but I think Enlightenment

51:39.320 --> 51:40.960
doesn't actually have an official flavor.

51:40.960 --> 51:45.000
So Bodhi's the only one that I know of that is officially, like their main focus is Enlightenment.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.600
See, I'm on board with Crossroads.

51:46.600 --> 51:49.920
I think people get a new machine and they want to just love the hell out of it.

51:49.920 --> 51:50.920
What do you think, Crossroads?

51:50.920 --> 51:51.920
Is it the eye candy?

51:51.920 --> 51:53.200
Is it the more advanced features?

51:53.200 --> 51:55.040
What is it that's gonna make people switch?

51:55.040 --> 51:56.040
Crossroads.

51:56.040 --> 52:04.520
It's GNOME 3, KDE, GNOME 3, KDE, and Unity are pretty, and that's, at least for kids

52:04.520 --> 52:08.540
my age, is what is going to drive them towards Linux.

52:08.540 --> 52:12.480
When they see my computer, and I'm running GNOME 3 right now, they're like, whoa, that

52:12.480 --> 52:13.480
looks so cool.

52:13.480 --> 52:14.480
How can I do that?

52:14.480 --> 52:17.280
How can you do that with your computer?

52:17.280 --> 52:22.480
It's things like, I mean, XFCE is great and it's customizable and I love it, but it's

52:22.480 --> 52:24.600
not what's going to push people to Linux.

52:24.600 --> 52:25.600
Yeah.

52:25.600 --> 52:29.400
Yeah, and then of course, it's like the point you've been making is that for different folks,

52:29.400 --> 52:32.440
some people will want the slower stuff or the more resource-friendly.

52:32.440 --> 52:34.480
Okay, I want to put this topic to bed.

52:34.480 --> 52:39.520
I feel like we've kind of reached a consensus, and I feel like I've kind of reached a good

52:39.520 --> 52:40.520
understanding.

52:40.520 --> 52:43.040
We don't have a lot of time left in the show, so I'm just going to point people over to

52:43.040 --> 52:44.040
the show notes.

52:44.040 --> 52:47.400
It's just, and it's probably good because I've probably talked about it too much recently,

52:47.400 --> 52:53.080
but you know, this Heartbleed vulnerability has just been getting so much coverage, and

52:53.080 --> 52:58.520
it seems like the coverage is now sort of pivoted from discussing the technical details

52:58.520 --> 53:02.360
and how disastrous it is to playing a little bit of the blame game, and you're seeing a

53:02.360 --> 53:05.880
lot of articles crop up on the web right now.

53:05.880 --> 53:10.320
Articles that kind of cast open source and the open source development model in a bad

53:10.320 --> 53:11.320
light.

53:11.320 --> 53:13.740
We talked a little bit about some of that on Sunday.

53:13.740 --> 53:19.720
Like here's one on ZDNet from Larry Seltzer, he says, open source does not provide any

53:19.720 --> 53:24.240
meaningful inherent security benefit for OpenSSL, and it may actually discourage some important

53:24.240 --> 53:26.040
testing techniques.

53:26.040 --> 53:33.320
So panhandling is not a good business model for important software like OpenSSL.

53:33.320 --> 53:38.200
And of course he's framing it in a very adversarial way, and he's painting it in the most light

53:38.200 --> 53:41.360
possible, and you're seeing a lot of these crop up.

53:41.360 --> 53:45.160
I've got a collection of them in the show notes, and I wanted to say, I guess what my

53:45.160 --> 53:48.860
point was in all of this, and I won't lean on this too much because I know we've talked

53:48.860 --> 53:53.660
about this before, but I think people need to focus on with this whole Heartbleed thing

53:53.660 --> 53:57.840
is that while maybe open source is getting dragged through the mud on this, we should

53:57.840 --> 54:02.880
maybe be focusing on the whole turnaround for the patch time, like how rapidly the response

54:02.880 --> 54:06.480
was, and the fact that we now have the ability to audit for these kinds of things in the

54:06.480 --> 54:07.480
future.

54:07.480 --> 54:10.000
And maybe they'll pop up, maybe they won't, right?

54:10.000 --> 54:11.400
But now we can look.

54:11.400 --> 54:15.360
Well, I got two words for everyone, especially the guy that wrote that article, it's called

54:15.360 --> 54:22.520
Blaster Worm, and it's called DMVs, hospitals, police stations, pretty much any civic entity.

54:22.520 --> 54:26.480
It was like literally the apocalypse when it happened.

54:26.480 --> 54:31.560
A month later, everybody was fine, Microsoft's great, we love Microsoft.

54:31.560 --> 54:37.360
So if these same idiots that are writing this crap can forgive a company that allowed something

54:37.360 --> 54:42.600
that, and keep in mind, when that happened, the patch was available.

54:42.600 --> 54:43.960
That's how pathetic this was.

54:43.960 --> 54:49.960
So things happen, but I think blaming licensing over it is just silly, I really do.

54:49.960 --> 54:55.480
Yeah, and I'll run, we'll leave it at this, because I've got to go do some work on the

54:55.480 --> 54:56.480
studio.

54:56.480 --> 55:00.040
So we can't talk about it too much, and I've probably over-talked it anyways, it's stayed,

55:00.040 --> 55:04.040
it's welcome, but if you would like to read some of those articles, and think about it

55:04.040 --> 55:05.760
yourself, I'll have links in the show notes.

55:05.760 --> 55:09.760
Look, we'd love to hear from you, this show, a huge portion of the show runs on your feedback

55:09.760 --> 55:15.800
and your involvement, and if you can't join us live over at jblive.tv Tuesdays on a 2

55:15.800 --> 55:19.840
