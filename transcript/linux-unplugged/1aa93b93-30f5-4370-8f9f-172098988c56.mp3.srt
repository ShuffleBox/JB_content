1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,180
Before we start talking about Linux today,

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,660
we have to talk about storage.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,220
Brent found this story about optical media

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,180
making a strong comeback.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,420
Researchers at the University of Southampton

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,900
are showcasing a new nano-structured glass disk

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,540
that has the ability to store data for billions of years

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,460
with a laser writer.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,220
So it's like optical media is back, Wes.

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,060
Well, I mean, of course Brent would be promoting optical media.

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,060
Not only can you store it forever,

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,540
but you can put a lot on there, like 360 terabytes of data.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,180
I mean, we all want more data all the time, right?

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,820
Yeah, and not only that, but how about them temperatures, too?

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,020
1,000 degrees Celsius, that's 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit.

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,580
It'll remain stable in up to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit.

17
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,540
That's a good archival media right now.

18
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,220
13.8 billion years at room temp.

19
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,140
It's like the next evolution of microfilm, but way better.

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,460
Maybe they'll be able to fit a single 8K video on there.

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,880
I assume they're eventually going

22
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,060
to get to where the original Superman movie where

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,060
they have the crystals that they put in and have

24
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,820
all the data in the Fortress of Solitude.

25
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,500
I think they're eventually going to get there.

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,900
That's absolutely what these are,

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,780
isolinear chips, Superman crystals, they're glass data.

28
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,700
And they show up a bit, like in the show notes,

29
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,740
we'll have a link to a video they have in there.

30
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,580
And they're holding it up, it's translucent.

31
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,860
It just looks like a piece of glass

32
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,900
where they've etched a title onto it, but they didn't need to.

33
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,940
That's just for looks.

34
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,780
I'd like all of Star Trek just on one

35
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,700
of those sitting on a shelf on the wall.

36
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,860
I think you'd have no problem fitting all of Star

37
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,860
Trek on one of those.

38
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,620
No.

39
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,700
You know what, actually, kind of ironically,

40
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,100
in like 15 years from now, somebody

41
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,420
could listen back to this and be like, oh, that's so quaint.

42
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,540
It'll be like the Computer Chronicles is to us now.

43
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,300
No doubt.

44
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,500
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 307 for June 25, 2019.

45
00:01:51,500 --> 00:02:05,780
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

46
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,500
My name is Chris.

47
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,420
My name is Wes.

48
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,060
Hello, Wes.

49
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,380
Looking very dapper today.

50
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,100
And are you ready to talk about Mixcloud?

51
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,140
Oh, I'm excited.

52
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,260
Yeah, we have an episode that we've been

53
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,660
prepping for in the most real sense.

54
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,380
You may recall we've recently reloaded our main server here

55
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,140
at the JB Studios.

56
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,300
And we have put it to good use.

57
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,300
Immediately.

58
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,740
Yeah, we will tell you about those adventures today.

59
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,420
But before we can get that far, we

60
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,860
got to do the one, the only introductions.

61
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,440
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

62
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:36,940
Hello.

63
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,440
Hello.

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,940
Hi there.

65
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,440
Hello.

66
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:38,940
Hello.

67
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,260
And of course, Alex, Drew, and Cheese are here as well.

68
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,140
Hello, hello.

69
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,780
Good day, everybody.

70
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,300
Hi there.

71
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,300
Hi there, everyone.

72
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,140
Well, we have a real panel of knowledge experts on this one.

73
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,060
We're going to need them today.

74
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,220
There's a lot going on.

75
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,620
You just heard from a whole bunch of Nextcloud users there.

76
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,820
This is really going to be, I don't know,

77
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
I feel like the one where I finally nailed it.

78
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,980
I am so excited to talk about this.

79
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,440
After many years of failed attempts

80
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,060
to move away from Dropbox to implement Nextcloud,

81
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,060
only to go back and have to eat crow right here on the air,

82
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,740
I feel like we have finally nailed it.

83
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,020
And I cannot wait to share our setup with you.

84
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,940
Dropbox, they finally just did it with this last update

85
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,660
where they want to take over everything

86
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,700
and they want to be like your online file system

87
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,740
and ship Electron as part of the Dropbox sync client.

88
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,180
I thought, OK, all right, maybe not.

89
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,500
Let's look somewhere else.

90
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,260
But before we get there, let's start

91
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,380
with some outrageously great community news today as well.

92
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,340
A round of applause to the Raspberry Pi folks

93
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,340
for tricking us all.

94
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,820
The rumors were we wouldn't see anything this cool

95
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,100
until like next year.

96
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,220
And so we kind of just thought, all right,

97
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,620
well, we got what we got.

98
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,380
And well, wait.

99
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,580
But yesterday, the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B was launched.

100
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,420
And it's actually a pretty decent upgrade

101
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,060
from the Pi 3, which they're saying this new device can now

102
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,780
provide desktop performance comparable to an entry level

103
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,540
x86 PC system.

104
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,700
Oh, that's exciting.

105
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,700
OK, but how does it perform as a server, right?

106
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,820
Could we replace this new box we've got?

107
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,420
Could we have just waited a little bit

108
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,860
and got this new Raspberry Pi?

109
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,980
No, it basically, while it's a huge upgrade,

110
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,180
it's still a Raspberry Pi at its heart.

111
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,220
Although, there's a lot to like, right?

112
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,820
So DDR2 RAM, that's been upgraded to DDR4.

113
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,340
And the new Cortex A72 CPU is anywhere

114
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,340
from double to quadruple the speed of the older A53.

115
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,260
Plus, there's gigabit ethernet that

116
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,080
isn't hamstrung by that darn USB 2.0 bus

117
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,300
that everyone's been ragging on for years.

118
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,420
You can actually saturate some traffic now.

119
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,100
Yeah, genuine gigabit ethernet is a big deal.

120
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,900
And keep in mind, all of that is still

121
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,700
at the starting price of $35, which is still

122
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,580
a pretty good deal.

123
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,000
One of the things they're doing differently now, though,

124
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,380
is they're including different SKUs, three different SKUs,

125
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,980
up to 4 gigabytes of RAM, which is the model I purchased.

126
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,460
Did you get the 4 gig?

127
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,100
I got the 4.

128
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,700
I mean, you're going to say no to that.

129
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,580
And it's only, I mean, what was it, like $55?

130
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,620
Not that much more.

131
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,060
Cheese, did you pull the trigger?

132
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,260
I haven't purchased one yet, but I plan on it.

133
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,800
Alex, you were probably too busy on vacay to pull the trigger.

134
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,380
I was.

135
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,660
I use a Pi to run my 3D printer.

136
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,220
I have a 3B plus right now.

137
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,780
I think a 4 will be in my future.

138
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,740
I'm going to see if this 8 gig rumor shakes out, though.

139
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,060
There is a rumor in the manual.

140
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,380
They talk about an 8 gig model, which

141
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,860
that might be what we see in, oh, boy, 2020.

142
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,700
Drew, are you a Raspberry Pi fan?

143
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,780
Yeah, I've got a few lying around the house,

144
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,660
but I think they're all 1s and 2s.

145
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,820
I didn't actually buy any 3s.

146
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,740
Thinking about the 4, but I don't know.

147
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,300
I mean, I don't have a project for it yet,

148
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,700
except that it's cool.

149
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,620
Yeah, I bought it because I'm going to try it as a desktop.

150
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,060
I'm going to test this claim.

151
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,660
You know, I'm going with reasonable expectations.

152
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,540
I'll tell you one thing it will be really great for.

153
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,340
It has x265 hardware decoding.

154
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,940
So we've all had h264 for years and years.

155
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,220
And now x265 offers significantly smaller files,

156
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,900
and this thing has hardware decoding.

157
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,500
So it will make an absolutely great media box.

158
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,700
They're also saying potentially 4K video out.

159
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,100
Early benchmarks, seems like some of the reviewers

160
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,860
have had issue getting that 4K video to actually work,

161
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,620
but jury's out in my opinion on that one.

162
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,860
I think something else they did with the announcement

163
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,300
is they had a little bit of a,

164
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,700
is it fair to call it a publicity stunt

165
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,300
or would it be a proof of concept?

166
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,460
Proof of concept, I don't know.

167
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,140
I think it's just a fun thing to do.

168
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,540
The launch site for the new model

169
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,740
is mostly running on a cluster of 18 Raspberry Pis themselves.

170
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,580
So why not self-host it with the product you're selling?

171
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,980
14 handle PHP code execution, two more serve static files,

172
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,700
and then two run our old friend memcached.

173
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,260
Of course.

174
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,220
Of course, that's all sitting behind Cloudflare.

175
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,660
As you do. Which is caching.

176
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,940
And also, I think the databases aren't on that cluster either.

177
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,140
But if you're serving cached content, it still worked.

178
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,620
It's legit.

179
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,820
I think the way to look at it is not really proving anything.

180
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,820
It's just saying, look, these are capable little devices.

181
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,280
Maybe don't use them for production,

182
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,260
but they're great for small little tasks.

183
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,860
Yeah, I see quite a few people on Home Lab

184
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,780
and all that kind of thing on Reddit using three, four,

185
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,660
five different Pis to run small Kubernetes clusters.

186
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,940
So there are definitely use cases for that kind of thing.

187
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,220
I'm kind of feeling that the Raspberry Pi, as time goes on,

188
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,620
is becoming sort of the universal Linux computer.

189
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,420
The Raspberry Pi 4B now kind of makes

190
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,260
it competitive with a lot of the other boxes

191
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,220
that are out there at a pretty competitive price point.

192
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,620
This isn't the fastest.

193
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,580
But Raspberry Pi is a brand.

194
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,940
It's an ecosystem.

195
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,620
It is a standard now.

196
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,740
It's integrated in production equipment.

197
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,780
And it's also in classrooms with students tinkering.

198
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,860
And it's at an accessible price that a massive range of people

199
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,900
can afford.

200
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,220
And the sort of pop a disk in, like a floppy disk,

201
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,660
and boot off of an operating system approach

202
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,620
where you can flash it from a Windows or a Mac

203
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,060
and then just pop it into a little Raspberry Pi

204
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,420
is approachable.

205
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,940
It's just so easy, and you get such leverage

206
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,020
for such a low entry fee.

207
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,060
And it brings something that we so rarely

208
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,260
have to the Linux desktop.

209
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,420
And that's why I'd really love to see as the Raspberry develops

210
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,380
when the 5 and the 6 come out, maybe one day

211
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,820
we'll even have a Raspberry Pi 10.

212
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,620
Could you only imagine what that thing's going to be for $35?

213
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,300
I just think it's something that Linux doesn't typically have,

214
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,860
and that is a single problem domain for the desktop.

215
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,500
It's the opposite of fragmentation.

216
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,340
It's one company, one product, and we're not locked into it.

217
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,600
That's what's so great about it.

218
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,580
It's available to us.

219
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,380
And because of its brand, and its ecosystem, and its user

220
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,860
base, it's becoming this common platform.

221
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,580
It's not the Apple style where only one company makes

222
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,900
all of the hardware, and only their operating system

223
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,740
runs on all of that hardware.

224
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,820
It's like it's Linux still available to everybody.

225
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,580
I really like where the Raspberry Pi is

226
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,500
going as a broader product.

227
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,620
When you look at it individually with the different boards

228
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,820
and stuff, you can argue about which one's technically

229
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,540
superior.

230
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,980
But when you zoom out and look at it

231
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,140
as a platform and an ecosystem, it's

232
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,420
creating something for Linux as it becomes powerful enough

233
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,380
for the desktop.

234
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,100
It's creating something we've never had, in my opinion.

235
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,980
Very excited about it.

236
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,900
So that's why I ordered what they call their desktop kit.

237
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,940
You get the Pi 4B with a keyboard and mouse,

238
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,380
and you get that micro HDMI adapter.

239
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,740
Wish they hadn't done micro HDMI.

240
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,940
That's the one thing I'm not really a big fan of.

241
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,380
And they've added two micro HDMI outs.

242
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:04,900
Yeah.

243
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,860
I would have loved some kind of a SATA interface

244
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,820
instead of a second HDMI port, but maybe that's just me.

245
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
You know, it's going to give it ethernet.

246
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,900
There's a lot of ways I can get storage onto that Pi now.

247
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,660
I think one of the original issues, too,

248
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,300
is that with the original CPU, you were tied down

249
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,740
to USB 2.0 throughput, so that's why you could never really get

250
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,500
gigabit speeds out of it.

251
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,420
And now that it's upgraded, with USB 3.0,

252
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,060
obviously, yeah, you can get that speed out of it,

253
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,540
no problem.

254
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,940
And I mean, there are tests that have been run out there

255
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,980
that actually show that they're able to get their full gigabit

256
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,820
speed out of it.

257
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,860
Are you happy with this?

258
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,700
You follow these types of boxes, or I guess boards,

259
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,540
pretty closely.

260
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,140
Are you happy with this release?

261
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,580
Yeah, I mean, I own several of these.

262
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,980
I own Raspberry Pis, Orange Pis, Nano Pis,

263
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,100
you name single board computer.

264
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,900
I probably have one of them from one company or the other.

265
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,580
I think it's a great step for the Raspberry Pi foundation.

266
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,220
This is obviously a response to the popular RK, the Rockchip

267
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,100
3399 that's in some of the other boards out there,

268
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,660
and set top boxes and stuff.

269
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,780
It seems to stack up pretty well.

270
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:24,580
I will say, though, that that cluster that they set up,

271
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,100
the photo that they tweeted out of that

272
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,180
just drove me crazy because of the cable management and the.

273
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,820
Don't look, man.

274
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,060
Don't look.

275
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,860
Yeah, just don't look.

276
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,860
It's a nightmare.

277
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,340
But no, I mean, I think this is going

278
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,660
to be a really good board, and it's going to be something,

279
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,300
like you said.

280
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,140
I mean, Raspberry Pi already has an ecosystem built around it.

281
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,300
There are so many companies that produce Raspberry Pi hats that

282
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,740
are continuing to do that.

283
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,380
And I think that this is just going to be a continually

284
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:58,140
growing project from them, where I think they focus more,

285
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,980
kind of take that Debian approach,

286
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,740
and focus more on reliable tried-and-true hardware

287
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,020
before they just step off into the next thing.

288
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,340
Like you have some of these other single-board computer

289
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,500
manufacturers, OrangePod to name one,

290
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,220
that just iterate so quickly on these boards.

291
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,500
And they're all over the place.

292
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,660
They've saturated the market with these different boards

293
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,180
and stuff.

294
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,100
Some of them are good.

295
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,900
Some of them aren't.

296
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,740
But it just kind of dilutes the whole thing.

297
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,220
So it's really nice to see Raspberry Pi just chugging

298
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,300
away, doing what it does, coming out

299
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,140
with what's sure to be a great board once it gets out

300
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,940
on the scene and everybody starts using it.

301
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,460
So I'm really looking forward to seeing what they do.

302
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,620
Man, I can't even imagine a Raspberry Pi 10,

303
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,300
what that's going to entail.

304
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,660
A couple of use cases that I haven't super seriously

305
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,780
considered the Raspberry Pi 3 or previous Raspberry PIs for.

306
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,740
Number one now is, to me, this seems like a clear contender

307
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,980
for a Codibox.

308
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,900
You've got real performance on this thing now, real ethernet,

309
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,540
real HDMI out, and it just seems like a clear contender.

310
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,420
So that's something I'm going to have to try.

311
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,120
And then also, you and I were just

312
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,820
talking about this a couple of days ago.

313
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:18,060
We kind of need a computer that is low noise, low heat,

314
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,540
doesn't have to be super powerful.

315
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,700
We just need to show graphs and different inputs

316
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,180
and different meters and just readouts of different data

317
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,420
that we have.

318
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,660
And a Raspberry Pi that can run two monitors,

319
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,060
that would be perfect.

320
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,780
That could be exactly what we need.

321
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,420
And it could take the job of a louder, more power hungry

322
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,460
x86 PC easily.

323
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,380
That's kind of cool.

324
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,340
You know, I just thought of another use case,

325
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,380
too, is considering that these are fanless,

326
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,420
this would not be a bad choice for something

327
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,100
to run Reaper on in a little mini recording booth.

328
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,260
Yeah, that's got to be tried, I think.

329
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,580
They do have an ARM version.

330
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,220
They do.

331
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,780
And also, our mixer makes the mixer's GUI software

332
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,540
for the Linux ARM as well.

333
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,580
Yeah, that's why I said we could get meters right

334
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,740
off the mixer on a Raspberry Pi.

335
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,900
It's pretty great.

336
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,360
There's also a link in the show notes

337
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,380
to CNX Software, which got one of these units

338
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,340
and did a series of benchmarks on it.

339
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,260
I don't really know what to take from this.

340
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,540
A couple of temperature benchmarks.

341
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,560
Remember, there's ambient.

342
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,360
There's other things you have to consider.

343
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,580
But at idle, it ran at 62 Celsius.

344
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,060
And then when the benchmarks were being downloaded and loaded,

345
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,140
you know, accessing disk and network, 64 Celsius.

346
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,660
And then when John the Ripper was ripping, 73 Celsius.

347
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,540
And he appears to observe some CPU throttling

348
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,700
as temperatures have gone up.

349
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,900
He kind of describes it as a particular type

350
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,100
of peak performance, bursting performance, I guess.

351
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,020
Yeah, it'll operate perfectly fine.

352
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,020
You don't need extra cooling.

353
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,020
It's designed for sprint performance, right?

354
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,580
You're going to get a few extra workloads done here and there,

355
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
but you're not loading it all the time.

356
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,180
If you are keeping the CPUs ramped up,

357
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,220
you'll probably want some extra cooling.

358
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,380
Yeah, yeah.

359
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,700
Otherwise, passive cooling does seem to be sufficient.

360
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,300
And he also did test that gigabit ethernet

361
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,740
and was getting pretty reasonable transfer speeds,

362
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,660
you know, between 95 megabytes a second,

363
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,660
93 megabytes a second on the send and receive,

364
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,140
which is perfectly, perfectly good.

365
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,180
And did run into some 4K video playback issues.

366
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,300
But again, early days on that.

367
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,980
So I'm going to wait and see on that one.

368
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,700
I'm tempted to pick one up, 3D print a little housing

369
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,020
for a USB hard drive, and then just send it

370
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,980
to my parents' house, plug it into the network,

371
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,860
and then just use BitTorrent Sync as a remote endpoint.

372
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,380
Oh, yeah, great little management,

373
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,420
whenever I'm having something in someone's house.

374
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,980
I could definitely see it being a little Sync endpoint,

375
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,540
or a little Nextcloud endpoint, potentially, as well.

376
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,620
Well, we have to move on because, of course, there

377
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,740
was some dramatic breaking news.

378
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,820
Everybody freak out.

379
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,500
Ubuntu is dropping I-386 architecture support.

380
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,140
Oh, no.

381
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,660
Yep, if you are on a Intel series processor,

382
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,260
no longer will there be 32 support.

383
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,940
Steam is pulling out all support for Ubuntu.

384
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,380
And Valve developers are upset.

385
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,340
And Wine developers are, wait, what's that?

386
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,940
It's the Linux gaming apocalypse?

387
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,740
I'm sorry.

388
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,980
I'm sorry, I was just going off an article that was posted

389
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,540
by PC Gamer just 20 hours ago.

390
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,740
Hold on, Wes, just one second.

391
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,660
I'm getting, I'm getting, I've got to get, I'm sorry.

392
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,860
I've got to get pulled aside.

393
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,940
Apparently, there's an update.

394
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,820
The Cone of Silence.

395
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,980
OK, what's going on?

396
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,180
So I'm getting word here that all of this

397
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,800
is a complete overreaction.

398
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,300
Oh, yeah, there's some updates.

399
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,800
Oh.

400
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
We should get into them.

401
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,300
Oh, OK.

402
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,660
All right, well, maybe we'll just cut all that out, OK?

403
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,900
All right, let's go.

404
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,020
Yeah, so this week, there was a big upset

405
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,580
when it appeared that Canonical would be removing support

406
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:02,980
for i36 packages in Ubuntu 19.10, and subsequently, 20.04 LTS.

407
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,480
So kind of the series of events is,

408
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,320
this is something that's been discussed for quite a while.

409
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,060
We covered the timeline on LAN a little bit.

410
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,420
But from what I can kind of see, it

411
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,920
seems like you really kind of see the conversation kick off

412
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,180
around May of 2018.

413
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,080
And we've seen other distributions

414
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,500
make similar moves already.

415
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,740
Yeah, in fact, OpenMandriva just announced they're dropping.

416
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,360
Now, arm architecture, you've got arms keeping 32-bit.

417
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,660
That's not going away.

418
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,040
This is just for the Intel x86 side of the camp.

419
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,220
And so you see conversations.

420
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,900
And the message really seems to be from the Ubuntu developers

421
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,360
is, our sense is, kind of I'm paraphrasing for them,

422
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,780
our sense is that these packages are not well-maintained.

423
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,740
They don't really have a lot of eyes on them.

424
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,940
There is security issues that they're

425
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,540
known to be vulnerable to, like Spectre and Meltdown,

426
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,140
that they're not receiving mitigations

427
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,500
for, amongst other issues.

428
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,580
And we kind of think to protect the overall platform,

429
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,500
moving forward, we should remove these packages

430
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,740
because they're likely a security risk.

431
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,020
Although we can't prove it, they likely are.

432
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,660
Conoco didn't want to come out and scare everyone.

433
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,740
But in their own way, that's essentially

434
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,380
the message they were relaying is, hey, nobody's

435
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,340
really looking at these.

436
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,620
I mean, we're shipping them.

437
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,980
And we're putting the work to package them and make

438
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,700
sure they're built against your current distro.

439
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,340
And we're making sure they're in the repo.

440
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,300
And that's all good, but they might not

441
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,780
be very well-maintained.

442
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,340
And that conversation sort of went off from the mailing list

443
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,820
onto the web and then onto podcasts.

444
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,700
We've talked about it a little bit.

445
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,300
And then this last Tuesday, just after the show wrapped up,

446
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,420
Ubuntu desktop lead developer or manager, Will Cook,

447
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,980
went onto their community Discord and our discourse

448
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,780
and said, here's the plan.

449
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,980
We're going to start officially deprecating support for I36.

450
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,620
A couple of days go by, nobody really

451
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,300
says much except for a few other people

452
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,700
from Canonical chime in on the conversation.

453
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,760
And then on Friday, a staffer from Valve

454
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,100
posts on Twitter that the removal of I36 support

455
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,900
would be untenable and that Steam

456
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,380
would have to look at dropping support for Ubuntu moving

457
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,300
forward in 1910 on.

458
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,020
Yikes.

459
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,140
That was the moment that really set the internet on fire.

460
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,260
Because all of a sudden, it looked like Steam

461
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,180
was dropping support.

462
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,660
So then you immediately had half a dozen articles go live saying

463
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,420
that Valve was officially dropping support for Ubuntu.

464
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,900
And within a short time after that,

465
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,260
a change.org petition was created to force Canonical

466
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,900
to keep 32-bit support in the distribution.

467
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,760
And there was sort of a back and forth

468
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,700
about if this was good or not for the longevity of Linux

469
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,640
desktop.

470
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,780
And by Sunday, Canonical had decided

471
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,380
they would walk it back a bit.

472
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,140
And then on Monday morning, they made an official announcement

473
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,860
that they would be keeping the 32-bit I36 packages for Ubuntu.

474
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,820
They wrote, thanks to a huge amount of feedback

475
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,500
this weekend, that's how they start the blog

476
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,580
post on their Canonical blog.

477
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,620
And then later on, they say, community discussions

478
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,300
can sometimes take unexpected turns.

479
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,340
Ain't that true?

480
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,940
And then they later write, we also

481
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,060
look forward to working with Wine, Ubuntu Studio,

482
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,440
and gaming communities to use container technologies

483
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,940
to address the ultimate end of 32-bit libraries.

484
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,860
And that's important right there.

485
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,580
Yeah.

486
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,260
So I want to continue this conversation.

487
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,840
But I thought maybe what we should do

488
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,460
is not a lot of people are really

489
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:31,980
discussing what it takes to run a 32-bit x86 program

490
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,480
on a 64-bit x86 Linux system.

491
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,500
So suppose that you have a modern 64-bit x86 Linux system

492
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,100
and that you want to run an old 32-bit program on it.

493
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,580
I do.

494
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,020
Maybe a game or something like that.

495
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,060
It's got some libraries.

496
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,540
So what does it require from an overall system,

497
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,020
both from the kernel and the rest of the environment,

498
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,220
to actually run a 32-bit application on a 64-bit box?

499
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,900
All right, well, at a minimum, that

500
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,860
requires your 64-bit kernel to support programs

501
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,340
running in 32-bit mode and making 32-bit kernel calls.

502
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,760
OK, so there's some kernel stuff.

503
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,620
Oh, yeah, of course.

504
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,700
And supporting those calls is not always easy

505
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,820
because there's all kinds of different structures involved.

506
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,380
And those structures have to be translated back and forth

507
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,780
between the native 64-bit version

508
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,500
and the emulated 32-bit version.

509
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,540
Wow, imagine when you're playing a Windows Proton

510
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,340
game that's 32-bit on Linux.

511
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,540
There's so many layers of translation happening there.

512
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,660
Oh, yes.

513
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,060
And a lot of those, they're not always pretty.

514
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,140
I'm sure there's many in the kernel community who

515
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,060
wish that it would just be kind of simpler.

516
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,660
It'd be cleaner not to do this.

517
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,180
There's more complications around eye octals

518
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,300
and dealing with pseudo terminals

519
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,100
and other sorts of devices like that.

520
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,460
And more complications with the VDSO,

521
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,460
where you have stuff that gets mapped into just

522
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,300
about every program running, even

523
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,680
for statically linked programs that don't necessarily

524
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,040
make use of nice sorts of optimizations

525
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,580
for dynamically linked programs.

526
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,900
System doesn't know, so it's just got to load it.

527
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,500
Yes, and that means the kernel has

528
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,060
to carry around another 32-bit ELF image, which

529
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,160
has to be generated somewhere.

530
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,340
And that's where a lot of this stuff

531
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,260
gets the most complicated, I think,

532
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,780
because you have to get all of these programs.

533
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,500
You have to make all of these shared libraries.

534
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
You have to generate and compile all this stuff,

535
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,020
and that's never going to be simple.

536
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,660
Well, and it gets even significantly more complicated

537
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,620
because it's a little simpler if the 32-bit application,

538
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,340
like you were saying, is statically linked.

539
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,860
However, if it's a dynamically linked 32-bit application,

540
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,680
then there needs to be 32-bit libraries all the way down,

541
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,860
and they're all loading all of this extra baggage and crap

542
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,140
all the way down, including if you

543
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,580
have an application that needs to do a name lookup.

544
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,700
There needs to be a 32-bit name lookup library.

545
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,020
Oh, yeah, all those NSS modules you have in nsswitch.com.

546
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,820
Yeah, you've got to take care of those.

547
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,680
There's lots of complications with glibc.

548
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,140
Maybe there's some other libraries

549
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,620
you have, stuff like Curses or X11,

550
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,940
or the standard library for, say, C++.

551
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,340
There's just lots of stuff lurking all over,

552
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,580
and a lot of it might need a 32-bit compiler or toolchain.

553
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,700
Now, in theory, it's often possible

554
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,340
that you can do cross-compilation,

555
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,660
but it's just a lot of infrastructure

556
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,980
that actually has to be supported

557
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,860
to make all of this work at the level

558
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,380
that you expect on a modern Linux desktop.

559
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,980
Well, if you try to file a bug against a 32-bit application

560
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,700
that was built on a 64-bit system,

561
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,460
they'll tell you to go screw yourself.

562
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,620
You're supposed to, if it's going to work in production,

563
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,220
you build a 32-bit app on a 32-bit system.

564
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,100
I mean, it is possible, but in practice, there's problems.

565
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,020
On top of that, many build systems just

566
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,940
don't really even support it, so there's that as well.

567
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,700
So forgive my perhaps ignorant question,

568
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,060
why do Valve care so much about the 32-bit thing?

569
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,700
Is Steam a 32-bit app or something?

570
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,620
Keep in mind, this was an employee at Valve.

571
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,580
This wasn't an official Valve announcement

572
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,740
about a Valve partner.

573
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,140
This was an employee venting on Twitter.

574
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,300
But it's the games.

575
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,060
It's the games.

576
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,340
The games need the 32-bit libraries,

577
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,140
because a lot of the games are 32-bit.

578
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,900
And everybody that has played a handful of Steam games

579
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,020
has definitely run into this.

580
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,020
I mean, I know I have 32-bit libraries on my system

581
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,020
right now just for Steam games.

582
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,420
Canonical's Insight data that they

583
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,780
get from the surveys that people opt into in 1804

584
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,340
shows that less than 3% are getting the 32-bit version

585
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,900
of the ISO.

586
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,660
That's the ISO.

587
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,000
Doesn't tell you how many of them

588
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,180
are 64-bit systems running 32-bit libraries,

589
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,180
but that tells you how many people are going directly

590
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,500
to 32-bit.

591
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,900
It tells you, really, as a whole,

592
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,100
it affects your entire system to run a single 32-bit

593
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,660
application.

594
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,900
We'll have a great breakdown linked in the show notes

595
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,860
if you want to dive into just everything that has to go on.

596
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,220
There's a real technical cost.

597
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,980
There's a genuine technical cost.

598
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,440
And sure, we all have memory to burn,

599
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,140
and we all have processor to burn these days.

600
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,280
But I don't know.

601
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,380
I like my system to be as efficient as possible.

602
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:46,780
Right.

603
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,100
As always, supporting this stuff,

604
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,420
it's a cost-benefit analysis.

605
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,420
And if people are using it, and it's useful to have,

606
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,420
then you should do it, but it's never free.

607
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,940
Somebody tell me if I'm wrong.

608
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,740
But let's just pretend we live in a world where

609
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,860
internet outrage didn't drive immediate reaction

610
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,340
by corporations.

611
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,540
And Canonical really stuck to their guns on this.

612
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,240
And they said, no, no, no, no.

613
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,140
You don't understand.

614
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,500
We're going to maintain the libraries in 1804.

615
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,300
There'll be ways to get those libraries on 1910.

616
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,220
It's not a big deal.

617
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,940
The libraries aren't changing that much.

618
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,120
We'll be backporting security fixes.

619
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,940
You just get it that way.

620
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,380
What if they had done that?

621
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,140
Because to me, it seems like, because that

622
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,140
was the original proposal, to me, I

623
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,060
see a few ways that problem could have been solved.

624
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,860
We could have had our cake and eat it, too.

625
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:34,820
We could keep 1910 64-bit pure, and then wrap all this stuff up

626
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,700
in a snap.

627
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,860
One Steam snap that has all the 32-bit libraries you need.

628
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,300
Or how about the flat pack that literally already exists?

629
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,140
There is a flat pack already that you

630
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,340
can install on a pure 64-bit system,

631
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,140
and you can play 32-bit games.

632
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,540
It exists today.

633
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,460
Of course it does.

634
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,580
What about a PPA?

635
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,980
How about a PPA that just installs the 1804 libraries?

636
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,180
Could have done that.

637
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,220
Valve could update the Steam runtime

638
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,380
to just simply include the now missing 32-bit libraries.

639
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,380
They have chosen certain libraries to include already,

640
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,620
but then opted to allow the OS vendor

641
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,100
to supply the rest that they consider to be less important.

642
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,460
Perhaps Valve could reconsider.

643
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,820
It seems like the community does think they're important.

644
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,460
Perhaps they could just package them up

645
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,980
like they've been already packaging a lot of libraries.

646
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,820
So what I don't quite understand,

647
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,020
and I'm genuinely seeking feedback here,

648
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,860
is what was the risk?

649
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,520
It seemed like there was always going

650
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,940
to be a pretty solid solution.

651
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,540
In fact, some that are already working today.

652
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,340
So I don't quite understand what the upset was about,

653
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,700
why we needed a change.org petition,

654
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:46,540
why we harassed canonical employees over the weekend

655
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,780
about this.

656
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,060
PC Gamer just posted an article this morning,

657
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,820
even after canonical clarified, just

658
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,260
trying to get clicks and drive controversy.

659
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,580
You had people that were trying to get others

660
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,940
to switch distributions.

661
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,780
Come to Manjaro, it'll solve your problems.

662
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,060
I mean, that was all over the place.

663
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,280
And I don't understand why we, as a fairly technical community,

664
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,420
are susceptible to this, because it seems like,

665
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,960
and I guess maybe I'm just idealist,

666
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,540
but it seems like the immediate conversation should be,

667
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,780
all right, well, how do we solve this with technology?

668
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,500
How do we get together as a community

669
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,180
and collaboratively solve this problem?

670
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,860
Right, or at least maybe the beginnings of, hey,

671
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,540
this could cause problems for us.

672
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,460
What are our avenues?

673
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,140
Do you have, how can we migrate our software?

674
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,100
Because usually, and I know this is true for canonical,

675
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,380
people care about others running their software,

676
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,660
and they want to help, right?

677
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,500
You could be a part of this in a positive way

678
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,340
and engage and have help from canonical

679
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,140
to find the best solution.

680
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,660
It's harder to do when you start in such an aggressive tone.

681
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,580
Well, what I don't understand is that people

682
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,020
are so up in arms over this now, where

683
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,380
this is something that's been talked about for quite a while

684
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:53,860
now.

685
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,300
Yeah, I think it was that developer at Valve's tweet

686
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,820
that sort of, that kicked off the headlines.

687
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,180
Why are we taking faith in this guy's statement

688
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,780
when it's not a direct statement from Valve?

689
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,580
I mean, I've gone to Valve's blog.

690
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,900
They've stated nothing about any of this.

691
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,220
I guess to be fair, there was also

692
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,740
a conversation going on on the wine development mailing list,

693
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,220
too, about some serious, right?

694
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,740
But yeah, again, I come back to there were ways,

695
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,700
there always was going to be ways to solve this.

696
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,940
And at some point, we do need to move forward.

697
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,740
Just for funsies, was it you that

698
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,980
went and dug up the original announcement

699
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,900
about transitioning to 64-bit?

700
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,740
Yeah, way back in the day over at Linux.com.

701
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,100
And it's quaint, because it's written in a way where they

702
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,420
clearly don't think we'll be.

703
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,740
The 32-bit support's like a transitional technology.

704
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,140
These will hang around for a while and then be gone.

705
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,660
Yeah.

706
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,660
Like, no, here we are in 2019.

707
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,260
Yeah, almost like 15 years later.

708
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,020
Yeah.

709
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,940
You do kind of wonder, when is it time to go?

710
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,220
And I know the elephant in the room here

711
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,220
is that Mac OS Catalina drops in the fall, and it's 64-bit only.

712
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,500
And Apple's like, just shut up and make it work.

713
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,620
Deal with it.

714
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,060
And they don't even have the same technical.

715
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,460
They don't have the Snaps, Flatpaks, Docker images.

716
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,180
They don't have Chirrut environments.

717
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,420
We have a lot of ways to solve this problem.

718
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,980
I think what kind of gets me, I'm

719
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,420
going to just take this moment to remind everybody,

720
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,780
currently a very happy Fedora user on my daily driver,

721
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,340
and just moved my server over to Fedora.

722
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,900
However, you have to acknowledge that Canonical takes it

723
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,140
in the face on this stuff all the time.

724
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,260
They move something forward like this

725
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,700
that maybe is a little bit earlier than anybody else,

726
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,500
or because of the size of their user base,

727
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,540
it's genuinely the first time it matters.

728
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,260
They take the brunt of the reaction.

729
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,900
And then in a year when Fedora announces

730
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,380
they're going 64-bit only, crickets.

731
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:48,940
The day OpenMandriva announces it, crickets.

732
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,300
Canonical's reputation constantly takes it

733
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,140
as they move this stuff forward.

734
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:59,020
And people love to trot out old wounds like Mirin Upstart.

735
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,220
It even came up on the YouTube comments.

736
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,260
Pulsatio.

737
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:02,860
Yeah.

738
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,860
And at what point do you go, you have

739
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,460
to weigh the good with the bad.

740
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,100
They make a decision, they listen to the feedback,

741
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,500
and they change it.

742
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,780
That seems to be the balance.

743
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,240
That seems to be the right balance.

744
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,500
And in this particular instance, I

745
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,820
kind of wish they'd stuck a little more to their guns,

746
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,380
because you've got to think about the long-term picture

747
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,180
here.

748
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,860
These distributions, like 2020, the LTS version,

749
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,420
are going to be supported until, what, 2025?

750
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,040
And then and now they're doing 10 years,

751
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,180
so it could be even longer.

752
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,860
So when they commit to shipping these 32-bit libraries

753
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,340
in these LTS distributions, they're

754
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,460
committing to paying staff to maintain those libraries,

755
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,900
even if they import them from Debian once a cycle.

756
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,180
Yeah, that's still a lot of money, time, and effort.

757
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,760
For years.

758
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,820
So they have to cut at some point,

759
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,940
because there is a knock-on effect for years.

760
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,780
A long tail, yes.

761
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,780
A very long tail here.

762
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,260
And somebody's got to do it eventually.

763
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,780
That's what makes it so funny, too.

764
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,580
We had this discussion in such a rapid, quote, unquote,

765
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,620
discussion, in such a rapid-fire manner,

766
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,620
when this is all stuff happening over months and years

767
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,220
of timeline.

768
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,980
So there's plenty of time to figure it out.

769
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,820
The fervor really kind of started Saturday morning,

770
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,660
London time, which is where Canonical's offices are.

771
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,900
Saturday morning.

772
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,380
And they had provided clarification

773
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,980
by Monday morning, PST, Pacific time.

774
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,400
That's a very, very small window of time

775
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,380
to respond, to come to a consensus,

776
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,740
and then issue a statement.

777
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,820
Which is funny, because a lot of people

778
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,660
are getting on them for not responding faster.

779
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,060
What do you expect?

780
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,060
You need to go watch our video on burnout,

781
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,020
because this is getting ridiculous.

782
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,540
Anyways, so yeah, the end result is essentially

783
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,480
they're backpedaling to a degree.

784
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,940
And they do leave a line in the second to last paragraph

785
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,180
in their update, they write, there

786
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,660
is a real risk to anybody who is running

787
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,340
a body of software that gets little testing.

788
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,620
Again, they're trying to tell you in a professional,

789
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,600
non-fearmongering way that they don't think, in their opinion,

790
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,560
that these are safe libraries, that this stuff is not

791
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,380
getting enough attention, and they really

792
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,140
recommend that we stop using it.

793
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,460
And we're kind of forcing them to continue to ship it.

794
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,540
That sucks.

795
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,820
Yeah, it must be pretty frustrating.

796
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,140
We've been thinking about it.

797
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,420
It's not like they rushed into this.

798
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,060
You might say that they did, or that they

799
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,780
could have done some things better,

800
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,660
or communicated more, or whatever.

801
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,200
It really wasn't rushed into you.

802
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,340
It's just silly.

803
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:33,980
All right.

804
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,940
I know by the time people are listening to this,

805
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,100
it's probably been talked to death.

806
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,420
So if you have thoughts in the Mumble Room you want to chime

807
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,460
in, let's do it in the post-show,

808
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,700
because I know people are probably sick of the topic.

809
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:47,100
But that's where it stands of us right now, at least.

810
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Any other thoughts?

811
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,600
Yeah.

812
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,300
Maybe just go play some games on your sweet gaming Linux rig.

813
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,860
I'm going to go play some 32-bit games while I still can.

814
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,380
I actually thought it would be kind of a laugh

815
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,260
to start a change.org petition that demanded that Canonical

816
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,020
goes all 64-bit.

817
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,860
Do the opposite.

818
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,620
Get that gross 32 off my system.

819
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,660
Promote it here in the show, and get quadruple

820
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,220
the amount of signatures.

821
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,380
But I thought, you know what?

822
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,140
Canonical's probably just ready to move the F on.

823
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,560
They don't need me trolling them.

824
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,060
I am too.

825
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,140
Yeah, me too.

826
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,940
All right, and with that, let's do a little housekeeping.

827
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,460
We've got some good stuff.

828
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,860
We won't be doing the Friday stream.

829
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,540
I mention that here because a lot of times

830
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,260
the crew here on this show is who's on the Friday stream.

831
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,220
So it's like a sneaky second Linux Unplugged.

832
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,940
But this week we're going to be in Texas,

833
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,780
so no Friday stream this week.

834
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,020
But Friday 8 just came out.

835
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,140
Best thing about a Monday, Friday stream comes out.

836
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,020
Random access memories.

837
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,980
Wes is there.

838
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,780
Drew's there.

839
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,340
Cheese is there, I'm there.

840
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,820
And we share the stories of our very first PCs.

841
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,980
Yeah, it's a retro show.

842
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,060
It's all sentimental.

843
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,220
It's a lot of nostalgia, a lot of fun.

844
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,420
We solve some problems for the world.

845
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,380
Of course we do.

846
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,200
And I won't spoil it, but there is a competition

847
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,340
to give away a game in the show.

848
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,380
And one of the hosts here on the show wins.

849
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,460
We won't say anymore.

850
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,620
We won't say anymore.

851
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,540
Fridaystream.com is a really, really fun episode.

852
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,020
Go check that out.

853
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,180
And then catch up while we have an off week.

854
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,140
Why not, right?

855
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,260
Oh, yeah, that's a great tip.

856
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,820
We're doing it at 1 PM Pacific time.

857
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,220
Check out meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting, too.

858
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,980
We have a security meetup coming.

859
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,540
We just had our burnout, understanding burnout,

860
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,140
I should say.

861
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,140
What's actually the name?

862
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,860
The understanding burnout meetup.

863
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,580
And it was really good.

864
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,340
Really good.

865
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,140
Fantastic.

866
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,020
I mean, Drew's got a heck of a file he's got to go through.

867
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,100
But once we get a chance to process it and all that,

868
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,540
we'll get it up on the YouTube channel.

869
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,100
It's a lot, Drew.

870
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,580
I'm sorry.

871
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,900
It's a long one.

872
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,060
But it's so good.

873
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,020
It's really good.

874
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,060
This is an instance where the Mumble Room showed up.

875
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,420
We had just a really great participation.

876
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,740
And just, ah, so good.

877
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,380
And organic, helpful discussions.

878
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,620
We'll have a link to that in a future Linux Unplugged.

879
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,340
Or just keep an eye out at meetup.com slash Jupiter

880
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,940
broadcasting for that.

881
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,220
Also, a little sneaky tip.

882
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,380
This is a little birdie.

883
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,740
This isn't an official feature, but I

884
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,300
think you guys might like to know.

885
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,060
Linux Academy is going to be soft-rolling out

886
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,020
transcripts on the platform over the next couple of days

887
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,060
or the videos.

888
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,100
Killer feature when you're trying to study.

889
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,660
Now, it's just going to be initially in some videos.

890
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,420
They're working out the tech.

891
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,580
You know, they want it to be really solid.

892
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,080
Of course.

893
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,260
I've seen the demos, though.

894
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,220
It's nice.

895
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,380
The implementation is solid.

896
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,580
The tech is good.

897
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,180
But they're going to be measured about how they roll it out.

898
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,180
But a little sneaky little insider tip.

899
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,140
I notice that's rolling out soon.

900
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,620
I know people have asked in the audience.

901
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,540
Yeah, that's nice to have.

902
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,620
It's really nice to have that.

903
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:27,780
All right.

904
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,580
Anything else we want to mention in the housekeeping?

905
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,260
All right.

906
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,100
I'm calling it then.

907
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,020
So you probably heard in the last few episodes,

908
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,980
if you've been listening, that we

909
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,860
did a hot swap, a live swap, of our free NAS

910
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,860
box to a Fedora box.

911
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,620
At the time, we said, don't do what we did.

912
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,460
But it actually worked great.

913
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,180
So maybe you should.

914
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,340
Jeez, it's been good.

915
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,380
And we'll keep you, you know, if it goes wrong, we'll tell you.

916
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:50,880
Of course.

917
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,180
Of course.

918
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,020
Oh, my gosh.

919
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,140
It's been so good.

920
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,500
Because we really took the philosophy

921
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,300
of put all of the applications we're running

922
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,180
on this thing in a container.

923
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,780
Is NetData in a container, or is that actually

924
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,660
installed on the host system?

925
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,360
That's on the host.

926
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:05,860
All right.

927
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,860
So that might be the one app that is actually

928
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,820
installed locally.

929
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,780
But otherwise, it's pretty much just a pure Fedora server

930
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,900
install.

931
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,180
And then we have begun standing up back-end services

932
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,740
that I am already so elated over.

933
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,460
But the one that was sort of number one

934
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,660
with a bullet on our list was replacing Dropbox.

935
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,260
So it's not a, you know, as a business,

936
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,140
it's not the end of the world to pay $1,000 a year for storage.

937
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,340
But it's a big chunk of change.

938
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,220
And it's sizable.

939
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,340
You have to think about it.

940
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,580
It's not on the accounting.

941
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,260
Yeah.

942
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,180
Well, you know, $1,000 a year in hard drives

943
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,540
would be a much better investment, in my opinion.

944
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,660
And this is so silly.

945
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,580
Because now, I disagree with past Chris.

946
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,620
Past Chris is such an idiot, you know?

947
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,540
Future Chris, you don't know about that guy.

948
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,700
But present Chris is really, he's got to figure it out.

949
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,780
I'm hopeful for future Chris.

950
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,860
He's going to come through for us.

951
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,060
Right.

952
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,580
But present Chris, I really feel like he's

953
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,660
got everything figured out.

954
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,820
You know, he really knows what's going on.

955
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,980
And he had came to a realization that the reason why

956
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,580
he was sticking with Dropbox was really

957
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,700
because I just wanted something that was fundamentally

958
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,700
really good file sync technology that I could generate a web

959
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,300
URL so people that don't have an account

960
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,260
or don't have the software installed

961
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,140
could still get access to resources.

962
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:20,980
It's a combo, right?

963
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,900
It's this everywhere file system that follows you around.

964
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,140
And you can easily get stuff from it whenever you want.

965
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,080
And sort of sneaking up on me, I didn't even

966
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,140
realize what's happening, Wes, is it turns out

967
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,460
like a good mobile app matters.

968
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,340
Yeah, it does.

969
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,220
When I started file sync, it didn't matter.

970
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,540
But now here in the 2019s, I want a good mobile app.

971
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,740
You do stuff on your phone.

972
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,940
And the better it is, the more you can do.

973
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,700
So when Dropbox announced their latest update where

974
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,140
they would be packaging the Electron Runtime

975
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,500
and integrating with Google Docs and Google Sheets

976
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,820
and trying to connect all of your different online systems

977
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,020
together in one activity dashboard

978
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,100
that you could share with your colleagues,

979
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,700
I realized if the dropping of everything but Extended For

980
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,940
wasn't enough, this was it.

981
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,320
It's not your Dropbox anymore.

982
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,260
It's just not a product for me anymore.

983
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:12,860
It's not.

984
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,300
And I thought Nextcloud wasn't for me

985
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,540
because I didn't want the overhead of a whole website

986
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,960
and all of the collaborative stuff.

987
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,220
I just wanted file sync.

988
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,820
So I was convinced I would go with Sync Thing or Resilio

989
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,220
Sync.

990
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,180
I tried them all out.

991
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,620
And I thought about it from a collaborative space.

992
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,980
And I realized how important some of the mobile app features

993
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,740
were and the web interface was.

994
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,260
And in the end, Nextcloud won out.

995
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,300
So I came to you, Wes Payne.

996
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:42,420
I said, Wes, bestow upon us a Nextcloud instance.

997
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,580
That's how he talks all the time in real life, yeah.

998
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,220
It's weird.

999
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,820
And Wes, grant us with the performance

1000
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,340
that only a dedicated database can provide.

1001
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,660
These are the words that I conveyed to you.

1002
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,580
And you came back to me with a multi-container setup

1003
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,740
on our fake net.

1004
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,460
So can you walk us through our setup a little bit?

1005
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,860
And then we'll get into everybody else's setup.

1006
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,300
Yeah, actually, Nextcloud provides

1007
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:09,660
some pretty handy Docker Compose YAML files ready to go up

1008
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,980
in their repositories on GitHub.

1009
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,220
We'll have that linked, of course.

1010
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,220
So you can get it set up.

1011
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,840
There's all kinds of ways.

1012
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,240
It's a blessing and a curse with Nextcloud.

1013
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,380
There's also a really handy Linux server I.O. image

1014
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,820
we also have linked.

1015
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,300
And there's a snap.

1016
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,780
So there's all kinds of ways to get Nextcloud installed.

1017
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,300
Well, to that end, we'll hear from each of those

1018
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,060
in a moment.

1019
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,980
But you went with the official.

1020
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,620
Yeah, I thought we might as well give it a try, right?

1021
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,820
See what that road was like.

1022
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,540
And we ran into a few snafus, because I

1023
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,780
wanted to use Postgres, which is my database of choice.

1024
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,620
And we ran into an issue with using

1025
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,460
some of the automated setup to sort of populate our stuff,

1026
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,740
set up an admin user right out of the box.

1027
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,740
Had to do a little tinkering with the database.

1028
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,380
Were they expecting you to use a different database?

1029
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,660
Well, no, it just seems like that bug

1030
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,900
was only affecting Postgres, because you can also

1031
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,940
use MariaDB or SQLite.

1032
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,780
But we wanted good database performance,

1033
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,180
as that's supposedly quite important for doing

1034
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,620
heavy file syncing of large media files.

1035
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,500
Once we got through that, through all the configuration

1036
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,580
stuff, it's working great.

1037
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,500
So we have Redis in there.

1038
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,240
We have a Postgres container, the actual web container

1039
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,340
that has all the app and has PHP FPM running,

1040
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,540
and then some proxies in front of it that are handling

1041
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,180
lots of encryption, all the rest.

1042
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,060
Yeah, and it works beautifully, and the performance

1043
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,700
seems to be actually pretty wonderful.

1044
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,300
While we're talking the container method, though,

1045
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,460
Alex, do you know what would be the advantage of going

1046
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,740
with the Linux server IO container over the project's

1047
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,380
main container?

1048
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,860
This is an aspect of Docker that bewilders me.

1049
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,900
So full disclosure, Linux server IO

1050
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,660
is a website that I helped found several years ago.

1051
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,900
But the reason that I run the Linux server

1052
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,220
image instead of the upstream Nextcloud image

1053
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,580
is the permissions mapping that the Linux server images do.

1054
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,540
So the user that is running inside of a container

1055
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,580
will probably have a different UID and GID

1056
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,060
to that on the host.

1057
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,820
So we allow, through environment variables,

1058
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,660
which are specified at runtime, you

1059
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,580
can specify a specific user and group

1060
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,740
ID that matches that that's running inside the container.

1061
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,700
So it just makes permissions a lot more simple.

1062
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,060
All right, very good.

1063
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,540
A lot of the other things, almost all

1064
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,500
of the other things we're running

1065
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,380
are Linux server IO images.

1066
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:23,860
Oh, yeah.

1067
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,500
There's, I don't know, 10 of them on there.

1068
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,420
Yeah, that has been really good.

1069
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,140
Well, I expect nothing less, Chris.

1070
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,780
Well, that way, I know who to yell at if it doesn't work.

1071
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,780
I'm going to treat that.

1072
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,260
OK, so Cheesy, you did the snap method, right?

1073
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:42,900
Yeah, I did the snap method in super simple snap install,

1074
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,220
setting up your let's encrypt certs.

1075
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,420
I'd spoken with Wimpy at Linux Fest Northwest,

1076
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,420
and I told him how snaps are just kind of freaky to me

1077
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,100
because I'm used to being a little more hands-on

1078
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,860
with my setup and going through and editing files

1079
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,300
and setting up the configuration and everything.

1080
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,460
So it's just weird that literally just one command can

1081
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,900
pull it down and get it working.

1082
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,300
So that's what I've done.

1083
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,860
But one thing that I did notice with that particular snap image

1084
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,740
is that it's based on Nextcloud 15.

1085
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:22,780
I wanted to run 16, and you can do that.

1086
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,820
It took a little bit of a Google foo getting around

1087
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,580
and just reading some of the documentation

1088
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,060
there for the snap.

1089
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:34,900
But doing a snap refresh package name,

1090
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:40,420
tac-tac channel equals 16 forward slash candidate,

1091
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,300
then you can pull down the latest 16 and give it a go.

1092
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,940
You can even pull down edge versions or nightly builds.

1093
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,860
Yeah, and you can revert as well if it screws up.

1094
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,260
I've played a little bit with the snap as well.

1095
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:50,980
It's pretty nice.

1096
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,620
Yeah, it's super painless.

1097
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:57,140
And then what I've done is I've gone through and connected

1098
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,980
to some block storage elsewhere so that all of my data

1099
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,180
basically resides in that storage

1100
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,400
so that if I need to nuke or do something different

1101
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,580
with the snap or if I wanted to flip it over

1102
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:18,140
to being a Linux server.io Docker container,

1103
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:18,820
I could do that.

1104
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,980
Right, the data's still there.

1105
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,380
And my data's still there.

1106
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,460
Yeah.

1107
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,180
Chris and I, we were talking about how good a time

1108
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,100
it is to be running some of these server side

1109
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,140
apps on Linux because it's easy to reason about

1110
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,660
and it's safe because all of them

1111
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,740
have these nice mechanisms for protecting your data.

1112
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,500
Yeah, I mean, multiple times yesterday,

1113
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,540
we would just completely destroy a container

1114
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,060
and then stand it back up and just reattach it to the data.

1115
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,500
And it's like nothing changed.

1116
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,060
It's just incredible.

1117
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,260
Several years ago, I was pretty anti-Docker.

1118
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,260
I thought it was going to be a flash in the pan

1119
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,720
and a waste of time and just the next kind of noise

1120
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,140
in the industry, really.

1121
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,460
And then I started using, this was when I was using Unraid,

1122
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,580
so it was probably five years ago now.

1123
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,500
Docker was like 0.3 or 0.4 or something.

1124
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,820
It was a while ago.

1125
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:13,700
And I blew away probably 15 apps worth of configuration

1126
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,700
by mistake.

1127
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,380
However, it turned out that Unraid

1128
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:21,180
had mapped my volumes to a persistent storage somewhere.

1129
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,600
And I hadn't really realized what

1130
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,660
I'd done to set it up because I was a complete novice.

1131
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,420
I reinstalled Unraid and came back and had all of my apps

1132
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,420
exactly as they were within five minutes.

1133
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,580
And I'll tell you what, that single thing alone

1134
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,140
was just like a light bulb going off

1135
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,700
in my head of just to say, yes, containers.

1136
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,540
But storing the state outside of the application runtime,

1137
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,220
I am 100% on board with this.

1138
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,820
This is fantastic.

1139
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,500
So Drew, we haven't asked you yet.

1140
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,020
So we've got a couple of container-based installs.

1141
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,100
We've got a Snap installed.

1142
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,340
Have you done a traditional install for your Nextcloud?

1143
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,540
Or are you also a container guy now?

1144
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,620
Container all the way.

1145
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,900
Mine is set up very similar to the way

1146
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,060
Wes set up the Studio instance in that I've

1147
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:09,340
got Docker running Nextcloud, Redis, and PostgreSQL all

1148
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,900
behind a reverse proxy.

1149
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,420
So very, very similar.

1150
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:12,940
Wow.

1151
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,180
None of us have done a traditional package

1152
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,300
install or anything.

1153
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,020
I don't want to.

1154
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:22,260
I mean, especially for a PHP sort of app like Nextcloud,

1155
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:22,900
unpleasant.

1156
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,460
I literally never would.

1157
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,540
After this experience, I just never would.

1158
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,860
And I think my takeaway advice is,

1159
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,940
if you're running an instance for a group of people,

1160
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,740
like a small office, or a couple, or a family,

1161
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,060
the Snap version is really solid.

1162
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,020
I've experimented with it, used it myself.

1163
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,540
And if you're going for a larger team instance,

1164
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,700
like we're using here, then something

1165
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,620
with a traditional Postgres database

1166
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,940
is a better setup using a container, where

1167
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,700
you have a little bit of flexibility,

1168
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,780
because it is a fast-moving project that needs updates.

1169
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,180
And that's kind of the nice thing,

1170
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,060
is we can just track now.

1171
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,300
And if things go wrong, we'll just go back.

1172
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:57,820
Go back.

1173
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,340
Go back.

1174
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,220
Just a heads up for other listeners,

1175
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,060
MySQL works just fine as well, if you

1176
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,260
prefer that for your database.

1177
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:04,820
There you go.

1178
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,300
Yeah.

1179
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,540
Yeah.

1180
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,380
So there's a lot you can do with Nextcloud besides file sync.

1181
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,940
But that's how I came at it.

1182
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:15,340
I've always really been primarily interested in that.

1183
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,020
But I started now to look at it more as like a team

1184
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,300
collaboration piece of software.

1185
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,220
And when I changed my perspective to that,

1186
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,980
I think I started, that's really for me

1187
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,020
when I started to click.

1188
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,180
I started to see in a different light.

1189
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,940
And I've been watching how Drew and Cheese

1190
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,340
use Nextcloud quite a bit.

1191
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,140
You guys have really kind of integrated it quite a bit.

1192
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,540
I have a sense maybe you're one of the longer Nextcloud

1193
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,420
users on the show.

1194
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,580
I'm not sure, though.

1195
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,100
I get that sense, though.

1196
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,540
Six months, maybe.

1197
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,180
OK.

1198
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,340
Cheese, how long have you been running Nextcloud now?

1199
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,940
Probably three, four months.

1200
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,460
OK.

1201
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,540
So we're all kind of new to it.

1202
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,100
What about you, Alex?

1203
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,380
So I guess maybe, Alex, you're probably the longest term.

1204
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,540
Over a year.

1205
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,700
Before I emigrated, I digitized every single document

1206
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,340
in my house.

1207
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:06,620
And I have to say, when I was emigrating across the ocean,

1208
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,660
just being able to pull up a scan of this bill

1209
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,100
or that piece of ID at a moment's notice on my phone

1210
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,300
was so unbelievably useful.

1211
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,220
That sounds wonderful.

1212
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:14,780
Yeah.

1213
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:19,340
So when I started looking at it, and we're obviously the newest

1214
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,700
because we've only been running it for a week.

1215
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,060
So it's still very new to us.

1216
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,300
But I've ran Nextcloud on and off for years now.

1217
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,100
And now that I'm looking at it, it's

1218
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,020
more of like a team collaboration tool.

1219
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,500
These apps are starting to make sense.

1220
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,900
One that I'm looking into right now

1221
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,020
is called Workflow External Scripts.

1222
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,800
I'll put a link to this in the show notes.

1223
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,740
And this just allows you to pass files through this.

1224
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,020
And depending on the type of file and set of defined rules,

1225
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,260
it will take different actions.

1226
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,700
So I was imagining we could have a Nextcloud drop

1227
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,340
folder where this would be set up.

1228
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:53,620
And it would read the file name and then take actions based on

1229
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,340
and what type of file it is.

1230
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:54,940
Where it needs to go.

1231
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,620
Oh, that's a great idea.

1232
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,700
Absolutely something we could use, right?

1233
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,940
So that I put in there.

1234
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,620
The other one that I installed, but it sounds like maybe

1235
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,540
isn't so great, is there's an audio player

1236
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,020
that I thought would be great for us

1237
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,660
because we have a lot of media content in there.

1238
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,860
That's hit and miss.

1239
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,660
Doesn't seem to be working, does it, cheese?

1240
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:15,380
Well, I tried out the latest version of that audio player

1241
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:18,020
plug-in or app, as they call it.

1242
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,620
And on my particular instance, which

1243
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,800
is just a DigitalOcean droplet with one CPU

1244
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:29,860
and two gigs of RAM, there was this crazy runaway PHP FPM

1245
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:33,860
process that I can only associate with that player.

1246
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,140
That I guess, I don't know exactly what it was,

1247
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,100
but it pegged the CPU at 100%.

1248
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,940
So I mean, I think that there are still,

1249
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,900
maybe on the particular instance that you have set up,

1250
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,220
it might not be a big deal.

1251
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,980
You're the guy trashing the server now.

1252
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:48,740
Yeah.

1253
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,740
No, that's always me.

1254
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,620
I'm always the guy that's just totally soaking up

1255
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,420
the CPU.

1256
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,700
Yeah, some of these apps are a little hit and miss.

1257
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,340
And you do have to kind of check how they went.

1258
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,940
Sometimes you have side effects.

1259
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:04,020
There's something that Nextcloud doesn't do by default

1260
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,100
that seems sort of necessary for what our use case is,

1261
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,420
because we'll often be inviting people in,

1262
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,300
is it doesn't have registration on by default.

1263
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,780
When you go to Nextcloud, you just

1264
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,100
kind of have to have an account or someone

1265
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,460
has to have made one for you.

1266
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,340
And again, that's nice for like a small team.

1267
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,780
Yeah, private, right?

1268
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,380
So I turned on the registration app,

1269
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,860
and I said, if your email is this domain,

1270
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,860
you can register, essentially, is what I did.

1271
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:26,340
And that works.

1272
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,380
That's a great little feature for small teams.

1273
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,420
And you can make sure it goes into this group.

1274
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,900
You can turn on two factors as well.

1275
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,220
But here's, I wanted to find something kind of cool

1276
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,020
that you could never have in Dropbox.

1277
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,900
I turned this on for the whole team, because I'm that guy.

1278
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,580
It's called Keep or Sweep.

1279
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,100
Keep or Sweep.

1280
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,660
It's Tinder for your files, essentially.

1281
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,340
When you get bored and you're in Nextcloud,

1282
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,740
you hit this little random button that's up in the toolbar,

1283
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,380
and it'll just bring up a random file in your Drop,

1284
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,500
in your Nextcloud, almost a Dropbox.

1285
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,660
It'll bring up a random file in your Nextcloud,

1286
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,100
and it will ask you if you want to keep it or delete it.

1287
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,140
Oh, that's kind of handy.

1288
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,060
And you can sweep it or keep it.

1289
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,420
And I sat there, and I went through.

1290
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,460
And I started going through some old pictures.

1291
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,980
I don't need that picture anymore.

1292
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,060
Sweep it.

1293
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,100
Yeah, yeah.

1294
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,500
Speaking of pictures, I'm looking forward

1295
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,920
to when we go to events, turning on the phone auto upload

1296
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,740
feature in the app.

1297
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,740
And just have it like, as I'm taking pictures at events,

1298
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,620
just put them all up on Nextcloud automatically.

1299
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,900
But this one is a game changer.

1300
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,340
Now, this, I admit, is not applicable to all teams,

1301
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:29,780
or even probably anyone else on our team.

1302
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,420
But this one I'm very excited about.

1303
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,340
It's PhoneTrack.

1304
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,780
People might be familiar that I have a Rover tracker in the RV.

1305
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,300
And he likes everyone to know where he is all the time.

1306
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:41,580
I really only turn it on when I'm on trips, typically.

1307
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:45,620
Every now and then, we went somewhere in Oregon,

1308
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,140
and I turned it on.

1309
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,100
And somebody noticed.

1310
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,380
That was kind of cool.

1311
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,180
Because it is always up at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash

1312
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,680
Rover, at least the tracker is.

1313
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,620
But I pay for that.

1314
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,740
And it uses a proprietary service.

1315
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,340
And it has a hardware device.

1316
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,420
You've got like a dongle hanging around you.

1317
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,780
So PhoneTrack is an application for Nextcloud

1318
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,580
that will generate links that you can plug

1319
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:10,420
into corresponding apps on a phone or hardware device.

1320
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,380
And it will supply location data to this Nextcloud

1321
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,380
application.

1322
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,740
And then it will generate a real time map

1323
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,660
using OpenStreetMaps.

1324
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,060
And it looks really good.

1325
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,460
And you can get history.

1326
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:24,200
You can create an entire tracking session.

1327
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,660
You can display location history if you want.

1328
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:30,260
You can check distances and points.

1329
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,100
You can display session statistics.

1330
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,420
And of course, you can also make it public if you want.

1331
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:40,020
It'll generate a public page that I could make available,

1332
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,180
which is kind of neat.

1333
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,900
So we wouldn't necessarily have to use the proprietary tracking

1334
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,340
service.

1335
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,100
We could use this.

1336
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,580
That is a great application.

1337
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,220
I tried it out.

1338
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,700
I loaded an app on the old iPhone

1339
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,060
and said allow background tracking.

1340
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,740
And sure enough, it's accurate.

1341
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,100
It's very accurate.

1342
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,820
And I was able to then share the link with the team.

1343
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,420
It could be useful, too, though, right?

1344
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,700
If you're trying to coordinate or maybe we're

1345
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,300
all going to the same meetup or event

1346
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,300
and keeping track of one another.

1347
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,420
I actually think it'd be a great way for a meetup

1348
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,540
to tweet out, here, this is where we're at.

1349
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,000
Especially if we were at some sort of large event

1350
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,180
where you're moving around.

1351
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,460
Oh, right.

1352
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,340
Or if I'm on the road.

1353
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:21,620
The main reason I've used the Rover tracker so far

1354
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,540
is because people watch where I'm going.

1355
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,340
And they send me emails.

1356
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,500
And they're like, hey, man, if you're in my town,

1357
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,260
stop by and say hi.

1358
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,620
Let's go get dinner or something.

1359
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,460
And so that's really neat because people

1360
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,180
can kind of anticipate where I'm going to go next if they're

1361
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,340
looking at the map and stuff.

1362
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,140
Right.

1363
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,460
I'll be in this in two hours.

1364
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,340
Yeah, right.

1365
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,740
Now it's just on Next Class.

1366
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,620
Just on Next Class.

1367
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,260
I think the thing that we have now

1368
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:45,020
is something like it's close to $90 a month for the service.

1369
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:45,900
Shh.

1370
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,460
It's meant for fleets that have trucks

1371
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,180
that they want to track and stuff.

1372
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,620
It's not really meant for the industrial grade solution.

1373
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,780
It's not meant for a podcaster in his RV.

1374
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,420
Cheesy, you threw in a news app.

1375
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,020
Oh, it looks like a feed reader app.

1376
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,560
Yeah, and that's exactly what it is.

1377
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,940
So I've previously been using an instance of fresh RSS,

1378
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:08,460
basically just to have my own little RSS news reader

1379
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:12,060
that I can log into and pull down feeds from.

1380
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:17,380
Just switched over a couple of days ago to using the news app

1381
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,580
that's in Next Cloud.

1382
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,260
And it's super solid, really good.

1383
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:24,260
It's a lot quicker than fresh RSS was

1384
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,420
as far as updating the feeds.

1385
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,020
It will give you kind of like a little notification

1386
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:34,380
if you're on that tab letting you know that it's been updated.

1387
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,860
It's a really solid, solid news reader.

1388
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,620
I'll tell you where they could improve it.

1389
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:42,340
If they made it so it was a group RSS shared set of feeds

1390
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,900
so we could have like a one feed dashboard

1391
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,860
that we could go into, that would be great.

1392
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,580
The way it is now is each user has their own app data.

1393
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,260
Right.

1394
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:56,140
And then another thing I would recommend that an app that you

1395
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,180
install, and maybe one of the first,

1396
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:01,860
is the app order app, which will allow

1397
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:05,900
you to reshuffle the icons along the top header.

1398
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,620
So you can place those wherever you want.

1399
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:11,060
You can do that from an admin level.

1400
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:16,180
So you can choose what to show all of the users, which

1401
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,620
icons to show them, which ones not to show them.

1402
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,820
You can reorder them.

1403
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,100
Or you can just set it up so that the user basically

1404
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:28,860
has the ability to reorder and show and hide whichever icons

1405
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,380
that they want to see.

1406
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,900
So it's a really nice little feature

1407
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,140
that I'd like to see built in.

1408
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:37,780
Another one is right click.

1409
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:41,220
At first, whenever I installed Nextcloud and I got it going,

1410
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,780
and I couldn't right click and get that context menu,

1411
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,420
it kind of drove me crazy.

1412
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,540
So I would highly recommend that you also install the right

1413
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,340
click app.

1414
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:53,180
Right click is pretty much necessary in 2019.

1415
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,220
So I have a couple of recommendations as well.

1416
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:59,620
One of them is a two factor authentication for login.

1417
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,080
So that supports like Google Authenticator and Authy

1418
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,580
and all that kind of stuff.

1419
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,700
As I mentioned, I've got a lot of personal information

1420
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,260
in this one.

1421
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:09,260
So I wanted to make sure it was safe and secure.

1422
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,820
The other one is QoNotes.

1423
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,900
I don't know if you've used this desktop app.

1424
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,780
I think it's Qt app that allows you to take notes.

1425
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,660
And it allows me to use Nextcloud to sync my notes

1426
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,620
like I used to use Evernote to do.

1427
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,620
I think it's text only.

1428
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,460
But I mean, that's good enough for most things.

1429
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,580
Supports markdown.

1430
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,060
Yeah, it supports markdown.

1431
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,460
And yeah, that's all I need.

1432
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,640
So QoNotes API is the name of the plug-in for Nextcloud.

1433
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,180
Yeah, we should probably set that up.

1434
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,460
I love QoNotes.

1435
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,220
That's a good one.

1436
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,420
Drew, you got any pro Nextcloud tips?

1437
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,260
Yes.

1438
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:43,620
So you can actually use it as a full PIM suite PIM,

1439
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:46,100
personal information management.

1440
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:49,620
It does have a mail client and a calendar.

1441
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,020
And you can even get your contacts in there

1442
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:55,260
if you want to set it up so that you have all of your stuff.

1443
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,580
Is it good though?

1444
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:57,700
It's OK.

1445
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,380
It's not great.

1446
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:02,200
It's not going to be challenging Gmail and Google Calendar

1447
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,380
anytime soon.

1448
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:07,700
But as far as a simple implementation

1449
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,500
of each of those things, it's all right.

1450
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,980
So really, if you're going the route of Nextcloud

1451
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,700
because you want the enhanced privacy

1452
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:22,460
aspect of self-hosting it and not having somebody controlling

1453
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:25,980
your stuff, and say you also have your own mail server,

1454
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:30,420
this is a good way to have a web-based interface

1455
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:35,860
to your various services like mail, contacts, calendars

1456
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,540
that isn't being snooped on.

1457
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:44,140
So using it that way, you can get a little more off the grid,

1458
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,060
as it were.

1459
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,660
I have one more pro tip, if I may.

1460
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,260
And that is something called Rclone.

1461
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,100
Now, Rclone allows you to mount a directory using

1462
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,860
Fuse on your Linux system.

1463
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,220
And then use Google Drive or any other kind

1464
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,220
of quote unquote limitless back end.

1465
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,380
So if you wanted to host Nextcloud on a droplet,

1466
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:06,300
for example, it's only got 20, 30 gig of disk.

1467
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,460
Without paying for digital ocean spaces or something,

1468
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:11,740
you could use your pre-existing Google Drive account.

1469
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:12,780
And it's all encrypted.

1470
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,460
Rclone handles the encryption.

1471
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:17,460
And it's completely transparent to Nextcloud using Fuse.

1472
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,580
So that's another top tip.

1473
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,460
Nice.

1474
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,980
My newbie tip then would be take a look

1475
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,820
at the desktop client's Selective Sync options.

1476
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,620
And I'm very happy to report that I

1477
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:31,420
feel like they've given really good data on the sync process.

1478
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,060
In fact, much better data than Dropbox gives.

1479
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:34,540
Really?

1480
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,060
Yeah.

1481
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,300
I'm really happy with the desktop sync information.

1482
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,660
You were skeptical of sync.

1483
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,340
Very happy.

1484
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,060
And for us, because we have archival information,

1485
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,180
we have large productions that some people just

1486
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,580
aren't even involved with, Selective Sync

1487
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,860
is such a killer feature.

1488
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,100
And I'm very happy to report that it seems to be working

1489
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:54,740
quite well.

1490
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,340
So my early tips are to play around

1491
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,140
in the settings of the Nextcloud client and take a look at that.

1492
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,820
I'm excited to switch to this already.

1493
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:04,660
Yeah, I've moved three or four folders out of Dropbox already.

1494
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:05,980
That's how far I've gone.

1495
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,900
And then I feel like after the company event,

1496
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,900
we're going to just do the big switch.

1497
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,420
Another quick tip related to that,

1498
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,500
for any GNOME users out there, GNOME Online Accounts

1499
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,940
does support Nextcloud.

1500
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:21,900
So you can add it, and it shows up as a file system

1501
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,700
in your files app, Nautilus, on the left-hand side,

1502
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,980
where you can click into it and directly access

1503
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:32,300
all of your folders, not even the ones that are just synced.

1504
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,780
And it just grabs everything over web dev.

1505
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,220
Yeah, so you don't even have to.

1506
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,740
If you just need a couple of files,

1507
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,540
you don't need to bother with sync,

1508
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,540
which is probably a fair number of people on the team, really.

1509
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:42,380
Always on connection.

1510
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:42,900
Yeah.

1511
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,060
Oh, it's so great.

1512
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,900
Yeah, I really think that's pretty neat.

1513
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,260
We've been experimenting with all kinds of different ways,

1514
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:53,020
too, to make sure that, like, I have a couple of automation.

1515
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,740
I don't want to go into a lot of details,

1516
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,440
but I have a couple of automation things

1517
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,100
that kick off when certain things enter folders right now

1518
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,060
in Dropbox.

1519
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,820
And Wes and I yesterday were experimenting

1520
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:05,020
with replicating that Nextcloud with the extra layer

1521
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:08,300
of challenge that you then have to mount that path to where

1522
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,620
that is in Nextcloud into the Docker container.

1523
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,620
Like, there was a little extra layer

1524
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:16,060
of work we had to do there to kind of figure that out.

1525
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,580
So there's some instances like that.

1526
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,380
We're still sorting a couple of things out.

1527
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:23,020
But I think for us, the other area we're going to use this

1528
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:24,880
out of, and I don't even know how you do this yet,

1529
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,840
is there's that feature where you can request

1530
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,940
somebody sends you a file.

1531
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,100
And we're going to use that for production purposes.

1532
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,980
When we record, we can then send a guest a link,

1533
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:35,460
say, hey, please upload what you just recorded to us here.

1534
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:36,660
Give me those bytes.

1535
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,060
And otherwise, we were actually just,

1536
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,780
we were discussing building that.

1537
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,380
We'll just, I guess we'll just build this ourselves for free,

1538
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,140
because that'd be great.

1539
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,340
And then we look at the Nextcloud and go, oh, yeah,

1540
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,260
like, that's just a feature built in.

1541
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:47,860
It's pretty nice.

1542
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:48,740
Hey, Chris.

1543
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,780
I don't know if you remember, but for our Portland trip,

1544
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,980
I sent you a link like that, and you gave me all your photos.

1545
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:53,540
Yeah.

1546
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,180
All the photos.

1547
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:54,980
That's incredible.

1548
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:55,540
It was awesome.

1549
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:56,540
It was the first time I'd used it.

1550
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,500
It worked really well for us.

1551
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,500
I was going to ask you, have you been finding success there?

1552
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,540
Do you sync a lot of photos?

1553
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,180
You're like, what's the, like that?

1554
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,180
A lot of little files, big files, that kind of.

1555
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,020
What's the Brent breakdown?

1556
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,580
Yeah, what's the Brent experience?

1557
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:11,420
Yeah, so I've been recently moving towards Nextcloud

1558
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:14,740
for syncing photos to clients as like a method

1559
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,020
of delivery because almost everything I

1560
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:22,060
produce in my photography stuff is digital,

1561
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,260
as you might imagine.

1562
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,060
So I've been testing that a little bit,

1563
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,900
and it's been working really, really well for clients.

1564
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:32,100
I've gotten no bad feedback, and it has mostly the features

1565
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,780
I need, not all, but mostly.

1566
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:34,780
And it's worked great.

1567
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,700
I haven't had anybody complain about it.

1568
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,580
I think after the last week, Cheese and I

1569
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:44,940
were talking about raw support for giving previews of raw

1570
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:46,220
photos.

1571
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,140
That's something he ran into as a problem,

1572
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,740
but I don't ever serve raw photos sort of to a public place.

1573
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,540
So it was fine for me.

1574
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,500
But it's been super solid.

1575
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,060
I've been running it for a year now,

1576
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:01,540
and also moved all of my contact and calendar

1577
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:04,060
syncing from the phone to the computer.

1578
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,860
Wow, you must be feeling good about it.

1579
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:09,220
Oh, yeah, that I've been doing for a few months now.

1580
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:15,180
And I was testing it alongside the Google services,

1581
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,020
just because I think, as you learned last time,

1582
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:21,020
you tried Nextcloud, you should sort of test it for a while.

1583
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,540
And sometimes you run into some strange bugs.

1584
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:26,380
But it's been really, really solid.

1585
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:30,860
And I've been loving it that all of my syncing of almost

1586
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,100
everything is in the same place.

1587
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,740
So one log in, and I get files.

1588
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:35,940
I get calendars.

1589
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:36,780
I get contacts.

1590
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,020
I get notes.

1591
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,260
I get all that stuff.

1592
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:41,460
So I would encourage you to consider that as well.

1593
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:42,620
It's been really powerful.

1594
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:44,860
And I've helped a bunch of people move to that.

1595
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:45,740
And they've loved it.

1596
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:48,980
That does sound appealing, especially because Hedi and I

1597
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,460
right now are trying to sort out,

1598
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,140
what's the best way for us to share that kind of information?

1599
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,340
Nextcloud, dude, definitely is.

1600
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,060
Brent, there is a Camera Raw plugin

1601
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:59,580
that you can install, which I have used successfully

1602
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:00,660
for a while.

1603
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:04,700
Yeah, it requires an iMagic plugin that has been deemed.

1604
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,220
Some people said it wasn't so secure.

1605
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:09,380
So I would love to get your take on that at some point.

1606
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,280
But that's for that reason I considered not going for it.

1607
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:12,780
I didn't know that.

1608
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:13,540
I just installed it.

1609
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,180
Honey badger.

1610
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,180
I didn't care.

1611
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,140
Ironic honey badger.

1612
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:20,180
What's your nextcloud address again?

1613
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:21,860
Yeah, let's give that out on the air.

1614
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:22,980
Yeah, let's do that.

1615
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,620
Can we talk about business applications

1616
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:25,420
for just a moment?

1617
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:26,180
Please do, sir.

1618
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,140
So there are a couple other cool things

1619
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,620
that you can do with it.

1620
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:33,780
There is the ability to white label,

1621
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,180
where you can put in your own logos, your own color

1622
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,820
themes, and all of that.

1623
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,020
JBcloud.

1624
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:42,100
That's right.

1625
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,260
And I want to do that.

1626
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,740
I definitely want us to do that.

1627
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:47,980
There are some other neat features in the app store,

1628
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:54,780
like a DICOM viewer for people working in HIPAA sites,

1629
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:55,980
that actually works.

1630
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,100
I don't know if you guys have ever had to deal with DICOM

1631
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:06,540
files, but essentially they're files that are typically

1632
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:07,940
somewhat encrypted.

1633
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:12,740
And you end up shipping them on a CD from one hospital

1634
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:13,540
to another.

1635
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,620
And then they've got this included viewer

1636
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:17,220
that only runs on Windows.

1637
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,740
And some of them only run on Windows XP.

1638
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,860
Like for x-ray images and whatnot?

1639
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,620
Yeah, I think I have.

1640
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:25,700
It's been a long time.

1641
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,300
So for HIPAA, where you are trying

1642
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,860
to self-host all the things as much as possible,

1643
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,980
Nextcloud is a really good option.

1644
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,900
OK, so now, Brent, you brought it up, Federation.

1645
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,980
I got to ask how Federation is going

1646
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,380
to fit into our future setup.

1647
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,020
Because I envision, and I want to get your feedback

1648
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:48,220
on this, all of you, I envision our on-premises Nextcloud box

1649
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:50,940
being like a source of authority for all of the data,

1650
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,580
like terabytes of data on this thing.

1651
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:57,700
But then it seems like the more frequent access data,

1652
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,380
the less historical stuff, should be available up

1653
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:02,700
on a droplet or something that's fast and available

1654
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,700
for everyone.

1655
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,700
And I'm wondering if that's where Federation plays

1656
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,580
into this, or how Federation plays into this.

1657
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,820
And if, maybe down the road, I could

1658
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:14,260
have a setup where some data is on some Nextcloud servers

1659
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:17,540
and the rest of it's on another, how that could work?

1660
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:19,060
Or do you get where I'm going?

1661
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,500
Is there some sort of future where

1662
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,300
I could have some sort of glorious on-premises cloud

1663
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,660
hybrid Nextcloud setup?

1664
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,180
I think the future is here, Chris.

1665
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:26,860
Is it?

1666
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,180
Have you played with Federation?

1667
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:31,020
So I have two servers, because I basically

1668
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:33,540
wanted to play with Federation, but for a few other reasons.

1669
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,740
So I have two servers that I am running

1670
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:39,700
with a few different users on each individual server.

1671
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:42,900
And so that way, I can have a certain URL

1672
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:46,780
when I share files to clients, for instance,

1673
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:50,260
and then another sort of internal URL, if you will,

1674
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:54,740
that contains almost all of my internal files.

1675
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:56,340
So you can see it another way, which

1676
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:58,260
is I have one for business and one for personal.

1677
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:00,660
Oh, that's a good idea.

1678
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:04,300
It's been really nice, because I can have certain content

1679
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:09,300
in one place, and I can share it to myself from one server

1680
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,180
to the other.

1681
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:12,140
I've been really impressed with the Federation.

1682
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,700
It isn't instant when you do a share,

1683
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,700
but it's pretty darn close.

1684
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:20,460
And so I would say if you've got that sort

1685
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:24,400
of decentralized notion in your mind of where you want to go,

1686
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,180
I'd say go ahead and try it.

1687
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:29,580
It's been super solid and really easy to share files.

1688
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,700
They have sort of a nomenclature that's

1689
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,340
easy to understand for sharing files

1690
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,060
between different servers from user to user.

1691
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:38,420
And I say go full steam ahead.

1692
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:40,840
Couldn't be easier to test that kind of thing in Docker,

1693
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:41,340
though.

1694
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:44,140
You just spin up another container and test it out.

1695
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:44,740
That's true.

1696
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:48,620
And we have a system up on DigitalOcean

1697
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:50,780
that we kind of use for those very kinds of purposes.

1698
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,140
So we could definitely try it.

1699
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:56,460
And I think I could also see myself setting up a personal

1700
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:59,420
next cloud, probably on DO.

1701
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:01,220
I don't need nearly as much storage.

1702
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:04,460
If I separated my personal stuff from all the JB stuff,

1703
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,140
I'd probably need a couple of gigs at most,

1704
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:10,260
because it's mostly documents and backgrounds that I like.

1705
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:11,820
It's all the boring stuff, yeah.

1706
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:14,220
Don't forget that high res photo sync, though.

1707
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,020
That does eat up a lot of space.

1708
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:16,980
It does, yeah.

1709
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,940
But I'm going to be sending those to the JB one,

1710
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:21,620
because my intention there is to just turn that

1711
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:24,500
on while I'm at events, and then turn it off after.

1712
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,940
Because otherwise, I've got built-in platform solutions

1713
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:29,540
for syncing the photos and backing them up.

1714
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:34,020
But I guess I feel like one of the things that

1715
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:36,940
has made me feel like this is the time to go with NextCloud,

1716
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:39,340
besides just the project getting more mature,

1717
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:44,220
and Dropbox getting crappier, is the setup

1718
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:48,580
that we now have, where we have at multiple layers what I feel

1719
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:52,660
like are solid sketch hatches.

1720
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:55,540
If the container goes bonkers, we can go back,

1721
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:57,300
or we can switch to a different container.

1722
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,420
It's isolated from the config and the data.

1723
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:02,380
The data is not the application.

1724
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:05,180
The two things are not at all intertwined,

1725
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:08,140
and they're completely safe to separate and move

1726
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:09,660
independently.

1727
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:14,260
And then the operating system, also, as we have now proven,

1728
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:18,140
can be swapped out to anything that supports ZFS.

1729
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:21,660
I mean, we have gone from a FreeNAS install that

1730
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:25,860
was maybe one release behind or current, and went to Fedora,

1731
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:28,860
and were able to just successfully mount those CFS

1732
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:29,980
pools.

1733
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:34,100
And did we end up doing these command to bring it up to date?

1734
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:36,180
We've not upgraded the pool to the latest stuff.

1735
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,300
Yeah, we did look, though.

1736
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,340
There is an option to essentially upgrade

1737
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,420
the pool to the most current, but then there's

1738
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:43,260
no going back to FreeNAS if we do that.

1739
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,300
Does Alan know that you've dropped BSD?

1740
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,500
I haven't really said anything, no.

1741
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,540
I'm pretty confident that at this point, if for some reason

1742
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:52,300
we were like, oh, screw Fedora.

1743
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,100
It's so horrible for some reason,

1744
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,580
even though we've been running it on other systems on DO

1745
01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:01,260
now for a while, I'm pretty confident we

1746
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:05,180
could put Ubuntu LTS on there, spin those containers up,

1747
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:08,460
and mount that ZFS pool, and we'd be back in business

1748
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,580
in an hour.

1749
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,420
And so at each, all these different levels,

1750
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,780
we're abstracted and we're safe.

1751
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:15,460
There's like, next cloud can screw up, we're good.

1752
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:16,900
The ZFS pool can have problems.

1753
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:17,820
It doesn't mess it.

1754
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,100
And at the same time, it's not making it

1755
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,460
like it's some horrible thing.

1756
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,340
In fact, it's easier to manage, if anything.

1757
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:22,820
It is.

1758
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,300
It's way easier.

1759
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,340
It's great.

1760
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:28,140
I'm giddy with how simple it is, really.

1761
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:31,780
Once you've gotten the most basic Docker understanding,

1762
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:34,300
you compose files that are easy to read,

1763
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:37,740
and the Docker command line is very simple.

1764
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:41,220
Or you can use, even on top of that, you can use cockpit.

1765
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,460
And it has a front end, a graphical front end.

1766
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:45,740
And if you don't need to do anything fancy, it's fine.

1767
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,700
I'm so pleased you guys are doing this.

1768
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,180
It's been the way I've been running my servers now

1769
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,940
for two, three years, or whatever.

1770
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:55,020
Just 100% Docker containers for everything

1771
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:56,020
I can get my hands on.

1772
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:58,860
And it just makes life so, so easy.

1773
01:08:58,860 --> 01:08:59,620
It's great.

1774
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:01,660
I guess I feel like, I don't know,

1775
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,580
a lot of times when you do something like this,

1776
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:04,940
you've got to compromise.

1777
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,580
You've got to give something up when

1778
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:09,340
you go with the free solution that's self-hosted.

1779
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:13,900
But this time, it's like, I'm gaining a bunch of stuff,

1780
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,860
and I'm going to be saving money.

1781
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:21,660
And I also got privacy that I didn't have before.

1782
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:23,420
So I've gained on every front.

1783
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,740
I think the application is better.

1784
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:25,940
The suite of tools is better.

1785
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:27,500
The platform it's on is better.

1786
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:28,580
And it's private.

1787
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:30,840
And, oh, by the way, it's under my own roof.

1788
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,220
And it's kind of fun.

1789
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:33,740
Yeah, and it's really fun, too.

1790
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:34,340
That, too.

1791
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,220
Because it's not a huge hassle.

1792
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:35,740
Hell yeah.

1793
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:36,900
That, too.

1794
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,620
I just, oh.

1795
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:40,420
This is just, I love open source.

1796
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:43,860
I love free software because this is the right.

1797
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:45,980
This is when it's at its best.

1798
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:46,860
It really is.

1799
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:47,380
So good.

1800
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:49,060
So I really encourage you to go out there and check it out.

1801
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:51,060
However you want to install it, it's

1802
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:53,040
worth the time to just play around with it a little bit

1803
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,620
and see if maybe it would work for you.

1804
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,980
Because I was resistant, legitimately.

1805
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:58,900
And I'm just really happy we gave it a go.

1806
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,900
And maybe some of our fine audience

1807
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,740
have some tips we should be hearing

1808
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,860
about how they have their Nextcloud instances set up.

1809
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:05,860
How do they tell us, Wes?

1810
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:09,620
Oh, linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1811
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:10,740
Absolutely.

1812
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:13,540
Hey, by the way, next week, we're

1813
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:18,180
going to have a special on PCI pass-through for virtualization

1814
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,100
and our general VM setups, how we do them,

1815
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,020
and maybe some of Wes's tricks for running operating systems.

1816
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:27,940
We decided to just make one authoritative episode

1817
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,140
that we can refer people to.

1818
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:32,820
So it's going to be our comprehensive setup

1819
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:34,580
on how we do virtualization.

1820
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:37,540
I have been all in on PCI pass-through and eGPUs.

1821
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:40,100
And so has Drew.

1822
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:44,340
And I feel like we need one definitive spot.

1823
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,380
And so while we are traveling, we thought,

1824
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,940
let's go ahead and release a special.

1825
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:50,780
So we're going to do a PCI pass-through special next week.

1826
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:51,900
So make sure you grab that.

1827
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:52,900
Should be really good.

1828
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,060
All right, Mr. Payne.

1829
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,500
Well, I'm so excited I could talk about Nextcloud

1830
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,180
for another hour.

1831
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:58,880
But we should probably get to these pics,

1832
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,540
because they're crazy good.

1833
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:03,340
And one of them is rather relevant to us that you found.

1834
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:07,180
And I love the way they talk about this project.

1835
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,940
So it's called Lexicon.

1836
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:11,940
And here's how it describes itself.

1837
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:14,980
Manipulate DNS records on various DNS providers

1838
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,780
in a standardized way.

1839
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:19,940
It's just, what does that mean, Wes?

1840
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:23,060
Well, OK, I think Lexicon is actually a great name, right?

1841
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:25,020
Because we're dealing with names.

1842
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,380
We have all these different terms.

1843
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:28,580
DNS helps you look things up.

1844
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:30,420
Unfortunately, different providers

1845
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,740
do things in different ways.

1846
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:33,260
Some have very nice APIs.

1847
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:35,100
Some have complicated APIs.

1848
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:38,380
Some have unofficial undocumented APIs.

1849
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:40,460
All of that's been combined in Lexicon,

1850
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:42,740
which is a handy Python library that has

1851
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,140
a great little command line.

1852
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:48,020
So it was built with Let's Encrypt in mind, primarily,

1853
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:50,100
as well as being a general utility.

1854
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,280
So you can do stuff like do their DNS challenge,

1855
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,060
where you have to go add a specific thing to your DNS

1856
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:55,900
update.

1857
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,060
With Lexicon, you can do that programmatically.

1858
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:02,420
Yeah, and it supports a ton of providers.

1859
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:05,780
Route 53, Cloudflare, Hover.

1860
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:11,420
Hover, DigitalOcean, EasyDNS, GoDaddy, obviously,

1861
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:12,500
Google Cloud DNS.

1862
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:16,800
I mean, Linode, just essentially all of them.

1863
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,660
I'm looking at namecheaps on there.

1864
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:21,620
All of the ones I've ever used are on there,

1865
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:23,540
including ones I haven't.

1866
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:25,860
So in theory, as long as it's on this list,

1867
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:27,980
regardless of who your DNS provider is,

1868
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,940
it's the same set of command syntax

1869
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:32,540
to update DNS records, modify DNS records.

1870
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:35,020
Yeah, there's a few little variances here and there

1871
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,780
as they're acquired by the platforms.

1872
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:40,100
And it's one PIP package in Python,

1873
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,300
but a few of them have a few extra packages because they

1874
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,640
have extra dependencies, maybe.

1875
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,340
So look into the details for your specific provider.

1876
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:48,980
But in our case, we were doing some stuff with Hover.

1877
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:49,740
Really easy.

1878
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:50,620
You just had to go.

1879
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:52,820
You could get your credentials, pass that in.

1880
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:55,220
They have a couple different options for how you do it.

1881
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:56,860
And then you can make queries and stuff.

1882
01:12:56,860 --> 01:13:00,620
So we needed a dynamic DNS updater

1883
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:03,020
now that we're using a whole bunch of stuff at the server,

1884
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,900
obviously, here in the studio.

1885
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:08,740
We want to know where it is when we're on the road.

1886
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:09,820
That made it really easy.

1887
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:11,240
I just wrote a little batch script.

1888
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:14,820
You could go and query Hover through lexicon

1889
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:17,180
to find out what the current IP address is.

1890
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:19,340
And you can easily delete it or change it.

1891
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:22,740
And does that just become like a script that gets cronned or?

1892
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:26,500
Yeah, I stuck it in a Docker container on the server here.

1893
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:29,220
And then it's just running all the time.

1894
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:30,340
Of course it is.

1895
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:31,780
All right, well, how about something

1896
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:34,220
you're not going to run in a Docker container this week?

1897
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:37,540
It's called Arandr.

1898
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:40,340
I realized that I never really followed up on how I solved

1899
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:41,940
this super obnoxious problem I had,

1900
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:44,660
where I had two vertical screens on the side

1901
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:46,160
and a horizontal screen in the middle.

1902
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,780
So I have three ASUS 27-inch monitors,

1903
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:52,660
two of which are vertical, one of which is standard 16

1904
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:53,940
or whatever it is.

1905
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:55,180
You get what I'm saying.

1906
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,180
And I have this really obnoxious problem

1907
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:00,820
that has plagued me across all the different desktop

1908
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:01,580
environments.

1909
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:03,620
And I eventually just decided I had

1910
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:04,740
to come up with a solution.

1911
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,940
I thought the desktop environments would solve it.

1912
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:10,580
I thought maybe switching to an AMD GPU from an NVIDIA GPU

1913
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:11,540
might solve it.

1914
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:13,340
A dramatic switch, by the way.

1915
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:14,420
It did not solve it.

1916
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:17,860
In fact, now it just manifests in different, weirder ways.

1917
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:19,580
So I had to make a script.

1918
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,260
And Arandr or Arandr or whatever you.

1919
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:23,220
A-ran-der.

1920
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:24,100
Yeah.

1921
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,340
It's essentially a front end to X-randr,

1922
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:31,020
which is a way to script the layout of your screen, windows,

1923
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:31,940
et cetera.

1924
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,660
And the nice thing about this is it just

1925
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:35,380
looks like a regular display manager window

1926
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:37,020
where you arrange your monitors like you

1927
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,420
would in a multi-monitor setup.

1928
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,420
And then you hit Save.

1929
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:41,820
And it generates the script for you.

1930
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:43,420
I put that into a desktop launcher.

1931
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,420
That's in my menu bar.

1932
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:46,660
As soon as I wake up my screens, if they're screwed up,

1933
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,180
I click that within a second.

1934
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:49,580
Everything's laid out perfectly.

1935
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:50,060
You know, it's funny.

1936
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:51,420
I discovered this a few years ago

1937
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,180
when I was still running Unity.

1938
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:55,940
And then I had three screens on an NVIDIA GPU

1939
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:58,420
over, like they were DisplayPort daisy-chained.

1940
01:14:58,420 --> 01:14:59,500
And it was just the worst.

1941
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,980
I had to deal with fighting with the built-in desktop

1942
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,780
environment display manager.

1943
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:04,700
It just wasn't as good.

1944
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,540
Plus, as you say, you can easily add it to startup scripts

1945
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:09,460
or, you know, just restore scripts.

1946
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:11,420
Yeah, didn't you just use it recently here in the studio?

1947
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:11,540
Oh, yeah.

1948
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,300
It's on the Reaper machine now, because I

1949
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,180
wasn't happy with how XFCE was doing it.

1950
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:18,260
Yeah, we have like a stand-up, the jack system,

1951
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:21,620
patch everything in, because we have so many things.

1952
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,660
And so Wes created a script to standardize it.

1953
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:25,940
And part of that is you just run this so that way,

1954
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,520
every time the monitors, you just

1955
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,980
know they're always laid out correctly.

1956
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:29,580
Exactly.

1957
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:33,780
Yeah, it's so nice, because you can run this once,

1958
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,580
and then it solves the problem for you forever.

1959
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,140
And I don't know if you've ever experienced some of the ones,

1960
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,100
I think, in the Gnome Heritage, in particular,

1961
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,580
where the screens just don't move where you tell them.

1962
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:44,580
Yes.

1963
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:45,300
It doesn't happen, right?

1964
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,340
It's just it's the perfect amount of simplicity.

1965
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:48,300
It's not flashy.

1966
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,580
It gets the job done.

1967
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:51,100
I will have a link in the show notes.

1968
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:52,860
I encourage all of you, at least as long

1969
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,940
as we're still running X. That was one of the stories that

1970
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:57,100
did not make it in, but I want to talk about soon,

1971
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:01,580
is we now kind of have a end-of-days date for X.

1972
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,420
Maybe we'll try to cover that next episode,

1973
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,020
because that's kind of a big deal, too.

1974
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:06,760
And maybe we should spend some time,

1975
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,060
switch totally over to Wayne.

1976
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,620
Let's see how, you know, evaluate.

1977
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:10,460
Yeah, we really should, especially

1978
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:12,540
since we've got the ThinkPads with the full Intel set up.

1979
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:12,940
Yes.

1980
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:13,820
We really could.

1981
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:14,660
I have done it a little bit.

1982
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:17,100
The issue is, once I switch back to XFC,

1983
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,900
I basically kiss that goodbye.

1984
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:23,260
But you know, it's not bad to check in on Gnome or GATEV.

1985
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:24,260
I think I need to.

1986
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:25,500
Yeah, and we could do that.

1987
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:26,780
We could definitely do that.

1988
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,580
Well, I want to say thank you, everyone, for listening.

1989
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:31,180
We really appreciate you listening to these shows,

1990
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:33,380
sharing them with your friends, sending in feedback.

1991
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:36,420
Or even if you've just been a longtime, silent listener who's

1992
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,620
never said anything, we're thinking about you,

1993
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:39,020
and we appreciate you.

1994
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:39,780
We do this for you.

1995
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:41,020
That's the whole reason, right?

1996
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:41,540
Yeah.

1997
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:42,940
We very much appreciate your time

1998
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:45,220
and choosing to listen to us, so thank you very much.

1999
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:47,500
We will not be live next week, because I'll

2000
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,660
be traveling back.

2001
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,980
I'll be doing a road trip back from Texas,

2002
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:54,700
so we'll have the prerecorded PCI pass-through episode.

2003
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,660
But we'll be back after that, the next Tuesday,

2004
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:57,940
the following Tuesday.

2005
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:59,660
We do it at 2 PM Pacific time, but you

2006
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:01,900
can go to jupiterbroadcasting.com.

2007
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:02,780
I'm at Chris Ellis.

2008
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:03,900
The network's at Jupiter Signal.

2009
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:04,780
Thanks for being here.

2010
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:06,140
See you next Tuesday.

2011
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:27,140
I'm Chris Ellis, and I'll see you next week.

2012
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:49,380
All right, jbtitles.com, let's go boat.

2013
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:52,260
I'll tell you where else I use A Render,

2014
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:55,060
and that's when I'm switching between two virtual machines

2015
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:56,940
with PCI pass-through.

2016
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:59,500
I can use that script on a hotkey

2017
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:02,940
to rearrange my monitors to have just one as Windows 10

2018
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:04,540
or just one as Linux.

2019
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:05,620
That's a nice way to do it.

2020
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:07,580
Yeah, hotkeys are a good way to go, too.

2021
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:08,580
I should hotkey it.

2022
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,260
I don't know why I don't.

2023
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:12,140
I should, I really should just hotkey that.

2024
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:15,340
Control-F10 is now Windows 10, so I mean, it just makes sense.

2025
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:17,140
That way, when you try it at Wayland again,

2026
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:20,860
you'll have to figure out how to make that work.

2027
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:22,660
You really are in this now.

2028
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:23,940
It's the future, Chris.

2029
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:26,340
I use XClip and A Render.

2030
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:29,660
I'm heavily all in on X.

2031
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:30,900
Yeah, I know.

2032
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,320
I know when I was reading this post about sort of the plans

2033
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,260
for wrapping up Xorg, I was thinking to myself,

2034
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:37,780
well, I don't know if I'm ready.

2035
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,580
I don't know if I'm ready, but you know.

2036
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:42,780
You're going to be installing the weird 32-bit Xorg snap,

2037
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:44,260
and that'll be your system.

2038
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,380
I'll have XWayland 32-bit.

2039
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:47,980
No, but seriously, though, you joke,

2040
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:50,180
but like we were talking about with the 32-bit stuff,

2041
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:53,220
at some point, you do have to make a transition.

2042
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:55,180
And like it or not, we're running

2043
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:57,540
an engineer's workstation operating system here.

2044
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:00,060
We're not really running Mac OS for end users, right?

2045
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,860
And so sometimes the stuff's a little bit of a pill

2046
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:07,340
to swallow, but that's sort of the agreement,

2047
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:10,540
I think, when you run desktop Linux, like it or not.

2048
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:12,700
Maybe I'm wrong, but it sure seems to be the case.

2049
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,180
See the upside if we do some playing around there.

2050
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:17,660
That's a good excuse to play with pipeline again, too.

2051
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:19,820
Yes, yes, yes.

2052
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:21,980
I like the way you're thinking, Wes Payne.

2053
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,140
We're going to have to make that happen.

2054
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:24,060
What are you thinking?

2055
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,380
Are you thinking like Fedora?

2056
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:27,660
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, yeah.

2057
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:28,580
How'd you know?

2058
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:33,580
Oh, I know.
