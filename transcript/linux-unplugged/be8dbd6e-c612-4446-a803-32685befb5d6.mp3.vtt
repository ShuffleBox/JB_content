WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Sorry Chris, are you about to start?

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
Yeah I am, but I'm, uh, what, what?

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
Time maths, time maths.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Yeah, I know, right?

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
I know, yeah I know.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.960
Yeah, so there's me thinking I'm like half an hour early and actually I'm like three

00:12.960 --> 00:13.960
minutes late.

00:13.960 --> 00:17.200
That's why I'm just kind of farting around, I hate it, and you just missed my daylight

00:17.200 --> 00:25.960
savings rant, but short version is, I'm willing to make a pack with you guys, Matt, Wimpy,

00:25.960 --> 00:29.780
you guys, everybody in the chat room, everybody in the mumble room, I will make a pack starting

00:29.780 --> 00:30.780
right here.

00:30.780 --> 00:36.360
If you want, and you know, they've got a couple of weeks until they catch up to us, Matt,

00:36.360 --> 00:41.820
but when we all spring ahead, when everybody's all sprung ahead, I'm gonna make a pack with

00:41.820 --> 00:46.040
you guys, you guys make a pack with me, we will not fall behind.

00:46.040 --> 00:50.560
We will refuse to do it, and listen, if we refuse to do it, then it, that's what time

00:50.560 --> 00:51.560
it is.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.480
Like if I say it's six o'clock and we all agree it's six o'clock, then it's fucking

00:54.480 --> 00:55.480
six o'clock.

00:55.480 --> 00:56.480
That's how it works.

00:56.480 --> 01:01.280
You're gonna go all Arizona on the time savings, aren't you?

01:01.280 --> 01:05.140
We're just gonna draw the line, and we're just gonna say from now on, we're done.

01:05.140 --> 01:06.840
It's a pack, it's a time pack.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.000
We're gonna make a time pack, and you know what, don't feel silly, because history will

01:10.000 --> 01:13.640
look back at us as the people that saved society from a shared delusion.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.120
We will be the saviors of this shared delusion that is daylight savings time.

01:17.120 --> 01:21.400
We will be revolutionaries, and I will start it, it'll start with Jupiter Broadcasting,

01:21.400 --> 01:24.040
and it will go out from there, and we can all be part of it.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.240
It'll become known as JB time.

01:26.240 --> 01:30.500
And you know what, I'll make the economic case, because it devastates our live shows

01:30.500 --> 01:31.500
for like two weeks.

01:31.500 --> 01:35.500
People get it all confused, and it's not even people outside the US.

01:35.500 --> 01:41.440
People inside the effing United States of America get it confused.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.420
The Americans can't even keep it straight.

01:43.420 --> 01:46.600
How do we expect people outside the US to keep it straight?

01:46.600 --> 01:50.600
And I'm starting to think that the only reason George W. Bush changed it by two weeks is

01:50.600 --> 01:54.000
just to make America different from everybody else, so the rest of the world would have

01:54.000 --> 01:55.760
to take notice of us.

01:55.760 --> 02:00.400
I'm starting to think that's the only reason he did it, and I'm so sick of it, I am so

02:00.400 --> 02:01.400
sick of it.

02:01.400 --> 02:05.600
The original reason is so dated to it, it's like what, farmers 50 years ago or some shit,

02:05.600 --> 02:07.480
so they get more time to farm shit?

02:07.480 --> 02:08.480
I don't know.

02:08.480 --> 02:09.480
That's part of it.

02:09.480 --> 02:10.480
Yeah, no, I agree.

02:10.480 --> 02:15.760
But okay, I agree with the whole daylight savings time, two weeks difference is incredibly

02:15.760 --> 02:16.760
stupid.

02:16.760 --> 02:17.760
Yeah.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.720
It should all be the same across the world, why is it different?

02:20.720 --> 02:22.600
Like why is the day changing?

02:22.600 --> 02:24.060
Like that's dumb.

02:24.060 --> 02:27.080
But the whole hour back and forth, who really cares?

02:27.080 --> 02:29.440
But the two week difference between every other country?

02:29.440 --> 02:30.440
That's ridiculous.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.440
I know.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.440
I know.

02:32.440 --> 02:36.060
Just to complete the circle of international ridiculousness, I'd like to point out that

02:36.060 --> 02:40.280
the UK is offset by one week from continental Europe as well.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.280
Oh.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.280
Oh, wow.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.280
Ouch.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.040
A week would hurt.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.040
That would hurt.

02:47.040 --> 02:53.280
No, I think we have to blame some monarch from donkey's years ago for that one.

02:53.280 --> 02:56.480
It's all pretty archaic, right?

02:56.480 --> 02:57.480
It's ridiculous.

02:57.480 --> 03:04.960
And the confusing thing for me is that my office is, our sister office is in Arizona,

03:04.960 --> 03:10.600
in Phoenix, Arizona, and they don't have daylight savings at all.

03:10.600 --> 03:11.600
Right.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.600
In Arizona.

03:12.600 --> 03:13.600
Fun.

03:13.600 --> 03:17.960
No, actually, Wimpy, I would state it like this, they do not share the delusion that

03:17.960 --> 03:18.960
the rest of us share.

03:18.960 --> 03:19.960
Yeah.

03:19.960 --> 03:20.960
Yeah.

03:20.960 --> 03:21.960
Yeah.

03:21.960 --> 03:22.960
Yeah, yeah.

03:22.960 --> 03:23.960
I like that.

03:23.960 --> 03:24.960
Yeah.

03:24.960 --> 03:25.960
Yeah.

03:25.960 --> 03:26.960
You know, all right.

03:26.960 --> 03:27.960
Okay.

03:27.960 --> 03:28.960
I mean, here's what I'm saying.

03:28.960 --> 03:33.000
The same people that believe that a laptop with one port are the same people that believe

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
in daylight savings.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.120
So you got to make a decision.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.120
What kind of person are you?

03:37.120 --> 03:40.760
Do you think a laptop should have more than one port or do you believe in daylight?

03:40.760 --> 03:41.960
I'm just asking.

03:41.960 --> 03:42.960
What kind of person are you?

03:42.960 --> 03:46.520
I want a laptop with one port that also charges itself.

03:46.520 --> 03:47.520
That's what I want.

03:47.520 --> 03:48.520
What could go wrong?

03:48.520 --> 03:49.520
Yeah.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.200
And I want to make sure it's a technology that I couldn't possibly already have so I

03:52.200 --> 03:54.800
can invest another 60 or 80 bucks into it.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.440
Can I introduce you into the concept of a single point of failure, please?

03:58.440 --> 03:59.440
Can I?

03:59.440 --> 04:00.440
I would like to.

04:00.440 --> 04:04.080
One port goes out and nothing on your laptop works ever again.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.080
Right?

04:05.080 --> 04:06.080
Yeah.

04:06.080 --> 04:11.240
But if you're going to talk about daylight savings, there is at least two ports.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.240
There is a-

04:12.240 --> 04:14.700
There is a fallback and spring forward port.

04:14.700 --> 04:19.120
There is actually a headphone jack that also is a microphone jack in one port, of course,

04:19.120 --> 04:20.120
because-

04:20.120 --> 04:21.120
That's enough.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.120
That's enough.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.120
I'm kind of-

04:23.120 --> 04:27.560
I'm kind of sorry that I've stirred up all of these feelings again, but also delighted

04:27.560 --> 04:28.560
at the same time.

04:28.560 --> 04:34.440
He would have felt very disappointed if he had missed the round completely.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.440
Yeah, no.

04:35.440 --> 04:36.440
I feel included now.

04:36.440 --> 04:39.800
No, I just think that we can make a difference.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.800
That's all.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.800
And I'm willing to do it.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.880
I just want to make sure I got everybody's best support because we got it.

04:43.880 --> 04:44.880
Just for a while.

04:44.880 --> 04:45.880
I don't care.

04:45.880 --> 04:46.880
Just remind me.

04:46.880 --> 04:50.360
I will definitely support that initiative.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.360
There's one other thing, Chris.

04:51.360 --> 04:56.560
I don't know if you want to discuss this now or after the show, but last week, you and

04:56.560 --> 05:05.560
I talked about BT SYNC, and when I listened back to it, it sounded like we were two people

05:05.560 --> 05:11.200
that weren't prepared to pay for good software because, certainly from my point of view,

05:11.200 --> 05:19.840
I hadn't explained why it was I didn't want to pay for BT SYNC in its future iterations,

05:19.840 --> 05:23.920
and I don't want that to come across as somebody that's not prepared to pay for software.

05:23.920 --> 05:31.080
I want to explain why it is BT SYNC has changed, and we shouldn't be supporting it.

05:31.080 --> 05:35.360
I completely agree because I think, and I'm sure you know this, Wimby, but you know me.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.200
I'm totally willing to pay for software.

05:37.200 --> 05:43.320
In fact, I spend thousands of dollars a year on software for what we do.

05:43.320 --> 05:47.200
In fact, I did say I'd be willing to pay for it, but I wouldn't want to make everybody

05:47.200 --> 05:51.840
else have to subscribe to use it, so I think it's a point well made, so go ahead.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.560
I think clarification is well-made.

05:53.560 --> 05:54.560
I'll explain.

05:54.560 --> 06:00.440
So, prior to using BT SYNC, I'd been a Dropbox subscriber for some years, and I'd been paying

06:00.440 --> 06:07.720
my $100, and I was perfectly happy with paying for my Dropbox subscription, so I'm not adverse

06:07.720 --> 06:15.200
to paying for software that I find useful, but in the light of the Edward Snowden revelations

06:15.200 --> 06:24.200
and then more so the crappity security at Dropbox, I decided Dropbox isn't somewhere

06:24.200 --> 06:31.520
that I wanted sensitive information, so I looked to move my data out of the centralized

06:31.520 --> 06:39.840
cloud storage platforms into something that I controlled, and albeit BT SYNC being proprietary,

06:39.840 --> 06:48.320
it offered me this peer-to-peer synchronization facility, safeguarded from central organization.

06:48.320 --> 06:54.060
And also, the torrent system is actually pretty great at distributing a lot of types of files

06:54.060 --> 06:59.720
like this, so it also has the advantage of being a very good way to distribute media

06:59.720 --> 07:01.360
files and things like that.

07:01.360 --> 07:05.320
Yeah, and it worked for me, but here's the thing.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.280
It's not the cost.

07:07.280 --> 07:11.840
The cost is just one aspect, but it's a very small part.

07:11.840 --> 07:18.800
For them to enforce you paying for this, so first of all, in their press release, they

07:18.800 --> 07:25.120
know how much data has passed through the BT SYNC network in the last 18 months.

07:25.120 --> 07:28.240
That's not the first time they've quoted that number either, and I've always wondered how

07:28.240 --> 07:30.040
can they know that?

07:30.040 --> 07:31.040
Exactly.

07:31.040 --> 07:36.200
How do they know how much data has passed through their network?

07:36.200 --> 07:41.760
More worrying is you now need to subscribe per user.

07:41.760 --> 07:46.740
Now per user subscription, that means there must be some central authority that you're

07:46.740 --> 07:54.160
logging in with, and therefore, where is your data going and how are they coalescing this?

07:54.160 --> 08:00.120
More worrying still is you're limited to 10 folders, so again, there must be some central

08:00.120 --> 08:07.000
place that knows what all of your folder shares are in order to determine whether or not you

08:07.000 --> 08:09.960
are under or over their threshold.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.320
It could be possible.

08:12.320 --> 08:17.920
What do you think about the possibility that the local server does a check and says, am

08:17.920 --> 08:22.520
I authorized, yes or no, and do I have more than 10 folders, yes or no?

08:22.520 --> 08:27.040
And it could just be as simple as if yes, I have more than 10 folders and am authorized

08:27.040 --> 08:30.200
as no than don't function.

08:30.200 --> 08:33.120
It was that simple, wouldn't they just tell you that?

08:33.120 --> 08:37.920
And that's a perfectly great piece of pseudocode analysis, but it's proprietary software and

08:37.920 --> 08:38.920
we just don't know.

08:38.920 --> 08:39.920
We just don't know, do we?

08:39.920 --> 08:40.920
We don't know how they're doing it, do we?

08:40.920 --> 08:41.920
Yeah, exactly.

08:41.920 --> 08:47.560
So in the light of not knowing how they're enforcing the user accounts and the folder

08:47.560 --> 08:53.600
limitations, I'm now looking at the data that I've got stored in there, which includes baby

08:53.600 --> 08:58.360
photographs and photographs of all of the children in the family, and as a father, you

08:58.360 --> 09:02.760
will know that children under the age of four take off all their clothes all the time, and

09:02.760 --> 09:08.520
therefore you take photographs of naked children and now who's analyzing the flesh tone coverage

09:08.520 --> 09:13.520
analysis in your photographs and all the rest of it, so consequently, it doesn't fly for

09:13.520 --> 09:14.520
me anymore.

09:14.520 --> 09:20.280
I need to find something that I know is open source because I can check it and I know it's

09:20.280 --> 09:27.040
not going through some third party orchestration server.

09:27.040 --> 09:32.480
I've always suspected that the BitTorrent Sync isn't doing any kind of data analysis

09:32.480 --> 09:38.400
because it would be pretty overt if a copy of your data was going to them, but I have

09:38.400 --> 09:43.280
suspected for a while, based on other observations, that they are doing some sort of metadata

09:43.280 --> 09:44.280
analysis.

09:44.280 --> 09:48.180
Well, we're all pretty familiar that metadata is pretty damn important too, and that doesn't

09:48.180 --> 09:51.160
make me super comfortable, but it's not a deal breaker because, let's be honest, it's

09:51.160 --> 09:57.200
probably less than, say, what Dropbox or what Google Drive, for God's sakes, or even Microsoft's

09:57.200 --> 09:58.400
OneDrive is doing.

09:58.400 --> 10:02.280
BitTorrent Sync is probably still the lesser of the evil of all of those things, or so

10:02.280 --> 10:03.760
I would tell myself.

10:03.760 --> 10:10.240
What really burned my ass, and I am so tired of this because, honestly, I've been watching

10:10.240 --> 10:16.360
this kind of BS for a really long time, and Google is a master of it, but they do it in

10:16.360 --> 10:22.160
a more subtle way, but what really burned me was sort of when they stuck their tongue

10:22.160 --> 10:27.060
in my ear about open sourcing it a little bit, and they went, hmm, yeah, I might do

10:27.060 --> 10:28.060
that.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.060
I might open source this.

10:29.060 --> 10:30.060
Little tease.

10:30.060 --> 10:31.060
Yeah, exactly.

10:31.060 --> 10:32.060
And then just walked away.

10:32.060 --> 10:36.100
All right, yeah, well, hey, you got more than ten folders, sorry about that.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.960
And then, oh, the open source thing, yeah, we've totally dropped that.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.640
And that, I'm so sick of that.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.420
I'm so sick and tired of that bait and switch.

10:45.420 --> 10:46.880
That's the part that upset me.

10:46.880 --> 10:51.120
Forty dollars, that's pretty reasonable because I've subscribed to Dropbox Pro because we

10:51.120 --> 10:53.240
also use that for media files.

10:53.240 --> 10:58.040
So forty dollars is pretty reasonable, but I can't expect every unfiltered supporter

10:58.040 --> 10:59.120
to also pay that.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.120
So I have to think this through.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.160
Yeah, I agree.

11:04.160 --> 11:12.040
I think the bait and switch thing is a very good point, but my concerns are more around

11:12.040 --> 11:13.040
how do they know?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.040
How are they monitoring?

11:14.040 --> 11:16.480
How are they tracking this?

11:16.480 --> 11:20.240
And therefore, now it's definitely not going to be open source.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.120
How can we trust it?

11:22.120 --> 11:26.560
Yeah, and for everybody listening that's been all along, I told you you shouldn't use it

11:26.560 --> 11:27.560
if it's not open source.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.120
Well, you were right.

11:29.120 --> 11:33.540
Well, and see, for me, I utilize technologies that aren't open source and that potentially

11:33.540 --> 11:35.360
I'm pumping data through.

11:35.360 --> 11:39.840
Generally speaking, I will only pump stuff out that I want people listening or viewing.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.400
So podcasts, hey, you know what?

11:41.400 --> 11:43.960
If the NSA wants to listen to my show, that's frigging awesome.

11:43.960 --> 11:44.960
You guys are bored.

11:44.960 --> 11:45.960
Yeah, they're listening.

11:45.960 --> 11:46.960
Yeah.

11:46.960 --> 11:47.960
Yeah.

11:47.960 --> 11:48.960
Just go use their sponsors.

11:48.960 --> 11:49.960
They're watching Matrix screens and stuff.

11:49.960 --> 11:50.960
Yeah, good.

11:50.960 --> 11:51.960
Exactly.

11:51.960 --> 11:52.960
So that's cool.

11:52.960 --> 11:53.960
But outside of that, anything personal, some stuff I won't even put on a computer.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.560
I mean, like just point blank.

11:55.560 --> 11:56.560
I won't.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.560
Wow.

11:57.560 --> 11:58.560
Wow.

11:58.560 --> 11:59.560
Hey, Matt.

11:59.560 --> 12:00.560
Hey.

12:00.560 --> 12:01.560
And you know what?

12:01.560 --> 12:02.560
On that note.

12:02.560 --> 12:03.560
You know what?

12:03.560 --> 12:04.560
I'll just get sexy shots.

12:04.560 --> 12:05.560
I don't want to put that out there.

12:05.560 --> 12:06.560
I don't want to hear about that.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.560
We're going to start the show.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.560
We're going to start the show.

12:08.560 --> 12:12.960
It's time to kick off.

12:12.960 --> 12:17.560
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's just sitting around and waiting

12:17.560 --> 12:20.080
for the damn internet of hat things.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.080
My name is Chris.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.440
And my name is Matt.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.700
I'm telling you, Matt, screw the watches, screw the phones.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.600
I want my hat internet connected.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.480
Think about all of that space you could use for battery.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.620
The rim could be used for sensors.

12:32.620 --> 12:35.240
You could have easily a couple of cameras.

12:35.240 --> 12:41.000
Dude, some hats could have a 360 degree camera assembly, right?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
You see-

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Where are you going with that?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Can we get off Google Glass?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.060
Can we get off the watching?

12:45.060 --> 12:46.060
Can we please folks?

12:46.060 --> 12:48.840
Not only that, who doesn't look good in a hat?

12:48.840 --> 12:50.840
Everybody looks good in a hat.

12:50.840 --> 12:51.840
Ladies look good in a hat.

12:51.840 --> 12:52.840
Guys look good.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.840
Hold on.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.840
I'm going to grab a hat.

12:54.840 --> 12:55.840
Hold on, Matt.

12:55.840 --> 12:56.840
You know what?

12:56.840 --> 12:57.840
You're going to do a hat thing.

12:57.840 --> 12:58.840
I'm going to grab a hat for the rest of the episode.

12:58.840 --> 12:59.840
I'm going to wear a hat.

12:59.840 --> 13:00.840
There you go.

13:00.840 --> 13:01.840
Guess what?

13:01.840 --> 13:02.840
I'm doing Unplugged in a hat, Matt.

13:02.840 --> 13:03.840
We're going to go in the future.

13:03.840 --> 13:04.840
This is my internet hat of things.

13:04.840 --> 13:08.960
And on this episode, I'm going to just have Google Docs sort of projected into my eyes

13:08.960 --> 13:12.960
because my hat of internet of things has snap down glasses because why not?

13:12.960 --> 13:14.720
Because it's got battery capacity for that.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.160
And I'll tell you what we're going to talk about.

13:16.160 --> 13:19.800
There's an upcoming distribution that promises to make it easy to game on Linux.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.920
And then it's from folks you may have heard of before.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.520
We're going to talk about that.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.720
Also, it's not Wayland.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.720
It's not Mir.

13:26.720 --> 13:31.480
No, ladies and gentlemen, a brand, brand new way to do graphics on the Linux desktop coming

13:31.480 --> 13:33.040
to you by Google.

13:33.040 --> 13:36.640
Yeah, we're going to talk about Freon a little bit in this episode.

13:36.640 --> 13:37.640
Yeah, I know.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.600
What, did you say it was called Leon?

13:39.600 --> 13:40.600
No, Freon.

13:40.600 --> 13:41.600
Yeah.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.640
Oh, see, I would have gone with Leon because then it's more recognizable.

13:43.640 --> 13:44.640
Hey, you know.

13:44.640 --> 13:45.640
Oh, yeah, man, I'm running Leon.

13:45.640 --> 13:48.640
You know how we have this open source thing called Wayland?

13:48.640 --> 13:51.440
That's a protocol that you could just kind of use.

13:51.440 --> 13:56.120
Well, let's just say if it's not invented here, you're never going to use it.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.680
And then we'll move forward from there.

13:57.680 --> 14:01.280
We're going to talk about Freon that's coming up later in the show today.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.440
We actually have, I'm really excited about today's Unplugged.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.000
It's a good smattering of topics.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.600
And one thing I want to get into with the mumble room is if anybody thinks this new

14:09.600 --> 14:14.880
Linux code of conduct, or I'm sorry, conflict resolution code that was merged into the Linux

14:14.880 --> 14:19.760
kernel during the Linux action show this Sunday, I guess Linus is probably just doing that

14:19.760 --> 14:21.000
while he's watching the show.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.160
If we actually think it's going to help how the Linux kernel developers interact with

14:25.160 --> 14:27.720
each other and if they need to change it.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.840
So that'll be coming up in the show as well, Matt.

14:29.840 --> 14:34.320
But you know, I've been trying something kind of new in the Unplugged show.

14:34.320 --> 14:38.920
There is a, you know, Matt, you got to mind the gap and between a Linux action show and

14:38.920 --> 14:42.680
Linux Unplugged, new stories develop and they change.

14:42.680 --> 14:47.420
And there is, there is a gap that oftentimes a couple of stories get dropped that just

14:47.420 --> 14:49.520
don't make it into any one of the shows.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.320
And so I've been trying to pick those things up and bring them to the forefront.

14:52.320 --> 14:57.160
Now one, I think we're going to talk about more later on Sunday is Ozone OS.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.600
I think that's how you say it or Ozon, Ozone, right?

14:59.600 --> 15:03.480
It's from the folks behind the Numix project and of course the Nitrix project designed

15:03.480 --> 15:08.360
to get you into a simple, sleek and modern desktop and get stuff done quickly.

15:08.360 --> 15:11.920
It is, if the Numix guys could make a desktop, well guess what?

15:11.920 --> 15:13.720
They have and this is what it would look like.

15:13.720 --> 15:16.960
Remember Matt, they teased it on our interview with them during the Linux action show that

15:16.960 --> 15:17.960
they're going to be working on it.

15:17.960 --> 15:18.960
Yeah.

15:18.960 --> 15:19.960
Well here it is.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.460
The latest OS release is called Hydrogen.

15:21.460 --> 15:23.560
It's based on Fedora 21.

15:23.560 --> 15:29.720
It uses Gnome Shell 3.14, customized with their own extensions to make it a unique experience.

15:29.720 --> 15:33.480
It ships with a gorgeous GTK theme, shell icons, the whole thing.

15:33.480 --> 15:37.120
So you got the GTK theme, you have a shell theme and an icon theme to make the whole

15:37.120 --> 15:39.520
thing freaking gorgeous.

15:39.520 --> 15:44.280
They have the dock down on the bottom and oh, oh they have a YouTube video and you know

15:44.280 --> 15:45.280
what that means.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.280
Chris got to play that YouTube video.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.280
Let's see what we can.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.800
Hey Matt, when there's YouTube, I got to play it.

15:49.800 --> 15:54.800
Oh yeah, we got some music.

15:54.800 --> 15:59.160
Atom Desktop, a simple, fast app storage by usage so your more frequent apps come up to

15:59.160 --> 16:00.160
the front.

16:00.160 --> 16:04.400
It comes with Chrome.

16:04.400 --> 16:10.200
They're using obviously a very nice theme so files looks like a very nice file manager.

16:10.200 --> 16:13.040
The icons are gorgeous, I'm not going to lie.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.040
It's very white.

16:14.040 --> 16:20.040
Oh, it looks like they have a software center in here Matt.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.040
Oh yeah.

16:21.040 --> 16:25.840
Oh wow, there's slight transparency in the menu so like you know they have the client

16:25.840 --> 16:29.040
side decorations but there's a slight transparency in them.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.840
The icons are just gorgeous.

16:31.840 --> 16:35.840
Yeah, wow.

16:35.840 --> 16:39.840
You know this might be the kind of, this is a fedora I could use.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.760
Yeah oh yeah, no it definitely looks great.

16:41.760 --> 16:46.800
Oh my gosh, so the Google Play, oh okay, alright so I think, yeah I'm going to give this a

16:46.800 --> 16:53.160
download and give it a try.

16:53.160 --> 16:57.320
I mean from a visual like just first impressions point of view, it's really, really cool.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.320
I am impressed by it.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.800
No, I really am impressed by this.

16:59.800 --> 17:00.880
I think this looks really good.

17:00.880 --> 17:04.960
I am really impressed that they, so here's the thing is what I was worried about when

17:04.960 --> 17:08.120
they first talked about it although they kind of corrected it pretty soon is I was worried

17:08.120 --> 17:12.180
they're going to go off and do something on their own and you and I have sort of lamented

17:12.180 --> 17:16.840
during our fedora reviews like why is nobody building an amazing distribution based off

17:16.840 --> 17:17.840
fedora?

17:17.840 --> 17:22.400
Like you have a million distributions based off of Ubuntu and Debian and nothing based

17:22.400 --> 17:24.640
off fedora or openSUSE of Merit.

17:24.640 --> 17:30.440
I mean there are some now like Korora which is great but Korora is essentially fedora.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.920
This is, this is true.

17:31.920 --> 17:37.400
This is not quite as hard core but this is nearly elementary OS meets fedora.

17:37.400 --> 17:40.580
It's not as hard core as that but it's close to that.

17:40.580 --> 17:45.160
That to me is a very compelling use of fedora as a very good base, technologically it has

17:45.160 --> 17:49.940
a lot of good features, it's pretty cutting edge but it's got a lot of rough edges.

17:49.940 --> 17:53.880
You throw this on top of it and you make it ready to play Steam games, I think it's kind

17:53.880 --> 17:54.880
of.

17:54.880 --> 17:59.200
So here's the thing, okay, here's what, haven't you, whenever you get asked, hey I would like

17:59.200 --> 18:02.720
to try out Linux and I want to be able to play some games, your default answer always

18:02.720 --> 18:06.440
is okay we should probably try out Ubuntu and in the back of your mind you're going

18:06.440 --> 18:11.060
gosh but I don't know like you know they're about to switch up the Unity desktop environment

18:11.060 --> 18:14.360
to this whole new thing and the next update could be really weird and I'm not sure if

18:14.360 --> 18:17.660
I'm putting you on a path that you're not going to be entirely happy with and there's

18:17.660 --> 18:21.180
these other distros that spin off of Ubuntu called Ubuntu Mate but they're still kind

18:21.180 --> 18:25.220
of you know attached at the hip to this main distribution that I'm not so sure where this

18:25.220 --> 18:29.040
is going and there's this other distribution called Fedora that's connected to this Red

18:29.040 --> 18:32.880
Hat company that I'm pretty sure is a good long-term bet and I would really like to be

18:32.880 --> 18:37.920
able to recommend this to you but I for God's sakes can't give you to just go try out Fedora,

18:37.920 --> 18:42.020
that would be horrible for a brand new user but something that takes Fedora and makes

18:42.020 --> 18:47.260
it presentable and user-friendly but lets you use a distribution that is based off something

18:47.260 --> 18:51.220
from Red Hat that's something I would have a little more confidence in recommending to

18:51.220 --> 18:55.080
a new user once it has some more development time.

18:55.080 --> 18:59.980
I would agree with that and one thing I need to refresh on is I need to re-examine where

18:59.980 --> 19:04.500
we're at as far as package availability for a lot of the specialty proprietary apps that

19:04.500 --> 19:09.280
I use most most distinctly see where that's at and how easy it is to get to but if it

19:09.280 --> 19:12.360
from what I'm seeing though it kind of looks like it's all just right there in a software

19:12.360 --> 19:14.380
center like environment.

19:14.380 --> 19:16.620
It looks like the nicest Fedora I've ever seen.

19:16.620 --> 19:21.620
I think it might be something I'm going to have to download it that's just what it is

19:21.620 --> 19:22.900
I mean there's just no way around it.

19:22.900 --> 19:27.020
Alright Rotten Corpse what do you think?

19:27.020 --> 19:31.660
Well it's actually really nice looking and I'm a GNOME fan and I like how they're using

19:31.660 --> 19:36.100
extensions to expand on GNOME rather than trying to fork it or something.

19:36.100 --> 19:40.300
The only problems that they've done a few things tweaks that are kind of odd like for

19:40.300 --> 19:44.940
example when you open up the application launcher there's no categories there's no folders it's

19:44.940 --> 19:48.620
just you have frequency of use of applications and that's it.

19:48.620 --> 19:49.620
You don't have any choices.

19:49.620 --> 19:51.500
And then you have to search for anything else?

19:51.500 --> 19:55.100
Yeah you have to search for everything and the pop like if you look at the screenshot

19:55.100 --> 19:59.300
it just shows like the most the most frequently used and it has really no order whatsoever.

19:59.300 --> 20:03.120
It could be a 1.0 or it's as a beta I mean that could be something they add but yeah

20:03.120 --> 20:06.260
that is a little that's a little odd I'll grant you that.

20:06.260 --> 20:10.600
I could see though how for a lot of users that would be kind of nice but if it's not

20:10.600 --> 20:15.140
pre-populated with some basics that could be very confusing too.

20:15.140 --> 20:21.140
It's a pretty cool distro it looks pretty awesome I like how they're replacing Shotwell

20:21.140 --> 20:25.980
with G-Thumb because they're actually you know being up to date now whereas Shotwell

20:25.980 --> 20:28.900
is pretty slow and updating.

20:28.900 --> 20:33.260
The only thing I only application they chose that's kind of weird is the tomahawk selection

20:33.260 --> 20:39.340
because tomahawks cool in theory they have like a lot of broken stuff and I've actually

20:39.340 --> 20:43.140
kind of like talked with the tomahawk people and they are working on a lot of different

20:43.140 --> 20:47.620
things that eventually it will be awesome right now it's still in like you know beta

20:47.620 --> 20:48.620
stage.

20:48.620 --> 20:52.340
What do you think about this what do you think about calling it the Adam desktop instead

20:52.340 --> 20:57.500
of calling it like Gnome Plus or something is that is it is that taking it well I guess

20:57.500 --> 21:00.860
if this is early days maybe they have intentions to go further perhaps that's what they're

21:00.860 --> 21:02.500
implying.

21:02.500 --> 21:05.500
Well I think they're they're calling the Adam desktop because all of their they're calling

21:05.500 --> 21:11.300
every single extension they make Adam something so maybe they just think that it's the Adam

21:11.300 --> 21:14.300
desktop is Gnome Plus all the Adam add-ons.

21:14.300 --> 21:19.620
It's interesting they do things like top icons by default I think it's a pretty smart bet

21:19.620 --> 21:25.620
doing the extension route because if you look at the trajectory of Gnome right now for example

21:25.620 --> 21:33.060
Gnome 3.16 is looking really really good and so for them it's going to be minimal effort

21:33.060 --> 21:39.500
to take these modifications theoretically and move them to Gnome 3.16 because it's their

21:39.500 --> 21:46.020
extensions works it's not it's not as dramatic of a it's not quote unquote a fork for example.

21:46.020 --> 21:49.660
Even their extensions are not very extensive like they're they're extensive in the sense

21:49.660 --> 21:54.980
of like what they're offering but they're not like so you know catastrophically different

21:54.980 --> 21:59.840
that if when when 3.16 comes out then automatically they're broken you can't use them anymore

21:59.840 --> 22:04.340
you have to rebuild everything they're they're changing things like they're instead of using

22:04.340 --> 22:08.820
the dock inside the overview they're making a dock like a genuine dock at the bottom and

22:08.820 --> 22:13.700
things like that it's it seems more like it's Gnome with extra polish.

22:13.700 --> 22:19.060
So they are using the the software center the Gnome software center as their software

22:19.060 --> 22:25.220
center but it says here they're doing things like they're including repos for things like

22:25.220 --> 22:30.580
making it easy to install codecs in various software inside the software center so again

22:30.580 --> 22:35.140
making Fedora a little more approachable.

22:35.140 --> 22:39.900
I'm gonna I'm gonna have to download this and give and kick the tires because I have

22:39.900 --> 22:44.940
felt I have felt basically for the last two releases but really with the last release

22:44.940 --> 22:50.740
of Fedora that it is such a it's such a great base distribution but the project itself probably

22:50.740 --> 22:54.700
because of its affiliation with Red Hat just they can't seal the deal to make it really

22:54.700 --> 23:00.780
approachable for users that are not free software crusaders, right?

23:00.780 --> 23:01.780
Yes, I agree.

23:01.780 --> 23:05.860
I think the fact that they're adding their RPM fusion includes that it's gonna solve

23:05.860 --> 23:07.340
some of the proprietary issues too.

23:07.340 --> 23:08.900
So why don't you like Tomahawk?

23:08.900 --> 23:09.900
Spotify and things.

23:09.900 --> 23:17.500
Oh, Tomahawk is awesome Tomahawk is a really cool concept but for example Google Play support

23:17.500 --> 23:22.060
like in their video they mentioned that you can use Google Music yeah you can it's just

23:22.060 --> 23:25.660
it's not integrated with any other service so you're either using your local stuff or

23:25.660 --> 23:28.700
you're using your Google Play Music and that's it.

23:28.700 --> 23:32.420
You can't switch between the two and you can't do shuffling between the two but it also has

23:32.420 --> 23:35.500
like Spotify so right now I've pretty much only been using Spotify for the last couple

23:35.500 --> 23:38.960
of weeks and all but also has things like own cloud support and I have a lot of music

23:38.960 --> 23:43.740
up on my own cloud server and it's they're all separated right but if you could that's

23:43.740 --> 23:47.580
the only reason I don't like it if you can pick if you can pick just one you get a native

23:47.580 --> 23:52.580
desktop application that allows you to have access to these cloud music services.

23:52.580 --> 23:55.340
Well there's also something like Clementine that does the same thing.

23:55.340 --> 23:57.960
Yeah Clementine would have been a good choice too yeah yeah.

23:57.960 --> 24:02.780
Well I like Tomahawk and it's got a lot of potential and I've talked to the people who

24:02.780 --> 24:07.100
are developing it and they said they are working on integration for all of the different cloud

24:07.100 --> 24:12.580
music plus local and like currently certain there's like weird views so like for example

24:12.580 --> 24:17.980
you can't you can't shuffle through Google Play Music stuff you can only play in like

24:17.980 --> 24:21.900
select and create your own playlist you can't actually do any kind of shuffle mode and that's

24:21.900 --> 24:27.300
and that's pretty weird but the like you can't like currently you can't even do a list view

24:27.300 --> 24:31.100
like you can just see just album covers you can't even say here just give me a list of

24:31.100 --> 24:36.960
all the stuff in my cloud you know my music Google Music account you can't even do that.

24:36.960 --> 24:43.540
So it's kind of like it's got a lot of potential and I am looking forward to it being more

24:43.540 --> 24:44.540
like a 1.0.

24:44.540 --> 24:50.580
I love the idea I love the idea because once it becomes a native GTK or whatever Linux

24:50.580 --> 24:55.260
application you know then things like my keyboard controls work a lot better and all kinds I

24:55.260 --> 24:59.860
love the idea of taking some of these cloud quote unquote services just using the word

24:59.860 --> 25:04.140
like it actually is a real word now and and and and then you know integrating with a local

25:04.140 --> 25:09.620
desktop something else real quick before we before we stop talking about ozone also steam

25:09.620 --> 25:17.020
pre-installed chromium default browser I mean this is this is my fedora if I spent two days

25:17.020 --> 25:21.760
I was gonna say three but one to two days setting it up RPM fusion repos I mean this

25:21.760 --> 25:27.940
is my fedora so yeah I just and it's fun because they teased it on our show it was the first

25:27.940 --> 25:31.500
place they ever mentioned it and now we get to see it here so I'll have links in the show

25:31.500 --> 25:34.500
notes if you guys want to go check it out probably talk a little bit more about it so

25:34.500 --> 25:45.260
of course it's but what what no no three dot eighteen dot eight kernels that way your chrome

25:45.260 --> 25:50.320
works just fine heyo anyways and also a link to a web update article where they did a good

25:50.320 --> 25:56.220
post on it I was gonna ask I was hoping poppy would stop by but I don't anybody running

25:56.220 --> 26:04.040
the anybody in the mumbler running the 1504 betas once wimpy you are oh yeah of course

26:04.040 --> 26:08.220
you are yes of course yes of course you are of course so I guess you've probably then

26:08.220 --> 26:16.060
you've made the switch over to system D any thing to report not a lot I've not had any

26:16.060 --> 26:22.980
difficulties myself the only thing that I've noticed is that if you've previously installed

26:22.980 --> 26:29.980
and gone for full disk encryption then system D is slow to boot and that's because there's

26:29.980 --> 26:37.260
a 90 second timeout whilst it tries and fails to do cryptid swap and they're working on

26:37.260 --> 26:43.260
fixing that so that's the only like major in air quotes issue I've seen with it but

26:43.260 --> 26:49.860
by and large it's been a seamless transition poppy did post on Google Plus that after his

26:49.860 --> 26:56.340
work day he did the update upstart was removed system D was added and all worked fine with

26:56.340 --> 27:02.940
no drama except for the historical drama attached with the entire system D tobacco yeah let's

27:02.940 --> 27:10.000
not get into that no no we shouldn't all right well before we continue on I want to take

27:10.000 --> 27:15.620
a minute right now and talk about our first sponsor and that's Linux Academy go over to

27:15.620 --> 27:23.120
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to get our special Linux unplugged discount which is

27:23.120 --> 27:27.420
unique to the Linux unplugged show I don't want to brag but Linux Academy I want to reach

27:27.420 --> 27:31.180
out specifically to the Linux audience to give you guys a special discount and Linux

27:31.180 --> 27:34.780
Academy is an awesome resource for you to take your knowledge set to the next level

27:34.780 --> 27:39.900
it's created by people that are truly passionate about Linux about teaching people about all

27:39.900 --> 27:43.940
of the categories that they cover and that's why they're not a generic training site they

27:43.940 --> 27:50.460
are dedicated to this and now they've been a sponsor for a little while I've had the

27:50.460 --> 27:55.540
opportunity to hear some really nice success stories and that is pretty amazing when you

27:55.540 --> 28:02.500
think about what success means right success when you go to Linux Academy means you've

28:02.500 --> 28:08.040
been able to pass a certification or you're able to get that job that you couldn't get

28:08.040 --> 28:12.180
before or maybe you did a little better on the review like that's the kind of success

28:12.180 --> 28:17.060
that has an impact on your life like nothing else and that's what's really unique about

28:17.060 --> 28:21.980
Linux Academy they have step-by-step video courses they have comprehensive study guides

28:21.980 --> 28:27.700
you can download and keep them viewer Seth he likes to listen to some of the mp3 content

28:27.700 --> 28:31.560
in the shower they also have live streams where you can ask the educator questions they

28:31.560 --> 28:35.440
have scenario based training and what's super sweet about this is this is going to give

28:35.440 --> 28:40.220
you a hands-on experience with the technology so by the time you're done with that lab you've

28:40.220 --> 28:43.960
actually implemented the technology you'd be working within production so when you go

28:43.960 --> 28:48.100
work with it in production it's not the first time you've ever touched that it's not the

28:48.100 --> 28:51.060
first time you've ever done that it's not the first time you've ever read that config

28:51.060 --> 28:55.420
file how embarrassing is that right no the scenario based training you actually go implement

28:55.420 --> 29:02.460
that technology and from and and for me because Amazon Web Services was an entirely new beast

29:02.460 --> 29:08.260
that was of its own and total creation unlike anything else I was a little intimidated by

29:08.260 --> 29:13.860
that the fact that I could go over to Linux Academy and wrap my brain around using s3

29:13.860 --> 29:19.140
and using the AWS mailing services and using their DNS and really kind of wrap my brain

29:19.140 --> 29:22.780
on how all of those things can work together so that way when I go to talk about it it's

29:22.780 --> 29:28.220
not the first time I've ever seen it that was that was critical for me go to linuxacademy.com

29:28.220 --> 29:34.940
slash unplugged get our 33% discount and get started I have a great success story right

29:34.940 --> 29:41.380
here thank you Linux Academy by Mike Kay I just landed the job of my dreams at a hosting

29:41.380 --> 29:46.980
company as a Linux administrator I can't thank you guys enough also I want to give a shout

29:46.980 --> 29:50.500
out to the guys over Jupiter broadcasting if it wasn't for the Linux action show and

29:50.500 --> 29:56.980
Linux unplugged I never would have known about Linux Academy that's pretty cool linuxacademy.com

29:56.980 --> 30:00.740
slash unplugged yeah Matt I mean that's that's seriously the coolest thing ever that's amazing

30:00.740 --> 30:06.340
yep go check it out it's really a great resource I'm using it now my wife Angela is using it

30:06.340 --> 30:10.900
as well Michael Domino from Koda radio he has the team pass that way his team can use

30:10.900 --> 30:18.780
it linuxacademy.com slash unplugged okay so I got a few things I want to talk to you guys

30:18.780 --> 30:24.060
about you guys this would have been a great topic for tech snap but we pre-recorded this

30:24.060 --> 30:27.660
week and so I thought well since it's Linux related I'm gonna be a little selfish I'll

30:27.660 --> 30:32.180
go ahead and grab it for the Linux unplugged show you guys may be familiar about project

30:32.180 --> 30:36.020
zero we've talked about it on the tech snap show before it's this initiative by Google

30:36.020 --> 30:41.660
to try to crack well in the most case open source projects but it's not because they

30:41.660 --> 30:44.780
hate open source it's because they want to try to find the bad stuff before like state

30:44.780 --> 30:52.040
actors or malware authors do and so it turns out they've been able to do a pretty devastating

30:52.040 --> 30:58.020
attack against Linux you're not gonna believe how they did it and especially you laptop

30:58.020 --> 31:01.340
users are susceptible to it if you're on a desktop you're not as susceptible to this

31:01.340 --> 31:08.460
attack get this the technique dubbed as a row hammer rapidly writes and rewrites to

31:08.460 --> 31:13.420
memory to force capacitor errors in DRAM which can be exploited to gain control of the system

31:13.420 --> 31:19.860
by repeatedly recharging one line of RAM cells bits in an adjacent line can be altered thus

31:19.860 --> 31:23.560
corrupting the data stored the corruption could lead to the wrong instructions being

31:23.560 --> 31:27.980
executed or control structures that govern how memory is assigned a program being altered

31:27.980 --> 31:34.100
the latter case can be used by a normal program to gain kernel level privileges the project

31:34.100 --> 31:39.660
zero team has now built two working exploits that successfully hijacked control of many

31:39.660 --> 31:45.180
x86 computing systems running Linux as they say they could do the same with other operating

31:45.180 --> 31:48.800
systems as well but they're kind of focused on trying to find flaws in open source software

31:48.800 --> 31:52.900
to make open source more secure the proof of concept exploit code flips bits in RAM

31:52.900 --> 31:58.780
to alter the page tables for a process allowing an attacker to gain access to all physical

31:58.780 --> 32:03.660
RAM including the kernels memory space from this point memory protection mechanisms and

32:03.660 --> 32:07.500
other security measures can be completely bypassed and structures within the operating

32:07.500 --> 32:12.900
system tampered with within to take over the machine now here's this how great is this

32:12.900 --> 32:20.660
the team tested the exploit on 29 x86 based laptops built between 2010 2014 using ddr3

32:20.660 --> 32:28.260
ram in 15 cases the team could successfully subvert the systems within minutes and found

32:28.260 --> 32:32.860
the DRAM made by a variety of manufacturers is susceptible to the attack here's the interesting

32:32.860 --> 32:39.440
part though while there was a high cracking rate the team reported almost no success on

32:39.440 --> 32:46.360
desktop machines this is possibly because those computers news use newer RAM maybe some

32:46.360 --> 32:50.500
of those computers were using ECC RAM with error correcting of course which makes row

32:50.500 --> 32:56.060
hammer attacks on the kernel much harder to accomplish or maybe that laptops are just

32:56.060 --> 33:00.700
denser and lower power so they're easier to corrupt and then this article goes on to talk

33:00.700 --> 33:04.340
about a bunch of other really interesting things but they say the Google team also said

33:04.340 --> 33:10.860
newer firmware versions like just to the bios the change of the CPU and the memories controller

33:10.860 --> 33:15.540
like just talk like how fast they refresh the RAM reduce the effectiveness of this of

33:15.540 --> 33:20.580
row hammer attack to not completely though just kind of in most cases made it take longer

33:20.580 --> 33:25.500
the team has released the code on github and can be used to test Linux and macOS systems

33:25.500 --> 33:30.380
for the vulnerability and in the article I link in the show notes that github code is

33:30.380 --> 33:35.060
linked so if you want to test your machine if you want to go all project zero here's

33:35.060 --> 33:42.740
the row hammer test code right there on github yikes I almost want to do it but then like

33:42.740 --> 33:46.700
you don't want to know no you do but you don't you really don't right like right you want

33:46.700 --> 33:49.580
to do it on someone else's machine especially someone you don't like right like if it's

33:49.580 --> 33:54.140
like a client that's like a real bear or something do it on their machine no that's okay I just

33:54.140 --> 33:57.540
don't I just don't I don't I don't have you act like we don't have you're like oh boy

33:57.540 --> 34:02.220
there's nothing I can do there's exactly yeah there's no way you could ever prevent anything

34:02.220 --> 34:10.100
from avoiding that Windows Linux Mac anything that has the permissions in RAM you know even

34:10.100 --> 34:14.860
the no execute bit those are by pages in the RAM of the computer yeah well even though

34:14.860 --> 34:20.040
it's enabled by the CPU they're all based in the RAM so you can just flip bits no matter

34:20.040 --> 34:25.260
what regardless for the operating system I was talking about a story on tech talk today

34:25.260 --> 34:31.220
one forty two I think it was today and we're talking about how the CIA has had a multi

34:31.220 --> 34:37.900
year effort underway to crack iOS devices and I was you know I was kind of thinking

34:37.900 --> 34:43.660
about like that that is just like a pretty nasty situation where they have gotten to

34:43.660 --> 34:48.000
the point where if they cannot crack your encryption if they cannot crap your crack

34:48.000 --> 34:54.540
your password or whatever it is they will take an iPhone and they will watch the electrical

34:54.540 --> 35:03.260
use and frequency of the CPU as it does encryption and from that can reverse engineer some keys

35:03.260 --> 35:08.380
to crack the encryption and I'm thinking to myself okay if my foe is somebody who can

35:08.380 --> 35:14.220
take my phone and put in a sensor grid and watch the electrical output of my CPU from

35:14.220 --> 35:19.400
afar and then somehow reverse engineer the encryption from that there's not a lot I'm

35:19.400 --> 35:23.660
going to be able to do this is nothing you can do about that and there's there's no point

35:23.660 --> 35:29.700
in worrying about that yeah you can leak information and pretty much most ways that's why a lot

35:29.700 --> 35:35.320
of things try to be deterministic or never allow variation in the operations that it

35:35.320 --> 35:41.400
actually performs everything is consistent it will be impossible for at least as impossible

35:41.400 --> 35:49.800
as designed or architected but it's very rarely that perfect software has bugs yeah and people

35:49.800 --> 35:58.460
are buggy yes they are all right wanted to just do a follow-up something that broke kind

35:58.460 --> 36:02.900
of between Linux action show and now that has really gotten out of control is this big

36:02.900 --> 36:08.100
hoopla around and I started to see a brew and I like no way what's going on here during

36:08.100 --> 36:11.740
before we for before we went on the earth Linux action show decided not to run with

36:11.740 --> 36:17.180
the story and then it just exploded like people are all upset Google is dropping support for

36:17.180 --> 36:24.380
every version of Linux before version 3.16 how dare Google Chrome is going to be completely

36:24.380 --> 36:31.000
unusable on on LTS is like just all of this outrage and I was like what is going on here

36:31.000 --> 36:38.260
well okay okay all right it turns out just mislabeling the bug has caused all of this

36:38.260 --> 36:44.040
major confusion and outrage on forums all across the internet over the weekend you might

36:44.040 --> 36:47.100
not even heard about this if you weren't paying too close of attention because it happened

36:47.100 --> 36:51.860
so damn fast a few days ago it appeared that Google began requiring new versions of the

36:51.860 --> 36:56.940
Linux kernel in order to use Chrome or Chromium now it appears Google intends to continue

36:56.940 --> 37:01.780
to support older versions of the Linux kernel but they're hitting a buck it appeared with

37:01.780 --> 37:06.180
modern versions of Google's Chrome and Corbyn web browsers it seems to be that there was

37:06.180 --> 37:12.300
a dependency on version 3.17 or newer of Linux otherwise when dealing with Chrome or Chrome

37:12.300 --> 37:16.660
extensions the user would get error messages it turns out that Google intended for there

37:16.660 --> 37:21.860
to be didn't intend for there to be a hard requirement on version 3.17 a Chromium developer

37:21.860 --> 37:27.060
commented on the bug and said I'm updating the title so that people who have been misled

37:27.060 --> 37:32.100
into thinking that non TSY and C kernels were deprecated immediately understand it's simply

37:32.100 --> 37:35.660
just to some unknown bug that are hitting some users and they're continuing to work

37:35.660 --> 37:40.900
on it so if you read that Chrome will no longer work on your version of Ubuntu because you

37:40.900 --> 37:48.100
have the 13 you have the 3.13 kernel or something like that or 3.16 kernel never fear Chromium

37:48.100 --> 37:54.780
is not going away I just I couldn't believe that this is just another example of why Firefox

37:54.780 --> 38:02.100
is awesome oh for God's sake really that's where we go with it I mean I don't mind Firefox

38:02.100 --> 38:08.580
but for God's sake hey Wimpy are you are you awake are you still around oh yeah I'm awake

38:08.580 --> 38:14.060
just yeah are you okay are you okay yeah are you okay yeah all right good here I have an

38:14.060 --> 38:19.420
email that I think you are the perfect person to answer so zek the penguin right cranky

38:19.420 --> 38:26.060
I know I know question about Matei and the pie hi guys glad to be getting in touch again

38:26.060 --> 38:30.020
I listen to unplug this week and was wondering if anybody's tried Ubuntu Matei on the Raspberry

38:30.020 --> 38:34.960
Pi by the way did you know there's a pie two out now holy crap I suppose this question

38:34.960 --> 38:39.140
might be more for the mumble room but here it is I've noticed there has been no mention

38:39.140 --> 38:42.860
of a bunch of TV for some time I've looked around what's the deal on that stay frosty

38:42.860 --> 38:48.220
zek the penguin so I'll get to the bunch of TV thing in a sec but wimpy anything to share

38:48.220 --> 38:57.700
on Ubuntu Matei and the Raspberry Pi okay on the Raspberry Pi you know the original versions

38:57.700 --> 39:06.660
there'll be no Ubuntu on those models because Ubuntu don't build for arm v6 they only build

39:06.660 --> 39:15.020
for arm v7 but if you've got a Raspberry Pi 2 then somebody in the Ubuntu Matei community

39:15.020 --> 39:22.860
ported Ubuntu Matei 1504 to the Raspberry Pi a couple of days ago so that's available

39:22.860 --> 39:30.700
now and I've had preliminary conversations with some of the Ubuntu devs that are responsible

39:30.700 --> 39:37.280
for Ubuntu snappy core to get some advice as to how we might be able to make that an

39:37.280 --> 39:44.180
official image and they've given us some really cunning advice about just creating a root

39:44.180 --> 39:52.340
file system for arm v7 hard float and then the instructions on how you then integrate

39:52.340 --> 39:59.740
a bootloader and a kernel for any other arm v7 platform into that root file system so

39:59.740 --> 40:06.220
you can effectively enable that for a multitude of arm v7 devices so we're looking at that

40:06.220 --> 40:11.380
but if you've got a Raspberry Pi 2 there's an Ubuntu Matei 1504 image available for you

40:11.380 --> 40:16.580
now which is well ahead of the schedule as far as I'm concerned yeah I was pretty surprised

40:16.580 --> 40:22.060
when I saw that on Google Plus yeah it's pretty great pretty great well no I tell you what

40:22.060 --> 40:27.380
I can't take any no this and I wish I could pronounce the community members name but it's

40:27.380 --> 40:32.980
got far too many letters that I can't string together in it so I'm just gonna say thank

40:32.980 --> 40:38.100
you and you know who you are yeah that's pretty neat and you know what it makes a lot of sense

40:38.100 --> 40:42.820
for the Raspberry Pi especially this new one is supposed to be much faster makes me sound

40:42.820 --> 40:46.980
it makes it honestly it makes it sound like you could be used as a full-fledged desktop

40:46.980 --> 40:51.780
at what have you got any reports back on the performance good enough that you can use

40:51.780 --> 40:59.580
LibreOffice in it well I mean that's that's pretty big that's like in a browser yeah that's

40:59.580 --> 41:04.860
really where it comes down for me yeah yeah reasonably you know then cool yes so long

41:04.860 --> 41:10.900
as you're using HTML 5 rather than flash that all works too there's we haven't caught the

41:10.900 --> 41:16.120
guy the guy that's looking at this hasn't quite figured out the the accelerated video

41:16.120 --> 41:21.300
yet do I think that's just a matter of time and we're also looking at the Odroid c1 as

41:21.300 --> 41:27.780
well ooh very nice that's pretty exciting that's pretty exciting oh Wimpy I always love

41:27.780 --> 41:31.380
getting the updates I feel like I get the inside scoop it's great I know right so Zach

41:31.380 --> 41:34.260
the penguin I hope that answers your question sounds like that might be an area to play

41:34.260 --> 41:38.580
around with and oh man now you're making me want a Pi 2 so if anybody out there in the

41:38.580 --> 41:43.860
audience ends up trying it out on a Pi 2 I'd love to hear your thoughts go over to JupiterBroadcasting.com

41:43.860 --> 41:49.500
slash contact and tell me your thoughts or maybe you know we've all got phones with cameras

41:49.500 --> 41:53.260
now why the hell aren't some of you taking more videos and just upload that to YouTube

41:53.260 --> 41:58.300
and email that into the show I'd like to actually see the phone I want to see how it works how

41:58.300 --> 42:03.940
does it function how well does it work that's what I want to know so go over to JupiterBroadcasting.com

42:03.940 --> 42:07.380
slash contact and you'll find the Linux unplugged show in the drop down or you can submit to

42:07.380 --> 42:11.420
LinuxActionShow.reddit.com hey before we run too far I know I've mentioned a lot I don't

42:11.420 --> 42:14.220
mean to be obnoxious but I just really want to see you I want to meet you I want to shake

42:14.220 --> 42:21.380
your hand at Linux Fest Northwest 2015 I know it's a long ways to go but let me tell you

42:21.380 --> 42:27.820
the United States of America we've got like more than 20 states we do yeah like a lot

42:27.820 --> 42:32.980
more than 20 states and you know what Matt maybe you would tend to disagree but tell

42:32.980 --> 42:37.700
me Washington it's one of the best isn't it oh it's I've been to a few of them yeah up

42:37.700 --> 42:42.700
and down the area I've been way up north way down south and I would say Washington is definitely

42:42.700 --> 42:48.140
both weather wise and culture wise is just chill it's very relaxed yeah Washington Washington's

42:48.140 --> 42:52.420
the best state out of all of them absolutely and so that's why we want you to come to Linux

42:52.420 --> 42:56.740
Fest Northwest because one of the best places in Washington is Bellingham Washington I mean

42:56.740 --> 43:01.540
there's Seattle and they have a Space Needle and they have sports there but you know what

43:01.540 --> 43:05.820
they don't have the true genuine hippie culture of Washington that's up in Bellingham it's

43:05.820 --> 43:10.520
so true too right growing up in Bellingham for a good portion of my years yes that's

43:10.520 --> 43:14.580
actually yeah so if you really want to know what Washington's about you come to Bellingham

43:14.580 --> 43:19.020
if you want to know what we want you to think Washington's about you go to Seattle exactly

43:19.020 --> 43:24.020
yes now you got it now you got it so it's April 25th and 26 we're gonna try to get as

43:24.020 --> 43:29.060
much of the crew out there as possible we really want to go big this year and so that

43:29.060 --> 43:33.220
means you know we're gonna be flying we're gonna be flying folks out we're gonna be having

43:33.220 --> 43:36.580
some big after parties and things like that and along to go with that we've launched a

43:36.580 --> 43:41.620
new shirt if you go to teespring.com slash Linux we've only sold 38 we need to get to

43:41.620 --> 43:46.700
150 even meet goal and at that we won't even be covering our Linux Fest Northwest costs

43:46.700 --> 43:51.380
not even a little bit we would have to probably sell a lot more than that because we're selling

43:51.380 --> 43:55.100
the t-shirt specifically near cost but if you could go over to teespring.com slash Linux

43:55.100 --> 43:58.660
grab yourself some swag you've got that we've got the long sleeve shirt we've got the hoodie

43:58.660 --> 44:03.100
this will support our Linux Fest Northwest efforts we've also got the ladies tee you

44:03.100 --> 44:08.460
can go grab that over there as well as the kids tee which is look at that $13 for the

44:08.460 --> 44:13.820
kids tee $17 for the t-shirt that's our cost so if you if you really want to make sure

44:13.820 --> 44:17.660
we get there I'm not even joking you might want to buy two we set it low because we really

44:17.660 --> 44:21.820
want as many folks wearing this way as possible right now the number one color seems to be

44:21.820 --> 44:25.660
this nice blue which I'm not gonna lie it does look really good and you know what pro

44:25.660 --> 44:30.580
tip your Chris had your Chris right here you this guy this me me I had your back when we

44:30.580 --> 44:35.460
designed the new Linux action show logo for episode 300 we knew what was up we'd actually

44:35.460 --> 44:39.980
gotten our crap together by that point and we decided let's make sure that this will

44:39.980 --> 44:45.340
print well on a shirt so we've designed the Linux action show logo at for episode 300

44:45.340 --> 44:49.820
and forward specifically to make sure that when we do swag it prints well and my friends

44:49.820 --> 44:54.000
it does this is the only black and white run of the Linux action show logo that we have

44:54.000 --> 44:57.380
done and we are trying to raise funds for our coverage of Linux Fest Northwest you can

44:57.380 --> 45:03.140
get it at teespring.com slash Linux and we have only sold a meager 38 so far not even

45:03.140 --> 45:07.900
reaching the goal and the idea is once we raise the funds then we're gonna be able to

45:07.900 --> 45:14.380
afford things like flying out guys like rotten corpse and q5 sis and Chris Moore and Alan

45:14.380 --> 45:21.900
Jude and Michael Dominic and like could you imagine how much it costs to fly all of those

45:21.900 --> 45:27.180
people out and put them up in a hotel room can you imagine it's got to be like two thousand

45:27.180 --> 45:32.620
dollars a person so there's no way Alan is great I mean we did I think that's what we

45:32.620 --> 45:35.600
did that one year I just popped him out of a crate so there's I mean it'd be nice right

45:35.600 --> 45:40.940
now 38 shirts is not gonna do it that's for sure that's damn sure and I even if we sold

45:40.940 --> 45:43.860
a thousand we probably only still cover only a part of it but anything we could do could

45:43.860 --> 45:47.060
help plus then you get some awesome swag even if you're not going to the fest you can still

45:47.060 --> 45:52.680
get a great shirt and the logo does look good and I have found for some reason that rocket

45:52.680 --> 45:57.560
seems to start conversations and then with you are clever you segue that conversation

45:57.560 --> 46:02.280
into discussion about Linux and software freedom and I know that sounds like stupid but you'd

46:02.280 --> 46:06.540
actually be surprised how often that has happened I'm not even kidding I went got my hair cut

46:06.540 --> 46:12.500
today and I'm wearing the unfilter shirt and like somebody unfilter what's that I'm like

46:12.500 --> 46:18.780
oh well let me tell you and it's a great opportunity to also to plug the network so anyways that's

46:18.780 --> 46:25.580
my super long way of saying Linux fest Northwest 2015 is coming up and they've just today opened

46:25.580 --> 46:30.940
up early registration you can go register right now and if you want to be a if you want

46:30.940 --> 46:35.220
to register for free you can or if you want to toss in to them you get a t-shirt and at

46:35.220 --> 46:40.500
60 bucks and it helps support the Linux fest Northwest as well it's a great we go to all

46:40.500 --> 46:45.020
of them you know and I got to tell you it's one of the best in the US of a and if you

46:45.020 --> 46:49.520
ever considered coming to United States Linux fest not only gonna get a great test of great

46:49.520 --> 46:54.340
taste of one of the best states in the United States of America you'll also get exposed

46:54.340 --> 47:00.500
to some great barbecue some great JB experiences and get a great fast at the same time that's

47:00.500 --> 47:06.020
right man I tell you what man I made myself want to go now and I already want to go well

47:06.020 --> 47:08.980
you know and I think two important things to realize too is one if you have a shirt

47:08.980 --> 47:13.420
on we know we know you're with us boom and that's important the second thing is if you're

47:13.420 --> 47:17.700
if you are coming up do the hotel thing now don't wait till don't wait till April don't

47:17.700 --> 47:21.300
wait till few days before trust me you're gonna get a better experience if you do it

47:21.300 --> 47:26.460
now you know really really important the thing is and this is why the shirt is so important

47:26.460 --> 47:32.060
is last year I think there was about thirteen hundred fourteen hundred attendants to Linux

47:32.060 --> 47:36.580
fest Northwest and I think about seven hundred of those attendants were wearing Jupiter broadcasting

47:36.580 --> 47:42.460
swag so we got to do it again this year we cannot go down in numbers right we got to

47:42.460 --> 47:48.180
make a sea of Linux action show and and that that there's one clear reason to do that because

47:48.180 --> 47:51.500
the more shirts that are say Linux action show the more interviews we're gonna get come

47:51.500 --> 47:57.780
on let's be honest no I don't know all right so anyways teespring.com slash Linux why not

47:57.780 --> 48:01.260
I say it's a good-looking logo if I don't say so myself I'll tell you what else is great

48:01.260 --> 48:06.620
our first actually I'm sorry our second sponsor this week and that's digital ocean and a digital

48:06.620 --> 48:12.340
ocean is all in on Linux so when the Linux kernel developers create a code of conduct

48:12.340 --> 48:16.300
they're probably paying attention and when core OS came onto the scene they were also

48:16.300 --> 48:19.340
paying attention that's why they scrambled to work with the core OS project directly

48:19.340 --> 48:22.820
so that way they could get subscribed to the development channel so that way they get official

48:22.820 --> 48:27.640
updates directly from the project I love it they truly get it they get community they

48:27.640 --> 48:31.780
get open source they get Linux and they understood that if they're gonna have a compelling product

48:31.780 --> 48:35.580
it they couldn't just have a great UI that's pretty obvious if you look at their website

48:35.580 --> 48:39.140
they've got the best in the business clearly but they also knew they needed to build it

48:39.140 --> 48:44.460
on top of incredible technology state-of-the-art bandwidth and data centers and really let's

48:44.460 --> 48:50.420
be honest Linux right it's Linux and KVM that makes digital ocean possible and it's that

48:50.420 --> 48:55.940
fact that they use Linux and KVM is why I use digital ocean because I have faith in

48:55.940 --> 49:00.060
that infrastructure I have faith in that setup and that's one of the reasons why I'm happy

49:00.060 --> 49:05.060
using them as sort of my back-end infrastructure every time we have to spin up a Jupiter broadcasting

49:05.060 --> 49:09.340
server it kind of took me a little while to really wrap my brain around this idea because

49:09.340 --> 49:14.040
at first I kind of thought oh this is my VPS you know I need to go I need to go do a thing

49:14.040 --> 49:20.260
I'll have I'll go spin up a VPS now I think of them as my server room like when when when

49:20.260 --> 49:24.140
somebody comes to me says Chris we're gonna have to do this thing like you know dedicated

49:24.140 --> 49:29.420
video streaming or a new type of Ruby on rails things to manage our chat room like I don't

49:29.420 --> 49:35.220
think of anything other than digital ocean like that is my server room because it's so

49:35.220 --> 49:41.700
easy to get started it is simple intuitive and it's very fast you can start in less than

49:41.700 --> 49:46.820
55 seconds and pricing plans start at only five dollars a month it's gonna get your 512

49:46.820 --> 49:53.020
megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer if you're just

49:53.020 --> 49:56.460
starting out we just did our production on Linux episode of the Linux action show if

49:56.460 --> 50:00.660
you're just starting out your podcast just host your files on a digital ocean droplet

50:00.660 --> 50:05.280
I wish this was available when I started okay data center locations in New York San Francisco

50:05.280 --> 50:09.740
Singapore Amsterdam and London so you could have multiple like for like 15 bucks you could

50:09.740 --> 50:14.880
have like essentially worldwide distribution man I love that again it was blogging too

50:14.880 --> 50:20.180
like I wish this was available when blogging became a thing it's so nice but at that interface

50:20.180 --> 50:24.180
it's crazy intuitive and power you just can replicate the interface with digital oceans

50:24.180 --> 50:27.820
API and the community has already done that a bunch there's a great a ton apps just you

50:27.820 --> 50:30.980
can go out a ton of great apps you just go out there and take advantage of like right

50:30.980 --> 50:35.380
now in the Google Play Store for your Android device in the iOS store for your Apple but

50:35.380 --> 50:39.260
really just all kinds like this the whole spectrum from bash applications to Ubuntu

50:39.260 --> 50:44.660
applets to puppets plugins I mean it's the full spectrum and there's new ones being developed

50:44.660 --> 50:51.080
all of the time why because the API is actually really good it's really good and so the development

50:51.080 --> 50:53.820
community and there's a really passionate community the same thing you see the same

50:53.820 --> 50:57.820
thing in digital oceans tutorials community they get passionate about it because they've

50:57.820 --> 51:02.980
given them the tools they've given them a reasonable value and so much to work with

51:02.980 --> 51:07.480

and a big thanks digital ocean for sponsoring the linux unplugged show I love it I love

52:03.440 --> 52:07.980
it all the time I love it a little bit inappropriately to be honest with you I spend entirely too

52:07.980 --> 52:11.820
much time in my droplets I'm always coming up with something so it's really cool now

52:11.820 --> 52:18.620
I guess Linus kind of has a reputation you know he's kind of known for being a little

52:18.620 --> 52:23.780
tough the linux development mailing list is known for colin as it is it's been bit of

52:23.780 --> 52:27.980
a it's been a bit of a point of discussion for the last year or so I'm not actually totally

52:27.980 --> 52:32.460
sure why it feels like if you don't like it just don't participate yeah but it might you

52:32.460 --> 52:37.540
know it's gotten to the point though matt where it's just not going away you know I

52:37.540 --> 52:42.260
honestly yeah and I guess it really depends on now if there's enough people that are bothered

52:42.260 --> 52:47.540
by it then it can become a thing but I think if it's just one or two you know it's really

52:47.540 --> 52:52.560
kind of up in the air I for myself personally I don't see an issue yes he comes off like

52:52.560 --> 52:56.820
a raving lunatic sometimes that's fine you can do it right back to him and it's all good

52:56.820 --> 52:59.740
you know as long as things are you know I just don't see it as that big of a thing but

52:59.740 --> 53:03.540
I know a lot of people are really really upset by it and you know maybe they need a code

53:03.540 --> 53:09.380
of conduct I don't know that's something they're gonna determine so friend of the show Greg

53:09.380 --> 53:16.380
KH submitted a patch to the Linux kernel during the Linux action show he said and here I'll

53:16.380 --> 53:20.340
cover that in a second but the idea is to make the Linux mailing Linux kernel mailing

53:20.340 --> 53:27.580
list maybe a bit more peaceful they've they're going to adopt a code of conduct the title

53:27.580 --> 53:30.780
I don't know if I call it quite a code of conduct I don't think that's quite the right

53:30.780 --> 53:36.600
title it's more like a method to resolve conflicts like for example in it they say the Linux

53:36.600 --> 53:40.580
kernel development effort is a very personal process compared to traditional ways of developing

53:40.580 --> 53:45.900
software your code and ideas behind it will carefully be reviewed often resulting in critique

53:45.900 --> 53:50.780
and criticism the review will almost require will almost always require improvements to

53:50.780 --> 53:54.680
the code before it can be included to the kernel know that this happens because everyone

53:54.680 --> 53:59.700
involved wants to see the best possible solution for the overall success of Linux this development

53:59.700 --> 54:04.060
process has been proven to create the most robust operating system kernel ever and we

54:04.060 --> 54:08.020
do not want to do anything to cause the quality of submission and eventual result to ever

54:08.020 --> 54:13.720
decrease now Matt I'm not a corporate speak master anymore but if I were to pull out my

54:13.720 --> 54:18.920
old corporate speak to me that sounds like what they're codifying there is attitude essentially

54:18.920 --> 54:22.820
what they're saying is this process has attitude and if you can't handle the heat get out of

54:22.820 --> 54:26.780
the kitchen do you disagree exactly what it is they just they were lacking synergy and

54:26.780 --> 54:33.700
focus but otherwise they nailed it yeah yeah yeah yeah okay all right and then before we

54:33.700 --> 54:40.420
jump in too much further the new code which was made by a via a Linux kernel patch continues

54:40.420 --> 54:45.780
if however anyone feels personally abused threatened or otherwise uncomfortable due

54:45.780 --> 54:51.140
to this process that is not acceptable if so please contact Linux foundations technical

54:51.140 --> 54:55.540
advisory board or the individual members and they will work to resolve the issue to the

54:55.540 --> 55:01.220
best of their ability as a reviewer of code please strive to keep things civil and focused

55:01.220 --> 55:06.500
on the technical issues involved we are all humans and frustrations can be high on both

55:06.500 --> 55:13.540
sides of the process try to keep in mind the immortal words of Bill and Ted be excellent

55:13.540 --> 55:21.500
to each other like that amazing yeah that's amazing that's that's incredible that's a

55:21.500 --> 55:24.980
very good way of putting it I'm okay with it from the fact that I think it's important

55:24.980 --> 55:30.580
that it doesn't come down to sexist comments or you know racial slurs and things like that

55:30.580 --> 55:33.660
that that's not okay but I think if you're just calling someone a dumbass or it's like

55:33.660 --> 55:37.880
pull your head out of your backside pay attention you stupid fool or what you know that's whatever

55:37.880 --> 55:41.300
that that's not pointing toward any one group of people that's just basically hating on

55:41.300 --> 55:44.940
anyone who did something stupid you know I don't have a problem with that all right so

55:44.940 --> 55:50.460
the Linux foundation tuned in with their with their thoughts on it but before I go any further

55:50.460 --> 55:54.500
wimpy or anyone in the mummer of anything jump to you is this gonna even work in the

55:54.500 --> 56:00.980
Linux kernel team have a code of conduct well I like the fact it's called a code of conflict

56:00.980 --> 56:07.340
I think that that's that's the best the best title for it given where it's been placed

56:07.340 --> 56:19.020
right and yeah the Linux kernel developments kind of famous for its occasional blow-ups

56:19.020 --> 56:26.860
and raucous attitude and is this is this now Linux kernel development growing up and getting

56:26.860 --> 56:35.140
a little bit corporate and PC and and a little bit sensible and not quite so punk and chaotic

56:35.140 --> 56:41.880
and anarchic like it used to be is it that or is it codifying bad behavior as a code

56:41.880 --> 56:50.320
of conduct maybe I don't know it doesn't seem to be because there's an escalation channel

56:50.320 --> 56:55.660
for if people are uncomfortable with how they've been treated so it feels like this is this

56:55.660 --> 57:02.380
is sanitizing and normalizing you know Linux kernel development behavior to be more in

57:02.380 --> 57:07.300
line with what you'd expect in traditional working environments and that's that's good

57:07.300 --> 57:13.940
and bad it's good because it can be more inclusive and it's bad because well that a little bit

57:13.940 --> 57:19.380
of the anarchy of Linux kernel development was maybe as maybe died a little bit maybe

57:19.380 --> 57:26.500
maybe Linus is a little bit sad rumor is that he was he was not totally absolutely happy

57:26.500 --> 57:32.940
with it but he is the one that committed the patch well he would he would be really wouldn't

57:32.940 --> 57:38.060
they I mean ultimately yeah he has to he has to accept these things isn't it funny they

57:38.060 --> 57:42.740
did this as a patch that's kind of funny right they do this as a patch that's that's that's

57:42.740 --> 57:50.500
classic and it's kernel tree so why not yeah yeah well I would rather have a warning sign

57:50.500 --> 57:57.940
then accidentally fall into a manhole having a warning knowing what I'm going to get into

57:57.940 --> 58:02.180
and having it that's fair it almost offends their position that they can be assholes to

58:02.180 --> 58:08.300
you and be ready for it yeah right like you're you're stepping into the arena even though

58:08.300 --> 58:15.620
they're kidding or saying it up front they're almost legitimizing it well and shouldn't

58:15.620 --> 58:20.900
it's okay though because it's good to have conflict like to have good feedback couldn't

58:20.900 --> 58:25.660
you argue that Linux kernel development is like in the top 10 most important development

58:25.660 --> 58:33.500
software development projects of all of humanity because so much depends on Linux that if somebody

58:33.500 --> 58:38.420
screws something up you literally you I mean you could you could impact live through the

58:38.420 --> 58:46.380
world yeah so like maybe it's okay that sometimes people use kind of difficult and hard words

58:46.380 --> 58:51.140
when they're developing on one of the most important projects of our entire society's

58:51.140 --> 58:56.300
creation I'm not saying the most maybe I don't know but I'm saying it's got to be up in like

58:56.300 --> 59:01.580
the top 10 right like look at the entire freaking world runs on it right and so if it seems

59:01.580 --> 59:07.260
like from time to time if you do something that makes that thing less good you probably

59:07.260 --> 59:16.620
should be yelled at yeah yeah everyone's baby and also you know if if Linux is a reflection

59:16.620 --> 59:23.220
of humanity through software development then it should probably reflect reflect its imperfections

59:23.220 --> 59:31.380
as well yeah yeah exactly for better or worse and you know but I guess this is sort of saying

59:31.380 --> 59:35.540
we're going to allow some room for that but we're going to try to keep it semi-civil and

59:35.540 --> 59:39.780
it's have an official process when things get out get out of hand right that's kind

59:39.780 --> 59:45.340
of what they're saying don't seem like it yeah Colonel Linux is Linus told a dev in

59:45.340 --> 59:49.580
the mailing list that he wished that he would have retroactively abort what he didn't say

59:49.580 --> 59:54.780
currently he doesn't finish the thought the whole patch maybe I don't know I think it

59:54.780 --> 01:00:00.180
was the whole that was the whole comment but he thought he was surprised he could find

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:09.300
his well very good that's rather means he wanted him to die yeah I got it now all right

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:15.660
should we you know when canonical announced their own display server I don't know if you

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:20.620
guys noticed but the entire internet caught on fire at least the the lands of Linux when

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:28.660
when mirror was announced I believe that it was the end of times and the debate raged

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:37.660
and continues to rage so this week Google announced their own display server called

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:46.340
free on to replace x11 on Chromebooks not based on Wayland not based on mere their own

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:54.020
totally invented at Google solution and we're going to talk about it right after I mentioned

01:00:54.020 --> 01:01:00.280
ting go to Linux dot ting dot com right now to go get $25 off your first device or your

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:05.560
service plan and man is ting rockin right now so they've rolled out the GSM to the open

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:10.300
better you can get your device on the ting network if it's GSM compatible they just did

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:14.140
a big post over on their blog that talks about all the different types of devices that work

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:18.900
on the ting network let me just tell you it's a lot right because I got the whole CDMA spectrum

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:23.060
now and the GSM spectrum just got to make sure it's the right frequencies and they have

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:29.100
it all laid out in a brand new blog post go over to Linux dot ting dot com to get started

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:33.740
then you can check on the blog to see if your device is compatible lots of great use cases

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:37.460
for these devices I've been hearing about some good ones Colonel Linux he's got an old

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:41.720
Nokia device that he uses as like the bat bone that he brought back to life it's a feature

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.920
phone it's like okay two people have this phone number if it rings I actually know that's

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:51.360
an important phone call chase right our buddy from how to Linux and the unfilter show his

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:57.780
home security system running off the ting GSM network myself I have put my my Nexus

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:04.220
5 on the ting GSM network holy crap holy holy holy crap I'm gonna tell you about here in

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:08.940
a second Nexus 5 it's so badass on the ting network because I can switch I can go I can

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:13.980
move back to the CDMA network if I want or the GSM network which that's that's mind-blowing

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.420
if you think about like kind of flexibility that gives you but here's the great thing

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:22.340
about ting I'm only paying for what I use it's a flat six dollars a month now I'm gonna

01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:27.020
tell you real talk ladies and gentlemen that's a game changer if you're a small business

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:31.780
a company like Jupiter broadcasting we really can't afford to do jack but one of the things

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:37.140
I can afford to do is give people on our team cell phones that is huge for us as an internet

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:41.900
connected company that is extremely important and ting is making it possible I just checked

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:51.300
our ting bill for three devices and an iPhone 5 and HTC one and a Nexus 5 $55 is our bill

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:55.960
three smartphones hotspot and tethering are included all of the features it's just six

01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.380
dollars for the line and then we pay for our usage I've got three freaking high-end smartphones

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:06.140
on my plan I would not be able to do this as a business if it was not for ting like

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:11.100
I would not have an option for this and I'm only paying $55 a month if you're a family

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:15.620
you can take advantage of that same savings go to linux.ting.com right now try out their

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:19.820
savings calculator see how much you could you could save I think you'd be pretty much

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:24.300
just shave it off shave it down shave it down now let me tell you about that GSM coverage

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:28.780
it's gonna vary you can find out your coverage information on the ting website but this morning

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.740
on my drive into work as I was streaming I was like you know what I'm doing 50 miles

01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:39.060
per hour right now how 2015 is this what kind of bandwidth am I gonna get while I'm doing

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:44.300
50 miles per hour on a podunk country road it's in Marysville Washington it's called

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:49.420
67th and if you know what I'm talking about this is this is a this is a in the woods road

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:53.700
that is literally cut between farmland that's why I take it it's a beautiful drive and I'm

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:59.380
doing 50 miles per hour I open up the speed test app I get 18 megabits down 17 megabits

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:06.260
up 31 millisecond ping while I'm driving in my truck on the ting GSM service it is so

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:12.140
awesome and I'm only paying for what I use linux.ting.com go there and support this show

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:18.040
go try it out and also I'll give a quick plug to women's tech radio women's tech radio has

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:23.900
been giving out some ting GSM cards if you like I think episode go listen episode 16

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:27.760
this latest episode women's tech radio within the first few minutes they have information

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.700
you can get on the you can get in for the drawing to get a free ting GSM sim and they

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:36.620
have information in episode 16 of women's tech radio and the reason why I tell you that

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:41.640
I don't I mean they get the credit for it but the reason why I tell you that is game

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:47.120
changer it's so much fun when I do something like this and I and it just totally opens

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:51.700
up a whole new world of speed and signal and it's just it's such it's so exciting it's

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:56.340
such a game changer I want you to experience it to go to linux.ting.com to get started

01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:01.120
go listen to women's tech radio episode 16 to get a free GSM sim is they have a drawing

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.180
it's not gonna take you know not much I mean there's other people listening to but you

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:11.440
have a shot again they're giving out two GSM cards free GSM cards per episode so you got

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.920
a good shot and that's episode 16 of women's tech radio anyways go to linux.ting.com to

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:20.040
get started try out the savings calculator just to get an idea of what you'd save especially

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.400
for your business and if you're thinking about buying a device specifically to run on the

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:28.360
ting GSM network go read their blog post about shopping for a GSM device first a lot of good

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:33.920
information and it's really simple and there's a lot of devices that work for ting now linux.ting.com

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:38.800
and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring the linux unplugged show I'll tell you I was there

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.560
yesterday and watching you play with it inside and you know it's like the speed readouts

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:47.360
were just like you showed it to me I'm like yeah yeah how you must be on Wi-Fi no no you're

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.840
on you know like you're on tickets like oh my god that's crazy it was really cool wasn't

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:55.640
it it was awesome yeah and the thing really gets crazy when I'm in full signal to it really

01:05:55.640 --> 01:06:01.160
gets crazy all right so let's talk about Freon real quick so if you haven't heard this is

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:08.720
Google's effort to basically remove x11 dependencies from Chrome OS altogether Freon is not based

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:14.120
on Wayland or Mir Freon does away with the rest of x11 dependencies and its processes

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:20.600
aiming to provide better performance and reduced power consumption and a smaller Chrome OS binary

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:28.040
within Freon there technically is not a display server I want to repeat that technically Freon

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:34.000
is not a display server under Freon drivers under the Freon driver model the Chrome browser

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:40.560
talk the Chrome browser talks directly to the kernels DRM and KMS APIs and is also communicating

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:46.760
directly with open GL ES for the 3d drawing functionalities within Chrome OS 41 this functionality

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:50.920
is mostly for the Intel Chromebooks while the various Samsung ARM Chromebook should

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:56.240
receive similar treatment in later releases the initial Freon supported devices include

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:03.760
the Chromebook pixel the Acer c720 the Asus Chromebox the HP Chromebox the LG Chrome base

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:09.160
the Acer Chromebox and the Dell Chromebox the initial limitations are due to be independent

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:15.640
on DRM and KMS support in the hardware this is a new approach though among the benefits

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:20.400
of Freon is supporting hardware overlays for compositing partial screen update supports

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.640
you just update a certain area of the screen zero copy texture uploads external display

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:33.160
device improvements and reduced input in the late in the latency stack sounds nice why

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.120
didn't Google just use Wayland though anybody in the mumble room have any thoughts why would

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:42.440
Google have to go invent its own system why not just use the Wayland protocol well Google

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:47.460
have invented their own system before why didn't they use surface flinger yeah they've

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:54.280
already got all the work done before they made this they had a thing called Ozone and

01:07:54.280 --> 01:08:02.320
they are making the Wayland and mirror abstractions built on top of Ozone and Ozone talks to KMS

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:08.320
and DRM through right but not to be not to be confused with the Linux distribution yes

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:13.120
so they already have this layer called Ozone so they've already got two implementations

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:17.680
which talk directly to the kernel already they're just adding one that is a little bit

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:23.280
less protocol your extraction yeah I mean essentially it sounds like they have it all

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:28.260
decoupled or decoupled already I mean this is not my area of expertise but it sounds

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:34.120
like on Chrome OS they've essentially been doing a lot of all of the heavy lifting inside

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:40.120
Chrome and then just sending the output to X to just draw it to the screen here X here's

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:43.920
all of the hard work now could you just as a frame buffer dump this to the screen for

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:48.940
me and now what they're going to do is take X11 out of that all together Chrome will talk

01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:52.160
directly to the kernel and the kernel will then display it directly on the screen through

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:55.800
the current because the rendering processes all have their own compositors within the

01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:01.640
browser already they're already within each like within the browser architecture so since

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:07.600
the compositor is already there in the browser all they need to do is just do a direct well

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:14.020
code they have to talk directly to that one Ozone layer and they get directly to the kernel

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:23.040
they take the whole process of a what is it method or an indirection by like Wayland or

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:28.480
mirror protocols yeah they're all in an indirection it'll cost so they're just trying to remove

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.720
costs and they're not actually destroying the usability of Wayland or mirror because

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.800
they already have the architecture and code in order to support all three good old Google

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:44.280
it's interesting to watch them really make their own Linux in a way their own Linux distribution

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:48.600
and you know I speak very highly of core OS and they were inspired by Chrome OS in some

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:56.720
ways so I have I have learned to give Chrome OS more consideration and when Google announces

01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.840
they're doing something to kind of sit back and go all right what are they thinking and

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.560
why are they doing it this way like remember when they announced they were going to drop

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:10.080
support for like extended for or something like that oh yeah yeah that was a big yeah

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:14.280
and then they kind of reversed on that and and then with the earlier we talked about

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:19.400
in the episode the dropping support for kernels earlier than 3.16 well that just turns out

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:23.160
to be a proprietary software company that ends up working out in the open sometimes

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:28.220
doesn't title things for public consumption and gets bit by the news cycle in this case

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:33.320
you know the initial reactions have been why aren't you using Wayland well it turns out

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:37.760
we don't really need to we've already done the majority of the work it's interesting

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:43.040
I wonder what happens down the road and how far Google can take this well I think historically

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.320
companies like Google like control so even if it seems like it's just us you know self-centered

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:53.360
unneeded act a lot of times they just feel more comfortable being in the driver's seat

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:58.000
yeah you know yeah it's unfortunate but it's true oh Popey you managed to make it just

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:05.080
as we end the show yeah sorry about that yeah it's the daylight savings isn't it yep yeah

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:10.360
I know it is the worst thing ever that we purposely put ourselves through don't even

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:17.040
get me ranting again it's all right we missed you how is that how are things in Ubuntu touchland

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:23.460
Popey good busy busy busy yeah I saw there was a community QA today and your name was

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:27.200
dropped in it there's the only part I saw and their name dropping you so your internet

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:32.280
famous now oh yeah yeah it's all over now the one part I saw and their name dropping

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:37.200
him like wow that Popey everybody knows about him now it's he's big-timing us yeah all right

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:43.280
well I had one question for you Popey has anybody go on then as have you heard anybody

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:50.840
talking about somehow connecting the pebble to Ubuntu off her phone which one the old

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.800
pebble or the new pebble time well not well the times not out yet I got the pebble steal

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:58.960
and I just wanted to know if like I could get any if there is there any prospects of

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:04.440
integration I don't know it's one of those things I think you probably have to ask pebble

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:10.120
themselves I know we've poked them I mean publicly one of our developers tweeted at

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:17.240
them when their pebble time Kickstarter kicked off Chimmy poked them on Twitter and said

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:24.480
hey I work for Chronicle I would like to add support in Ubuntu for the pebble time so yeah

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.320
with I don't know if they replied and I don't know what conversations he's had with them

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:33.400
but yeah they know we exist so it would be nice but you know I've read articles about

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:39.720
how they dropped Windows phone support and they seem to do that in a not very friendly

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:48.640
way so I'm not hugely optimistic to be honest hmm all right well so I you know I want to

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:53.840
make up I want to make a plea again to the audience I would love to get your runs Linux

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:58.560
like just like take a selfie or for God's sakes or don't do that but a video or something

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.840
of your setup upload to YouTube or imager Flickr whatever you need to do I'm not gonna

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:08.400
judge go over to Jupiter broadcasting click the contact link choose a Linux action show

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:12.320
from the drop down but runs Linux in the subject line and send it I want runs Linux from the

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:17.400
people I want yours out there for for goodness sake you got to have a decent Linux setup

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.560
I don't care it could be your laptop I don't care what it is I just want to see it we can

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.400
say and put your IRC handle in there so we can give you a call out or Twitter handle

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.000
or your name whatever you go by maybe you're not some sort of weird internet person maybe

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.440
you just have a real name whatever whatever you go by put that in the email put a little

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.520
description of what your setup is and I'll feature it as a runs Linux videos are going

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:40.640
to be more likely to be featured especially shorter ones and I'd love to do that I just

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:44.840
especially once where you hold the phone the correct direction yeah probably yeah I just

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:48.840
said I mentioned it from time to time and it never really happens but one of these days

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.480
one of these days Matt I will get an epic runs Linux from the audience you just wait

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.600
you just wait hey Matt is there anywhere you want to send folks throughout the week if

01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:01.600
they want to follow up on what Matt's up to best place to go is matthartley.com slide

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.640
down to one of the subscription options there all the stuff that I have going on is happening

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:10.640
you can you know follow social media I'll send an email situation it's such a good looking

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.960
modern looking website I don't even I don't even like under like I need you to you need

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.800
to make me a site it just looks good people should go there it just looks good Matt's

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.080
all fancy I've actually got a couple other ones I'll show you I think you might be all

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.960
right with them pretty conscientious but I'm still you know not like I would never say

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:28.880
I'm a developer but I'm comfortable you fancy Matt all right everybody join us live next

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.620
Tuesday go to jblive.tv on a Tuesday jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get it for your local time

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:36.760
zone we'd love to have you live in that mobile rooms open you can join us in that virtual

01:14:36.760 --> 01:15:04.640
log if you don't get the time zone messed up like poppy did see you back here next week

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.240
it is the weirdest thing you'd think when you when you have an audience of linux user

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:14.240
and you say hey send me your runs linux setup you'd think you'd get one or two from time

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:20.520
to time I mean I get a couple but then you know I have a theory yeah what is that I think

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:25.200
it's because of all the all the times we're on linux for the past you know a couple years

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.080
or so there have been something that's kind of awesome like a movie studio yeah like that

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:34.160
people like mine's not that cool no I know that's the whole point that's the whole point

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:39.400
is I want the people's runs linux I want the people's runs linux there's a magazine linux

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:45.400
voice and in the back on the back cover they have a little bit that's got a q&a with someone

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:50.440
and a photo of their of their workstation and they do it every month and it's quite

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:55.280
cool you should you know just ask people to do that you know seeing a photo of your workstation

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.680
that would be cool that's a shame I've got some something to add oh go ahead and add

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.440
away go ahead add away I'll turn off the motivational music you can add away yeah yeah

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:06.640
turn that turn that rubbish off what do you got what do you got at all I was trying to

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:12.560
get people to vote yeah well yeah yeah go and vote go and go and go and think up better

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:15.960
titles because apparently they're all crap they're crap and whilst you're thinking up

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:25.720
better titles I'll I'll have a chat with Chris on linux action action show you and Noah mentioned

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:32.680
they had a feedback from a user who was looking for accessibility options under linux yes

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:42.260
okay I can talk a little bit about this so with regards to screen readers orca is really

01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:49.040
where it's at that's your only option and if I forget the name of the the person that

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:54.080
had written in but if they're not happy with orca it's quite possibly that they're not

01:16:54.080 --> 01:17:00.400
happy with the voices that orcas using an orca isn't the actual the speaking software

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:09.440
it's e-speak and what they probably need to do is head over to sonar gnu linux they make

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:17.320
an accessible operating system that's based on manjaro uses gnome 3 and they have some

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:23.400
tweaks to e-speak to sort of change the cadence of the voice it still sounds a little bit

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:30.120
robotic but they're working with an external organization to bring some new voices to e-speak

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:37.120
that are a bit more natural so I would suggest anyone that is blind or visually impaired

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:43.480
start by heading over to sonar gnu linux and they they have an irc chat room and also a

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:49.160
mumble server obvious for obvious reasons and the people you need to speak to are either

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:56.200
kyle brouard or kendall clark or jonathan nado who's the president of the accessible

01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:03.240
computing foundation and they're the people driving all of this and if you don't get any

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:09.320
any joy with sonar gnu linux i'm sure you will because they're the right people to talk

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:16.000
to another operating system that's highly accessible and has had the thumbs up endorsement

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.520
from the accessible computing foundation is ubuntu mate which is a fully accessible operating

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:28.920
system but we still have the rather crappy voices in e-speak and are waiting for the

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:34.320
accessible computing foundation to refine the voices and when they do that we'll integrate

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:53.200
them very nice thank you
