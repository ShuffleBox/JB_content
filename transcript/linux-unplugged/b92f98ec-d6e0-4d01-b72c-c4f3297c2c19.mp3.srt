1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,080
Wes, what do you think?

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,840
Nintendo and Super Nintendo,

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,400
good game consoles or greatest game consoles ever?

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,680
Here we are almost 30 years later

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,520
and people are still remaking these games,

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,360
replaying these games.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,080
We're watching right now on the live stream

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,340
the automatic 3Dification of an NES game,

9
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,760
which started out as a bit of a ruse

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,960
because there's this April 1st conference

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,540
where people have published fake research.

12
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,720
It's been going on for years.

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,660
And as usual, this guy over here,

14
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,440
we got a link to the blog post.

15
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,400
I think his name is Tom.

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,600
He created an NES emulator

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,880
that actually renders the NES game in legit 3D.

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,760
So manual steps involved,

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,400
but best game console or greatest?

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,440
I'm just gonna throw my PlayStation 4 right out the window.

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,480
What do I need it for when I can have this?

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,200
VR v Schmar, I want this, exactly.

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,040
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,840
I mean, it does say something

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,680
about the enduring value of these games.

26
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,600
Yeah, you know what it tells you?

27
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,960
You code something really well once

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,200
and you make people love it and it sticks around.

29
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,280
It's part of the culture forever.

30
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,120
Yeah, it's almost open source by default.

31
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,960
Yeah, exactly.

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,240
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 194 for April 25th, 2017.

33
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:27,240
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

34
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,240
that's celebrating International Penguin Day.

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,080
My name is Chris.

36
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,920
My name is Wes.

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,160
It really is legitimately.

38
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, that's great.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,840
I know, I'm very excited

40
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,320
because we got a great show to celebrate.

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,160
Yeah.

42
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,000
Tux's birthday.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,840
It's officially Tux's birthday.

44
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,680
Happy birthday, Tux.

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,080
The mascot of Linux.

46
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,800
Yeah, coming up on this week's episode,

47
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,840
of the Unplugged program.

48
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,560
I'm not gonna say we're gonna talk about System D.

49
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,400
We're actually gonna talk about the total lack of System D.

50
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,720
Yeah, but that's totally different.

51
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,780
That is totally different

52
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,240
and it's coming up at the end of the show.

53
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,840
So if you have no interest,

54
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,360
you'll be able to tune out before we get there.

55
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,240
But first, the Linux Foundation has made

56
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,480
their largest announcement in the history of the Foundation.

57
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,400
Whoa.

58
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,280
I'm not sure if a lot of people are talking about it.

59
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,120
Yeah.

60
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,520
But I actually have some exclusive footage

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
that I've been sitting on for three weeks

62
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,520
I wasn't allowed to tell you about.

63
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,080
And I will play it for you today

64
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,600
now that Linux Foundation has made their announcement.

65
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,320
So that's coming up in the show.

66
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,680
Plus, of course, we're gonna go through some updates

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,640
on our favorite open source projects.

68
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,120
And it turns out, I know a lot of you love it.

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,680
I know it.

70
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,880
But I got some bad news.

71
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,360
Thunderbird is on the ropes and it's not coming from me.

72
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,120
It's coming from the developers of the project.

73
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,560
And it's really thanks to improvements coming to Firefox

74
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,600
that robbed Thunderbird.

75
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,320
So we'll be talking about what's all going on there

76
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,520
and why you should actually care,

77
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,120
even if you're not a Thunderbird user.

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,080
And trust me, there are some reasons.

79
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,480
Some drama going on with some Unity 8 ports.

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,840
We're gonna clarify some announcements

81
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,000
that were on the show last week.

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,080
And big changes coming to Debian.

83
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,520
But before we can get to any of that, Wes,

84
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,880
we gotta bring in that mobile room.

85
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,720
Heck yeah.

86
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,160
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

87
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,000
Hello.

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,840
Hey.

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,240
Hello, hello.

90
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,120
Hello, you know, you guys,

91
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,400
I think if we practice a little bit after the show,

92
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,120
we could make a pretty good singing group.

93
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,440
Ooh. Sometimes they nail that.

94
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,720
A little acapella up in here.

95
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,560
That's what I was thinking, Wes.

96
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,400
That sounds great.

97
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,320
Yeah, just something we'll play with.

98
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,160
Just something we'll play with.

99
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,640
But that'll be after the show.

100
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,920
Let's start with some news.

101
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,360
Let's start with some updates.

102
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,560
And I wanted to follow up on something

103
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,320
that we started talking about last week.

104
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,200
And we were literally just talking about it

105
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,320
before I hit the go button on the show.

106
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,480
And there's a group of Linux users.

107
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,600
You might not be one of them, Wes.

108
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm not one of them.

109
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,080
But there's definitely a group of Linux users now

110
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,360
that are looking for replacements to Unity.

111
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,520
They're coming from Unity,

112
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,440
and they're looking for maybe another

113
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,040
desktop environment to land on.

114
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
Is it GNOME with some extensions?

115
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,000
Is it Budgie?

116
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Is it Plasma?

117
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,120
Is it XFCE?

118
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,960
Probably haven't looked in a while.

119
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,360
There's a lot of options now.

120
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,800
Yeah, and one of the things you might notice

121
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,720
when you're making the transition

122
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,320
is every now and then, things will look out of place.

123
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,800
They won't look quite right.

124
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,000
And it's nice if you can kind of smooth things out,

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,600
make everything look like it belongs on the same desktop.

126
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,160
And I don't know if it's just because

127
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,800
of Canonical's announcement,

128
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,880
but it seems like there's a lot of energy around GNOME.

129
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,720
I agree, yeah.

130
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,560
Themes.

131
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,440
And I wanna just follow up on this one,

132
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,480
which I thought was pretty great

133
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,920
because it makes Qt apps, or Qt apps,

134
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,520
feel at home on the GNOME desktop.

135
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,720
It's Edwadia Qt.

136
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,080
It's a theme that you can get

137
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
for the Plasma desktop applications.

138
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,760
And it will match the default GNOME theme.

139
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,640
Now, I'm not gonna sit here and assume

140
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,640
that you would run Edwadia like an animal.

141
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,980
I am assuming you're probably running Arc.

142
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,200
But if you're not, this could be very useful.

143
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,520
Actually, even if I was on Arc or ArcDark,

144
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,000
I would still like my Qt apps

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,200
to look as close to a GNOME app as possible.

146
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,040
Right, yeah.

147
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,600
This is better than what they natively look like.

148
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,560
Yeah, and a lot of folks do run Edwadia by default.

149
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,080
I think they're insane, but they do it.

150
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,320
Once you have it installed,

151
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,040
you set it as the theme for your Qt apps.

152
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,940
If you're on GNOME, you can run qt-config to do this.

153
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,000
Or you could start the Qt app specifically

154
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,880
on the command line with tax style space edwadia.

155
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,840
And then I actually. I'm not gonna do that.

156
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,800
No. I'm not gonna do that.

157
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,000
No, but if you had like one Qt application

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,480
and you wanna just add it to the desktop shortcut.

159
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,080
Make an alias so you have a desktop shortcut,

160
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,900
it would work well.

161
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,840
Can I stop calling him Qt now?

162
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Can I just say Qt?

163
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,120
Can we, is that okay?

164
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,760
Can we, hey, a mumble room.

165
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
Is anybody gonna get offended?

166
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,000
Anybody in the mumble room gonna get triggered

167
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,520
if I just refer to this as Qt application instead of Qt?

168
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,440
Will everybody be okay?

169
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,960
If anybody's gonna get triggered, say something.

170
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,840
Go on once.

171
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,680
Oh, go on.

172
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,840
Monkey, you're gonna get triggered?

173
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,660
No.

174
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,500
Oh, dang.

175
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,120
I was excited there for a second.

176
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,220
What were you gonna say, monkey?

177
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,680
What were you gonna say then?

178
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,600
I was gonna say, I don't need my safe space.

179
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,440
I'm good.

180
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Well, dang it.

181
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,840
All right, well, there goes all the fun for this show.

182
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,600
There goes all the clicks.

183
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,160
Anyways, you can find a link to this in the show notes.

184
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,480
I find this whole process to be really interesting.

185
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,840
I think in all of this,

186
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,360
I'm gonna end up switching back to GNOME myself.

187
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,920
I've had a few people tweet me and ask me.

188
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,480
I don't know why.

189
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,160
I don't know why people seem to care.

190
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,480
But yeah, I have been using Plasma

191
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,080
on about half my machines.

192
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,300
And I haven't switched over on a couple of systems.

193
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,280
And I think on the systems, I have switched to Plasma.

194
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,400
At least for a little while,

195
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,500
I'm gonna switch back to GNOME.

196
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,440
So gotta go full bore here.

197
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,040
Well, I feel like most of the community is in a large way.

198
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,600
I'm not trying to downplay Plasma or people that use it

199
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,640
or the Neon Projects work or anything like that

200
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,040
because I think those are all super relevant.

201
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,200
In fact, after the dust settles,

202
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,400
the Plasma desktop will probably be

203
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,240
more important than ever.

204
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,080
Yes, I think so.

205
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,900
You're right, but.

206
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,740
But right now, I wanna.

207
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,760
Be part of the zeitgeist.

208
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,120
Yeah, I just wanna,

209
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,400
I've been running Plasma desktop for a while.

210
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,160
One of the things I'm interested,

211
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,800
going from Plasma back to GNOME,

212
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,000
is if I'm gonna feel like it's slow as shit.

213
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,480
The whole thing about GNOME,

214
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,300
when I remember switching to Plasma,

215
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,960
was that Kaywin felt like everything was lubricated.

216
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,080
Butter smooth, I think you said.

217
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,720
Just, yeah, everything just flew around on my desktop.

218
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,800
Windows render, I could perceive how the Windows

219
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,200
just moved better.

220
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,760
And I've been doing some reading about that.

221
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,840
Is it mutter?

222
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,320
Because really, the GNOME Shell is like an extension

223
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,860
that runs on top of mutter.

224
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,280
GNOME Shell itself, in some ways,

225
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,940
is like an extension that runs on mutter.

226
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,800
And so is it mutter?

227
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,640
Is that the problem?

228
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,860
Is it JavaScript?

229
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,080
Is GNOME Shell just stuffed full of JavaScript?

230
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,320
And that's why it's so slow.

231
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,720
And that's not really a fair characterization either.

232
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,160
It's, there are some blocking things

233
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,120
that make performance not as great as it should be.

234
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,040
But I have to tell you,

235
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,880
and I don't know if you recall,

236
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,400
but last week when we had Aiki on the show,

237
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,120
I said, hey, tell me about these patches you did

238
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,680
that supposedly make mutter support

239
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,120
the NVIDIA proprietary driver.

240
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,960
Remember that?

241
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,780
And he's like, oh yeah,

242
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,560
that's just something Pharaonyx cares about.

243
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,920
I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

244
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,800
I wanna know.

245
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,040
Well, so since that conversation with Aiki

246
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,640
in the last week's show,

247
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,480
I've been running Solus Gnome Edition

248
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,560
on that Dell 7720.

249
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,000
And it flies, man, it flies.

250
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,760
And it feels like everything's faster

251
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,720
and I don't understand why,

252
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,080
because it feels like even the menus in Chrome are faster.

253
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,440
Like when you click on the bookmarks bar

254
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,040
and you drill down and you click on a bookmark,

255
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,520
the way that shows up and fades away feels faster.

256
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,680
The way that the rest of the desktop performs

257
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,660
while five Chrome tabs are loading at once feels better.

258
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,620
The, there's, I think it's a combination.

259
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,160
I think the first part of the mix

260
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,280
is that Solus by default with their Gnome spin

261
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,120
is shipping the impatience extension.

262
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,940
Oh, right.

263
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,420
And the impatience extension shaves off animation times.

264
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:41,400
So I think there's a bit of that.

265
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
But I tell you what, Wes,

266
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,680
I'll have you use this Gnome machine before you leave.

267
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
It's out there.

268
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,840
I'll have you play around with Gnome

269
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,440
and just tell me if it's not the fastest damn desktop.

270
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,840
I'm excited, that sounds nice.

271
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,660
I, so I feel like gonna move back to Gnome,

272
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,000
gonna try it out again for a little while,

273
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,040
gonna live that lifestyle,

274
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,240
gonna maybe try experimenting

275
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,720
with some of these things people are doing.

276
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,560
Yeah, right.

277
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,000
It makes it a lot easier to like,

278
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,600
to be with, see what the community's doing,

279
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,440
play along with them,

280
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,880
even if you don't want to use that for the long term.

281
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,520
Monkeycom, you have a comment about switching to Gnome?

282
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,800
Well, our whole office is in the process

283
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,160
of upgrading to, from 16,

284
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,880
and they're talking about going to 17,

285
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,200
and now it's okay, well, what do you do?

286
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,160
Gnome or whatever.

287
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,440
Most of our group has gone from Unity to Gnome.

288
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,380
They were going, a couple of them have gone to KDE,

289
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,220
but they ended up with Gnome

290
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,880
because they had Java issues,

291
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,120
and they had Java issues in KDE,

292
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,180
and it may have just been-

293
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,280
Like Java apps not working properly?

294
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,240
Yeah, they have custom apps.

295
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,240
One of them was, oh, the Ruby management,

296
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,320
development environment that they use,

297
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,860
and it runs in Java,

298
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,660
and they were having problems in KDE

299
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,240
where it would just crash randomly,

300
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,660
and it doesn't do it under Gnome,

301
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,640
and the only difference is Gnome.

302
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,920
So it's not, you know, 1704 with KDE.

303
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,400
That just doesn't make any, it's gotta be,

304
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,560
it's gotta be like a,

305
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,280
that just doesn't make any sense to me.

306
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,120
It doesn't.

307
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,280
Why would a Java app be impacted

308
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,680
by the desktop environment?

309
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,640
I don't know.

310
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,600
I mean, it was why we switched from Unity to KDE.

311
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,920
We were just thinking it would be faster and smoother.

312
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,600
Well, you know, Monkey, I hear this

313
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,920
in different versions from a lot of people.

314
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,240
So since the news, Noah and I have been trying to talk to,

315
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,680
like, as many people as we can that are using Unity,

316
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,560
that are switching to Gnome,

317
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,240
or that went from Unity to Gnome,

318
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,720
and we're specifically trying to talk to people

319
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,960
that are using it in the workspace, just like Monkey is.

320
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,660
This is super awesome that we're having this conversation,

321
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,360
because one of the things that we've heard

322
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,000
over and over again in different iterations

323
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,420
is X, Y, Z didn't work under X desktop environment,

324
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,520
so we moved to a different one,

325
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,640
and it's sometimes something didn't work under Gnome,

326
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,100
so they used Unity, and it's, I don't know,

327
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,580
I don't know what, so what it comes,

328
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,740
what I think it must be is something with graphics drivers,

329
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,320
either with the compositor,

330
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,640
and if you're using proprietary versus free.

331
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,500
Do you know, Monkey, if that could be a factor

332
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,340
on any of these systems?

333
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,800
Maybe it was like Compiz versus Mudder.

334
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,720
I mean, could it be something dumb like that?

335
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,120
It could be a thousand things.

336
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,880
It's, you know, when you're installing a bunch of programs,

337
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,300
one of them was a database development program,

338
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,720
and it was a commercial application

339
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,320
that they had running in Unity just fine,

340
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,320
and then when we installed it on KDE, it didn't run.

341
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,280
We were running Neon, so it was 16.04,

342
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,520
but when we went to 17.04 Gnome,

343
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,280
it just ran fine, we had no issues,

344
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,160
so there might have been a distro issue on that one,

345
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,360
but it, you know, it's, you talk to the vendor

346
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,320
who's selling the application, and they're saying,

347
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,520
well, we did all our development under Unity,

348
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,720
and we are in the process of revamping for other distros.

349
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,520
Hmm, wow.

350
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,200
Hmm, well, the beard hooks us up

351
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,600
with something that's perfect for me.

352
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,920
It's exactly what I was just talking about,

353
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,880
the theme for Qt applications

354
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,360
to make them look like Gnome apps.

355
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,560
Well, instead of using Adwadi, if you do use Arc,

356
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,640
the beard's linked us up,

357
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,480
a Arc theme for Qt applications,

358
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,360
so I'm gonna grab this right now.

359
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,200
Yeah, you should, yeah, just grab it.

360
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,720
I'm gonna bookmark this, it'll be in the show notes,

361
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,000
if you run Arc or Arc Dark,

362
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,160
and want to be able to run a few Qt applications.

363
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,440
I'll give you an example, Quasal Core.

364
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,400
There's nothing like Quasal and Quasal Core on Gnome.

365
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,280
I'm using it right here, right now.

366
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,640
And are you on a GTK desktop, otherwise?

367
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,480
Yeah.

368
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,320
Exactly what you're doing.

369
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,820
Yeah, at the end of the day,

370
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,120
even if you've replaced everything with a GTK app,

371
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,680
eventually you're gonna want good IRC,

372
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,160
and when you do, you're gonna wind up at Quasal.

373
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,000
Exactly.

374
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,440
Hmm, this looks really good, thank you, beard.

375
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,280
That is a good one.

376
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,800
He's never so helpful.

377
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,240
You know, that beard, he has got the Google food down,

378
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,560
that is for sure.

379
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,640
Maybe he uses something else,

380
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,920
he's just not telling us about it.

381
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,840
Maybe he's using DuckDuckGo.

382
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,000
While the peeps are using Google.

383
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,680
Yeah, right, that guy.

384
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,640
He's clever.

385
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,640
So Debian is making a big change,

386
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,480
and it feels like a passing of an era.

387
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,800
They're shutting down their public FTP servers.

388
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,760
Goodbye.

389
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,600
I don't buy any of this.

390
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
I think this is really a shame,

391
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,200
and oh, I know FTP's old, hmm.

392
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,960
If you're one of the few people, LWN writes,

393
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,440
that's still using FTP to access Debian repositories,

394
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,240
well, the time has come to move on.

395
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,760
They're gonna shut it down in November.

396
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,440
It's driven by the following considerations.

397
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,240
FTP servers have no support for caching or acceleration.

398
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,080
All right, fair enough.

399
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,880
Okay, okay, you got me there, okay.

400
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,440
Most software implementations have stagnated

401
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,120
and are awkward to use and configure.

402
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,920
I find that to be weak.

403
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,200
Stagnate, yeah, they've stagnated because FTP's finished,

404
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,880
and awkward to use, that's totally an opinion.

405
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,400
That's absolutely an opinion.

406
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,480
Okay, the next reason.

407
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,160
Usage of FTP servers is pretty low,

408
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,200
and our own installer has not offered FTP

409
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,000
as a way to access the mirrors for over 10 years.

410
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,800
Whoa, okay, all right, got me there.

411
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,840
The protocol is inefficient

412
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,000
and requires adding awkward kludges to firewalls

413
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,540
and load balancing daemons.

414
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,340
That feels like an argument from 10 years ago

415
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,320
when it was hard, is this FTP or is it FTP passive?

416
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,560
I gotta configure my, like that's a problem

417
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,880
that all firewall administrators literally figured out

418
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,720
15 years ago.

419
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,800
But maybe that knowledge is gone, right,

420
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,660
like these guys didn't do that?

421
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,680
No, it's built in now, it's baked in now.

422
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,680
I find all of this, to me, to my personal preference,

423
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,160
I really find FTP to still be one of the fastest ways

424
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,220
to pull down files.

425
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,960
So you use it day to day?

426
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,840
I can't think of the last time I used it.

427
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,080
SFTP sometimes, but regular old FTP is tough.

428
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,160
I don't use it daily, I don't use it,

429
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,900
the shit is fast and great,

430
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,280
and if I'm just pulling down stuff that's GPL code anyways,

431
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,480
it's not like I care about privacy,

432
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,760
it's all open source code,

433
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,600
it's not like I'm moving around in the Nuke codes

434
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,440
or something.

435
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,680
And here's the other thing that's gonna be,

436
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,760
you wanna talk about awkward,

437
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,520
they used awkward twice in this reasoning,

438
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,520
here's some awkward, they're gonna remap ftp.debian.org

439
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,080
to go to the HTTP mirrors, that's awkward.

440
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,920
Yeah, that is a little awkward.

441
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,480
You go to ftp.debian.org and you end up on an HTTP site,

442
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,680
that is a definition of awkward, my friends.

443
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,740
That is awkward in kludge.

444
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,840
I don't know why this hurts me.

445
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,680
This cuts me deep.

446
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,360
I'm a little surprised, honestly.

447
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,200
I know, I can tell.

448
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,600
I guess like, I feel like it's just, it's not.

449
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,020
It doesn't matter at the end of the day,

450
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,840
but it feels like the passing of a, it feels like.

451
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,680
I agree with you there, I do.

452
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,560
Part of what it is, is it feels like we're shitting

453
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,120
on a perfectly good technology.

454
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,200
I'm not claiming that we should all be updating

455
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,320
our websites or pushing our applications

456
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,060
or moving around databases with FTP.

457
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,160
But if you're downloading something like a package

458
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,400
or a source file or an ISO that is GPL'd,

459
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,200
there is literally no security consideration here.

460
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,520
You're not logging in with an authenticated account.

461
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,360
You're just pulling down open source material.

462
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,760
It happens to be one of the fastest, most efficient means

463
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,960
to file transfer protocol.

464
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,860
Well, you say that, but it's not like,

465
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,700
like they said, like there's no.

466
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,760
Hypertext, that's what ACTP stands for.

467
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,120
It's for hypertext, Wes, not file transfer.

468
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,160
But since then, we've invented CDNs,

469
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,120
all kinds of methods to make this sort of thing

470
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,560
much more efficient for the provider.

471
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,840
Especially if you're a beleaguered Debian admin

472
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,920
where like, all right, this is another daemon to configure.

473
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,480
There's not very many users.

474
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,360
No one serious really uses it or has to use it.

475
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,200
I don't know, Wes.

476
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,020
To me, it feels like.

477
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,860
I don't even know if I have like, I mean,

478
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,040
do I have FTP here?

479
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,780
It feels like you kids today with your system Ds

480
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,760
and your containers and your Kubernetes

481
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,200
and your microservices all wanna shut down

482
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,640
good old simple FTP.

483
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,960
I'm not trying to say we should all go

484
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,360
to the Church of Telnet here.

485
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,960
I'm not trying to advocate that we should all be sending

486
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,680
our usernames and passwords over clear text

487
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,600
across the internet.

488
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,560
I am simply saying that when you have a simple, clean,

489
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,320
efficient file transfer protocol

490
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,640
and you need to transfer files, it kinda makes sense.

491
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,320
Like, it kinda works.

492
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,120
Especially for the Debian project, right?

493
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,040
It's not like we're talking about Solus here.

494
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,880
We're not talking about elementary OS.

495
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,240
We're talking about Debian, okay?

496
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,400
But it's fine, Wes.

497
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,280
It's fine.

498
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,720
Mookie, what do you think?

499
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,360
FTP is old and works and that's all that matters.

500
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,520
Okay, all right.

501
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,360
Thank you.

502
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,820
It's like we're gonna talk about Thunderbird

503
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,660
here in a little bit.

504
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,360
And what everybody always says is,

505
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,720
Chris, you're an asshole.

506
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,080
Thunderbird is finished.

507
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,980
We don't need to be working on it anymore.

508
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,460
Nobody's doing anything with email.

509
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,360
It's fine.

510
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,380
And everybody's like totally cool with Thunderbird

511
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,600
being this thing that isn't revolutionary

512
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,640
every couple of years.

513
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,880
But FTP, well, God forbid.

514
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,920
Well, there's a big difference though

515
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,080
because that's open source client-side software.

516
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,360
It doesn't require anyone to maintain a server

517
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,120
or perform security patching.

518
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
That's true, that's true.

519
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,720
I would not, as an admin,

520
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,000
I would not run FTP if I didn't have to.

521
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,200
I agree.

522
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,720
I actually agree on my own service.

523
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,640
Right, right, yeah.

524
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,480
I use SFTP.

525
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,800
And like you said, you wouldn't expect Solace

526
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,920
to have an FTP archive for you, would you?

527
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,360
I just use SCP, to be honest with you.

528
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,200
Yeah, right, totally.

529
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,960
But that Debian project, Wes.

530
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,760
I do, it is the end of an era.

531
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,880
You are right about that.

532
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,480
Yeah, yeah.

533
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,280
You know what the reality is too, when it comes to-

534
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,240
You should go download something before they shut it off.

535
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,120
Yeah, just to celebrate.

536
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,440
What really probably killed off FTP though

537
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,880
is corporate firewalls.

538
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Because they all support,

539
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,360
corporate firewalls don't care what you're doing

540
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,080
when you're going to 80 or 443.

541
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,120
Have that at Haas, enjoy yourself.

542
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,400
Oh, you wanna establish an SSH connection or FTP?

543
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,960
Oh no, you might be hacking.

544
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,600
So, I think it's really corporate firewalls.

545
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,440
I don't think so.

546
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,040
I mean, we use SFTP.

547
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,280
I mean, I know it's SSH,

548
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,440
but we use SFTP in the banking industry like crazy.

549
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,560
That is the protocol.

550
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,760
And when you start getting into stuff

551
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,760
like just the file transfers between financial institutions,

552
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,080
they still use SFTP because it works.

553
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,440
You're just dropping a file into a directory

554
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,240
for someone else to go read later.

555
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,080
And there's nothing really better than SFTP is fine,

556
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,000
but you really can't beat that,

557
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,240
especially when you're doing shared search

558
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,080
and stuff like that.

559
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,120
Wes is over there doing a passive FTP session right now.

560
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,520
I just got downloaded the read me from that archive.

561
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,320
You went to ftp.devian.org?

562
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,160
I sure did.

563
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,320
Good man, good man.

564
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,160
Pull that down while you can.

565
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,440
Now I have a piece of history.

566
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,440
You have until November 1st, 2017,

567
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,640
and then they'll shut it down and redirect you to HTTP.

568
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,480
What we have to do, see, we can't do it

569
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,840
because it's the observer effect.

570
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,360
Now that I'm gonna say this, it won't happen.

571
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,760
But in the future, you could all play a game at home

572
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,880
when we do something, when we cover a story like this.

573
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,460
So when Chris talks about FTP or something like that,

574
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,120
you could play a game at home

575
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,960
to see how many people go to the comments

576
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,520
to tell me about R-Sync or SCP.

577
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,400
Even though we kinda gave them quick mention on the show,

578
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,520
you'll be amazed at how many people listening

579
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,000
think Chris has never heard of these things.

580
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,640
Somehow, dude manages to do a Linux show for 11 years

581
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,840
but doesn't know about R-Sync or SCP.

582
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,520
And so it's such a fun game to play at home.

583
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,660
You can tell I love it.

584
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,560
You should play it too.

585
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,320
But now that I've mentioned it, it's the observer effect.

586
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,540
It will have 90% less.

587
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,820
I bet you we'll still get a couple.

588
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,480
Maybe two that are ironic and three that are serious.

589
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,520
Be careful if you drink while you play this game.

590
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,300
You have to set a reasonably low limit

591
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,740
or you will hurt yourself.

592
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,940
Yeah, that's like when you were playing drinking games

593
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,780
during the election.

594
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,120
You will get wrecked. Yes, exactly.

595
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,500
Let's talk about another way to get improved.

596
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,880
Let's talk about Linux Academy.

597
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,180
Now this is why I'm a big fan of Linux Academy.

598
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,480
It's on my terms.

599
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,860
I did schooling when I was in IT.

600
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,380
I mostly through community college like programs.

601
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,180
Do you have any, does your work give you a budget?

602
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,100
We do have a training budget.

603
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,940
That's nice.

604
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,980
Do you go to like classes?

605
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,740
We've had some, I've had some people come in

606
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,580
and then I think, you don't even get to three

607
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,660
like your individual managers but you can request training.

608
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,740
Yeah, this is, man, if I work somewhere,

609
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,440
this JB, you know, they don't have the perks.

610
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,140
But if I work somewhere that gave me a training budget.

611
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,740
Some baddies.

612
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,660
Yeah, exactly.

613
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,980
Just a little.

614
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,540
This would be such a great way to use it

615
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,920
because then it's on my terms.

616
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,740
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

617
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,420
It's a platform to learn about Linux.

618
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,700
You go there, you support the show,

619
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,620
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

620
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,020
and you can sign up for a free seven day trial.

621
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,740
Now you'll learn about the core of Linux

622
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,540
and everything you really need to know to manage

623
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,900
and set up and really be a great Linux administrator

624
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,940
or DevOps or sysadmin.

625
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,120
That's nice and that's fancy

626
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,780
and I pretty much use it exclusively now

627
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,420
for a couple of years just to do that kind of stuff.

628
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,260
I have dabbled a little bit in like Ruby and Python.

629
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,180
They have some great courseware.

630
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,020
Nice.

631
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,180
A little bit.

632
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,980
But I gotta tell you, if I was in the industry today

633
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,340
and I felt like OpenStack was over my head

634
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,260
or I keep hearing all these big data concepts tossed around

635
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,420
or containers fell out of my reach

636
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,380
or I didn't understand what made AWS so competitive

637
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,820
or why Microsoft is killing it with Azure,

638
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,880
even if I didn't have to work in that field just yet,

639
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,940
I would totally dive into these courses.

640
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,280
So we use Chef where I work.

641
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,540
We had some Chef training, intermediate level.

642
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,340
Linux Academy was an awesome resource

643
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,940
for everyone who hadn't done Chef before

644
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,380
to get up to speed on the basics.

645
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,620
Everything that Linux Academy covered

646
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,100
was exactly what the best practices in the industry.

647
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,500
They just, it's up to date.

648
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,660
It's focused on the real tools that people use.

649
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,780
Yeah, I think it makes a difference

650
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,740
because they have, not only do they have

651
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,660
a lot of passion for this stuff,

652
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,500
but they've really doubled down

653
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,220
on bringing in-house staff in

654
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,960
that's constantly making this stuff relevant,

655
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,800
keeping on top of this.

656
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,640
They're going to the events.

657
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,980
They're staying abreast in the industry.

658
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,140
And they think the other big differentiator for them

659
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,060
is if you get stuck,

660
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,620
they have real human mentorship available,

661
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,640
like actual instructors that know the courseware,

662
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,340
know the stuff in and out, and they can help you.

663
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,580
You can master Linux at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

664
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,900
And a big thank you to Linux Academy

665
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,880
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

666
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,720
Last week on the program,

667
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,900
we tried to make sense of the big Docker announcement

668
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,660
because DockerCon was going on.

669
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,620
And I thought we did a pretty good job

670
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,300
of cutting through the BS.

671
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,140
We weren't the only ones.

672
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,300
It was a lot of BS to cut through though.

673
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,020
I felt a little validated that you found

674
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,540
a few other conference discussions online

675
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,940
where people were incensed by the amount of BS

676
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,900
coming out of Docker.

677
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,960
And now we have a little bit better understanding

678
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,060
of what the hell's going on and why you should care.

679
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,260
So it appears, kinda sorta,

680
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,580
that Docker became Moby last week.

681
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,620
It was like a rebranding thing

682
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,860
that has just sparked a shit ton of confusion.

683
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,620
So at DockerCon in Austin,

684
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,860
apparently I leave Austin and then they

685
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,740
decide to have DockerCon. They just both talk.

686
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,420
On last Tuesday, which was the day

687
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,100
we were recording the show,

688
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,240
Docker announced the Moby project.

689
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,020
It's a new name for the open source software

690
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,900
from which the commercial versions of Docker are derived.

691
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,500
And it serves as like a starting point

692
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,680
to create customized container software

693
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,420
for specific purpose-built infrastructures.

694
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,420
It's essentially what we said last week.

695
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,100
Turns out though, we were probably

696
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,260
one of the only news outlets that got it right.

697
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,420
Because, and it's not other folks' fault,

698
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,080
they got really confusing.

699
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,660
There was a series of issues

700
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,620
that totally muddled the message.

701
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,940
First of all, you had Docker's extremely thick,

702
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,460
complicated PR announcement.

703
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,180
Then there were some vague mentions

704
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:10,100
on some poll requests that sort of

705
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,580
led people to misunderstand.

706
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,600
So there was some terminology

707
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,340
in one of the recent poll requests

708
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,300
where it just said, Project Moby

709
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,300
is the new upstream for the Docker project.

710
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,140
And people are like, what, what, what?

711
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,300
What is this, what?

712
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,500
And then people went to go check what was going on

713
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,340
and GitHub connectivity problems

714
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,100
totally messed up this announcement.

715
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,900
The message had disappeared.

716
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,740
Docker had to get in the hold of GitHub's support staff

717
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,300
to try to get this stuff restored

718
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,060
while people are trying to figure it out.

719
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,020
Then the problem was compounded

720
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,760
during another poll request

721
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
where the CTO of Docker said,

722
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,780
Docker is transitioning all of its open-source

723
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,420
collaborations to the Moby project going forward,

724
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,700
which people didn't have any idea what that meant.

725
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,100
Yeah, so then they go to the PR announcement

726
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,380
and they can't make sense of it at all.

727
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,660
There really was, like last week,

728
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:06,540
there was no straight-laced, easy-to-read description at all.

729
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,500
Yeah, yeah, so we have this other announcement

730
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,820
that kind of actually makes more sense.

731
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,860
They should have led with Linux kit.

732
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,060
Now, it sounds like something for iOS,

733
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,980
but Linux kit includes the tooling

734
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,660
to allow building custom Linux subsystems

735
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,020
that only include exactly the components

736
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,300
that the runtime requires.

737
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,780
So you got an application,

738
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,220
maybe it's a web app with a database,

739
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,960
it will only include the components necessary

740
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,520
to boot that container up and get those applications started.

741
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,820
All system services are containers that can be replaced.

742
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,380
Everything that is not required

743
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,620
can just be removed from the system.

744
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,600
All components can be substituted

745
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,060
with ones that match specific needs,

746
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,340
so different runtimes, different containers,

747
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,340
different DNS servers.

748
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,160
It's a kit very much in the Docker philosophy

749
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,240
of batteries are included, but all are swappable,

750
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,220
and Docker announced it an open-sourced Linux kit,

751
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,980
which is up on GitHub.

752
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,100
And if my understanding of it is correctly,

753
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,380
it's like an Alpine Linux shim

754
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,740
that goes on top of Mac OS or Windows

755
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,520
that gives them the basic elements they need

756
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,920
in the user land space to fire up a container.

757
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,940
It's not a Ubuntu Linux, it's not a Red Hat Linux,

758
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,780
it's Alpine Linux,

759
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,140
which is like this hyper-focused container Linux.

760
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,220
Am I tracking this so far?

761
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:23,220
Well, yeah, it's a way to build these very minimal,

762
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,180
customized Linux.

763
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,820
I mean, you could call it a distribution, but it's not.

764
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,140
It's really this image that's meant

765
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,580
to just have the bare bones necessary

766
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,580
so that on top of it, you could just run a bunch of containers.

767
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,060
It kind of seems like a lower-level

768
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,380
container OS kind of thing.

769
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,660
Right, that can run on top of a host OS,

770
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,780
but it's not a VM because you're not virtualizing

771
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,520
the disk controller and the ethernet

772
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,280
and all of the hardware stack.

773
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,280
The kernel of the host OS is facilitating

774
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,540
the actual processes.

775
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,280
So the processes are using the same type

776
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,580
of containerization they use on Linux.

777
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,220
So you could be running on a Mac,

778
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,800
but it's not necessarily virtualization,

779
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,680
which is very confusing to me,

780
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,340
but it's all made possible with this Linux kit,

781
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,720
which Docker is billing as a lean, portable Linux subsystem

782
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
for all OSes, basically.

783
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,900
And how far does this go?

784
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,580
Could a group like the FreeBSD Project

785
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,700
come and make it their new Linux subsystem?

786
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,540
That's a good question.

787
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,820
Is this now basically, is Linux going to become

788
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,900
like the bash for Mac OS 10,

789
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,920
like getting a bash on Windows?

790
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,640
Is this, I know OS 10 already has bash,

791
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,920
but is this going to be a way for people

792
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,900
to just have a Linux environment running on their Mac now?

793
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,180
Where does the line stop?

794
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,180
When do we stop taking from Linux

795
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,820
and let Linux just have something for God's sakes?

796
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,020
Now the user land and containers,

797
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,260
and the only thing we have left is the curve.

798
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,380
Well, they don't seem to want to take our desktops.

799
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,260
They don't want those.

800
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,380
Damn it, Wes.

801
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,860
That just made me feel worse.

802
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,420
I did note here at the bottom,

803
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,860
they talked about how Linux kit provides a space

804
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,820
to incubate security projects that show promise

805
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,100
for improving Linux security.

806
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,460
So like WireGuard, I don't know what Landlock is,

807
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,260
but Mirage and O-kernel.

808
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,500
Damn, you know, I also got the, I got a smell,

809
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,700
I got a Microsoft smell coming off this.

810
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,060
There's nothing in this.

811
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,460
I mean, they do reference,

812
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,180
they do reference Windows 10 customers

813
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,860
will get access to Linux containers

814
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,680
and we will be working together

815
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,220
on how to integrate Linux kit with Hyper-V isolation.

816
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,900
So there is some reference to Microsoft technologies,

817
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,860
but it doesn't, when I read this,

818
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,820
yeah, that's Redmond.

819
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,120
Yeah, I know what Redmond smells like.

820
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,100
That smells like Redmond.

821
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,740
And I don't quite know what it is.

822
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,200
I think when I was on Twitter,

823
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,460
I noticed some Microsoft employees that I follow

824
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,700
were promoting this.

825
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,980
And I think some of this was done in partnership

826
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,540
with Microsoft to get this on Windows

827
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,580
and the work they did to make this work for Windows

828
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,820
is basically opened up for other BSD, Mac OS,

829
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,540
other platforms as well.

830
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,800
So Linux kit, they say, is a container native.

831
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,500
They just can't help themselves.

832
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,960
They still got to talk like a bunch of monsters in here.

833
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,140
I don't know what it is, but it just gets me crazy.

834
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,020
Yeah, Linux kit.

835
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,520
They do, I mean, they talk about security

836
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,300
like a thousand times in that little article.

837
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:16,300
So I hope it means that they are focusing on that

838
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,700
and helping to advance,

839
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,600
like they mentioned the kernel self-protection project

840
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,440
and other things.

841
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,300
And I think we need that, right?

842
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,340
Like, especially with all the hype around containers,

843
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,140
whatever that means on Linux and all that thing.

844
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,420
I think a big name like Docker taking it seriously

845
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,820
or at least looking like it is a good sign.

846
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,660
I wanted to talk more about it,

847
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,220
but I sense that there is just a,

848
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,340
I don't give a shit aspect in the audience.

849
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,420
Like people, as soon as you start talking about Docker

850
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,220
and containers, I feel like there's a portion of the audience

851
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,180
that just doesn't care.

852
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,100
And I don't know how to grapple with the fact

853
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,000
that at the same time,

854
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,240
this could be one of the biggest things that's happening

855
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,540
in the Linux space in the last few years.

856
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,860
Like I don't know how to connect those dots.

857
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,020
It's also one of the ways where it's like,

858
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,620
it is kind of far away from this show, right?

859
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,980
Like especially the desktop focus,

860
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,760
but this is like one of the main things

861
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,460
that's selling Linux to the enterprise

862
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,340
or the modern enterprise.

863
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,020
Yeah, we talked about it on Monday's Code to Radio,

864
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,780
but basically Michael Dominic is refocusing in a large way

865
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,700
his entire company on delivering Docker solutions,

866
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,080
not even like container solutions, but Docker solutions.

867
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,220
And I just, yeah, I feel like I have a hard time

868
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,860
figuring out a way to make it connect with the audience

869
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,760
because there's only so many reasons they should care.

870
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,140
At the same time, like if you follow Linux,

871
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,060
this is a huge thing that's happening.

872
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,460
And at the same time, there's this undertone,

873
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,940
what's really happening here,

874
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,060
and it's something we've talked about before,

875
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,780
is Linux is the runtime.

876
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,780
They're delivering software in containers,

877
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,100
but what is the software actually running on top of?

878
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,740
It's Linux.

879
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,280
Well, now with this Linux kit move,

880
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,500
it's like a hybrid Linux

881
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,460
because it's no longer the Linux kernel.

882
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,420
It's Linux user land and some aspects of the kernel

883
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,780
and a host kernel, something's happening here.

884
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,020
And in some ways, it doesn't all feel good,

885
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,580
but it definitely feels like inevitable progress.

886
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,380
Yes, I mean, I think that that is one of the thing

887
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,300
about the Docker stuff,

888
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,020
their strong cooperation with Windows,

889
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,660
it really is focused on cloud, cloud workflows,

890
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,480
whatever that means, right?

891
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,320
But that's the marketing,

892
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,220
that's what they're trying to talk about.

893
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,700
And the Linux part is really an implementation detail.

894
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,900
Jeez, that's so true.

895
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,620
Which is both like good and useful and maybe, right?

896
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,500
And it does advance Linux,

897
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,540
it brings people to Linux Foundation

898
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,780
to see a lot of benefit from that, I think,

899
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:32,080
but it's also like, do we lose sight of the core thing?

900
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,160
Does that make it easier for Linux to then be replaced

901
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,740
as a component of that ecosystem?

902
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,580
I don't know.

903
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,600
Yeah, something that we've been kicking around here,

904
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,620
like if you can take Docker containers

905
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,580
and you can run them on macOS,

906
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,380
if you have Bash on Windows,

907
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,300
you go to a tech conference like DockerCon,

908
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,400
they're all MacBooks.

909
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,020
You just go search for hashtag DockerCon on Twitter

910
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,620
and then sort by images, it's all MacBooks.

911
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,240
It's on, DrupalCon's going on this week.

912
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,260
I'm doing the same exercise.

913
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,260
I'm working on a project

914
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,140
and so I'm following all these conferences

915
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,220
and no one I notice when we go to these things.

916
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,380
And I gotta tell you, it's all MacBooks.

917
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,940
So you got MacBooks with Bash terminals

918
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,220
and Docker containers.

919
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,740
You got Windows machines with Ubuntu in a terminal

920
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,820
and the ability to run Docker containers.

921
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,940
It feels like Linux has been recently gaining a lot of ground

922
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,180
for the DevOps web developer type role.

923
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,380
I mean, look at Project Sputnik

924
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,440
and the year over year 100% growth

925
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,260
they're having there selling to developers.

926
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,100
But why the hell does a developer need to use Linux

927
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,420
if the Bash shell and containers

928
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,380
are on their favorite OS that they're used to

929
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,440
and they've been using for years?

930
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,180
Where's the motivation to switch?

931
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,100
Where's the platform advantage?

932
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,180
Am I overthinking?

933
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,420
It seems like just as we're finally gaining a foothold

934
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,060
with a certain type of user,

935
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,500
all of the things that are driving users to that

936
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,440
are beginning to vanish in front of us.

937
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,700
Yes, it means that the server world

938
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,660
of Linux and the desktop world

939
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,020
are even farther apart than they have been in the past.

940
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,340
There's no reason to use Linux on the desktop really anymore

941
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,340
unless you want to.

942
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,540
Which is fine.

943
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,580
Right, and maybe it's good.

944
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,540
But I was sure enjoying the competitive advantage we had

945
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,340
where there was like, you couldn't reproduce production

946
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,860
unless you also ran it on your laptop or desktop.

947
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,620
And now with containers, now with Bash on Linux

948
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,800
or Bash on Windows.

949
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,040
And I feel like there's at least a small subset of users

950
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,880
that have misconceptions

951
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,440
or those people that tried it 10 years ago

952
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,280
when it was really rough or other things

953
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,920
that before they had that incentive to give it a try

954
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,120
and maybe they would find something they like

955
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,960
but now they can just be like,

956
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,800
well, then I'll just keep using my MacBook.

957
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,640
Why did I change?

958
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,040
Right.

959
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,880
Or Windows.

960
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,700
Or Windows, yeah.

961
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,880
I mean, Windows has become a much better option.

962
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,400
Right, I got the Linux subsystem.

963
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,720
I can run Bash if I need to.

964
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,200
I can SSH into a VPS when that doesn't work.

965
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,640
Oh, oh, and now with, oh, I just, all right.

966
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,160
Well, it's not gonna be Thunderbird

967
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,100
that's moving them over to Linux

968
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,800
but let's talk about Thunderbird here for a second

969
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,700
because it's a topic that's come up on this show before

970
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,680
that I was met with a surprising amount of interest.

971
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,400
And there is a proposal to start a new implementation

972
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,660
of Thunderbird based on web technologies.

973
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,800
Now, does that mean Electron?

974
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,300
What do you mean when you say web technologies?

975
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,140
What does that mean?

976
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:17,960
Yeah, I don't know.

977
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,040
Because isn't Thunderbird already based,

978
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,040
isn't Thunderbird based on web technologies

979
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,760
by the very fact that it's like a Zool app

980
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,320
that runs on top of the Gecko engine?

981
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,160
I mean, isn't that kind of?

982
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,080
But those are old web technologies.

983
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,920
We don't talk about those anymore.

984
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,640
Oh, okay, I see, I see, okay.

985
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,520
New web technologies like Electron and WebKit, right?

986
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,560
No, so here's the point they make

987
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,120
and how are you gonna ignore this.

988
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,180
Their base is going away.

989
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:42,760
What Thunderbird is based on is going away.

990
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,080
This is reality.

991
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,040
Gecko is gonna change dramatically in the future.

992
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,860
It already is.

993
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,940
They're dropping features that Firefox does not need anymore

994
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,840
but Thunderbird clearly relies on.

995
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,680
Plus, the Thunderbird code base is now 20 years old.

996
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,740
JavaScript and HTML5 have evolved dramatically

997
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,320
since they created this application.

998
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,300
They think a rewrite in JavaScript makes sense now.

999
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,380
He, in this article, points out that,

1000
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,240
look, this is a Zool app

1001
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:17,600
and Firefox is discontinuing Zool extensions.

1002
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,320
They're killing off small projects this way.

1003
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,840
I mean, it's just the reality.

1004
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,320
It's a cut that goes to the base of Firefox

1005
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,080
and they did that because these extensions

1006
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,440
are sort of holding back internal architecture improvements

1007
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,280
that they've been trying to make.

1008
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,220
And also, the Thunderbird base is based entirely

1009
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,280
on the XPCOM, the back end communication module,

1010
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,020
XPCOM, whatever it's called,

1011
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,440
and Zool for the user interface.

1012
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,040
So if you take away XPCOM and you take away Zool,

1013
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,240
which Firefox is doing,

1014
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,340
you've effectively taken away Thunderbird

1015
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,840
and they're gonna have to rewrite anyways.

1016
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,680
This is a huge problem.

1017
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,280
This is a huge problem

1018
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,320
for a project that's already struggling

1019
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,960
and understaffed or funded or whatever.

1020
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,920
Yeah, that was basically put on the shelf

1021
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,520
in maintenance mode.

1022
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,580
And this week too, I don't know if it's related,

1023
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:06,020
but there's been some folks posting mock-ups

1024
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,560
of what a new Thunderbird could look like.

1025
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,380
It's not bad.

1026
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,840
It looks like a web browser a bit to me.

1027
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,880
It does, yeah, very much so.

1028
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,440
That's a crew, oh no, that's, yeah.

1029
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,000
Yeah, that would be their Thunderbird,

1030
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,720
this would be their Thunderbird redesign right here.

1031
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,840
It's kind of nice.

1032
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,040
Could be worse.

1033
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,640
I've moved on in myself,

1034
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,700
so I have a hard time connecting with this story.

1035
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,120
I found Thunderbird to be really, really my go-to

1036
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,160
for many, many, many, many, many years.

1037
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,040
Especially with Enigma, like it was so hard

1038
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,720
to get away from Thunderbird and Enigma combo,

1039
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
which is a great, easy, simple way

1040
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,640
to do GPG encryption in your email client.

1041
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,760
Just gorgeous, beautiful, love it.

1042
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,360
It's the greatest encryption I hear from the people.

1043
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,200
It's the best.

1044
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,020
I can't, I can't, I can't.

1045
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,860
I'm not a very good Trump impressionist.

1046
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,000
I can't work on my Trump impression.

1047
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,360
For a new Linux user.

1048
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,180
I've moved on.

1049
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,020
What would you recommend?

1050
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,160
If they want, they don't want web-based email,

1051
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,000
they want a client.

1052
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,160
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

1053
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,240
For me, it's N1,

1054
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,240
but I can't recommend the latest to everybody

1055
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,440
because there's other issues people have with it.

1056
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,060
Kmail is still just as quirky as Kmail ever was.

1057
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,880
And, I mean, I just don't, I don't know.

1058
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,200
Geary was my go-to, but Geary kind of faded,

1059
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,040
and now it's merged with elementary OS.

1060
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,400
Claws gets mentioned a lot.

1061
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,240
Claws does, yeah.

1062
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,060
Yep, Claws does.

1063
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:17,900
I don't have a ton of Claws experience.

1064
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,740
True.

1065
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,560
What about you?

1066
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,400
What's your answer to this?

1067
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,240
I don't, you know,

1068
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,760
I just end up using web mail most of the time.

1069
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,080
What if somebody comes to you and says,

1070
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,920
Wes, I'm moving to Linux, and I just.

1071
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,960
I would probably say, try Nihilus.

1072
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,800
Really?

1073
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,640
Yeah.

1074
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,560
I mean, it depends on the person.

1075
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,520
If they were, you know, more computer savvy, maybe not.

1076
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,000
Maybe I would, I would maybe say Kmail or Claws

1077
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,480
or something like that, but.

1078
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,640
Yeah, and Elias has the advantage

1079
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,580
of being very easy to use,

1080
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,760
and it has features that people expect,

1081
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,440
like the ability to snooze emails

1082
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,960
and follow up and.

1083
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
And the interface is pretty nice and responsive

1084
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,800
and rich in a way that people coming

1085
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,440
from other platforms might like.

1086
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,400
I don't know how I feel about having to say that,

1087
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,760
but that's probably what I'd say.

1088
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,320
So maybe it is time for a Thunderbird reboot.

1089
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,160
Yeah.

1090
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,980
At least in our world.

1091
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,800
Because I mean, I do think it's important that we have,

1092
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,600
I mean, I don't know how important we can debate that,

1093
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,640
but it would be nice to have a good,

1094
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,560
open source, free software email client

1095
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,920
that people can come to and use,

1096
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,440
and that is well supported and modern and good.

1097
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,880
A lot of love for Claws in the chat room right now.

1098
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,720
Look at this.

1099
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,560
Yeah.

1100
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,440
I know it's producer Michael's favorite too, I think.

1101
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,920
So a lot of love for Claws.

1102
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,320
Look at the beard trolling us with his wood dust bail.

1103
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,480
Oh my gosh.

1104
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,640
Can't even with you right now.

1105
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,480
Get out of the air.

1106
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,040
I do use Evolution sometimes.

1107
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,200
I have on occasion.

1108
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,040
The nice thing about Ev,

1109
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,420
the nice thing about that is the,

1110
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,800
it's still sort of baked in a gnome in some sense.

1111
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,560
Like when you use some of the online account stuff.

1112
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,520
One of the things that the internet

1113
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,720
was saying a lot about Thunderbird

1114
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,120
is it needs to have native exchange support,

1115
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,960
which I guess is still a big thing.

1116
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1117
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,620
That probably would add a lot.

1118
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,460
You can do it with a plugin, but.

1119
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,980
Yeah.

1120
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,820
I got a problem.

1121
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,920
I gotta, we gotta move on.

1122
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,200
We got a problem.

1123
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,760
We gotta do a little,

1124
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,440
you know, we should do the Linux Unplugged

1125
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,280
consultancy agency for some.

1126
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,440
Oh, I like that idea.

1127
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,920
Yeah, for some of these open source projects,

1128
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,560
because the folks behind the Unity 8 port

1129
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,160
could use a little consultancy.

1130
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,840
I'm not gonna give another stupid shit

1131
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,900
going on in their community right now,

1132
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,360
but there's a lot of dumb drama.

1133
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,520
And it all centers around one core problem.

1134
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,040
And I'm gonna tell you what it is here in just a minute.

1135
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,280
But so, for those of you that don't know,

1136
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,000
there is some rash, brave souls out there

1137
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,760
that have been fighting the good fight

1138
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,880
when it comes to Ubuntu on the phone for years now.

1139
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,720
Yeah.

1140
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,000
Making it available to devices

1141
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,800
that Canonical didn't officially support.

1142
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,320
And that group decided, let's take on the Unity 8 desktop.

1143
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,640
We will continue it, which, brilliant.

1144
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,000
You know, in an open source, when a door closes,

1145
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,840
a window opens.

1146
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,760
I think that's the saying.

1147
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,480
When you take a leak and flush it, right, that's the saying?

1148
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,600
That is a brilliant philosophy,

1149
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,240
one that brought us the Nautilus file manager today.

1150
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,720
The great files file manager

1151
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,680
that has been of much controversy in GNOME

1152
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,240
actually was called Nautilus,

1153
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,920
and it was created by a company called Easel

1154
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,000
that was trying to do this crazy thing.

1155
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,560
Get ready for this, Wes.

1156
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,160
Server-side storage and integration with the file manager.

1157
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,120
That's crazy.

1158
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,400
Yeah, they didn't call it cloud back then.

1159
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,720
That's, you have to say cloud.

1160
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,560
Right.

1161
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,400
We didn't learn that yet, though.

1162
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,800
No, it was just an online storage service.

1163
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,640
Yeah.

1164
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,480
See, that sounds expensive.

1165
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,400
And they were gonna integrate it

1166
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,040
into their Easel file manager called Nautilus,

1167
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,520
and that's how they're gonna make money.

1168
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,440
And they were gonna make great tools

1169
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,520
to manage Linux desktop along with this file manager.

1170
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,000
Eventually, they had this customized desktop,

1171
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,200
the Easel desktop, that was like this respin of GNOME

1172
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,800
that was like the best implementation of GNOME you could find.

1173
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,360
You could even get it with a special software manager.

1174
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,920
It was the bee's knees, as the kids say.

1175
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,080
And nobody was interested in storing their files online.

1176
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,160
That is crazy, people said.

1177
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,080
I'm not just gonna hand my personal information

1178
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
over to some company and have them store it on their server.

1179
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,200
Then would I have to download it if I wanted to get it?

1180
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,040
How's that gonna work?

1181
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
That's ridiculous.

1182
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,200
So, Easel eventually went out of business.

1183
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,280
But they had, by the day's standards,

1184
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,760
created one of the best file managers for Linux.

1185
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,120
Turns out it was open source,

1186
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,720
and so the community picked it up.

1187
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,240
And from the ashes of Easel,

1188
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,820
we have files that we still use on the GNOME desktop today.

1189
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,720
It's also used on Unity.

1190
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,280
It's been around.

1191
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,840
So, in that same spirit,

1192
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,960
the folks that wanted to continue on Unity 8,

1193
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,440
yeah, the commercial company behind it

1194
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,760
may be turning to a different direction,

1195
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,200
but we can continue Unity 8.

1196
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,800
Seems bold, seems brave,

1197
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,000
seems like in the spirit of open source.

1198
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,840
They made a problem, though.

1199
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,100
They made a real 2017 mistake.

1200
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,440
And it is hollowing the project out from the inside.

1201
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,320
It's gonna burn out the developers.

1202
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,000
It's souring the community.

1203
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,140
It's poisoning the well.

1204
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,880
And it's gonna stunt the project

1205
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,720
before they've even shipped some code.

1206
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,080
And the problem is,

1207
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,720
they've focused their community around Reddit.

1208
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,640
They thought they could start an initiative like this

1209
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,720
with a subreddit.

1210
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,720
So, you can go to reddit.com slash r slash unit Y-U-N-I-T

1211
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,440
and you can watch the train wreck for yourself.

1212
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,800
They can't even get a logo or a catchphrase together

1213
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,540
without all of the alpha geeks living on Reddit,

1214
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,660
shitting all over each other,

1215
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,640
and creating a massive invite.

1216
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,920
It is one of the best displays

1217
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,800
of how humans cannot work together out there right now.

1218
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,720
This is a rough threat.

1219
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,640
And I gotta tell you,

1220
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,340
if you have an open source project

1221
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,540
that you actually wanna build a community around,

1222
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,300
you have to build some of the infrastructure yourself.

1223
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,740
Go do it on Mastodon.

1224
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,960
Go do it on a forum.

1225
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,200
Do it on a mailing list.

1226
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,800
Do it in an IRC room.

1227
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,440
But for God's sakes, do not do it on Reddit.

1228
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,640
It will poison your project from the beginning.

1229
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,360
And unfortunately, we're watching this

1230
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:47,120
de-evolution of humanity right here for public display.

1231
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,960
It's really unfortunate.

1232
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,360
And I think it's a lesson

1233
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,120
that so many open source projects could take away.

1234
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,400
Do not base the center spoke of your community

1235
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,260
around Reddit.

1236
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,980
Because it's a place where people wanna go

1237
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,940
that have an opinion,

1238
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,820
and they think that they've gotta be

1239
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,740
the smartest guy in the room.

1240
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,060
And they've figured it out,

1241
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,020
and they're gonna tell you about it.

1242
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,900
And it is, it's shocking to watch this.

1243
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,600
And you have people saying,

1244
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,660
don't bother replying here.

1245
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,660
I won't be reading this.

1246
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,220
You have all kinds of typical

1247
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,120
man-child type behavior that happens.

1248
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,580
I don't see, I just,

1249
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,540
I don't see how this is gonna go anywhere.

1250
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,780
This is so unfortunate,

1251
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,100
because it's a project that's gonna have

1252
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,320
minimal community interest to begin with.

1253
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,420
Because let's be honest,

1254
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,820
it was never a massively popular project.

1255
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,620
We probably wouldn't be here today if it was,

1256
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,160
in this position we're in now.

1257
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,460
And to focus it around this,

1258
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,340
it's just such a shame.

1259
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,940
Because I would love to have seen

1260
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,860
what a modern QT desktop could look like.

1261
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,540
Maybe they'll still pull it out.

1262
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,040
But it's a little lesson we can all take away.

1263
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,660
Because the core problem,

1264
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,380
the thing that always made me leave hope,

1265
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,900
a little bit of hope for Ubuntu Mobile was,

1266
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,620
we've gotta do something about Android.

1267
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,540
I don't care if everybody does something about Android,

1268
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,380
but I would love to use it.

1269
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,040
I would like an option.

1270
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,480
I still would like an option.

1271
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,900
That has not changed.

1272
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,380
And I would love, even if it's a community.

1273
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,700
We're just a little more sad in the press.

1274
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,300
So a community project

1275
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,900
that gives us a legitimate,

1276
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,640
legitimate type image we could download one day,

1277
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,380
and flash to your Nexus slash Pixel devices,

1278
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,660
is absolutely something that interests me.

1279
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:23,540
So I hope that these early growing pains get worked out.

1280
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,420
Because my hopes are that one day,

1281
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,980
they can save us from the Android.

1282
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,540
Save us all from the Androids taking over our humanity.

1283
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,380
Exactly.

1284
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,200
Spying on us.

1285
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,180
Dun, dun, dun.

1286
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,380
All right, you know, let's talk about mobile.

1287
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,860
Let's talk about something you can do right now.

1288
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,040
That might all be out in the future,

1289
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,100
but there's something, there's action,

1290
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,900
there's something you can do.

1291
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,740
You can switch to Ting.

1292
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,300
This is such a great story, I'll tell you in just a second.

1293
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,860
But start by going to linux.ting.com.

1294
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,420
You go there, this is the landing page to support the show,

1295
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,900
and get $25 off a device.

1296
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,740
Or if you bring a compatible device, check their BYOD page.

1297
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,660
They'll give you $25 in service credit.

1298
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,940
You might have a device that already works,

1299
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,660
because it turns out cell phones have been around

1300
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,980
for a little while, and they've got a CDMA network,

1301
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,500
and a GSM network, so there's probably something

1302
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,480
in there that'll work for you.

1303
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,580
You get $25 in service credit then.

1304
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,460
Now Ting is pay for what you use mobile.

1305
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,820
Minutes, messages, and megabytes.

1306
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,640
You just pay for that.

1307
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,700
It's $6 for the line.

1308
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,180
Now here's the story.

1309
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,040
So Noah's out here visiting the studio.

1310
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,320
But he has a client that's like, no, I know you're busy,

1311
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,860
but I just really need to get my phone situation figured out.

1312
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,900
Can you please tell me which phone plan I should get?

1313
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,540
And she links him all the different options.

1314
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,780
And Noah's like, just look at all these different options.

1315
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,540
It's like 40 bucks a month for this line,

1316
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,940
$65 a month for this line, all these different things.

1317
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,300
And he goes, just go to linux.ting.com.

1318
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,300
And she goes to linux.ting.com, and she says,

1319
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,700
well, this can't be right.

1320
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:39,620
She writes him back.

1321
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:43,620
She's like, how can, I just did the savings calculator,

1322
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,900
and for my phone it's gonna be $12 a month.

1323
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,100
How can this be right?

1324
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,940
This can't be right.

1325
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,020
And Noah's like, yes, that is exactly right.

1326
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:50,900
It's that simple.

1327
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,060
She said, it's so simple, this can't be right.

1328
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,100
It can't be right.

1329
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,260
That's the funny thing.

1330
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,580
It's the rest of the industry that's wrong.

1331
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,780
That's the funny thing.

1332
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,060
They've all got it wrong,

1333
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,540
and we've just all gone along with it.

1334
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:09,060
We've just all, well, it's like the boiling pot, isn't it?

1335
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:13,300
We've just, we grew up in an environment, I started,

1336
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,300
I started with my folks having these huge phones,

1337
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,260
and I had a pager, and I thought that was cool.

1338
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,540
And I would have taken any plan they gave me.

1339
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,500
And then when these phones started coming out,

1340
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,660
for all, VoiceStream, I got on VoiceStream,

1341
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,540
I got all these different plans, tried all these different,

1342
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,020
anything they would give me, I would take it.

1343
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,100
Anything I would take,

1344
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,540
because it was such an incredible new technology.

1345
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,140
But now, here we are in 2017, looking back at it,

1346
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,180
we got snow jobbed.

1347
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,740
Why am I paying for minutes and messages and megabytes

1348
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,900
I never even use?

1349
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,260
That's crazy.

1350
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,660
Why am I getting in these agreements?

1351
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,380
Don't call it a contract, it's an agreement.

1352
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,980
This is insanity.

1353
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,700
You can make a difference by voting with your wallet.

1354
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,020
Linux.ting.com, you go there, you sign up, oh!

1355
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,220
No contract, nor the termination fee,

1356
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:57,020
and if you're a business with like 11 to 20 employees,

1357
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:01,260
there is like a 99.999999% chance you're gonna save money.

1358
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,100
It's so awesome.

1359
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,220
And they got a great blog too, you can check it out.

1360
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,820
Just start by going to linux.ting.com,

1361
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,540
and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring

1362
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,220
the Linux Unplugged program, linux.ting.

1363
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,300
So here's something that's relevant.

1364
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,340
What do you have here?

1365
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,020
Hello, it says, hello, what is this?

1366
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,140
Take a look.

1367
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,580
That is my pixel replacement, the first one died.

1368
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,420
Oh, really?

1369
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,940
Yeah, so I've been forced to use.

1370
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,900
I noticed.

1371
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,180
I know, I was like, why is he on his Nexus 5 again?

1372
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,940
So you got the new phone today?

1373
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,660
I got it yesterday, I didn't have time last night

1374
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,100
to set it up, I know, right?

1375
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,300
So I was like, wow.

1376
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,620
So it comes in a, here, do I have a, yeah.

1377
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,940
So it comes in a hello box, look at that.

1378
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,620
Pretty cute.

1379
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:40,980
Yeah, and it's still all wrapped up too with, whoo!

1380
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,820
No!

1381
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,980
No!

1382
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,340
Not the best packaging, I think, is what we learned.

1383
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,740
I should have planned that as a bit.

1384
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,740
I just dropped it.

1385
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,140
I just dropped it on the wood floor in the studio here.

1386
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,060
All right, all right, here we go.

1387
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,740
Wes, it's got this big crack across it.

1388
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,260
I'm kidding, it's totally fine.

1389
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,380
This is a nice-feeling phone.

1390
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,500
It is a nice-feeling phone.

1391
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,340
And this is really nice.

1392
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,300
So can you, did you just take the SIM out of your old one,

1393
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,620
put it in that, and now you can move it into this,

1394
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,580
or did you have to do something fancier?

1395
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,500
No, I had a prepaid plan on my old phone,

1396
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,940
so I just activated a month of that,

1397
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,100
and then I'll go back to.

1398
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,300
So you'll just be able to, yeah,

1399
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,300
that's so you don't even have to worry about it.

1400
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,300
That is nice, smooth move, Wes.

1401
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,420
Well, does it not come with a charger?

1402
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,060
No, so you keep your original charger and everything,

1403
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,460
and then you just send back the phone.

1404
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,300
Oh, I see.

1405
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,140
A little package.

1406
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,620
So that's a specific replacement box.

1407
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,220
So I went through Google, talked to them,

1408
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,220
they got me a replacement and everything, so that's good.

1409
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,460
I'm happy about it, and I'm very happy

1410
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,060
to have a regular 27, you know, like a modern phone again.

1411
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,540
Does it feel like a huge downgrade?

1412
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,380
Oh, yes, oh, terribly, yes.

1413
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,740
I didn't, I mean, I knew I liked the phone,

1414
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,380
like it's been a really nice phone,

1415
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,780
but I really missed it when it was gone.

1416
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,140
Now you've, now you realize like, wow,

1417
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,060
I probably use this Nexus 5 longer than I needed to.

1418
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,540
Yes, exactly.

1419
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,540
The camera alone.

1420
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,380
Oh, I know.

1421
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,780
Wow, all right, well, so there's this huge announcement

1422
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,420
by the Linux Foundation.

1423
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,060
I wonder if anybody in the Mumble Room even saw it

1424
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,180
or could even explain it to me.

1425
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:00,100
Did anybody in the Mumble Room see this announcement

1426
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,500
by the Linux Foundation this week

1427
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,340
of the launch of Edge X Foundry?

1428
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,180
Anybody see this?

1429
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,020
Sorry, I haven't.

1430
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,460
Yeah.

1431
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,300
I missed it as well.

1432
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,740
I find this to be interesting,

1433
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,860
and I think it's because we all have IOT fatigue.

1434
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,140
That's a great phrase.

1435
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,500
I'm gonna run with that, IOT fatigue.

1436
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,540
I've heard now, I think it's one of the phrases

1437
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,260
that's taken off is the Internet of Shit,

1438
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,300
which feels a little clunky.

1439
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,860
Like, I wish we could do something with the T,

1440
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,620
you know, to keep the IOT acronym,

1441
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:33,060
like the Internet of Terrible might be better

1442
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,860
because you're keeping the T, but anyways.

1443
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,700
Otherwise it's iOS, that's overloaded enough.

1444
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,540
It's true.

1445
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,620
I don't know why this isn't,

1446
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,300
so I suspect, actually, I do know why.

1447
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,900
I suspect this is why this is not making

1448
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,940
a big splash in our crowd,

1449
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,980
is because we all glaze over when we hear this.

1450
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,660
And what this is, this Edge X Foundry,

1451
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:54,180
is actually something that is going to,

1452
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,980
it's going to shift IOT into a direction

1453
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,540
that I think everyone listening to this show would like.

1454
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,020
It basically takes it out of the cloud

1455
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,700
and it puts it in your LAN.

1456
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,700
Yeah, it's actually-

1457
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,540
I'm scared, Chris.

1458
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,380
Are you scared?

1459
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,740
Buckle up, Wes.

1460
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,220
See, I don't like IOT,

1461
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,380
and if it's on other people's computers in the cloud,

1462
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,340
then I feel safer.

1463
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:19,620
So I have a little insider story here.

1464
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,740
I'll give you a little background before we start.

1465
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:25,300
While we were at Dell in Austin, Texas recently,

1466
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,540
there was a lab they took us into.

1467
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,380
And actually, just walking by, you'd have no idea.

1468
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:33,380
It's called the CTO Lab.

1469
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,980
It's called like the CTO Lab or something like that.

1470
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,460
You'd have no idea what it is.

1471
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,020
And in this lab,

1472
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:43,020
they're using these purpose-built hardware devices.

1473
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,700
They're like, they're x86 rigs,

1474
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,800
but they look like tiny arm systems

1475
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,420
where they have like the thin cooling on the sides

1476
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,460
and they have antennas coming off them

1477
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,780
and they're ruggedized x86 computers.

1478
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:59,020
And the ones I was looking at was running Ubuntu core.

1479
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,300
So they're testing a lot of this stuff with Ubuntu.

1480
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,620
And the whole idea is IoT is fun.

1481
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,640
And this is literally, I don't know if I'm,

1482
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,380
this is literally what Dell told me.

1483
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,580
IoT for the home looks fun,

1484
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,380
but let's be honest, they say, Amazon's won that.

1485
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:18,700
Like Amazon with the Echo has just,

1486
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,620
dude, you're not gonna,

1487
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,820
like Dell's not gonna come out

1488
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,740
with an Echo competitor, right?

1489
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,420
I'm like, yeah, you're right.

1490
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,380
How refreshing is it that finally some company

1491
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,220
just go acknowledges, yeah, there's a market leader there

1492
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,020
and we're probably not gonna unseat them.

1493
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,500
But you know what Dell said is like,

1494
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,500
there's really nothing like this for the enterprise.

1495
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,340
And the enterprise-

1496
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,160
And that's their game.

1497
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,000
Yeah, and it has, and the enterprise

1498
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,500
has a much bigger problem to solve.

1499
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,340
And if you think about it, like in manufacturing,

1500
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,420
either be like food manufacturing

1501
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,140
or even car manufacturing,

1502
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,700
there's so much equipment that's kicking off

1503
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,540
on schedules and stuff where you could be getting data,

1504
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,260
like motion sensors, pressure sensors,

1505
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,540
temperature sensors, like IoT, if you'll call it that,

1506
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,340
it's basically remote sensor devices

1507
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,940
and network connected devices, has real practical advantages

1508
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,820
in the enterprise and nobody's trying to solve that problem.

1509
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,080
So what EdgeX Foundry is,

1510
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,420
it's a Linux Foundation initiative

1511
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,700
where Dell is seeding the initial technology

1512
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,180
to try to make a standard framework,

1513
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,980
all these different vendors, IoT devices can plug in

1514
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,820
and you can do local LAN management.

1515
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,020
And so I think, whoa, hello there.

1516
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,860
Hi there. Hello.

1517
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,180
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

1518
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,020
I guess it's time for us to start the show, Wes.

1519
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,420
Yeah, we're late.

1520
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,700
Yeah. Whoops.

1521
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,860
And it's actually probably solving the problem

1522
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,020
that so many of us have with IoT,

1523
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,540
where it's like, you have to give everything

1524
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,820
over to the cloud, they have all of your data,

1525
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:40,620
and there's other problems that brings in for businesses.

1526
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:43,320
And I think EdgeX Foundry is gonna solve all of it.

1527
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,740
So I got just a couple of minutes and we got some footage.

1528
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,160
I had to sit on it for a little while,

1529
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,040
but now I can share it with you guys

1530
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,700
to give you a little insight on what this is

1531
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,380
and why the Linux Foundation is calling this

1532
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,380
their largest announcement ever.

1533
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:59,180
We're here in the CTO lab, talking IoT.

1534
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,020
How about that?

1535
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,780
And this is Jim, and Jim's gonna give us a walk around

1536
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,260
to some of the tours, give us a couple of demos.

1537
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,380
I'm looking around, I'm just seeing all kinds

1538
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,660
of really great devices, like that guy right there.

1539
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,780
There's some hardware over here.

1540
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,220
So where should we start?

1541
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,180
We'll start in our mini lab, let's do it.

1542
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,940
During our visit to Dell, there was one thing

1543
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,500
we couldn't share with you just yet.

1544
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,780
So we're gonna save this for three weeks.

1545
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,860
Future Chris and though, save this for three weeks.

1546
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,140
Dell and the Linux Foundation are launching EdgeX Foundry,

1547
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,500
an initiative that aims to build a common framework

1548
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,500
to make IoT usable in the enterprise.

1549
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,860
The problem we have in IoT is that all these different

1550
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,780
types of devices that speak all these different protocols,

1551
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:43,460
everything from BLE to Modbus and BACnet,

1552
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,660
which are ancient protocols, at least by most

1553
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,220
of our standards, they all speak a different format,

1554
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,780
they speak a different language.

1555
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,980
How do you bring those all into a single platform?

1556
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:52,820
Yeah, exactly.

1557
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,060
And then make it available to people

1558
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,620
like you and I to actually use.

1559
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:59,100
That's what our platform called EdgeX Foundry is about.

1560
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,780
It's a software platform that allows us to bring

1561
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:05,660
all that data in, normalize it to a single format,

1562
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,100
and then make it available to your cloud or enterprise,

1563
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,460
as well as be able to control things

1564
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,380
at what we call the edge, that's the name, EdgeX Foundry.

1565
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,100
If you can't control things at the edge,

1566
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,340
it's too much data and it's too slow for reaction.

1567
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:20,420
And we'll talk and show that here in a second.

1568
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,540
So you're right, right here we're seeing

1569
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,580
just a little visual, a little graphic

1570
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,700
of the data coming off of, in this case,

1571
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,060
the gyroscope and this Bosch sensor.

1572
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,740
So you're seeing the ups and downs of that.

1573
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,300
In fact, we always have fun with those sensors

1574
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,220
when we take them out of the road,

1575
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,100
we throw them around the room,

1576
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,580
you get big spikes up and down.

1577
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,220
We also get to see who drops them

1578
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,420
and watch them go to the floor.

1579
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,380
So that's the collection of data,

1580
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,340
or example of a collection of data

1581
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,940
by our EdgeX Foundry software into our gateway.

1582
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,060
That's one job of the system,

1583
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,260
collect data and make it available.

1584
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:55,220
Second job is to be able to offer the ability

1585
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,940
to do what we call actuation,

1586
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,980
which means respond to data you see coming in

1587
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,220
and take some action.

1588
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,260
But it also solves a big problem

1589
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,060
I never really thought much about.

1590
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,940
More importantly though, it's not just about

1591
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,300
gathering data and being able to actuate back down.

1592
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,060
It's being able to do those in combination,

1593
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,860
meaning you have to have what we call edge analytics,

1594
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:18,940
or some smarts, some intelligence on that gateway

1595
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,980
that's watching all the data come in

1596
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,380
and being able to translate that back down actions

1597
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,300
down to your systems.

1598
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:30,300
Say for example, if we moved that punch machine here,

1599
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,220
I'm gonna lower that arm down.

1600
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,020
Get the little mouse on there, right?

1601
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:39,180
Beep, beep, beep.

1602
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,700
Sending off the signal there.

1603
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,140
Actually, I did it the wrong way.

1604
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:43,500
I moved it up and it was already up,

1605
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,460
so let me move it in the other direction here.

1606
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,180
So there we go.

1607
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:52,060
You'll notice the sound came out of that pat line.

1608
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,340
That's a rules engine that's running

1609
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,900
as part of our edge x foundry

1610
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,140
that's in this case looking for movement on that arm.

1611
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,180
There's no way that's triggered as long as you want.

1612
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,940
But you can see it happening for lots of different devices

1613
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,500
for lots of different business.

1614
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,660
Exactly, you maybe have a proximity sensor

1615
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,500
that shuts the machine off

1616
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,420
if your arm gets too close to it.

1617
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,540
That's the intelligence you want at the edge.

1618
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,460
They can be that quick?

1619
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:15,700
They can be that quick.

1620
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,140
As you see here, we're not exactly real time

1621
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,780
yet, but pretty darn close, right?

1622
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,820
Enough where you can send off a sensor like that

1623
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,060
in seconds.

1624
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,140
You don't want to operate your automobile airbag

1625
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,900
with our edge x foundry yet,

1626
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,140
but we're getting close to doing that.

1627
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,340
That's what local intelligence is all about.

1628
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,900
That's why you need a gateway.

1629
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,940
You can't afford to let that data go all the way to the cloud

1630
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,060
all the way back down.

1631
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:39,900
It's too late.

1632
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,740
Somebody's lost an arm.

1633
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,140
It's not just about security and privacy.

1634
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,180
It's also about timing.

1635
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:48,180
I hadn't even thought of that too late.

1636
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,740
Somebody's already lost an arm.

1637
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,460
Yeah, that's morbid, but true way to talk about that.

1638
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,660
And you know, it wasn't clear in the video there,

1639
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,460
but the system, the, the, the beep that the alarm beep

1640
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,380
was coming from a separate device.

1641
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,660
So there's like, you know, and they're talking

1642
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,420
what's great about, what's great about Dell is they have

1643
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,700
the resources to say, so they've gone into these businesses

1644
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,860
that already have like all of these systems

1645
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,660
and these, these things can connect this edge x foundry.

1646
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,960
It's based on an existing open source project

1647
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,100
that has been sort of merged with some other stuff.

1648
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,780
And Dell then went out and did some industry research

1649
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,500
and they found people that have like

1650
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,020
serial connected controllers.

1651
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,460
And they made that work with edge x foundry and yeah.

1652
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:29,700
So it's not, it's, it basically works with all of them.

1653
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:34,000
And then it gives, it gives people a framework to target

1654
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,300
if they want to make their device specifically compatible.

1655
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,140
And you can run this edge x foundry stuff on Linux.

1656
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:40,260
You can run it on windows.

1657
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:43,500
Dell has a combination of Ubuntu hardware and software

1658
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,020
that you can run it on top of.

1659
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,760
But there's 22 other companies involved.

1660
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,780
Right.

1661
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:49,740
Today Canonical announced they're one of them.

1662
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:52,560
And so that's a huge ass start.

1663
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,960
It's being head up by the Linux foundation.

1664
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,140
It's got a huge investment and initial seeding by Dell.

1665
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:59,720
It's got Canonical on board.

1666
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,120
And then you've got 22 other companies that are,

1667
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,560
that are device manufacturers and software makers

1668
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,980
that are going to work with this thing.

1669
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,520
And it might come, we might get to the point

1670
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,220
where the enterprise, because they got work to get done

1671
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,760
and money to be made,

1672
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,580
we'll get this IOT situation figured out.

1673
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,420
I know, isn't that funny?

1674
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:16,240
But it makes sense.

1675
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,080
Like, yeah, they have the money

1676
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,380
and they have like strict requirements about security,

1677
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:21,620
what things they are allowed to install or use.

1678
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,120
So that can drive a lot of things.

1679
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,280
Well, and when you think about it from a standpoint of,

1680
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,540
we want that machine to stop crushing

1681
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,680
before the guy's arm is totally lost.

1682
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,860
You do want something a little more fast,

1683
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,980
maybe gigabit speed, maybe not, you know,

1684
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,740
going up to the Amazon cloud

1685
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,900
and waiting for the API to respond.

1686
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,540
And you know, like that might just add

1687
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,220
a little bit of unnecessary delay.

1688
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,460
AWS is having an outage.

1689
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:46,460
No one use the paper crusher today.

1690
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,220
Now this is not going to work, is it?

1691
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,620
All right, before we move on from this,

1692
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,020
does anybody in the Mumble Room have any thoughts,

1693
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,180
questions, comments about any of this?

1694
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,240
You guys have been quiet for a bit.

1695
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,140
So I want to give anybody a chance in there.

1696
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,020
Charlie Brown, AU, are you new here?

1697
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:02,300
Are you welcome, welcome to the Mumble Room, sir.

1698
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,500
Hi, hi, Charlie Brown, AU.

1699
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,340
How you going, man?

1700
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,180
Not bad, thanks.

1701
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,020
Hey, so what do you think?

1702
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,540
Is this all crap, is it hype?

1703
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,780
Do you think there actually could be

1704
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,260
some actual value here?

1705
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:19,100
I don't know enough about it to have a view on it.

1706
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,540
I was hoping the segment would give you

1707
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,180
a little bit of an idea.

1708
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,460
I think, you know, for me, Charlie,

1709
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:27,820
it seems like, okay, oh, I get it in the business sense.

1710
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:30,980
I get where you would want Wi-Fi temperature sensors,

1711
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,820
and I get where you would want Bluetooth controllers,

1712
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,740
and I get where you'd want serial controlled stuff.

1713
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,820
I get Internet of Things in the business

1714
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:40,220
in a way that I don't necessarily get it in the home.

1715
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:43,140
Do you have any device, do you follow me?

1716
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,700
Do you have any devices in your home,

1717
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:45,940
or are you kind of on the same page?

1718
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:47,940
Like, I just don't get IoT for the home.

1719
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,900
I've got a Steam Link, which is like an armed device,

1720
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,900
and I want to actually get a Raspberry Pi

1721
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,800
to turn into a PFSense box,

1722
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,860
and I've actually got a Adreno Nano as well,

1723
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:04,100
which I'm making a track IR out of.

1724
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:08,180
Charlie, that's all sounding kind of thingy on the Internet.

1725
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:10,580
That's getting close, Charlie, that's getting close.

1726
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:14,540
Yeah, I've actually, what I have found it really useful for

1727
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,700
is controlling my space heaters.

1728
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,140
I know that sounds weird.

1729
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,120
No, I get it, I get it.

1730
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:19,960
But with the-

1731
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,620
When you're cold, you don't want to move.

1732
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,460
Well-

1733
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:25,300
I'd like some warm me up, cancel.

1734
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:28,060
Actually, you say that, but it's funny.

1735
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:31,180
So today when I left the house, it was like 38 degrees

1736
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,580
when I left the house, when I left the RV.

1737
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,020
A brisk spring morning.

1738
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:37,480
And so we have an electric space heater

1739
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:41,340
in their oil-enclosed systems, so they're like coils,

1740
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,620
and we have one in the front of the rig,

1741
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:43,900
and we have one in the back of the rig.

1742
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,460
And they're both controllable by the echo.

1743
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:48,580
And when we left today, it was cold,

1744
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,740
I didn't even think to turn them off.

1745
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,540
And they're just sitting there sucking power.

1746
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,500
But when I got here to the office, I was like,

1747
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,740
you know what, it's like 58 degrees out now,

1748
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:57,260
I don't need those running.

1749
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,980
And it's one command, I could say it right now,

1750
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,980
and it just turns off the oil heaters in the RV.

1751
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,900
That's really nice.

1752
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,820
And it is super nice, actually,

1753
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:09,820
because I then compare them with Belkin WeMo plugs

1754
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,420
that will give me the real-time amperage

1755
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,140
and voltage and watts draw.

1756
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,640
Now you've got data.

1757
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:19,100
And I can actually say, well, today's Earth Day,

1758
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:22,420
so after I've drawn X amount of watts,

1759
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,240
just turn the thing off.

1760
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,140
Just turn it off.

1761
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,500
And I can also say, I'm gonna get home

1762
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,420
around four o'clock today, so turn the thing on

1763
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,080
around three so it starts warming the place up,

1764
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,180
but don't leave it running all day.

1765
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,700
And that's actually kind of nice,

1766
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,300
because some places I go, I actually pay,

1767
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,300
they meter me, and they actually pay for how much I use.

1768
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,460
Some places I go, it's free.

1769
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,300
So it's nice when I'm at somewhere

1770
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,980
that'll actually watch the meter and charge me.

1771
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,620
It's nice to be able to have that kind of control.

1772
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,940
See, that makes this more exciting.

1773
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,780
Imagine then, maybe if you're like Charlie

1774
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,500
or other people, you already have some of these devices,

1775
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,860
but then if you have your own devices

1776
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,260
or you would be able to interface with that,

1777
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,660
see the data in another way,

1778
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,020
maybe have it interface with a non-proprietary format

1779
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:02,900
or just store it locally, that would be cool.

1780
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,300
One of the things they were showing me there,

1781
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:07,780
so I just gave you guys the real raw stuff,

1782
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:09,200
just those real specific, like this is what

1783
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,820
Edge X Foundry does, but they then took me over

1784
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:14,820
to their R&D side of the room,

1785
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:17,060
and they have three major sections.

1786
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,420
Well, actually, they have four major sections.

1787
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,500
So you walk into this room, this lab,

1788
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,160
and it's like a lobby.

1789
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,540
There's a couple of couches, some chairs.

1790
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,540
Then to your left, they have a mini lab.

1791
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,620
And this mini lab is where the bulk of that video

1792
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,020
just took place, which I have, by the way,

1793
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:30,860
if you're listening on the audio,

1794
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,340
I have the video embedded in the show notes.

1795
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:33,340
It's only four minutes long.

1796
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,540
It's kind of worth checking out.

1797
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:36,920
That's the mini lab.

1798
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,700
Then they have a glass window.

1799
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:42,120
On the other side of the mini lab is like a fucking lab.

1800
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:42,960
It's like a lab, dude.

1801
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,580
This ain't no mini lab.

1802
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,560
Yeah, it's like false floor, false ceiling, racks,

1803
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:51,380
like full on, can't go in there, no media allowed,

1804
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:53,500
don't even think about it, dude, lab.

1805
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,740
Then next to that, they have this R&D room.

1806
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:00,180
It's like this long room, one window at the end of it,

1807
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:03,220
brown walls, and all along the walls

1808
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:05,340
is gear just mounted like crazy,

1809
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,580
like tons of different IoT stuff,

1810
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:09,740
everything from custom in-house built stuff

1811
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:11,860
that looks super crazy and esoteric

1812
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:14,900
to Amazon Echoes, like the whole range.

1813
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,320
And what they were trying to demonstrate to us was

1814
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,740
you can go completely local, you hold all the data,

1815
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,940
you hold all the analytics,

1816
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,980
you do all the controlling of all of these devices

1817
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,580
on the LAN, or if you really want to,

1818
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,100
you can go as far as,

1819
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,340
you can abstract all of this away to an Echo.

1820
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:32,100
And so they showed me where they have,

1821
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,880
where they can start a motor actuator

1822
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,700
and start something going down a conveyor belt

1823
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,040
and an arm using a dot.

1824
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,180
Wow, that's pretty slick.

1825
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:43,500
And they're like, the real thing we see here,

1826
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,900
and this is how far out they're going,

1827
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,980
like the first thing, the first stage we see this is

1828
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:50,820
the worker is doing something and their hands are full,

1829
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:54,540
and so they're using voice commands to trigger something.

1830
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:55,860
And I guess people are experimenting

1831
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,220
in the workplace with dots.

1832
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,200
But they're like, but what we kind of have

1833
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,740
a long-term thing here is it's AR.

1834
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:06,420
Like what we are working towards is creating sensors

1835
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:10,300
that we can mount in things and on top of objects,

1836
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:13,940
and then all of these sensors will give data back

1837
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,420
to the EdgeX Foundry box,

1838
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,860
and that EdgeX Foundry box will supply data

1839
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:20,000
to an AR headset that, you know,

1840
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,940
you're looking at the engine

1841
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,300
and you're looking at real-time stats and schemes,

1842
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,780
schematics and temperatures and all that stuff,

1843
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:30,780
and all real-time data that the EdgeX box is processing,

1844
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:33,740
collating, and then feeding an AR headset.

1845
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,380
Totally way out in the future stuff,

1846
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:37,140
but like that's how far they see this going.

1847
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:40,100
Like right now, today, it's just about a framework

1848
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,380
to manage IoT in the enterprise.

1849
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:45,460
But in the far future, it could be the key part

1850
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:48,720
to feed a real-time data feed to an AR headset.

1851
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,780
Are we just making the sensory organs

1852
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,740
for our future AI overlords, Chris?

1853
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,860
We are the biological bootloader for sure, my friend.

1854
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:57,060
Yes, absolutely, and this is a key part of that.

1855
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:57,900
Right, yeah.

1856
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,260
So do your duty, help out.

1857
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,500
Make no mistake about it, Wes.

1858
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,180
But let's be honest, it's gonna be way better.

1859
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,180
It's gonna be great, yeah.

1860
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,100
I could see it too.

1861
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:09,120
Like I could see like you're working at Boeing

1862
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,780
or you're a doctor, like I could so see it.

1863
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,460
So it seems inevitable.

1864
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,100
It really does seem like you can.

1865
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,500
When you have technology like the HoloLens

1866
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:21,620
or even Google Glass, and then you have the data

1867
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:24,140
and the devices doing the analytics.

1868
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:28,620
And they didn't wanna come across to me as biased.

1869
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:31,460
They were very sure to make sure I understood

1870
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,180
that it could run on multiple operating systems

1871
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,700
and they have partnerships with Red Hat

1872
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,440
and SUSE and Microsoft.

1873
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:41,140
But it is clear to me that to them,

1874
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:44,060
they prefer running all of this stuff on Ubuntu Core.

1875
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:44,900
Interesting.

1876
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,420
Something about working with Canonical.

1877
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,060
I think Canonical's the right size for them.

1878
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:50,740
They're not too big, not too small.

1879
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,060
Dell can have some influence.

1880
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:53,100
Yes, totally.

1881
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:54,260
I don't know, it just seems like,

1882
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,500
it seemed like to them, like this was their-

1883
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,140
They have experience working with them.

1884
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:58,900
Yeah, it was fascinating to see.

1885
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:02,300
So while we were there, servers obviously, storage.

1886
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,440
It turns out, and I'm gonna try to find more information

1887
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,340
about this though, Dell's also working

1888
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:11,060
on a Debian-based network switch OS.

1889
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:12,380
Right, yes, I remember us talking about that.

1890
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,340
Yeah, so I gotta get more information on that.

1891
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:15,720
But there's just a huge range of stuff

1892
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,560
they're working on over there.

1893
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,100
And so this is one of it.

1894
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:22,820
But like they put in the Linux Foundation announcement,

1895
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,780
the foundation says, this is coming from Linux Foundation,

1896
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:28,940
that EdgeX Foundry is unifying the marketplace

1897
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:30,900
around a common open framework

1898
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:34,200
and building an ecosystem of companies offering

1899
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,940
interoperable plug and play components.

1900
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:38,640
I guess that's actually pretty possible.

1901
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,340
They say it's designed around any hardware

1902
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,940
or operating system with any combination

1903
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,180
of applications environments.

1904
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:47,060
And EdgeX can quickly and easily deliver interoperability

1905
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:49,700
between connected devices, applications, and services.

1906
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,620
Jeez, all right, it's just getting ridiculous.

1907
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:53,580
You know what's crazy too, is they make it worse

1908
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:54,860
because it's just a bunch of commas.

1909
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:59,860
So this sentence has one, two, three, four commas in it,

1910
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:03,060
just to explain all of these buzzwords, yeah.

1911
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,420
It's too much, but anyways.

1912
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,500
See that list there of the companies,

1913
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,340
that's more interesting.

1914
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:10,220
That is actually legit in here, and good on them.

1915
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:12,220
Lenaro's in there, that's interesting.

1916
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,460
Yeah, yeah, VMware.

1917
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:19,340
Yeah, VMware is pretty involved with the Linux Foundation.

1918
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:21,580
And of course, Canonical, which I think is the bigger part

1919
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,860
because that's what's gonna be powering the machines

1920
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:24,780
that are managing all of this.

1921
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:28,220
So that's the part that actually is maybe more takeaway.

1922
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:30,920
Anyways, something to follow, so it's the EdgeX Foundry.

1923
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,940
Not a ton of people in our space are talking about it,

1924
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:35,180
but I think it's because we don't realize it means

1925
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:38,700
bringing a lot of this internet of things to the LAN,

1926
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:39,540
controlling it there.

1927
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:40,380
And it's one of those like,

1928
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,300
Dell hasn't talked that much about it.

1929
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,580
Other people haven't talked that much about it.

1930
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:45,620
And it's one of those enterprise, business-to-business

1931
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,340
things that just happens behind closed doors.

1932
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:48,260
It is very much that.

1933
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:51,460
And I think that one of the bigger stories here

1934
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:55,700
that is sort of hard to relay is it's super intentional

1935
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,820
that Dell's not talking a lot about this.

1936
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:01,980
It is a big deal that this was a Linux Foundation

1937
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:04,260
announcement and not a Dell announcement.

1938
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:05,620
I can see that, yeah.

1939
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:08,060
I think Dell very much wants us to be an open source

1940
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:11,000
community project, and they are so willing to push

1941
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,940
that angle that they are, do you understand?

1942
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,420
It's a big deal for a company not to take

1943
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:17,260
the PR win for this.

1944
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:18,380
Yeah, totally.

1945
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:19,220
Because they could have come out,

1946
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,620
this could be the Dell EdgeX Foundry.

1947
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:21,440
Yes.

1948
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,700
To be very clear about how much development happened there.

1949
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,820
But they've worked since the beginning of this project

1950
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:28,740
to make it a Linux Foundation thing.

1951
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:30,200
Like you don't just get 22 companies.

1952
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,660
That took like a year of work.

1953
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:32,480
Yeah, totally.

1954
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,540
And a lot of agreements and other things

1955
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,860
that have to be signed, legal things to work out.

1956
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:37,620
That is a part of, that's a bigger story.

1957
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,740
I don't know how to quite tell it,

1958
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,740
but that's a very intentional thing they're doing.

1959
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:43,020
So this is like, we've talked a lot about

1960
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,460
maybe the downsides or the controversy

1961
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:46,660
of the Linux Foundation, but maybe this is

1962
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:48,020
an example of the other things they do

1963
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:52,940
that other types, not an industry organization, can't do.

1964
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:55,400
Yeah, and this was never, these types of tools

1965
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,480
and IoT is never gonna be a credible thing

1966
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,860
you can use in the enterprise that's actually manageable

1967
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:03,220
and secureable unless something like this came along.

1968
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,640
Yeah.

1969
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,700
And so if it was one-

1970
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,900
Let me get my app on my phone that connects

1971
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,380
to this private cloud and then, yeah, that's done.

1972
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,980
Imagine if this was Apple doing an extension of HomeKit.

1973
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:15,380
They would have, it would be so less relevant

1974
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:16,820
to how it's gonna impact the industry.

1975
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:18,920
Doing this as an open source Linux Foundation effort,

1976
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,920
I think, long-term, might actually make this legitimately

1977
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:25,380
a real, like the real products

1978
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:27,240
that we can use in the enterprise.

1979
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:28,500
Speaking of things that are legitimate and real

1980
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,640
and you can use right now, DigitalOcean.

1981
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,960
DigitalOcean.com, go there and sign up.

1982
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,540
And then once you sign up, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED,

1983
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:38,060
that's one word, DOUNPLUGGED to support the show

1984
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,440
and get a $10 credit.

1985
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,700
You wanna mess around with something,

1986
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,820
DigitalOcean's perfect.

1987
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:43,180
You wanna put something in production,

1988
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,100
DigitalOcean's perfect.

1989
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,220
You wanna rely on it, resell it even, DigitalOcean.

1990
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,060
It's the range.

1991
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,540
You know, that's what's incredible about it.

1992
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:51,520
So for three cents an hour, you can get a rig

1993
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,820
that's probably faster than any machine

1994
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:53,740
you've got on your land.

1995
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:55,140
I mean, if you wanna make Chris feel bad,

1996
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:56,940
you have a MacBook, you're never switching to Linux.

1997
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:00,460
Bam, DigitalOcean, get a VPS, 55 seconds.

1998
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:01,300
I know, right?

1999
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,260
It's great because, okay, so for $5 a month,

2000
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,380
like that's gonna run most your stuff

2001
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:08,120
that you wanna run headless on a Linux box.

2002
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,100
That's nice.

2003
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,060
For $5 a month, you get SSDs.

2004
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:12,600
You get 40 gigabit eConnection.

2005
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,660
They use Linux for the host,

2006
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:15,120
they use KVM for the virtualizer,

2007
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,520
that you get to use their awesome interface.

2008
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,140
You can use the one-click deployment

2009
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,760
of open source applications.

2010
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,340
You get to use the API.

2011
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,780
Like all of that stuff is there

2012
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:25,900
for like the $5 a month rig.

2013
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,500
And then you can step it up from there

2014
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,260
to machines that are just monsters

2015
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:33,000
with 200 plus gigs of RAM, tons of processor cores,

2016
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,660
crazy amounts of storage.

2017
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:37,020
But what's nice is what,

2018
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:38,180
and this is always what I've done,

2019
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,020
is I've either started at the $5 one

2020
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:42,300
or maybe if it's something I'm using a lot,

2021
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:44,300
like I'm running Mumble and Minecraft on there,

2022
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,800
I might do a nicer rig, maybe at most a $20 a month rig.

2023
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:48,980
I mean, sometimes I'll go crazy

2024
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,920
if I got a lot of stuff going on there.

2025
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,460
But I can, there's this whole range.

2026
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,260
And there's also baby steps.

2027
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,800
You can just take little itsy-bitsy beautiful baby steps.

2028
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,660
Beautiful babies.

2029
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:58,500
You just go over there

2030
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,880
and you attach block storage as you need it.

2031
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,140
Just, it's all SSD based.

2032
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:05,660
You can go up to 16 terabytes.

2033
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:06,880
It's so crazy.

2034
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,700
You want to mess around with ZFS or ButterFS?

2035
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:10,540
I mean, why not?

2036
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,460
Because they'll show up as block devices.

2037
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:13,340
I mean, have at it, Haas.

2038
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:15,380
You'll really get a chance to learn something.

2039
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:17,340
Also, they have monitoring available.

2040
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,420
That'll give you metrics.

2041
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:19,500
It'll give you alerts.

2042
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,380
It makes you look like a boss for a team of one or 100.

2043
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,620
And then speaking of teams,

2044
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:27,020
you can easily manage and transfer droplets.

2045
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:29,420
So if you got like, you got kernel Linux here.

2046
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,900
Kernel Linux in the house.

2047
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,620
This dude's over here spinning up droplets

2048
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:35,100
for customers that want Nextcloud instances.

2049
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,340
Sets them all up and transfers it to them.

2050
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:38,180
It's brilliant.

2051
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:40,060
You can also resell at these prices too.

2052
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:40,900
It's so nice.

2053
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,700
And when you bring in things like monitoring

2054
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:44,540
or when you have their CDN,

2055
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:46,420
you have private networking for backups

2056
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:47,780
that don't count against your transfer.

2057
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:50,060
There's a lot of opportunities for developers,

2058
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:51,700
for sysadmins, for enthusiasts,

2059
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:52,860
for people that just want to learn.

2060
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,660
Go to digitalocean.com.

2061
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:57,860
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGED, one word, sign up.

2062
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:58,700
And check it out.

2063
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:00,340
And check it out at digitalocean.com.

2064
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:01,660
Big thank you to DigitalOcean

2065
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:04,140
for sponsoring this here Unplugged program.

2066
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:07,500
Boop-a-boop, boop-a-boop, boop-a-boop, boop-a-boop.

2067
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,920
So this is a hell of a story here.

2068
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,260
And I commend them for getting a release out.

2069
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:13,380
This is not gonna be a mocking thing.

2070
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:15,500
I say this is actually potentially a good thing.

2071
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,380
A little competition actually is a very good thing.

2072
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,500
Duvon?

2073
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:20,340
Devuon?

2074
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:21,180
Devuon?

2075
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:22,000
Devuon.

2076
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,840
Oh yeah, that's right.

2077
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,680
Devuon.

2078
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:24,500
Devuon.

2079
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,340
There we go.

2080
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,180
Devuon.

2081
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:29,500
Devuon GNU slash Linux has been released, version 1.0.

2082
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,940
Jesse, hmm, I've never heard that before,

2083
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:35,100
I bet Debian's totally gonna assume for trademark,

2084
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:35,940
was just announced.

2085
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,260
The release candidate is actually out.

2086
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:40,180
The Devuon project, as I'm sure you recall,

2087
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:43,800
is Debian without the D,

2088
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,260
without the system D init system.

2089
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:48,700
And instead they're using, I don't know,

2090
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:52,900
probably Hope, Bubblegum, and Magic, maybe Ponies?

2091
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,360
What's that, init, init system, what's that?

2092
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

2093
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:59,380
And so I actually, at first I was gonna laugh this off,

2094
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:01,820
and I thought, this is no big deal.

2095
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:04,340
Who cares what Devuon is doing?

2096
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:07,060
And then I started thinking about it a little bit,

2097
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,940
and why the hell not do it?

2098
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:13,940
If you want a sort of a Debian of a different era,

2099
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:18,480
and more importantly than that though,

2100
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,820
what a great potential base for a bunch of respins.

2101
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:26,820
Maybe Devuon, Devuon itself won't be massively popular,

2102
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:29,500
but I could actually, for some weird reason,

2103
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:32,700
see like a remix respin derivative

2104
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,220
that uses Devuon as its base,

2105
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:37,020
building a really competitive Linux distro.

2106
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,540
Yeah, I think, I mean, I could see that too,

2107
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:41,220
especially, I feel like Debian's,

2108
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:43,460
I mean, a lot of the strengths of that family

2109
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,580
is the huge, you know, the huge app repos,

2110
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,280
that they put a lot of efforts into like, you know,

2111
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,060
the Etsy defaults alternatives,

2112
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:51,260
all that kind of stuff, right?

2113
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,380
There's like, you can, there's a lot of configurability

2114
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:54,680
and options built right in.

2115
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,740
So I can see, I don't know about the desktop space,

2116
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:59,100
but on the server side, container side, other things,

2117
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,860
I can totally see, maybe you want like an old style,

2118
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:04,220
minimal, you know, reproducible in its system

2119
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,300
that just starts things in a row, okay, great.

2120
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,380
Yeah, or maybe on even like,

2121
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,720
like they're working on Raspberry Pi 2

2122
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,460
and Pi 3 support right now, I could see that.

2123
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,740
Anybody in the mumbler, what do you think

2124
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:15,480
about a system D-less Linux?

2125
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,660
Do you care anymore?

2126
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,500
So one of the other things we thought was interesting

2127
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:19,460
about this story,

2128
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:22,740
and this might be something somebody could jump in on,

2129
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:27,740
is it's 2017 and the multi-year hoopla

2130
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:30,620
that was system D has passed us.

2131
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:32,420
And essentially it's just been normalized now

2132
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:33,380
into Linux culture.

2133
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:35,340
Wow, does it feel good to say that?

2134
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:37,700
I think so.

2135
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:39,220
So here we are now in 2017,

2136
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:40,900
and I'm feeling like things are actually worked out

2137
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:41,740
pretty good.

2138
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:43,960
We haven't had a security nightmare

2139
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:47,140
that's rolled across Linux, leaving us all exposed.

2140
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:48,900
Well, at least not because of system D.

2141
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:53,140
Yeah, boot times, man, I gotta say.

2142
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:54,780
Great.

2143
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,420
The one way I interact with system D

2144
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:58,300
on a more frequent basis is boot up time,

2145
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:01,220
and so far, my system D based systems boot a lot faster.

2146
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,360
System D service scripts, or service units,

2147
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,260
whatever they're called, just make a lot more sense to me.

2148
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:09,980
It is really easy to write a unit file

2149
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:11,980
and just like turn this into a service, please.

2150
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:15,540
And the system CTL enables such and such,

2151
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,440
and stop and start, like all those commands

2152
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,340
are really straightforward.

2153
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:22,420
And I cherish the fact that I can log

2154
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:23,820
into multiple different distros now

2155
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:24,660
and use the same command.

2156
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,480
That is really nice.

2157
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,320
Cherish that.

2158
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,620
I came from a time where that was not the case.

2159
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:29,580
Never gonna happen.

2160
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:33,340
Yeah, every distro had its own syntax

2161
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:36,420
for enabling, disabling, and starting and stopping services.

2162
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:37,260
Every distro did.

2163
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:39,460
And then we finally got that service wrapper

2164
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:41,620
right at some point, but it didn't bring any features

2165
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,240
because it was too disparate.

2166
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:47,300
And still, there was frequently variations

2167
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,980
in the names of the services,

2168
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:51,180
which is also standardized as Apache 2,

2169
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,960
or HTTPD, or who knows.

2170
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,260
Yes, yes, yes, exactly.

2171
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,420
And now that's much more normalized as well.

2172
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:00,500
These are all things that we had to struggle with

2173
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:03,300
back in the day that I feel like System D has helped with.

2174
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:08,240
And now, here we are, here we are in 2017,

2175
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,580
and MonkeyCom has just moved to System D,

2176
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:11,980
like just moved to System D.

2177
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:14,380
MonkeyCom, how has it been for you?

2178
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:15,780
Oh, it sucked in the beginning.

2179
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:19,140
I mean, just, well, you have the thing

2180
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:20,740
where you move your MySQL server

2181
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:22,500
from, let's say, 12 to 16,

2182
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:25,700
and everything's working great until everything doesn't.

2183
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:27,480
And then the jackass you hire to come look at it

2184
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,740
removes System D and wipes out your MySQL install.

2185
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:30,580
No.

2186
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:31,420
That's always awesome.

2187
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,860
Whoa.

2188
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:36,100
But because he said System D was bad.

2189
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:40,340
I feel like there is a sitcom at where you work

2190
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:42,420
that could be filmed right now.

2191
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:45,280
So you had an outside contractor come in

2192
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,220
who can't kind of have an agenda,

2193
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:49,620
like an anti-System D agenda?

2194
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:51,480
I don't know what his problem was,

2195
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:53,620
but he got on the database server

2196
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:55,960
and it was production development.

2197
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,680
I mean, it wasn't gonna hurt any customers,

2198
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,980
but it was definitely something I didn't wanna rebuild.

2199
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:03,180
And yeah, he removed System D

2200
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:06,740
and that just completely hosed everything.

2201
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:09,660
I mean, it literally, you couldn't even,

2202
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:11,260
it wouldn't even boot.

2203
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,100
It was bad.

2204
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:12,940
I mean, that kind of makes sense

2205
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:13,900
when you remove the edit system.

2206
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:16,900
That's like, you're coming in here and fixing it

2207
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,740
for free kind of bad.

2208
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:19,100
Yeah, exactly.

2209
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,220
We really liked having that database.

2210
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,700
So after the Nuke bomb was dropped

2211
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:27,200
and you guys rebuilt the village, how has it been?

2212
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,040
Oh, it's fine.

2213
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:28,880
You just gotta learn the tweaks.

2214
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,540
You gotta understand how to exclude it from,

2215
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:34,900
you know, System D automatically does a bunch of stuff

2216
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,340
and especially with the security profile.

2217
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:38,700
And you just gotta know how to deal with it,

2218
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,900
especially when you're running really intensive loads.

2219
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,740
And once you figure that stuff out,

2220
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:45,460
it's an excellent solution.

2221
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,160
And it's much better than Annette.

2222
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,040
And I don't know why anyone would wanna go back.

2223
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,540
It's just, it's a pain in the ass

2224
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:53,300
to get your head wrapped around.

2225
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,300
Yeah, it is definitely a paradigm change.

2226
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,820
It's new tools, new switches, all that stuff.

2227
01:17:57,820 --> 01:17:58,660
Yeah.

2228
01:17:58,660 --> 01:17:59,980
We went through that with SE Linux.

2229
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:01,380
We went through that with, you know,

2230
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,460
every time something new comes out

2231
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:06,120
that has a performance or a configuration impact,

2232
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,980
we always freak out and say they shouldn't have done that,

2233
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:10,740
but it always improves your life.

2234
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:11,580
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

2235
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:12,500
It does something.

2236
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,580
There was people that with the transition

2237
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:18,300
from Lilo to Grub, I think some people drew blood over that.

2238
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,860
Like there has always been big moments

2239
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:23,360
we've made moves that have been really, really,

2240
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,760
really painful publicly.

2241
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:27,120
And it's done so in a way that most projects

2242
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,040
that are commercial projects

2243
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,660
don't ever get that kind of exposure.

2244
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:31,420
And so we get to watch the sausage get made

2245
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:33,000
in a way that most people never see.

2246
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,620
But Monkey Comm, it's fascinating

2247
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:38,260
because what you represent is probably the reality.

2248
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:41,660
Most shops are just now beginning to make this transition.

2249
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:44,180
Like to me, my systems have been running

2250
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:46,020
system D for ages now,

2251
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:47,940
but people that have like Monkey Comm

2252
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:48,980
and probably like yourself, you probably have,

2253
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:50,940
do you have systems in production that are?

2254
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:52,980
Absolutely. Yeah, of course, right?

2255
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:54,120
I probably, there's probably systems

2256
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,980
I've still set up years ago that are still in production.

2257
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:00,220
I just got off a 12, so let's be honest here.

2258
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:01,780
And I do think like, it's interesting to compare,

2259
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,900
like I've talked to some developers in particular

2260
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,300
who felt a little burned about the whole Upstart thing.

2261
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,700
They're like, we finally got off Etsy in it for Upstart.

2262
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:10,140
You told us that was the next best thing.

2263
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:11,940
And we switched all of our programs

2264
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:13,060
and now we have to switch them again,

2265
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:15,440
which I mean, I think just that improvement already,

2266
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,880
it's like pretty easy to turn an Upstart job

2267
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,720
into a system D job.

2268
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:18,700
So it's not a huge deal.

2269
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:21,900
And I also think that like just the rate of adoption

2270
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,840
and the expanse of the adoption we've seen

2271
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,020
means that I don't think that,

2272
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:27,500
I don't think it'll take longer than maybe five years

2273
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,540
probably before we see a new system D thing

2274
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:33,500
that replaces it in the reach that system D has.

2275
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,140
So I think it's in a better position,

2276
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:37,940
but I can see why people are like, I have to change again.

2277
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,020
I don't know if anybody does this out there on the web,

2278
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,540
this would be really cool,

2279
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:46,400
is all of like the top 20 Linux distros.

2280
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,140
Now you know what, let's make it simpler than that.

2281
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:50,780
The top four Linux distros used by enterprise,

2282
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:51,840
and I don't know who determines that,

2283
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,060
but whatever sold determines that to be fact.

2284
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,580
We'll just ask Noah, he'll tell us.

2285
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:58,460
That's probably true.

2286
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:02,620
I would like just a simple HTML table,

2287
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:04,100
doesn't have to be fancy,

2288
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,700
of the current production Linux's

2289
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,700
and the kernel versions they're running.

2290
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:13,140
And current versions, yeah, I feel like

2291
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:15,780
if you look at the last five years of Linux,

2292
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:19,460
and this is so true when you look at the enterprise graph,

2293
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:23,460
we are converging in a way that if you gave 2017

2294
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:24,700
current day snapshot Linux,

2295
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:25,780
if you took a snapshot of it,

2296
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:28,500
and showed it to Chris of 1998,

2297
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,100
I wouldn't call this Linux anymore.

2298
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,500
Everybody, every major vendor

2299
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:36,260
shipping a GTK Gnome 3 desktop,

2300
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:40,540
every vendor, every major vendor shipping system D.

2301
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:42,700
Now if you look at the middle layer is system D,

2302
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:44,460
and the user land is GNU,

2303
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:49,460
then almost all distros are now exactly common.

2304
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:54,340
GTK, Gnome, GNU, system D,

2305
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:58,500
and then I bet they're all based

2306
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,780
on a semi-modern kernel four.

2307
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:04,780
And more and more of them at the end of 2017

2308
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:07,260
are gonna all at least have kernel version 4.10.

2309
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:09,420
We're pretty much all gonna be,

2310
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,020
anybody running current Linux

2311
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:14,620
will be on version 4.10 or later of Linux by the end of 2017.

2312
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:17,260
So you're gonna have this unprecedented,

2313
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:21,100
I mean, have we ever been this cohesive as a community ever?

2314
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,180
Maybe like only when it was just small enough

2315
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,620
that there couldn't have been this much,

2316
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:25,460
you know what I mean?

2317
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:27,140
Like early days, but it's been a long time.

2318
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:30,580
And also by the way, every distribution

2319
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:32,140
that matches what I just mentioned

2320
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:34,140
also can install flat packs.

2321
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,380
Whoa.

2322
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:36,980
So now we have universal application

2323
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:39,140
installation capabilities on Linux.

2324
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:40,980
I feel like we're talking about BSD.

2325
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:43,940
Yeah. Yeah.

2326
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:45,620
Kind of, in a different way.

2327
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,020
Only way more badass, right?

2328
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:48,500
Like this is way better.

2329
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,980
Like it's so awesome.

2330
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:52,860
And it could also be the shittiest things

2331
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:53,700
ever happened to Linux.

2332
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:56,260
Like you have to keep room to understand

2333
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:58,220
that one of the things that's made Linux great

2334
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:00,460
is diversity, lots of little things,

2335
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:03,900
doing single tasks, like there is the possibility

2336
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,460
that this could lead to ruin.

2337
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:08,860
But it seems more likely that we are reaching

2338
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:11,060
a level of consensus in the community

2339
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:13,380
that is gonna make us more targetable,

2340
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:16,020
more applicable, more commoditizable,

2341
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:17,940
which is gonna all lead to a greater adoption,

2342
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:20,540
more applications, more use case scenarios.

2343
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:22,980
To me, it seems like we're in a better spot

2344
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:25,220
than we've probably been in a really long time.

2345
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:26,460
Now, we're not quite there yet,

2346
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:28,340
but the skate or the puck

2347
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:29,820
is certainly skating in that direction.

2348
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,380
So does that like play hand-to-hand

2349
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:32,340
with what we were talking about before,

2350
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,820
where will that also make it like,

2351
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:36,980
so that branding and other things matter less

2352
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:38,180
when it's all just Linux?

2353
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:39,940
Like it doesn't matter if you use a bunch of,

2354
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:42,100
or I don't know if it's like 90% the same now.

2355
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:45,340
I would use Docker potentially,

2356
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,020
oh God, I can't believe I'm gonna throw up

2357
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:48,460
a little bit in my mouth when I say this.

2358
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:50,700
So don't judge me too harshly.

2359
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:54,020
I would use Docker slightly as the example

2360
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:56,180
in some sense here and I'll explain myself.

2361
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,820
So what's Docker selling?

2362
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:01,140
Docker is selling, this is what sucks for Docker.

2363
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,460
Docker is basically selling water

2364
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:05,220
to folks that have a town well.

2365
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:06,860
Like the problem with Docker is

2366
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:09,380
they're just selling namespaces,

2367
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:12,060
CNAME groups, Linux kernel features,

2368
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:15,140
and a bunch of great management utilities on top of that.

2369
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:18,020
Now, if you take away the management utilities,

2370
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:21,300
everything else is a commodity of the Linux platform.

2371
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:24,100
Like every distribution has the capability

2372
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:27,100
of namespaces and control groups.

2373
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,420
I mean, SystemD could make containers,

2374
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,340
I mean containers or whatever, but right there for you.

2375
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:32,900
Right, so this multi-million dollar company

2376
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,580
named Docker is selling something

2377
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:37,540
that you get for free with the platform.

2378
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,980
Now that's telling of where we could go in the future

2379
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:42,140
because we all could be selling the same thing,

2380
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:44,100
but yeah, we can have a multi-million dollar company

2381
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:47,820
on top of it that is branding and productizing

2382
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:50,740
the management infrastructure or the community around it

2383
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:52,700
or whatever it is that they do.

2384
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,780
So there is still space for a canonical

2385
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,820
and a SUSE where the product is commoditized

2386
01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:59,580
because Docker is the example.

2387
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:02,940
Docker is selling something that comes for free with Linux.

2388
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:05,520
You get containerized, you install a modern Linux,

2389
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,140
you've got what Docker, the core of what Docker can do,

2390
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:11,380
and yet somehow, somehow, they're still making money,

2391
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,780
they're still a name we're still talking about.

2392
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:13,740
I thought they're called Moby now.

2393
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:14,580
Yeah, right.

2394
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:15,420
But you see what I'm saying.

2395
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:16,380
I do see what you're saying, absolutely.

2396
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:18,740
It almost makes, it almost gives,

2397
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:21,340
it's just at a different, it's at a different layer

2398
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:23,980
where the product and the innovation happens.

2399
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:24,820
It's at a different layer.

2400
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:26,340
There's a common technology base.

2401
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:27,580
Which I think is good, right?

2402
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:30,660
Like that's a, I like, you know,

2403
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:31,700
you always have to decide where that level,

2404
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:34,020
where is the value add layer going to be?

2405
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:35,860
I think pushing it up a little higher in the stack

2406
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:36,700
is a good thing.

2407
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,980
Yeah, because what it does is it makes it sane

2408
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:42,660
and manageable and deliverable for developers.

2409
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,020
So I know what I'm targeting,

2410
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,940
I know how many systems I'm gonna be able to run on,

2411
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:47,220
and I know how to package it up

2412
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:48,740
and ship it for those systems.

2413
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:50,940
And I know how it's gonna run once it lands there.

2414
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:54,020
Those are not things you could actually say about Linux

2415
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:56,620
a few years ago, and especially not 10 years ago

2416
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:57,660
or 20 years ago.

2417
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:58,820
You couldn't say that.

2418
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:00,740
You kind of, like, depending, like,

2419
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:02,980
well, if it depends on a couple of libraries,

2420
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:03,820
you got a good shot.

2421
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:06,340
But when you're developing a modern huge application

2422
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:07,180
with all its components,

2423
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:09,420
the only way to do it in the past was to say,

2424
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:12,420
we work on Red Hat Enterprise 6, and that's it.

2425
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:13,940
We've tested for Red Hat Enterprise 6,

2426
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:15,340
and we work on Red Hat Enterprise 6,

2427
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:17,020
and you must run in Red Hat Enterprise 6,

2428
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:19,300
and that's the only way we support Linux.

2429
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,620
That's gonna go away.

2430
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:21,740
And what we're gonna have now is,

2431
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:23,860
well, you must have Linux kernel 4.10,

2432
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:26,380
you're gonna need systemd version dot dot dot,

2433
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:28,540
and you probably should install these packages.

2434
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,380
And that will be the requirements.

2435
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:31,540
That's a game changer.

2436
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:33,300
That's a game changer for all of us.

2437
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:36,100
And then the fact that at the same time that's happening,

2438
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,660
we just accidentally have Flatpak and Snaps,

2439
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:40,420
which are universal package installations,

2440
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:42,140
and we just accidentally happened to have

2441
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:43,660
all of the major Linux companies

2442
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:46,060
now working on the GNOME desktop and GTK.

2443
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:49,100
I mean, holy, holy convergence, Batman.

2444
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,820
That's a whole different type of convergence,

2445
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:52,940
and it's gotta be one that's in the long term

2446
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:53,780
gonna be good.

2447
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:55,820
And how the hell is BSD gonna compete with that?

2448
01:25:55,820 --> 01:26:00,380
All right, that brings us to an end

2449
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:01,660
of this week's broadcast.

2450
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:07,940
One more episode before the big Linux Fest Northwest, Wes.

2451
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:09,260
Whoa! I know.

2452
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:10,340
It's really snuck up on us.

2453
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:11,340
I'm excited now.

2454
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:12,580
I am, I am too.

2455
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:13,900
I'm really looking forward to it.

2456
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:16,300
Audience, you should try your darndest to get there.

2457
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,860
But you know what, like every Linux Unplugged

2458
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:20,180
is almost like a Linux Fest.

2459
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,780
You can join us in our virtual lug.

2460
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:24,140
Just go over to jblive.tv, join our chat room,

2461
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:25,860
and then do bang!

2462
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:27,380
Mumble, that's the exclamation mark.

2463
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:28,460
And you'll get our server address.

2464
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:30,460
You join that, you can hang out in our lug.

2465
01:26:30,460 --> 01:26:31,620
You can also send us an email over

2466
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:33,180
jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact,

2467
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:34,100
and get it converted to your local time

2468
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:36,460
at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

2469
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:37,580
Thanks so much for being here.

2470
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:38,980
We'll see you right back here.

2471
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:39,820
Next Tuesday!

2472
01:26:39,820 --> 01:27:03,640
Hey guys, good to see you again.

2473
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:25,320
JBtitles.com, why don't you all go over to that JBtitles.com.

2474
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:28,480
Let's pick our title real quick and then we'll make room for the TechSnap program.

2475
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,960
Wes, the light's still burned out in there, I have ordered replacements but they just

2476
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:32,960
take weeks to arrive.

2477
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:33,960
I'm sure.

2478
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:34,960
So you're just going to look like a tan man.

2479
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:35,960
All right.

2480
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:39,080
I watched last week's episode, you just look like you have a real healthy glow.

2481
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,520
I like, okay, not a problem for me.

2482
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,600
Mumble Room, thank you guys very much.

2483
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,600
You guys are awesome.

2484
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:45,600
Yeah, thank you.

2485
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,600
Monkey, thank you very much for carrying a lot of the weight.

2486
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,600
It was a fun chat today.

2487
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,640
Charlie, it was good to hear what you're working on too.

2488
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:50,640
Come back.

2489
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,640
Yes.

2490
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:55,520
JBtitles, JBtitles, won't you all go boat.

2491
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:59,960
I just am tired of Docker being the end all be all of the developers.

2492
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:03,380
I mean, half the developers don't even know them and they know they're developing in Linux

2493
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:06,320
but they've lost all understanding of what they're doing.

2494
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,320
It's creepy.

2495
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:10,280
It creeps you out because it makes Linux feel like it just doesn't matter, like it could

2496
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:14,520
just go away and nobody even know, oh, just keep making containers.

2497
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:17,480
It's never going to go away because every developer I know, when they build a Docker,

2498
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:20,880
they always use the same fucking port and then they put it on a Docker server and nothing

2499
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:21,880
works.

2500
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,480
And then it never gets updates and it sits there riddled with security issues.

2501
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:27,100
But that's, yeah, that's got to get worked out too.

2502
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:30,800
Maybe what we need is Edge X Foundry for Docker.

2503
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,200
Just got so enterprise.

2504
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:36,960
IoT, biological bootloaders, not bad.

2505
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,360
Oh, WW, you had a rant.

2506
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:39,720
You wanted the floor.

2507
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:40,720
Go ahead.

2508
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:41,720
Okay.

2509
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:50,600
So chat room, when you type in bang mum, you look stupid.

2510
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:57,760
If you want to come and join mumble and talk to Chris and then do Chris last mumble, hey,

2511
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,840
I want to say something, then that's what you do.

2512
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:06,120
Outside of that, you look like a donkey.

2513
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,280
Are you saying they're doing bang mumble just to get my attention?

2514
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,280
Is that what you mean?

2515
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,280
I don't know.

2516
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:16,520
I don't know why they're doing bang mum unless they want to, you know, bring down fears.

2517
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:22,960
Yes, you know, they're just trolling because that's all they know to do.

2518
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:26,080
I was doing it just because I saw somebody else do it and they got the floor.

2519
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:27,760
In fact, I think I saw a monkey do it.

2520
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:28,760
Well, yeah.

2521
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:32,880
Well, if you're in the mumble room, you do mum, Chris last, and then what you want to

2522
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,000
say and I'll call on you.

2523
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,400
Bang mumble, bang mum, bang mum or whatever, I think just gives you the server.

2524
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,080
I'm not even sure what that does.

2525
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:45,280
I think bang mum is just a misnomer, which is why it's making, it's rustling some jimmies.

2526
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:49,000
There is a way to like they're like when people preface like a comment, if you do like Chris

2527
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:54,240
last mum, colon, and then what you want to say, I almost always will call on you.

2528
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,520
Like that seems to be, that was the confusion.

2529
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:57,520
Yeah.

2530
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,520
Yeah.

2531
01:29:58,520 --> 01:29:59,520
I don't know why people get confused.

2532
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,520
You know what?

2533
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,800
I saw someone do it and they got the floor.

2534
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:04,800
Yeah.

2535
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,800
It's cause you know what?

2536
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:11,120
It's the, it's the, it's the, it's the wonderful cycle of noobs, w w it's, it's both glorious

2537
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:15,680
and excruciatingly frustrating at the same time.
