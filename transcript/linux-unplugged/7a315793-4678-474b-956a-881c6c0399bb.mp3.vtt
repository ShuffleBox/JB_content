WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.680
Well, thank you to the archive.org website.

00:02.680 --> 00:06.960
Some precious internet history has been preserved.

00:06.960 --> 00:10.160
It's peanut butter jelly time, peanut butter jelly time,

00:10.160 --> 00:11.820
peanut butter jelly time.

00:11.820 --> 00:14.680
Way yeah, way yeah, way yeah, way yeah.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.920
Now there you go, there you go, there you go, there you go,

00:17.920 --> 00:21.040
peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly,

00:21.040 --> 00:24.240
peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.900
little peanut butter jelly, peanut butter gel smell,

00:25.900 --> 00:27.080
peanut butter jelly with a baseball bat,

00:27.080 --> 00:27.900
peanut butter jelly.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.280
Yeah, this precious internet gem

00:29.280 --> 00:32.240
amongst many others, is now being preserved.

00:32.240 --> 00:37.800
These Flash games and movies and videos and comics

00:37.800 --> 00:39.840
are being preserved on archive.org.

00:39.840 --> 00:43.160
But there's a special twist for fans of this show, Wes.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.160
Oh, yes.

00:44.160 --> 00:48.080
It's all powered by Rust.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.720
Rust, you say?

00:49.720 --> 00:50.560
Well, yeah.

00:50.560 --> 00:51.400
I mean, of course.

00:51.400 --> 00:54.040
How else would you accomplish this magic?

00:54.040 --> 00:55.040
You can watch all this.

00:55.040 --> 00:57.620
You don't need to have a Flash plug-in installed,

00:57.620 --> 01:00.320
because it's powered by WebAssembly and Rust

01:00.320 --> 01:02.540
with the Ruffle project.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.400
The only way to make Flash acceptable

01:04.400 --> 01:08.600
is create an engine in Rust that plays it using WebAssembly.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.760
I think this is a Linux-unplugged

01:10.760 --> 01:14.400
approved methodology to watch your Flash videos

01:14.400 --> 01:17.280
and to play your Flash video games and whatnot.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.400
Flash, it's finally hip again.

01:19.400 --> 01:29.680
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.640
My name is Chris.

01:30.640 --> 01:31.720
My name is Wes.

01:31.720 --> 01:32.680
Hello there, Wes.

01:32.680 --> 01:35.680
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru, the leader

01:35.680 --> 01:36.600
in hands-on learning.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.840
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.880
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs, Cloud Linux servers,

01:41.880 --> 01:42.760
and much more.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.680
Get your hands cloudy at acloudguru.com.

01:45.680 --> 01:50.040
This is Linux Unplugged episode 381,

01:50.040 --> 01:52.520
which is getting really close to one of my favorites.

01:52.520 --> 01:55.920
I've had the privilege of a couple of shows reaching 386.

01:55.920 --> 02:00.480
And that and 486 are my two favorite episode numbers,

02:00.480 --> 02:01.360
because I'm a nerd.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.000
Really good reminder of just how much time you spent here.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.160
Yeah, it's nice.

02:05.160 --> 02:09.000
It's nice, actually, to be looking back at 381

02:09.000 --> 02:13.680
and feeling like, man, I feel like we still got a lot more

02:13.680 --> 02:14.480
episodes in us.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.920
We're not even close to feeling like we're

02:17.920 --> 02:18.920
near done with this show.

02:18.920 --> 02:20.520
We got still a lot to get into.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.020
We have a lot of episode to get into.

02:22.020 --> 02:23.920
This is going to be a really fun one,

02:23.920 --> 02:26.160
because we have an open source tool that's

02:26.160 --> 02:30.520
going to help you be a secret spy using, well,

02:30.520 --> 02:32.880
retro technology, a new open source tool that

02:32.880 --> 02:35.040
will make you feel very retro.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.160
That's a good tease.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.760
But we also have a bunch of community news

02:38.760 --> 02:41.040
and some feedback, a pic, too, that I

02:41.040 --> 02:43.120
think is going to make your desktop look even better

02:43.120 --> 02:44.520
and your terminal look super sharp.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.720
Oh, you're thinking of us.

02:45.720 --> 02:46.320
I am.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.720
I'm always thinking of you guys.

02:47.720 --> 02:51.820
Well, and well, constantly just dogged by what the hell

02:51.820 --> 02:53.200
I'm going to talk about next on the show,

02:53.200 --> 02:55.580
like it's some sort of demon that constantly stalks me

02:55.580 --> 02:57.280
every single day and ever.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.920
Anyways, where were we?

02:58.920 --> 02:59.920
Oh, yeah, right.

02:59.920 --> 03:01.640
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.140
Hello.

03:02.140 --> 03:02.640
Hello.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.140
Hello.

03:03.140 --> 03:03.640
Hello.

03:03.640 --> 03:04.140
Hello.

03:04.140 --> 03:06.280
Hello.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.600
Hello, everybody.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.560
Look at that, 25 in the Virtual Lug today,

03:09.560 --> 03:11.800
a few in the quiet listening, a whole bunch on air.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.800
And it's really awesome to see some new faces, old faces,

03:14.800 --> 03:15.880
and in between.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.720
Of course, we're also streaming at jblive.tv on a Tuesday.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.320
We do it at noon Pacific.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.520
And every now and then, like the last couple episodes,

03:22.520 --> 03:23.440
we tweak it up a bit.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.720
But we try to keep the calendar as best up to date

03:25.720 --> 03:27.360
as we can at jupitabroadcasting.com

03:27.360 --> 03:29.160
slash calendar.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.800
And let's start with a fun fact of life.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.960
Like it or not, and maybe you do like it,

03:33.960 --> 03:36.680
Chrome OS just isn't going away.

03:36.680 --> 03:42.200
So the question the show has is, could we have some fun?

03:42.200 --> 03:44.760
And there's a couple of projects out there

03:44.760 --> 03:47.080
that would suggest yes, including one that

03:47.080 --> 03:49.400
aims to be a total Chrome OS alternative maybe

03:49.400 --> 03:51.920
for those older Chromebooks.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.600
And it's from a developer we've heard of before, Wes.

03:54.600 --> 03:58.640
Yeah, from the creator of Ubuntu Unity and Ubuntu Ed,

03:58.640 --> 04:01.960
here comes yet another unofficial Ubuntu flavor,

04:01.960 --> 04:05.880
Ubuntu Web Remix, which aims to be an alternative to Chrome OS

04:05.880 --> 04:07.440
or Chromium OS.

04:07.440 --> 04:12.680
I will admit to still watching Ubuntu Unity with a bit

04:12.680 --> 04:15.640
of a curiosity, wondering what could happen there.

04:15.640 --> 04:18.040
As time goes on, it almost feels like it'd

04:18.040 --> 04:20.160
be fun to spend a week in Unity.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.640
I think it would genuinely feel old at this point.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.040
I have some fond memories, though.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.040
Yeah, it still feels like it'd be kind of fun.

04:26.040 --> 04:29.320
And I don't know if any of these will ever become official Ubuntu

04:29.320 --> 04:32.560
flavors, but they're cool to see out there because you do wonder,

04:32.560 --> 04:35.280
can you have a project that is Ubuntu adjacent,

04:35.280 --> 04:37.520
so it brings a lot of compatibility with it,

04:37.520 --> 04:41.640
that could be utilized to bring new life into old Chromebooks?

04:41.640 --> 04:44.760
So this Remix right now is based off

04:44.760 --> 04:47.980
of a version of GNOME 3.36.

04:47.980 --> 04:49.920
It comes with an app pre-installed

04:49.920 --> 04:52.280
so you can run Android apps.

04:52.280 --> 04:54.000
It has DTube video sharing on there.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.680
It has the Mastered on Web App and Twitter web apps

04:56.680 --> 04:58.040
pre-installed.

04:58.040 --> 05:01.040
Their focus here is really de-Googled web apps.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.800
I think that's a big focus of that project.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.840
Or at least they're focusing on those tools.

05:04.840 --> 05:08.040
Right, I mean, it uses primarily Firefox instead of Chrome

05:08.040 --> 05:11.560
because otherwise how is it an alternative to a Chromebook?

05:11.560 --> 05:14.960
You should note, though, that if you plan to install the Android apps,

05:14.960 --> 05:18.280
it's experimental right now and might not work properly,

05:18.280 --> 05:21.400
especially on the live session or in a virtual machine.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.900
It's all powered by Andbox under the hood,

05:23.900 --> 05:26.440
and you might have to do some fiddling with things like Secure Boot

05:26.440 --> 05:28.600
to get that all working nicely.

05:28.600 --> 05:32.560
All right, so maybe he's all in on the Chrome OS.

05:32.560 --> 05:36.000
So then maybe you want to bring it to other devices,

05:36.000 --> 05:39.720
like maybe the Pine 64, which could be legitimately useful.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.280
My kids' schools, they exclusively use Chromebooks,

05:42.280 --> 05:44.480
and maybe it wouldn't be so bad for me to know

05:44.480 --> 05:47.160
how to use the Chromebook OS and interface.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.120
And my Pinebook, which I already own,

05:49.120 --> 05:52.400
could be a great way for maybe me to learn without having

05:52.400 --> 05:54.040
to make a big investment.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.200
I'm going to take a shot at this name.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.720
I'm going to say Fee-ed OS.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.760
Well, I was going to say Fide, but yeah, all right.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.040
Fee-ed OS.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.160
No, no, no, it's Fide.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.400
I just thought, because that's what I thought it was,

06:05.400 --> 06:06.600
it must not be right.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.960
Oh, surely we're both getting it wrong.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.360
That's how it usually goes.

06:09.360 --> 06:13.840
So it's Fee-ed OS, which is a fork of Chromium OS,

06:13.840 --> 06:15.920
the open source version of Chrome OS.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.040
This version is based for Chromium x86,

06:19.040 --> 06:20.880
so it supports a lot of x86 machines,

06:20.880 --> 06:24.720
but they're also making a version for the Pine 64.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.360
Yeah, it is also available if you don't want it on the Pine

06:27.360 --> 06:28.360
book, you know?

06:28.360 --> 06:29.680
It's pretty flexible.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.880
It's got custom builds for things like the Microsoft

06:31.880 --> 06:36.000
Surface tablets, the Google Chromebook Pixel 2013,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.320
and the GPD Pocket 2.

06:38.320 --> 06:38.840
Hey.

06:38.840 --> 06:39.680
Yeah.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.760
That's kind of particularly cool and caught my eye.

06:42.760 --> 06:45.320
But we do have a reporter live on the scene.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.960
Byte Bitten, you're reporting live

06:46.960 --> 06:51.040
from using Fee-ed or Fide OS, and you have some notes.

06:51.040 --> 06:51.560
Yes, Chris.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.520
So here with my Pinebook, bro.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.400
So yeah, I've been trying Fide OS

06:58.400 --> 07:00.640
or getting it to install my Pinebook Pro,

07:00.640 --> 07:04.600
but it is very picky with the micro SD cards you're using.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.520
It needs to be fast enough for it to boot.

07:07.520 --> 07:12.840
And I had some what I thought were fast micro SD cards,

07:12.840 --> 07:16.000
but they seem to be not fast enough.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.960
And it is really a miss on that part,

07:18.960 --> 07:21.360
and you need to try a lot of micro SD cards

07:21.360 --> 07:23.680
if you don't find the right one.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.760
Oh, did you nail down what it is that it's

07:25.760 --> 07:27.360
looking for in an SD card?

07:27.360 --> 07:28.240
Not exactly.

07:28.240 --> 07:31.160
And also, the developer said that it is just

07:31.160 --> 07:32.680
demanding on the micro SD card.

07:32.680 --> 07:36.120
But as soon as you've got it installed on the eMMC,

07:36.120 --> 07:38.760
then it is just smooth sailing from there.

07:38.760 --> 07:39.560
Good to know.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.040
Thank you.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.840
Why don't we transition to a little bit of what's

07:43.840 --> 07:45.080
coming down the pipeline?

07:45.080 --> 07:48.520
As projects are looking to 2021, we're

07:48.520 --> 07:52.040
getting an idea of what Gnome is going

07:52.040 --> 07:53.520
to focus on as a project.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.560
Feronix has an article that also covers

07:56.560 --> 07:58.360
where they spent their money over 2020,

07:58.360 --> 07:59.480
if you're interested in that.

07:59.480 --> 08:03.120
It seems like a lot of it went to GTK4 development,

08:03.120 --> 08:05.360
some technical infrastructure support for Flathub,

08:05.360 --> 08:07.440
and a few other things.

08:07.440 --> 08:07.960
Oh, yeah.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.680
Hey, remember that legal case against Rothschild patent

08:10.680 --> 08:12.440
imaging that costs money?

08:12.440 --> 08:14.680
Plus some good stuff like conferences,

08:14.680 --> 08:18.720
Gwadek, Linux App Summit, GTK hack fests.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.040
They also got themselves a supported instance

08:21.040 --> 08:23.080
of the video chat software Big Blue Button.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.160
Hey, I'm sure that's pretty handy.

08:25.160 --> 08:28.440
And some internships and just general community support.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.480
And all of that is great work.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.840
Yeah, I bet they weren't expecting

08:31.840 --> 08:34.120
to need that video conferencing software quite as much.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.080
No.

08:36.080 --> 08:40.320
In 2021, they're going to focus on organizing Gwadek some more,

08:40.320 --> 08:43.000
as well as the Gnome Summit and the Linux App Summit.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
They're going to host virtual social events, hack fests.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.240
But there's also going to be, of course, work on two more

08:48.240 --> 08:49.800
editions of Gnome.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.300
They're going to look to push forward

08:51.300 --> 08:53.440
smaller projects within the Gnome ecosystem

08:53.440 --> 08:56.480
with some of their funding, including also hiring

08:56.480 --> 08:59.640
interns and paid internships for free software development.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.200
Awesome.

09:00.200 --> 09:00.800
Yeah.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.520
Provide financial and logistical support

09:02.520 --> 09:04.880
for people that are speaking at conferences, which

09:04.880 --> 09:06.640
for people who are new to speaking.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.800
But maybe you have somebody out there

09:07.800 --> 09:09.160
who can be a really good advocate for you.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.480
That's really nice to handle that stuff for them.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.160
But they're also going to, they note in here,

09:13.160 --> 09:14.600
launch a new initiative, including

09:14.600 --> 09:19.400
the Faces of Gnome, an increased conference participation.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.240
But the Faces of Gnome, I think, is that's interesting.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.620
There is a Faces of Open Source project out there,

09:24.620 --> 09:27.960
which I bet you this has inspired this.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.520
And maybe pretty soon, we're going

09:29.520 --> 09:32.280
to have a way to put more names to faces.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.080
I like that.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.480
Oftentimes, you just get to see a nick or a handle

09:35.480 --> 09:36.960
or an email and a git commit.

09:36.960 --> 09:39.280
But there's real people spending real time

09:39.280 --> 09:41.160
on all this free software that we love.

09:41.160 --> 09:41.640
Yeah.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.560
And I think it's good to also remind everybody

09:43.560 --> 09:44.800
that there's humans.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.120
Humans.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.520
Behind Gnome.

09:47.520 --> 09:51.760
Gnome gets so much opinion in this space.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.080
Everybody has an opinion.

09:53.080 --> 09:57.000
And we kind of just speak of this nebulous upstream gnome.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.880
Yeah, and everybody loves to share it too, right?

09:59.880 --> 10:01.480
They love to share that opinion.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.360
So maybe reminding us all that there's human beings there

10:04.360 --> 10:05.320
isn't so bad.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.200
But looking into our future crystal ball vision,

10:08.200 --> 10:11.520
like we were earlier before, I see something else coming down

10:11.520 --> 10:12.560
the pipeline, of course.

10:12.560 --> 10:15.720
And that is details for Fedora 34.

10:15.720 --> 10:18.700
Looks like we're going to have a couple of new spins,

10:18.700 --> 10:21.520
I guess they call them, in Fedora parlance.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.600
Well, one is the i3 team is working on an official Fedora

10:24.600 --> 10:27.280
spin for Fedora 34.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.280
And it looks like in Fedora 34, we

10:30.280 --> 10:34.240
will see an official KDE plasma spin for 64-bit ARM devices.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.920
I'm looking at you, Pi 400.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.360
Isn't that nice?

10:37.360 --> 10:39.760
And then the big doozy that, of course, Wes and I

10:39.760 --> 10:43.440
care the most about is Fedora 34 may try,

10:43.440 --> 10:44.800
this is still up in the air, but may

10:44.800 --> 10:49.680
try to use pipe wire by default to replace pulse audio.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.080
And I guess, would it also replace jack?

10:52.080 --> 10:54.760
This is where I'm still fuzzy, or would it integrate with jack?

10:54.760 --> 10:56.400
Yeah, I mean, that's just it.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.760
Pipe wire would provide Fedora 34's jack support.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.880
It would be a pipe wire future, at least based

11:02.880 --> 11:04.040
on the Ferronix write-up.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.040
Right, right.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.660
I don't know how I feel about that.

11:06.660 --> 11:08.600
I mean, I really love and support pipe wire.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.560
I'm super excited about the pipe wire future.

11:11.560 --> 11:15.360
But just the history of adopting new sound solutions

11:15.360 --> 11:17.440
makes me a little bit nervous, even

11:17.440 --> 11:19.760
in a great environment like Fedora, pipe wire

11:19.760 --> 11:22.920
is pretty easy to install in Fedora right now.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.160
I don't know.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.520
If it's ready, it's ready.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.880
Fedora can make that judgment.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.680
It just makes me a little nervous.

11:29.680 --> 11:33.760
Yeah, and it does maybe change our math a little bit

11:33.760 --> 11:35.280
on if we were going to reload.

11:35.280 --> 11:38.880
We have a machine that's super critical to our workload.

11:38.880 --> 11:41.760
I'm talking to Wes on it right now, and recording,

11:41.760 --> 11:42.400
and all of it.

11:42.400 --> 11:46.000
And if it were to go out, we would be so as well,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.080
and we'd have to rebuild that day.

11:48.080 --> 11:51.560
And so the question is, would you rebuild with 18.04,

11:51.560 --> 11:54.320
or at this point, at the end of 2020,

11:54.320 --> 11:55.600
would you go with something else?

11:55.600 --> 11:59.800
And seriously, Fedora would be a consideration in this mix,

11:59.800 --> 12:03.760
but not if in the next release this change is coming.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.640
And I'm all for it at the same time.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.000
I still want them to do it.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.960
It just means you'd use it in the appropriate use cases.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.840
You also got to figure, Wes, that maybe they'd

12:11.840 --> 12:14.040
make it an easy way to just switch back.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.920
Yeah, that very well could be.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.560
Yeah, that could be coming.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.720
And it seems like you just haven't played with it a bit.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.440
And I know our very own Mr. Drew has been evaluating

12:22.440 --> 12:23.840
PipeWire fairly extensively.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.720
And progress is very impressive.

12:25.720 --> 12:28.960
So it very well could be totally ready for this, at least

12:28.960 --> 12:30.360
in most use cases.

12:30.360 --> 12:33.080
Yeah, and kind of in the same wheelhouse,

12:33.080 --> 12:36.880
PulseAudio 14.0 has been just recently released.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.600
It comes with many changes.

12:38.600 --> 12:42.160
But there is this flat volumes controversy

12:42.160 --> 12:44.000
that I guess most distros patched around,

12:44.000 --> 12:45.400
so I was oblivious to it.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.720
Can you explain this to me?

12:46.720 --> 12:48.400
Yeah, I guess it's kind of always

12:48.400 --> 12:51.440
been a controversial feature in PulseAudio.

12:51.440 --> 12:54.720
With flat volumes, the stream volumes controls also

12:54.720 --> 12:55.640
the sync volume.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.520
And so maybe you've seen this feature

12:57.520 --> 13:00.480
where you adjust the volume in your loudest application,

13:00.480 --> 13:03.640
and that ends up adjusting the whole system volume.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.080
So those become linked, and you don't have these two layers

13:06.080 --> 13:09.040
of volume controls like you might think that you have.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.680
And the biggest problem is that sometimes,

13:11.680 --> 13:14.840
after you've adjusted the volume in one app to boost that up,

13:14.840 --> 13:19.480
the next app that plays suddenly plays and blows your ears out.

13:19.480 --> 13:22.920
OK, no wonder why the distros patch around that.

13:22.920 --> 13:23.720
That's not good.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.320
Right, and so that way, because it

13:25.320 --> 13:26.920
can be confusing if you don't understand

13:26.920 --> 13:28.800
that there's the second system volume.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.120
If you are in an app and you go all the way to 100%,

13:32.120 --> 13:34.760
if the system volume is at 30%, it's just not

13:34.760 --> 13:36.120
going to get that loud, right?

13:36.120 --> 13:38.280
So the intent was to fix situations like that,

13:38.280 --> 13:40.360
but I think it ended up causing more confusion.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.880
And clearly, the folks actually downstream implementing

13:42.880 --> 13:46.600
Pulse at the user-facing level kind of think the same thing.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.320
Yeah, that makes sense.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.200
And there's other nice improvements in there,

13:50.200 --> 13:53.040
and I guess one highlighted area that's

13:53.040 --> 13:54.520
probably most relevant to the audience

13:54.520 --> 13:57.400
is USB headset support has been improved.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.720
Various vendors specifically seem

13:58.720 --> 14:00.120
to have gotten improvements as well.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.720
Yeah, isn't that nice to see?

14:01.720 --> 14:02.640
Yeah, I guess so.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.440
I mean, you've got to figure not only are people using it

14:04.440 --> 14:06.240
obviously to play games, but a lot of people

14:06.240 --> 14:09.440
are probably using those headsets to do virtual meetings

14:09.440 --> 14:10.840
and whatnot as well.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.080
I know I sure am.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.560
I actually have been thinking about it with my big headset

14:14.560 --> 14:16.600
just because I like the way it feels and all of that,

14:16.600 --> 14:18.080
but I don't know.

14:18.080 --> 14:21.160
I feel silly with it on video.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.080
That's my only kind of slow-my-roll thing

14:23.080 --> 14:23.840
on that one.

14:23.840 --> 14:27.600
But maybe I'll just get over it, because after all, it

14:27.600 --> 14:30.720
does look very cool.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.960
Linode.com slash unplugged.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.960
Go there to support the show and get a 100.

14:34.960 --> 14:35.560
Wait, hold on.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.080
What?

14:36.080 --> 14:37.840
I got to check this.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.600
$100 60-day credit.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.720
Who authorized this?

14:40.720 --> 14:42.240
That's too much.

14:42.240 --> 14:45.440
Wes, did you authorize $100 60-day credit for new accounts?

14:45.440 --> 14:48.200
I mean, it just sounds like such a good deal, right?

14:48.200 --> 14:49.240
Who wouldn't want that?

14:49.240 --> 14:51.560
You move the soundboard guy to the deals job,

14:51.560 --> 14:52.720
and now this is what we get.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.000
Well, I mean, there's no way they're

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
going to keep this going.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.520
So you better go to linode.com slash unplug.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.200
They're our cloud hosting provider.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.680
They've been around since 2003 as one of the first companies

15:01.680 --> 15:03.480
in cloud computing, and they started

15:03.480 --> 15:05.040
because they freaking love Linux.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.560
They saw where things were going in the kernel in regards

15:07.560 --> 15:09.760
to virtualization and said, hey, you know what?

15:09.760 --> 15:12.000
Hey, we could probably build a business around that.

15:12.000 --> 15:12.880
I can relate with that.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.840
I mean, that's how we saw with podcasting 13 years ago.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.480
We saw where the technology was going.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.120
You said, hey, you know what?

15:19.120 --> 15:21.040
I could go talk about Linux on that.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.280
And I can relate with that.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.800
Now they're still the largest independently-owned cloud

15:24.800 --> 15:25.480
provider.

15:25.480 --> 15:26.840
They started with a love for Linux,

15:26.840 --> 15:28.000
and now here, look at them.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.360
And they've got fantastic customer service.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.960
And if you don't know a lot about Linux

15:31.960 --> 15:34.520
or you've never really ran a server before,

15:34.520 --> 15:35.680
they got you covered.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.440
I just deployed an Azurecast server.

15:38.440 --> 15:40.760
And Azurecast, do you remember how we say that, Wes?

15:40.760 --> 15:41.400
Azurecast.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.240
Let's go with Azurecast.

15:42.240 --> 15:42.800
Azurecast.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.520
Yeah, yeah, with the role there.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.800
And I deployed it in like 10 seconds on Linode.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.400
And I'm thinking maybe in the future,

15:48.400 --> 15:51.240
we're going to have this cool, new, upgraded live stream.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.720
And I've been on the fence if I was

15:52.720 --> 15:56.520
going to do that forever, for like a year now.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.520
But with Linode, and it was just like one click,

15:58.520 --> 15:59.320
I thought, well, why not?

15:59.320 --> 16:00.520
But then once it started deploying,

16:00.520 --> 16:01.720
I was like, oh, of course.

16:01.720 --> 16:02.920
Of course this is how it works.

16:02.920 --> 16:03.840
Linode is awesome.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.760
So when you're deploying it, whenever they can,

16:05.760 --> 16:07.720
they'll give you multiple choices of distros.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.360
So it's a one-click application deployment,

16:09.360 --> 16:10.520
and you choose the base OS.

16:10.520 --> 16:14.360
So I chose Ubuntu 20.04, which matches our other Linodes.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.400
And now it's up and running.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.880
On a dedicated machine, I decided to go dedicated CPU,

16:18.880 --> 16:21.960
since it's going to be doing multiple MP3 streaming codes.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.720
And I positioned it in Dallas, Texas,

16:23.720 --> 16:26.280
because I feel like for the majority of the audience

16:26.280 --> 16:27.880
that will be streaming it during the daytime,

16:27.880 --> 16:29.240
that's going to be US audience.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.680
And so probably should centralize it as much as I can.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.800
And they've got 11 data centers all over the world.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.180
So you can pick which one's close to you or, in my case,

16:36.180 --> 16:37.800
close to the client or the audience.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.400
They've got native SSD storage that's

16:39.400 --> 16:41.640
blazing fast 40-gigabit network connections

16:41.640 --> 16:43.680
and a totally easy-to-use dashboard that

16:43.680 --> 16:44.800
makes all of this possible.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.200
But generally, just one click away to go deep.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.980
If you know what you're doing, if you

16:48.980 --> 16:51.800
know what a mount point is, you can go deeper.

16:51.800 --> 16:52.480
It's great.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.360
And that's what I love about it.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.060
Not like the entry-level service providers

16:55.060 --> 16:57.000
that try to block all that stuff off.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.200
Plus, they have object storage, Kubernetes support,

16:59.200 --> 17:02.800
Terraform support, node balancers, built-in firewall.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.920
It's pretty feature-packed.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.680
And that $100 credit's going to get you really far

17:06.680 --> 17:08.520
with their base rig starting at $5 a month.

17:08.520 --> 17:11.120
So go to lanode.com slash unplugged.

17:11.120 --> 17:14.040
Go there, support the show, and get yourself $100 credit.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.840
And go in there, let them know you heard about it on the show.

17:15.840 --> 17:16.400
That helps, too.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.400
Maybe share it with your friend.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.160
I don't know.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.040
Maybe print it out and put it up all over the town

17:21.040 --> 17:23.560
on the post saying, server missing.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.240
Go to lanode.com slash unplugged if you see it.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.680
No, that's not my best idea.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.720
That's not my best idea.

17:28.720 --> 17:29.680
Maybe you should tweet me and let me

17:29.680 --> 17:31.600
know what you're doing with your lanodes.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.120
Tweet me at quizlast and let me know.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.440
Lanode.com slash unplugged.

17:35.440 --> 17:39.840
Well, while we're talking about new stuff,

17:39.840 --> 17:44.160
let's mention kind of a nice win for LVFS

17:44.160 --> 17:47.800
and, of course, for any users that use LVFS to upgrade.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.480
More importantly.

17:49.480 --> 17:52.320
ASUS is now offering their first motherboard firmware,

17:52.320 --> 17:55.400
which looks like more to come now that the groundwork has

17:55.400 --> 17:56.400
been laid down.

17:56.400 --> 18:01.880
The lucky board in question is the P11C-C-4L,

18:01.880 --> 18:04.440
which is a workstation or server board.

18:04.440 --> 18:07.840
It's an eATX board for the Intel Xeon ePlatform.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.080
So maybe not one you've got on hand,

18:10.080 --> 18:11.840
but you've got to start somewhere.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.680
Actually, it would be a really solid workstation.

18:13.680 --> 18:16.080
And if I had built a workstation around that motherboard,

18:16.080 --> 18:17.840
I'd be feeling real good right now

18:17.840 --> 18:19.920
that I was getting firmware updates via LVFS.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.320
And you know that's just the beginning.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.720
There's going to be more.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.520
And it's a nice little win for the project.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.520
Also, fwupd, the front end that you

18:26.520 --> 18:28.720
see on your machine that communicates with that service,

18:28.720 --> 18:30.400
got a nice update.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.520
There's various things you can go read in the show notes

18:32.520 --> 18:33.120
if you want.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.160
But the one thing that I like to see in here

18:35.160 --> 18:39.240
is a plug-in has been developed for the Pinebook Pro.

18:39.240 --> 18:44.040
Although, Huzy in here notes that it needs further work

18:44.040 --> 18:45.520
before it'll actually work correctly.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.880
But I like that it's there and that it's possible.

18:47.880 --> 18:48.320
Yeah, right?

18:48.320 --> 18:50.040
I mean, OK, you need a little help from the vendor

18:50.040 --> 18:52.640
to make sure you can figure out which keyboard layout is

18:52.640 --> 18:56.440
installed, getting the touchpad version worked out correctly.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.840
But if you've got the bones, that's

18:58.840 --> 19:01.160
the best place to be to add on these little things

19:01.160 --> 19:02.240
to make it really work.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.480
You talking about the doctor?

19:03.480 --> 19:05.320
I sure am.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.640
It's nice to see this thing hum right along, isn't it?

19:07.640 --> 19:08.880
If you think about it, a couple of years ago,

19:08.880 --> 19:10.280
none of this existed.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.360
And the idea that you wouldn't have

19:11.360 --> 19:13.520
to be booting into this sketchy DOS boot

19:13.520 --> 19:17.200
disk or, God forbid, Windows to update your firmware,

19:17.200 --> 19:20.320
I just expected that and kind of never updated my firmware.

19:20.320 --> 19:23.160
Now I'm just in home software, and I'm updating my firmware

19:23.160 --> 19:24.600
anytime I see one.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.000
Well, this next update is just one I wanted to mention.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.600
It came out over the weekend, and we've

19:29.600 --> 19:33.760
had mostly just cloudy skies here in the Pacific Northwest,

19:33.760 --> 19:37.080
which is nice, actually, because it acts as nature's blanket,

19:37.080 --> 19:38.560
and it keeps us warm.

19:38.560 --> 19:41.160
So I don't mind the clouds at all in the evening.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.440
But every now and then, there's been a break, and just

19:43.440 --> 19:44.800
the most brilliant stars.

19:44.800 --> 19:48.720
And so I have kind of taken up an interest in those night sky

19:48.720 --> 19:50.560
apps for the phone.

19:50.560 --> 19:51.940
We kind of can pan the phone around

19:51.940 --> 19:54.600
and see what constellations and what nots you're looking at.

19:54.600 --> 19:58.200
And K-Stars is among one of a handful

19:58.200 --> 20:01.520
of just really fantastic apps to do this for your Linux desktop.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.620
And version 3.50 came out this last weekend.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.280
And this release marks a significant milestone

20:07.280 --> 20:09.640
for K-Stars because they've done the integration of Stellar

20:09.640 --> 20:12.200
Solver, which, get ready for this,

20:12.200 --> 20:14.600
is a cross-platform sex tractor.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.320
Just what you need, right?

20:16.320 --> 20:17.120
I can relate.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.240
Let me tell you, Wes.

20:18.240 --> 20:20.280
Let me tell you.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.980
It also integrates with astronomy.net's

20:21.980 --> 20:24.800
based internal astro-metric solver, which

20:24.800 --> 20:26.240
this is getting serious, Wes.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.160
I'm hoping maybe you can explain some of this to me.

20:28.160 --> 20:28.660
Yeah, OK.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.360
So there's already some tools out there

20:30.360 --> 20:32.800
to do these things that you might need to do if you're

20:32.800 --> 20:33.800
an amateur astronomer.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.840
You're trying to make sense of the night sky

20:35.840 --> 20:40.440
and plot things correctly, including astrometry.net.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.400
But that application is command line only

20:43.400 --> 20:45.360
and has some rather nasty dependencies,

20:45.360 --> 20:46.580
depending on what system you're on.

20:46.580 --> 20:49.080
Or maybe you're just more focused on staring up at the sky

20:49.080 --> 20:50.880
and appreciating the beauty of the universe

20:50.880 --> 20:53.760
or about tracking down LibJPG.

20:53.760 --> 20:54.840
I can appreciate that.

20:54.840 --> 20:55.760
Sure.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.040
So now, with this integration with Stellar Solver,

20:58.040 --> 21:00.160
you don't have to fuss with any of that stuff.

21:00.160 --> 21:03.120
You just get K-Stars installed, and you're good to go.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.320
Yeah, that is really nice and simple.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.920
Because this is like one of those great little demos

21:07.920 --> 21:12.800
when your family member or a kid even has questions or yourself.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.960
And you just want to just sit down and get the answer

21:14.960 --> 21:17.200
and kind of demonstrate some of the cool open-source software

21:17.200 --> 21:18.160
that's out there.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.960
So some real significant retooling went inside K-Stars

21:20.960 --> 21:22.160
to integrate this stuff.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.160
And they feel like it's going to be

21:24.160 --> 21:25.600
a big benefit for their end users.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.880
They seem very excited about it.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.220
They put a lot of work into it.

21:28.220 --> 21:31.440
And it's just a cool piece of software to remind you.

21:31.440 --> 21:34.960
There's a big universe up there, Wes, and it's open source.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.200
There's also an Android version.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.400
Yeah, there's an Android version,

21:38.400 --> 21:40.440
which I'm actually just going to have to give that a try.

21:40.440 --> 21:42.960
Because I've got a couple of apps for trying to identify,

21:42.960 --> 21:46.040
hey, just what star is that, or planet up there?

21:46.040 --> 21:48.120
But all of them are free Android apps.

21:48.120 --> 21:49.600
And therefore, terrible.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.880
But you still haven't explained to me what a sex tractor is.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.160
Maybe when you're older.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.760
And also, I'm not even sure I know

21:54.760 --> 21:58.320
what an astronomic plane is.

21:58.320 --> 22:00.560
I read through this project announcement

22:00.560 --> 22:03.760
and realized, man, there's a lot I don't know.

22:03.760 --> 22:07.560
So apparently, you need an astronomic plate solver.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.240
And I didn't even know astronomic plates

22:09.240 --> 22:10.680
were a problem.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.200
Yeah, well, I think a lot of this

22:12.200 --> 22:13.700
comes down to when you're trying to match up

22:13.700 --> 22:16.000
what are you looking at and match it to existing things

22:16.000 --> 22:17.480
in star catalogs, say.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.160
So here I am in the universe.

22:19.160 --> 22:20.600
Here's what I'm looking at.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.880
How do I find out actually where that is on the larger

22:22.880 --> 22:25.040
picture of the night sky and what I can catalog

22:25.040 --> 22:26.840
and know as a reference is there?

22:26.840 --> 22:31.000
All right, well, let's clean it up around here a little bit

22:31.000 --> 22:33.240
and do some housekeeping.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.920
Shout out to the Luplug who had, sounds

22:35.920 --> 22:39.620
like a very productive jellyfin bugathon this last Sunday.

22:39.620 --> 22:42.480
They found some bugs and proved some documentation

22:42.480 --> 22:45.580
and increased distro compatibility.

22:45.580 --> 22:48.520
So like, wow, congratulations, you guys.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.560
That sounds like it was a big success.

22:50.560 --> 22:54.360
And I want to extend an invitation to anyone else

22:54.360 --> 22:57.920
in the open source community who would like to participate

22:57.920 --> 22:58.640
in our bugathons.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.000
We have a dedicated matrix channel.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.960
And you can join that matrix channel

23:02.960 --> 23:05.640
on our jupitabroadcasting.com matrix server

23:05.640 --> 23:07.880
and raise your hand in there.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.680
And they'll jump on it, and they'll help organize it.

23:10.680 --> 23:11.840
And then we'll promote it on the show here

23:11.840 --> 23:13.400
so we get some people to show up and help

23:13.400 --> 23:14.640
get a lot of eyes on it.

23:14.640 --> 23:19.480
The idea behind this is to help developers in a way that

23:19.480 --> 23:21.880
is within their bandwidth.

23:21.880 --> 23:25.200
We don't want to just organize hundreds of people on the show

23:25.200 --> 23:27.760
to just throw a bunch of bug reports at a project

23:27.760 --> 23:29.960
and inundate them with a bunch of technical debt

23:29.960 --> 23:32.640
that they can never address and burn them out.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.880
We want to work with developers on their terms.

23:35.880 --> 23:38.160
So they've set aside time.

23:38.160 --> 23:41.200
They're ready to work in an interactive high bandwidth

23:41.200 --> 23:43.640
environment where they can communicate in real time.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.480
And they're there to address the issues that come up

23:45.480 --> 23:46.880
and answer the questions.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.160
And there's a set time window.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.080
And when it's done, they go back to their life.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.200
And this, I think, was a great example

23:52.200 --> 23:55.200
of pulling that off because the developers there, several of them

23:55.200 --> 23:57.500
were there at the same time with our community.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.520
We had a lot of community participation.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.840
And big results, I think, came from it.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.040
So good work, guys.

24:03.040 --> 24:03.600
Good work.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.160
Way more productive than we were.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.420
Yeah, well, you know?

24:06.420 --> 24:09.060
And I think this could go, this could even

24:09.060 --> 24:12.400
be a situation where if multiple developers participate

24:12.400 --> 24:15.200
in the Bugathon and they join that matrix room, well,

24:15.200 --> 24:17.320
some of them are sticking around afterwards.

24:17.320 --> 24:20.680
And so all of a sudden, you may have a resource where projects

24:20.680 --> 24:22.560
that aren't necessarily related all of a sudden

24:22.560 --> 24:24.560
have a common chat room that they're talking in

24:24.560 --> 24:27.940
and solving problems and have a community they can call upon

24:27.940 --> 24:29.160
when they need some eyeballs.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.080
It could go somewhere.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.200
And it could all be on their terms,

24:31.200 --> 24:33.160
which I think is the beautiful thing about it.

24:33.160 --> 24:35.760
So keep your ears peeled, whatever the saying goes.

24:35.760 --> 24:38.640
Keep your ears at the ready that don't know.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.480
Your balls ready for future announcements on Bugathons.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.240
And if you're interested, do contact our Luplug.

24:44.240 --> 24:45.400
Things are in the works, too.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.900
So be sure you're subscribed to the Jupiter Broadcasting All

24:47.900 --> 24:50.200
Shows feed if you haven't already.

24:50.200 --> 24:54.520
And if you're looking to sponsor on this here podcast in 2021,

24:54.520 --> 24:55.520
give me an email.

24:55.520 --> 24:56.520
You know, whatever.

24:56.520 --> 24:57.280
I'll take it.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.600
I mean, if you're going to give me money,

24:58.600 --> 24:59.240
you can send me an email.

24:59.240 --> 24:59.760
It's fine.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.840
Chris at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

25:01.840 --> 25:04.680
You go there, and maybe you'd be a good fit for our audience.

25:04.680 --> 25:05.480
Let's talk.

25:05.480 --> 25:06.280
Let's talk.

25:06.280 --> 25:07.280
Let's talk.

25:07.280 --> 25:09.440
Could be a good year with you and me together.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.600
And that is the housekeeping.

25:11.600 --> 25:14.640
All right.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.440
So I'm going to share a URL in the chat room.

25:17.440 --> 25:20.600
Is there an easy way for them to do this live really quick?

25:20.600 --> 25:24.920
Because what we want to talk about today is Waveshare.

25:24.920 --> 25:27.560
And I'm going to put you on the spot, Wes.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.960
Can you explain kind of what Waveshare is

25:29.960 --> 25:33.280
and why it's the coolest retro new thing?

25:33.280 --> 25:35.480
Well, it's retro because of the way it sounds.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.920
We'll have a sample of that in a moment, I guess.

25:37.920 --> 25:42.200
But Waveshare is a neat project we found over on GitHub.

25:42.200 --> 25:45.880
It's peer-to-peer file sharing using WebRTC,

25:45.880 --> 25:49.840
but with signaling performed through sound.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.320
This is really great.

25:51.320 --> 25:54.000
So think about this as a way to transmit information.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.760
I'm going to play an example of it in the show right now.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.880
And if you have Waveshare set up and you

25:59.880 --> 26:01.360
play this portion of the show back,

26:01.360 --> 26:02.800
you will receive data from it.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.440
It will decode data for you.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.240
Here's an example.

26:05.240 --> 26:06.360
This is the slow mode.

26:06.360 --> 26:14.680
A little unpleasant on the ears, but it

26:14.680 --> 26:17.240
is magic to my old man ears in the sense

26:17.240 --> 26:20.280
that it completely reminds me of a modem.

26:20.280 --> 26:21.600
Yeah, it sure does.

26:21.600 --> 26:25.000
And it's kind of just a neat technology in general.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.240
Now, Waveshare, the project itself is even more impressive

26:28.240 --> 26:31.080
because it basically lets you set up a WebRTC connection

26:31.080 --> 26:35.320
with no server side involved at all, just peer-to-peer.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.320
And it's powered by this underlying technology

26:37.320 --> 26:41.200
that can encode data in these audio tones.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.600
Yeah, it's like a modulator demodulator.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.800
Yeah, the current approach uses a multi-frequency, frequency

26:47.800 --> 26:50.560
shift keying modulation scheme.

26:50.560 --> 26:54.160
The data to be transmitted is first split into 4-bit chunks.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.520
And then at each time slice, three bytes

26:56.520 --> 27:01.200
are transmitted using six tones, one tone for each 4-bit chunk.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.600
And you can kind of hear that as it

27:02.600 --> 27:05.120
alternates between the tones in the sample.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.960
Yeah, and we'll have a link in the show notes

27:06.960 --> 27:10.200
that has a web-embedded version of this

27:10.200 --> 27:11.400
that you could play with.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.960
But it also has a really pretty straightforward command line

27:13.960 --> 27:14.880
interface, too.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.280
Yeah, so the web version is a little more involved

27:17.280 --> 27:20.440
because it lets you set up a connection that, if you've

27:20.440 --> 27:22.880
got your own network going, it uses

27:22.880 --> 27:24.520
sound to establish the connection.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.080
So you've got two laptops, you've

27:26.080 --> 27:28.760
got their microphones on, you've got their speakers ready.

27:28.760 --> 27:31.880
You can just connect them via sound and the local network

27:31.880 --> 27:34.360
and then swap files back and forth.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.480
But underneath that is this little technology

27:36.480 --> 27:38.240
to actually just encode and decode

27:38.240 --> 27:40.440
from these fun audio samples.

27:40.440 --> 27:42.840
And Waveshare's got a nice little command line client,

27:42.840 --> 27:43.920
super easy to get going.

27:43.920 --> 27:45.600
You just clone the repo.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.100
They've got build instructions right

27:47.100 --> 27:48.720
in the README, which, of course, we'll

27:48.720 --> 27:50.720
have linked in the show notes.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.120
And then it just prompts you.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.840
You can enter text to encode it.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.480
Or if you just leave it open, it starts

27:55.480 --> 27:58.600
listening on your microphone, you play back the podcast,

27:58.600 --> 28:00.520
and you'll get Chris's little secret link.

28:00.520 --> 28:03.200
Yeah, there is a secret message that we have embedded.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.680
So I played for you the slow version.

28:05.680 --> 28:10.000
There is also a fast version that, well, is faster.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.440
And not like a ton, but I'll play it

28:12.440 --> 28:14.080
so you can hear the difference here.

28:14.080 --> 28:18.080
And you could also capture this and then get the secret message.

28:18.080 --> 28:36.480
Oh, hey, oh, I completely forgot to mention this,

28:36.480 --> 28:39.360
but I'm doing a Black Friday sale for the Unplugged Core

28:39.360 --> 28:40.040
Contributors.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.720
Random plug, if you want it to become one.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.960
I'm taking two bucks off, unpluggedcore.com.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.760
Keep the show independent, help reduce the ad load needed,

28:48.760 --> 28:51.800
and get one of two feeds, limited ad feed or full

28:51.800 --> 28:55.360
live stream, no cuts, no edits, all the nitty gritties.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.800
You get to hear how Chris tries to pronounce it,

28:57.800 --> 28:59.000
the really embarrassing part.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.760
That's probably true.

29:00.760 --> 29:04.640
It turns out several people, at least, people tell me,

29:04.640 --> 29:07.080
are listening to the totally unedited feed

29:07.080 --> 29:08.720
because when we recorded early, we

29:08.720 --> 29:10.300
started getting feedback into the show

29:10.300 --> 29:12.160
before we'd even posted the episode.

29:12.160 --> 29:13.440
This is like, that was weird.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.600
But that's totally a thing.

29:14.600 --> 29:17.600
Like, if you sign up and become a core contributor,

29:17.600 --> 29:19.080
you can get the live feed.

29:19.080 --> 29:22.480
And we try to post that as soon as possible after we record.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.360
So if we record on a Sunday, it means

29:24.360 --> 29:26.040
you're going to get the show on a Sunday.

29:26.040 --> 29:27.120
I don't know if that works better for you.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.800
But when that comes up, which may come up from time to time,

29:29.800 --> 29:31.200
that's a nice perk of getting that feed.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.640
And right now, if you use the promo code BlackFriday,

29:33.640 --> 29:36.200
all one word, you use that coupon code BlackFriday,

29:36.200 --> 29:38.360
it'll take two bucks off.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.200
And I'm not going to do that very often.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.720
So take advantage of that.

29:41.720 --> 29:43.760
And you can just go, I mean, I don't know.

29:43.760 --> 29:44.320
I haven't done it.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.080
You can just go to unpluggedcore.com.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.160
And when you're checking out, put that Black Friday coupon

29:48.160 --> 29:49.080
code in there.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.220
Anyways, that was totally random and unplanned.

29:51.220 --> 29:52.960
Back to Waveshare.

29:52.960 --> 29:55.840
It's fun in like a spy sense, Wes.

29:55.840 --> 30:00.240
Like, it makes me fantasize about sending secret messages

30:00.240 --> 30:02.000
at the end of every episode of the podcast.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.360
Like, we could fire off a little tone,

30:04.360 --> 30:06.700
and it would give the audience like an extra little bonus

30:06.700 --> 30:08.600
link that if they wanted to run through a thing,

30:08.600 --> 30:10.140
it could give them a special thing.

30:10.140 --> 30:12.360
Like, it's all these fun ways to actually use it.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.840
But I don't know how practical it is.

30:14.840 --> 30:17.400
Have you given thoughts to how you could practically use this?

30:17.400 --> 30:21.000
Yeah, I don't know that we need it especially often

30:21.000 --> 30:22.480
in our current day-to-day world.

30:22.480 --> 30:25.180
But I think it's an interesting proof of concept.

30:25.180 --> 30:28.480
It's a neat hack with some existing technology.

30:28.480 --> 30:31.160
And it's kind of convenient that this can all

30:31.160 --> 30:34.200
live on a totally serverless, just a static web page.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.100
So if you wanted to be able to quickly share files

30:36.100 --> 30:37.400
with devices, you could have this

30:37.400 --> 30:38.880
going on your local network.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.320
There's instructions in the GitHub

30:40.320 --> 30:43.440
for if you want to get this all built and host it yourself.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.080
Totally possible.

30:45.080 --> 30:47.000
And then it's all powered by WebRTC,

30:47.000 --> 30:49.440
which is just really neat because it

30:49.440 --> 30:52.560
turns your browser into this powerful communications agent.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.820
So not only are we using that to actually send audio data back

30:55.820 --> 30:58.020
and forth right now, but here on the browser,

30:58.020 --> 31:00.280
you can use it for just sending regular data,

31:00.280 --> 31:01.940
transmitting files, whatever you need.

31:01.940 --> 31:03.580
And you don't have to worry about a larger connection

31:03.580 --> 31:05.700
to the internet to poke holes through firewalls

31:05.700 --> 31:08.440
to get everything working or have to set up and maintain

31:08.440 --> 31:11.000
some sort of handshake server that does the signaling

31:11.000 --> 31:13.400
and sets up the WebRTC connection for you.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.520
As long as you've got speakers and a microphone,

31:15.520 --> 31:16.440
this can do it.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.400
Yeah, that's the fun thing about it, I think.

31:18.400 --> 31:24.120
Smartphone, computer, podcast playback.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.560
So that's the thing I think that's really fun.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.360
So that's called Wave Share.

31:28.360 --> 31:30.320
We'll have a link in the show notes.

31:30.320 --> 31:33.400
And you could do the three different speeds if you want.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.940
I think the easiest way to use it

31:34.940 --> 31:36.200
is how we're probably using it.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.900
The most straightforward is to transmit

31:37.900 --> 31:40.160
a small bit of information, like a URL.

31:40.160 --> 31:43.760
And that URL then sends you to the larger bit of information.

31:43.760 --> 31:47.120
Because otherwise, I mean, could you

31:47.120 --> 31:49.300
do a base encode of some kind for the image?

31:49.300 --> 31:51.280
And could you actually transmit the image, Wes?

31:51.280 --> 31:52.560
Yeah, absolutely.

31:52.560 --> 31:55.600
You just have to be willing to listen back to the audio.

31:55.600 --> 31:56.880
Yeah.

31:56.880 --> 32:00.800
There is an even faster speed that we haven't tried yet.

32:00.800 --> 32:01.600
Oh, really?

32:01.600 --> 32:02.560
Like a hyper speed?

32:02.560 --> 32:04.440
Ultrasonic, they call it.

32:04.440 --> 32:05.920
But is it actually ultrasonic?

32:05.920 --> 32:07.480
We'll have to find out.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.560
Man, computers, how do they work?

32:09.560 --> 32:10.360
How do they work?

32:10.360 --> 32:11.600
I think magnets.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.520
ByteBitton, you have a vision of how this could be used.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.480
And I like it.

32:15.480 --> 32:18.440
Yeah, so not all phones have NFC.

32:18.440 --> 32:22.560
And you have got the royalty fees

32:22.560 --> 32:25.600
for having NFC implemented in there

32:25.600 --> 32:30.320
for headsets and other Bluetooth kind of devices.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.920
So well, headsets usually already have a microphone

32:32.920 --> 32:33.560
in them.

32:33.560 --> 32:38.240
So you have the app that sends a pairing code.

32:38.240 --> 32:42.080
And that way, it's just setting your headphone in pairing mode.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.200
It starts listening.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.040
And your app sends that audio.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.480
And you've got a pair.

32:46.480 --> 32:49.560
That's also something they use with Furbys, for example.

32:49.560 --> 32:54.800
The newer generation back then had a chirp app kind of thing.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.240
And I also remember something that

32:57.240 --> 33:01.040
was developed on Android where you could send messages

33:01.040 --> 33:04.880
with a sort of chirp from Android phone to Android phone

33:04.880 --> 33:06.680
using this kind of technology.

33:06.680 --> 33:10.160
Yeah, what a great way to pair information or maybe even

33:10.160 --> 33:13.840
transmit Wi-Fi passwords between two local devices

33:13.840 --> 33:16.160
if they're trusted that isn't something that's audible

33:16.160 --> 33:18.520
that anybody could hear.

33:18.520 --> 33:20.240
It just should take off everywhere.

33:20.240 --> 33:22.160
This seems like it'd be great on smartphones.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.640
Great way to pair a Linux watch to a Linux phone.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.100
Yeah, they're already listening to everything

33:26.100 --> 33:27.440
you're doing anyways, right?

33:27.440 --> 33:28.840
Why not make it useful?

33:28.840 --> 33:32.040
Look at you busting out the bacon there.

33:32.040 --> 33:32.640
I like it.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.120
I thought we should share it with you guys.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.000
It's a super fun one.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.520
And it's an opportunity that we could put it in the show.

33:38.520 --> 33:40.800
Yeah, so just to rehash the easiest way

33:40.800 --> 33:44.040
to go find the secret little message,

33:44.040 --> 33:46.520
go check out the repo, build the command line tool,

33:46.520 --> 33:48.920
and play the podcast right back at it.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.880
And you get the secret bonus content

33:53.880 --> 33:58.240
that reveals the real star of the show, I think.

33:58.240 --> 33:59.560
Indeed it does.

33:59.560 --> 34:01.880
Putting us to shame.

34:01.880 --> 34:02.680
All right, Wes.

34:02.680 --> 34:05.480
Well, before we get to the picks,

34:05.480 --> 34:07.200
let's do a little bit of feedback.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.600
I think we've got enough time to get to a couple of them.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.040
And this one got my interest.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.320
I didn't get a chance to read this one before the show.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.280
But it's from Eric.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.000
And it's about his wonderful workstation,

34:16.000 --> 34:17.920
which that gets my interest.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.520
He says, in episode 380, you guys

34:19.520 --> 34:22.720
asked about our setup and workloads.

34:22.720 --> 34:25.400
The company I work for develops a desktop software package

34:25.400 --> 34:27.780
for image analysis and quantification.

34:27.780 --> 34:30.360
It has some really awesome 3D rendering capabilities

34:30.360 --> 34:32.440
and support for deep learning image processing

34:32.440 --> 34:33.840
with TensorFlow.

34:33.840 --> 34:35.200
I have a pretty sweet workstation

34:35.200 --> 34:37.200
to develop and test our own software.

34:37.200 --> 34:42.240
I'm running an AMD Threadripper 2970 WX with 24 cores

34:42.240 --> 34:48.360
and 128 gigabytes of RAM, one NVIDIA Quattro RTX 8000,

34:48.360 --> 34:54.720
and two RTX 2080 Supers with an NVLink bridge.

34:54.720 --> 34:55.720
Whoa.

34:55.720 --> 34:58.840
I just got to breathe that in for a second.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.160
I got to just sit with that for a moment.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.400
Wow.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.280
He goes on to say, I admit this workstation is

35:04.280 --> 35:05.960
super overkill for software development,

35:05.960 --> 35:08.360
but I recently managed to convince my managers

35:08.360 --> 35:11.200
that we need to sell a VDI, a virtual desktop infrastructure

35:11.200 --> 35:13.720
solution, to our customers rather than trying to get

35:13.720 --> 35:16.480
their IT department to set it up.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.600
I've been developing a framework for easily deploying

35:18.600 --> 35:20.520
a local cloud system with VDI that

35:20.520 --> 35:21.920
meets our customers' needs.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.720
And I'm using Terraform, which Wes mentioned

35:23.720 --> 35:26.160
in the past episode, to reallocate resources

35:26.160 --> 35:28.520
from one VM to another without having

35:28.520 --> 35:31.400
to code the API calls to the hypervisor myself.

35:31.400 --> 35:31.920
Yeah.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.120
By the way, that's why one of the reasons

35:33.120 --> 35:36.880
I mentioned in our Linode read that it has Terraform support,

35:36.880 --> 35:38.600
because that kind of crap is amazing.

35:38.600 --> 35:39.560
Exactly.

35:39.560 --> 35:40.400
What do you call it, Wes?

35:40.400 --> 35:42.040
You call it that infrastructure by code?

35:42.040 --> 35:43.000
Is that what you call it?

35:43.000 --> 35:43.680
Yeah, right?

35:43.680 --> 35:44.800
Well, don't you want it as code?

35:44.800 --> 35:45.640
Everything code.

35:45.640 --> 35:46.720
That sounds fancy.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.380
He says, he goes on to say, I recently

35:48.380 --> 35:50.680
added the RTX 8000 to my setup and started

35:50.680 --> 35:52.160
playing with GPU pass-through.

35:52.160 --> 35:52.840
Oh, yeah.

35:52.840 --> 35:57.240
And also NVIDIA's virtual GPU capabilities,

35:57.240 --> 35:59.160
which Terraform supports with VMware.

35:59.160 --> 35:59.760
Wow.

35:59.760 --> 36:03.080
It's really amazing nowadays how much one person can automate

36:03.080 --> 36:05.700
with great tools like Packer, Terraform, and Ansible,

36:05.700 --> 36:07.440
even if it's on corporate premises.

36:07.440 --> 36:10.960
Sadly, I'll soon have to ship out my three video cards

36:10.960 --> 36:12.880
to the head office so that our staff can

36:12.880 --> 36:14.840
use my local cloud solution and integrate that

36:14.840 --> 36:16.680
into their real workflows.

36:16.680 --> 36:22.520
I'll be left with my humble GTX 1060.

36:22.520 --> 36:23.920
Oh, wow.

36:23.920 --> 36:27.160
You know, I've been thinking a lot about my future laptop.

36:27.160 --> 36:29.720
Because I think everybody that listened to the show

36:29.720 --> 36:32.600
for a while knows that I threw Linux Academy, then

36:32.600 --> 36:33.520
a Cloud Guru.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.560
I had a ThinkPad that I thought was really great.

36:35.560 --> 36:38.920
But when that wrapped up, that was a company machine.

36:38.920 --> 36:41.360
I no longer had access to it and had to send that back.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.280
And I've been thinking for a long time,

36:43.280 --> 36:45.200
like, what will I go to next?

36:45.200 --> 36:46.880
And I've been really watching the market.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.920
And it has crossed my mind a few times

36:49.920 --> 36:52.060
that one thing that is just inescapable when

36:52.060 --> 36:53.480
you're pricing a laptop and you're

36:53.480 --> 36:55.440
looking at speccing a laptop is you

36:55.440 --> 36:59.160
could get so much more with that same money in a workstation.

36:59.160 --> 37:02.320
And that's a hard pill to swallow.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.520
But when you need mobile, you need mobile.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.800
And there's just no getting around it.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.320
But yeah, that has been something

37:08.320 --> 37:10.720
I've been watching closely and thinking,

37:10.720 --> 37:12.560
I'll see what Apple does with the ARM machines.

37:12.560 --> 37:15.160
You'll see where we get with the ThinkPad X ones that

37:15.160 --> 37:16.280
come with Fedora.

37:16.280 --> 37:18.780
And then System76 just updated the Galago.

37:18.780 --> 37:20.320
So I've been sitting back and watching

37:20.320 --> 37:22.800
and hearing Eric talk about his workstation

37:22.800 --> 37:27.160
and knowing in the back of my mind what I could do with that.

37:27.160 --> 37:28.280
Do you want to read the next one?

37:28.280 --> 37:29.000
Yeah, sure.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.360
OK, so next feedback.

37:30.360 --> 37:33.920
Andrew writes into the show asking about container host

37:33.920 --> 37:38.600
choices, something near and dear to your heart there, Chris.

37:38.600 --> 37:42.900
He's looking to repurpose an HP Elite Desk G4 Mini,

37:42.900 --> 37:46.160
i7, 16 gigs of RAM, 500 gig NVMe,

37:46.160 --> 37:49.040
nothing to shrink at all.

37:49.040 --> 37:53.880
As a container management host for home automation services.

37:53.880 --> 37:56.720
And he writes that he'd like to use something that would allow

37:56.720 --> 37:59.520
him to avoid manually rebuilding in the future

37:59.520 --> 38:01.560
should anything go wrong.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.960
But he doesn't have any experience with things

38:03.960 --> 38:06.800
like NixOS or Ansible.

38:06.800 --> 38:09.160
What would our recommended approach be?

38:09.160 --> 38:12.920
OK, I know you're probably going to recommend something

38:12.920 --> 38:16.360
that's more practical and would be a better skill that

38:16.360 --> 38:18.560
could be used for employment opportunities and whatnot.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.160
So I'm going to go the other way.

38:20.160 --> 38:21.560
And I'm going to say, Andrew, you

38:21.560 --> 38:23.440
may be just kind of reading this email,

38:23.440 --> 38:25.400
kind of reading where you are at technically,

38:25.400 --> 38:27.120
just between the lines.

38:27.120 --> 38:29.320
There's a real easy solution depending on what you need.

38:29.320 --> 38:32.520
And it's called Home Assistant, my friend.

38:32.520 --> 38:35.640
You can get the entire Home Assistant stack, which

38:35.640 --> 38:39.560
includes a supervisor container which can manage and install

38:39.560 --> 38:42.560
machines, but also more importantly, snapshot,

38:42.560 --> 38:46.240
restore them, back them up, help you do easy installations

38:46.240 --> 38:49.400
with just about any popular open source automation or hosting

38:49.400 --> 38:52.640
service out there from DNS to ad blocking

38:52.640 --> 38:53.920
to virtual machine managers.

38:53.920 --> 38:55.960
I mean, the whole nine yards can now

38:55.960 --> 38:58.720
be deployed when you're using the entire Home Assistant

38:58.720 --> 39:00.640
stack versus just like Home Assistant Core, which

39:00.640 --> 39:02.000
would be the container version.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.080
But if you get their whole purpose OS,

39:04.080 --> 39:06.200
or there's other ways to go about getting it on a Linux

39:06.200 --> 39:10.840
box, you have a system that makes this really approachable

39:10.840 --> 39:12.920
and is using really modern tools under the hood.

39:12.920 --> 39:13.920
Now, it's not what you're going to want

39:13.920 --> 39:14.960
to use at any kind of scale.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.760
You're not going to want to use it in an enterprise deployment.

39:16.760 --> 39:19.080
You're not going to want to put this necessarily on a resume.

39:19.080 --> 39:21.400
But if you have a home machine and you're particularly

39:21.400 --> 39:22.820
looking at automation, this is one

39:22.820 --> 39:25.120
of the things people don't understand about Home Assistant

39:25.120 --> 39:27.680
is it has a lot of really well-managed one-click

39:27.680 --> 39:30.480
deployments of very popular open source software.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.880
And it gives you an easy snapshot backup management

39:32.880 --> 39:36.200
update UI on top of it, and then has an extensible community

39:36.200 --> 39:38.880
hack store you can add if you want.

39:38.880 --> 39:41.320
And it's just all one stack OS that you could actually

39:41.320 --> 39:44.800
just flash to a Raspberry Pi 4 image and run it all day long,

39:44.800 --> 39:45.960
which I do.

39:45.960 --> 39:48.400
And I am extremely sensitive to performance.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.240
And it's just all out there for the taking.

39:50.240 --> 39:51.960
And I don't think enough people appreciate or understand it

39:51.960 --> 39:53.520
because they're not listening to self-hosted.

39:53.520 --> 39:54.240
End of rant.

39:54.240 --> 39:56.520
Ah, maybe they should head over to self-hosted.show

39:56.520 --> 39:58.760
and check that out, where there's many fine episodes

39:58.760 --> 40:01.200
that touch on basically all of this.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.760
Yeah, you like how I turned it into a plug?

40:02.760 --> 40:05.000
But I'm sure you'd probably have something that might

40:05.000 --> 40:06.920
be a little more practical.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.360
Well, I mean, I think it depends.

40:08.360 --> 40:09.640
He writes container host.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.760
If it is just containers and pretty much everything

40:11.760 --> 40:13.840
in containers, I think you can get

40:13.840 --> 40:16.680
a good amount of mileage just from Docker Compose.

40:16.680 --> 40:19.440
If you don't really customize anything on the system,

40:19.440 --> 40:21.320
it's just sort of a bog standard LTS

40:21.320 --> 40:23.320
installer, the latest Fedora.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.880
Install Docker and go from there.

40:25.880 --> 40:27.760
That can work pretty well if you're OK

40:27.760 --> 40:29.760
with that level of involvement.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.880
Otherwise, over on Linux Action News,

40:31.880 --> 40:34.080
we recently talked about the new backup server

40:34.080 --> 40:36.040
that Proxmox has going.

40:36.040 --> 40:37.920
And I wonder if, especially if maybe you've

40:37.920 --> 40:40.400
got some mixed workloads, some VMs with some containers

40:40.400 --> 40:43.080
involved, that might be an interesting choice as well.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.800
That's a great point.

40:44.800 --> 40:48.240
Proxmox is maybe something you should seriously

40:48.240 --> 40:52.560
consider as at least the base of whatever home solution

40:52.560 --> 40:53.800
you're going to do for hosting.

40:53.800 --> 40:57.760
Because even if you deploy the applications in a container,

40:57.760 --> 41:00.720
it's nice to have that host OS in a VM.

41:00.720 --> 41:03.040
Because if this is successful, then it

41:03.040 --> 41:05.120
makes it easy to migrate to a more powerful box

41:05.120 --> 41:06.320
in a couple of years.

41:06.320 --> 41:09.120
If you experience a failure, having everything virtualized

41:09.120 --> 41:12.600
makes it significantly easier to backup and then thus restore.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.160
And it abstracts out the hardware,

41:14.160 --> 41:16.280
so that way you could move it about in the future.

41:16.280 --> 41:18.320
You could even do things like take snapshots and then

41:18.320 --> 41:19.000
test an upgrade.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.200
If it doesn't work, roll back the entire OS.

41:21.200 --> 41:23.080
So I think, like I knew he would,

41:23.080 --> 41:25.840
I think Wes nailed it with the Proxmox recommendation.

41:25.840 --> 41:28.400
And with that new Proxmox backup server,

41:28.400 --> 41:30.000
that is even more of a solid choice.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.880
And if you're not familiar with it, well, right into the show

41:32.880 --> 41:33.920
and let us know if you'd like to hear about that.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.720
Because it's something Wes and I are debating,

41:35.720 --> 41:37.920
spending some time with, and then reporting back

41:37.920 --> 41:38.600
on the show.

41:38.600 --> 41:40.920
Lastly, Cory wrote in.

41:40.920 --> 41:44.160
Everybody went to linuxunplug.com contact, right?

41:44.160 --> 41:47.480
Cory wrote in and said, have you guys heard of Podify?

41:47.480 --> 41:48.660
All right, get ready.

41:48.660 --> 41:50.200
If you're going down the road, you

41:50.200 --> 41:52.240
may need to pull over and listen to this one,

41:52.240 --> 41:53.880
because this is a game changer.

41:53.880 --> 41:59.640
Podify uses YouTube DL to create podcast RSS feeds, which

41:59.640 --> 42:02.400
then you subscribe to in your podcast catcher of choice

42:02.400 --> 42:03.760
or some other mechanism.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.640
How awesome.

42:05.640 --> 42:06.560
We're out of a job.

42:06.560 --> 42:08.520
Yeah, Cory just, I think, just maybe came in

42:08.520 --> 42:12.280
with the best pick of 2020.

42:12.280 --> 42:13.520
How did we not find this, Wes?

42:13.520 --> 42:14.320
This is amazing.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.760
So again, it's called Podify.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.560
We'll have a link to it in the show notes.

42:17.560 --> 42:19.240
It's up on GitHub.

42:19.240 --> 42:21.400
And it's awesome.

42:21.400 --> 42:22.440
I even like the UI.

42:22.440 --> 42:23.760
It's simple, straightforward.

42:23.760 --> 42:24.760
Yeah.

42:24.760 --> 42:26.120
Self-hosted, you get a web UI.

42:26.120 --> 42:28.260
You paste in your YouTube link.

42:28.260 --> 42:31.040
And then it downloads it with YouTube DL in the background,

42:31.040 --> 42:31.880
adds it to a feed.

42:31.880 --> 42:34.120
And then you can go add that feed

42:34.120 --> 42:37.920
to whatever RSS player, podcast player of your choice,

42:37.920 --> 42:40.040
and then have access to the stuff right there.

42:40.040 --> 42:41.960
Way better than me downloading it manually

42:41.960 --> 42:44.640
and then using Telegram to send it to myself.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.280
Yeah, I think I've got to give this a go and then

42:46.280 --> 42:47.040
do a report back.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.320
But I might hold that report back for self-hosted,

42:49.320 --> 42:51.600
because this is totally up that show's alley.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.880
This turned into a big plug fest.

42:53.880 --> 42:55.120
That is so great, Cory.

42:55.120 --> 42:56.600
If you have a pick similar to that

42:56.600 --> 42:58.600
or something else you find really useful,

42:58.600 --> 42:59.480
do send it in to us.

42:59.480 --> 43:02.040
We love those submitted at linuxunplug.com

43:02.040 --> 43:05.040
slash contact, because that's great.

43:05.040 --> 43:09.120
Now, speaking of picks, this one feels sort of not

43:09.120 --> 43:11.600
as awesome now.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.200
Cory stole your thunder.

43:13.200 --> 43:14.880
Yeah, I got to follow Cory.

43:14.880 --> 43:17.680
But I stumbled across dev fonts this week.

43:17.680 --> 43:19.480
He was making the rounds on the internet,

43:19.480 --> 43:22.440
and I wanted to pass it along to our community.

43:22.440 --> 43:25.840
It is a way to go look at some really well-known popular fonts

43:25.840 --> 43:27.480
that are quote unquote for developers.

43:27.480 --> 43:28.880
But they're really for anybody who

43:28.880 --> 43:31.560
likes very readable fonts in either their terminal, which

43:31.560 --> 43:33.960
is what I really recommend you do,

43:33.960 --> 43:35.760
or in your text editor of choice.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.600
And there's a bunch of famous ones in there

43:37.600 --> 43:39.480
and probably some you've never seen before.

43:39.480 --> 43:41.760
And what's really nice about this website,

43:41.760 --> 43:44.640
beyond some of the filtering options and whatnot,

43:44.640 --> 43:47.040
is it gives you a preview in a code editor.

43:47.040 --> 43:49.240
So you can see what the font looks like in the content

43:49.240 --> 43:50.000
you'll be using.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.380
And it's a really clever website,

43:51.380 --> 43:52.920
so I wanted to give it a plug.

43:52.920 --> 43:55.520
It's devfonts.gafl.dev.

43:55.520 --> 43:57.160
But I'll have a link in the show notes,

43:57.160 --> 43:58.200
so you don't have to try to remember that.

43:58.200 --> 43:59.680
But it's devfonts is the website.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.200
You can probably just Google it, too.

44:01.200 --> 44:02.400
I think that's an I.

44:02.400 --> 44:03.200
Oh, OK.

44:03.200 --> 44:03.960
Oh, you're right.

44:03.960 --> 44:04.480
Sorry.

44:04.480 --> 44:05.840
I got across the room.

44:05.840 --> 44:07.720
They should have used a better font.

44:07.720 --> 44:10.200
devfonts.gafl.dev.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.640
Yeah, that's got to be it.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.280
That's why the link would just be a better way to go.

44:13.280 --> 44:15.160
But don't you like how it previews it for you

44:15.160 --> 44:16.740
and you can kind of get a sense of it?

44:16.740 --> 44:17.360
Oh, yeah.

44:17.360 --> 44:18.440
You can choose different themes.

44:18.440 --> 44:20.200
You can also change the syntax highlighting.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.480
So if you want to paste in some of your own work or code

44:22.480 --> 44:26.800
samples to see how it looks in Python or Ruby or Java,

44:26.800 --> 44:28.760
well, that's an easy little dropdown.

44:28.760 --> 44:31.240
And they've got a lot of nice options here.

44:31.240 --> 44:33.080
Cascadia code right at the top, which

44:33.080 --> 44:35.480
is Microsoft's new dev-focused font.

44:35.480 --> 44:37.040
Right below that is Fira code, which

44:37.040 --> 44:39.480
is one I use myself because I'm a sucker

44:39.480 --> 44:41.240
for those fancy ligatures.

44:41.240 --> 44:43.280
Yeah, I really like that one, too.

44:43.280 --> 44:46.720
I find it makes my terminal much more readable when

44:46.720 --> 44:48.720
you need to distinguish important little bits there.

44:48.720 --> 44:50.200
And then once I get it going in my terminal,

44:50.200 --> 44:52.600
I'm like, well, now I want it in my text editor, too.

44:52.600 --> 44:53.440
Put it everywhere.

44:53.440 --> 44:54.260
It's pretty nice.

44:54.260 --> 44:55.600
So check that out.

44:55.600 --> 44:56.160
Link to that.

44:56.160 --> 44:59.040
Not nearly as cool as Potify.

44:59.040 --> 45:01.000
But Potify, I'm going to knock at one point

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
because of that name.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.080
It sounds like a Docker management tool.

45:04.080 --> 45:06.040
It sounds like a Podman tool or something, right?

45:06.040 --> 45:07.040
Potify.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.320
So I'm knocking at a point.

45:08.320 --> 45:09.240
All right, all right.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.280
You still win.

45:11.280 --> 45:14.080
Yeah, that's what I'm going for.

45:14.080 --> 45:15.040
Thanks, Wes.

45:15.040 --> 45:16.360
I needed that win.

45:16.360 --> 45:18.680
You know what else I need is I need you to join us live.

45:18.680 --> 45:19.960
Yeah, so how about you do it?

45:19.960 --> 45:23.000
Because we'd love to have you join us live at jblive.tv.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.160
We put the times up at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

45:25.160 --> 45:27.360
But nominally, it happens Tuesday at noon Pacific,

45:27.360 --> 45:29.400
3 PM Eastern.

45:29.400 --> 45:31.680
The other live show we have right now is Coda Radio.

45:31.680 --> 45:32.180
But you never know.

45:32.180 --> 45:34.180
I'm thinking about doing more live stream stuff.

45:34.180 --> 45:35.840
So if you haven't followed us on Twitch,

45:35.840 --> 45:38.920
that's maybe the best way to know when we're going live.

45:38.920 --> 45:41.400
If you use Twitch, you can, I don't know,

45:41.400 --> 45:43.080
subscribe or follow or whatever.

45:43.080 --> 45:44.240
I don't think there's a bell.

45:44.240 --> 45:46.480
But you can get involved over there

45:46.480 --> 45:47.760
in some way with our channel.

45:47.760 --> 45:50.040
And then you get notifications when we go live.

45:50.040 --> 45:52.040
Old Man Chris tells the internet how to use Twitch.

45:52.040 --> 45:54.520
And then there's the YouTube, which

45:54.520 --> 45:57.360
is truly the source of all evil on the internet.

45:57.360 --> 46:00.240
But you can also, if you bell us up over there,

46:00.240 --> 46:04.880
I think you get the notification should the algorithm so

46:04.880 --> 46:05.880
deem when we're live.

46:05.880 --> 46:07.220
And the reason why I mention that

46:07.220 --> 46:10.520
is because I'm going to be experimenting coming up

46:10.520 --> 46:11.920
after the holidays predominantly.

46:11.920 --> 46:14.080
But even maybe before the end of the year,

46:14.080 --> 46:16.560
I'm going to experiment with a couple of different show ideas.

46:16.560 --> 46:17.880
And I thought, I'll do it on the live stream.

46:17.880 --> 46:18.840
And I'd like to get your feedback.

46:18.840 --> 46:19.960
So if you're not already following us

46:19.960 --> 46:22.000
on one of the places where you can watch us live,

46:22.000 --> 46:22.960
it might be worth it.

46:22.960 --> 46:25.400
Because you never know what could be there.

46:25.400 --> 46:26.280
You never know.

46:26.280 --> 46:28.720
Also, just one more plug for Linux Action News.

46:28.720 --> 46:31.480
I'm really happy where that's at.

46:31.480 --> 46:34.520
I think Wes has been able to really add

46:34.520 --> 46:35.600
a lot of value to the show.

46:35.600 --> 46:37.580
And while I still miss doing it with Joe,

46:37.580 --> 46:39.000
I just love doing it with Wes.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.880
And if you're not subscribed to Linux Action News,

46:41.880 --> 46:43.680
you're missing a lot of what we cover.

46:43.680 --> 46:45.080
I think truly one of the best ways

46:45.080 --> 46:47.640
to stay informed in free software and the open source

46:47.640 --> 46:49.800
world is weekly.

46:49.800 --> 46:51.320
There's just enough there every week

46:51.320 --> 46:54.240
that changes that it's good to keep track of that stuff.

46:54.240 --> 46:57.200
And there's a lot of stories we're not putting in this show.

46:57.200 --> 46:59.760
Because this show is really focused more on community stuff

46:59.760 --> 47:02.000
and things that we can get a conversation really

47:02.000 --> 47:05.240
rolling about and looking at like Fedora in the future.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.520
But Linux Action News is like the things that really

47:07.520 --> 47:10.080
happened in the open source world that week that matter.

47:10.080 --> 47:12.000
And it's been really great having you on there, Wes.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.380
So if you guys out there haven't subscribed to that yet,

47:14.380 --> 47:17.520
go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for that.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.400
But see you next week.

47:19.400 --> 47:21.920
Same bad time, same bad station.

47:21.920 --> 47:25.640
That does bring us to an end of this week's podcast.

47:25.640 --> 47:28.380
Thank you so much everybody who decided to download and listen

47:28.380 --> 47:28.880
to the show.

47:28.880 --> 47:30.920
Big thank you to our core contributors.

47:30.920 --> 47:32.720
But even if you're not a core contributor,

47:32.720 --> 47:34.420
we still really appreciate you listening.

47:34.420 --> 47:36.040
We're thankful for your time.

47:36.040 --> 47:37.960
We're thankful any time you have an opportunity

47:37.960 --> 47:40.360
to share the show or if you take advantage

47:40.360 --> 47:41.320
of one of our sponsors.

47:41.320 --> 47:43.320
That's all things that really matter a lot to us.

47:43.320 --> 47:46.880
And I've been ending now I think for three months officially.

47:46.880 --> 47:50.840
I think I'm crossing the three month threshold today.

47:50.840 --> 47:53.280
And I'm reflecting on that and just extremely grateful

47:53.280 --> 47:54.320
for all of you out there.

47:54.320 --> 47:56.160
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

47:56.160 --> 47:57.520
of the Unplugged program.

47:57.520 --> 48:01.040
And we will indeed see you right back here, not Monday,

48:01.040 --> 48:01.800
but next Tuesday.

48:01.800 --> 48:28.360
Yeah!

48:31.800 --> 48:39.440
All right.

48:39.440 --> 48:42.460
The duty has fallen upon us to title this here podcast.

48:42.460 --> 48:47.740
So those of you watching live head over to JBtitles.com.

48:47.740 --> 48:52.780
Today's episode is a real a phonic experience because we started with peanut butter jelly

48:52.780 --> 48:53.820
time.

48:53.820 --> 48:57.240
And then in the middle of the show, we were transmitting you secret messages using modem

48:57.240 --> 49:01.260
sounds and then coming up here in a little bit, I have something else that I'm going

49:01.260 --> 49:02.260
to play for you.

49:02.260 --> 49:03.260
That's some special audio.

49:03.260 --> 49:04.520
Assuming I can get it to download.

49:04.520 --> 49:06.240
Oh, there we go.

49:06.240 --> 49:07.240
Got it.

49:07.240 --> 49:08.240
Just in time.

49:08.240 --> 49:09.240
All right.

49:09.240 --> 49:10.240
JBtitles.com.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.240
Everybody go boat.

49:11.240 --> 49:12.920
Yeah, we don't know what the title should be.

49:12.920 --> 49:13.920
We can't know.

49:13.920 --> 49:18.280
Wes, I'm getting positive reports that Test Turkey 2 is doing very, very good.

49:18.280 --> 49:20.840
Ten pounds seems to be the perfect size for the smoker.

49:20.840 --> 49:21.840
I was worried.

49:21.840 --> 49:22.840
I know.

49:22.840 --> 49:25.800
And that's why I wanted to keep you up to date because I didn't want you stressing about

49:25.800 --> 49:26.800
it.

49:26.800 --> 49:29.920
Now, will we have a live stream of you eating said turkey later on?

49:29.920 --> 49:35.400
I don't think anybody wants that.

49:35.400 --> 49:37.560
Nobody wants that.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.680
Nobody wants to have to watch me try to carve a turkey either.

49:39.680 --> 49:40.680
Let me tell you.

49:40.680 --> 49:43.920
Maybe a sensual gravy pouring a little bit.

49:43.920 --> 49:49.660
I feel so embarrassed when I'm trying to carve a turkey because I feel like as a dad, I should

49:49.660 --> 49:50.660
have that down.

49:50.660 --> 49:54.400
And let me tell you, I am just horrible at it because you do it once every few years

49:54.400 --> 49:55.400
at best.

49:55.400 --> 49:57.080
And at least I do.

49:57.080 --> 49:58.340
So I'm not very good at it.

49:58.340 --> 50:00.440
I had a little quick thing I wanted to do.

50:00.440 --> 50:03.500
Wes and I came across this bit of audio.

50:03.500 --> 50:05.400
You guys know we're audio geeks.

50:05.400 --> 50:09.400
This is what the Perseverance rover sounds like.

50:09.400 --> 50:10.940
Now, Wes, make sure I don't mess this up.

50:10.940 --> 50:16.120
But they did like an internal diagnostic from the surface of Mars and captured some sound

50:16.120 --> 50:17.560
of the internal machinery.

50:17.560 --> 50:18.760
And that's what we have here, right?

50:18.760 --> 50:19.760
Yeah.

50:19.760 --> 50:21.000
So it's actually while it's on route.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.860
This is one of the first times they've attached microphones to a spacecraft like this.

50:25.860 --> 50:29.740
And the intent is to hear what it sounds like as they enter the Martian atmosphere and go

50:29.740 --> 50:31.140
in for a landing.

50:31.140 --> 50:35.360
But out in the void, quiet void of space, you can actually get a feeling for what it's

50:35.360 --> 50:40.720
like coming along, hearing its own machine, internal machinery, and nothing else in the

50:40.720 --> 50:41.720
void.

50:41.720 --> 50:47.160
Oh, that wasn't the right one.

50:47.160 --> 50:48.160
Dang it.

50:48.160 --> 50:49.160
Slack.

50:49.160 --> 50:50.160
Dammit.

50:50.160 --> 51:00.120
You know what happens is it's a snap, and then it's not in the actual downloads folder,

51:00.120 --> 51:05.960
but it's in the downloads folder inside the snap folder.

51:05.960 --> 51:09.320
That's why I played the wrong one.

51:09.320 --> 51:10.800
I have been trolled.

51:10.800 --> 51:12.080
I have been trolled.

51:12.080 --> 51:13.080
Self-troll.

51:13.080 --> 51:14.080
Yeah.

51:14.080 --> 51:22.600
Well, you know, you don't want just Slack having loosey-goose access to your file system

51:22.600 --> 51:23.600
like an animal.

51:23.600 --> 51:24.840
All right.

51:24.840 --> 51:25.840
Here's the sound.

51:25.840 --> 51:36.840
Here we go.

51:36.840 --> 51:41.720
And I guess, I mean, it's not all that interesting, really, other than you hear some machinery

51:41.720 --> 51:42.720
in there.

51:42.720 --> 51:46.480
But one of the things, I guess, that's making the most noise is its internal heating elements.

51:46.480 --> 51:48.160
I didn't realize, of course, this makes sense.

51:48.160 --> 51:50.440
This is the rover that's en route.

51:50.440 --> 51:53.040
And when it lands, does that mean we're going to get to hear what it sounds like on Mars?

51:53.040 --> 51:54.040
Yeah, we'll see.

51:54.040 --> 51:59.160
I mean, I guess, as long as all the microphone equipment makes it through, yeah, because

51:59.160 --> 52:03.160
they're really aimed at experiencing what the landing is like, like the mortar that

52:03.160 --> 52:07.400
sets off the parachute that helps break its fall, all that kind of element.

52:07.400 --> 52:11.400
But in theory, if all of that survives, if it keeps working and you get it on the surface,

52:11.400 --> 52:14.120
yeah, we'll have audio from Mars.

52:14.120 --> 52:15.120
That's crazy.

52:15.120 --> 52:16.120
Yeah, it is.

52:16.120 --> 52:17.400
Tell me what you think.

52:17.400 --> 52:20.080
I've got an idea for a combo, okay?

52:20.080 --> 52:25.120
So tell me what you think of this combo for like the secret message of the week.

52:25.120 --> 52:27.920
So this will be, this is how we do the secret message of the week.

52:27.920 --> 52:35.720
The cone of silence.

52:35.720 --> 52:37.440
Can you overlap the sounds like that?

52:37.440 --> 52:38.440
Will that work?

52:38.440 --> 52:39.920
I bet so.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.720
We'll have to try it.

52:41.720 --> 52:42.720
Somebody let us know.

52:42.720 --> 52:43.720
I'll do it.

52:43.720 --> 52:44.720
I'll do it.

52:44.720 --> 52:46.280
You know, one more time and then you let us know if this works.

52:46.280 --> 52:48.240
If you're listening live, let us know.

52:48.240 --> 53:10.600
The cone of silence.
