1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
So Wimpy, you were talking about video games.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,880
My friend, if you're going to get into games, guess what?

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:12,400
New Humble Bundle 12 is out, and they are finally, once again, rocking the Linux support.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,780
And there's some good ones on here.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,680
There is Gone Home, good game, Luftharossers?

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,680
How do you say that, Eric?

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,680
What do you think?

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,680
Luftharossers.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,680
Let's take a little look at this one.

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,680
Let's see what this is about.

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,840
Because I think this is mild fantasy violence.

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,840
Alright.

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:34,680
Oh, that was a fun game, actually, yeah, I got really into that for a while.

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,680
Luftharossers?

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,800
Yeah, if it's what I think it is, it's a side-scrolling, uh...

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,600
Oh, this actually looks like a lot of fun.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,160
Yeah, it's a super game.

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,160
Okay.

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,160
It's short, though.

20
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
It's actually a little short.

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,720
Ah, that's actually not a bad thing for me.

22
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,520
Is it like the airplane flying around in there?

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,520
Yeah.

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
Yeah.

25
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,520
That's not bad.

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
Okay, so then you've also got Hammerwatch.

27
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
Let's take a look at it and see what...

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
Oh, this is a really good game.

29
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
You've got SteamWorld.

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
Dig that.

31
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
I've heard a lot about this.

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
I actually have that one.

33
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Oh, yeah.

34
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
Papers, Please is also...

35
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
Here, watch this one.

36
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:17,040
This Papers, Please is a great game.

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,040
Papers, Please.

38
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,040
It's like the whole game right there, too.

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:29,440
Well, that's sad.

40
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Mm-hmm.

41
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:40,240
Isn't that interesting?

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,960
Denied.

43
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,760
What's funny about this is I have worked in a U.S. Customs facility in SeaTac Airport,

44
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,680
and I got to work in a U.S. Customs facility.

45
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,680
Oh, I see.

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
So you've worked in a U.S. Customs facility?

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Yes, I've worked in a U.S. Customs facility.

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Oh, okay.

49
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
I see.

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
I see.

51
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
So, yeah, that's a good game.

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,680
Yeah, it's pretty good.

53
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
Yeah, it's pretty good.

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Yeah, I can see that.

55
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
I can definitely see that.

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
Yeah, I can see that.

57
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
All right, so we've got...

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
This is pretty good.

59
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
All right, so should we check in to see how the funding is doing?

60
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
You know I always like to look at this, right?

61
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
I always got to see how we're doing.

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
Oh, all right, we got to watch the video.

63
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Come on.

64
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680

90
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,280
Oh, yeah

91
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280

Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's not yet chained down by the wrist proprietary hardware. My name is Chris

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,880
My name is Matt. Hey Matt, guess what 57 episodes in a row, buddy

99
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,200
Big five seven already. I know now we're like ketchup. You know what? That's cool

100
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,520
It's cool to be like ketchup Matt and you know to help us celebrate being tasty like ketchup in studio producer Eric

101
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,960
Hey, Eric. Hey Chris. How you doing? Good. Are you feeling like Heinz 57 today? A little ketchup a little bit great

102
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,560
Yeah, yeah

103
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,120
You and I are on a marathon broadcast in marathon broadcast mode still because we did that Apple thing this morning

104
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,040
Yeah, that'll be in tech talk today. It's probably gonna be out probably posted while we're recording. Yeah

105
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,440
It was like a two-hour show. It was a big show. Yeah, it was a big show like encoding nightmare. Yeah

106
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,280
Yeah, it takes extra processes. You gotta have more i7. We need more all of the i7

107
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,680
Well coming up in today's episode of the unplugged show. We got a lot of ground to cover

108
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,520
We have a little make good from last week. We didn't get a chance to talk about DNF

109
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
We're gonna do that in the latter half of the show

110
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,800
We also have I know you're gonna think it's crazy. You're gonna think I'm nuts

111
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,120
we got to talk about system D just a little bit more because I

112
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,880
Think I figured out where all the controversies coming from. Yeah, I think I've isolated it down

113
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,400
I think we can finally put this topic to bed once we just get it out there in the open

114
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,500
Who's stirring up trouble? Why are they're stirring it up? I think I got the answer for you

115
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,640
We're gonna talk about in today's unplugged call them out put it on the record

116
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,580
So that way we as a public can move on from all of this shenanigans

117
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,240
So we're gonna talk about that in the show and then our mobile room joins us to talk about open media vault today

118
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,320
I think we're supposed to at least we'll see how that goes

119
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,320
I did they've been doing a little open media vault review and

120
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,800
They've been preparing to come on and talk about their experiences with open media vault

121
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
So mama room time appropriate greetings to you guys. Welcome to the unplugged show today. Oh

122
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Whiskey, yes

123
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,000
Wimpy are you ready to talk about open media vault today? Are you excited? Oh, yeah

124
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,180
Someone hold that man down free now is everybody review over free now

125
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,260
I'm not exactly the right person be asking because he gets overly excited about nothing. That's true

126
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,340
I didn't want to give away my true feelings

127
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,060
Well, let's see, let's start with our first email see if we can get to the true feelings behind talks

128
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,500
Travis wrote in to Linux unplugged says hey guys

129
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,500
I saw a water article on a little piece of a little project called you talks and I found it to be an interesting concept any

130
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,700
Plans for highlighting it during an upcoming show that you guys are probably familiar with talks

131
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:47,580
It aims to be a Skype replacement that's secure encrypted and it's more like a protocol where a front-end could be written for it

132
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,980
And no, you were just saying a little earlier you were experimenting with talks. What was your takeaway?

133
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,700
Yeah, so me and actually a couple other people in the mumble room

134
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:03,220
Tried to got talks installed and started using it and I want to say first I think it's a fantastic

135
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,980
I think it's it's the potential for the project is fantastic

136
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,180
And I think it's a fantastic idea and I think it's going fantastic directions

137
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,820
However, it's very much not ready for daily use at least not from my experience

138
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,220
We were able to establish a call. We were able to have a conversation and that worked really well

139
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,300
Unfortunately to get that call

140
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:30,120
I had to have my client already open and waiting for the the the thing to pop up because the notification didn't work

141
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,560
That was a gnome. I couldn't even get it installed. It wouldn't even install on 1404

142
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,320
What like I said once it got connected we were able to have a conversation and that worked for about five or six minutes and

143
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Then the entire client would crash

144
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,640
In the middle of a call

145
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,520
Yeah, right in the middle of a call

146
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,280
group group

147
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,080
Conversate like like we're more than one person was connected. Yeah. Oh, yeah work at all group chat worked. Okay

148
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,040
But the like single one person to one person chat also would crash after like five or six minutes of use. Yeah

149
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,760
So you're saying it sucked. Well, I'm here's what I'm saying

150
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm saying that you know

151
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,200
It's it's one of those things where when I'm sure once they get once everything reaches stable and it gets and it gets released

152
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Yeah, it will be a fantastic project. It just it's clearly not where you know, for example Skype is today, of course

153
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,720
Yeah, it shouldn't be because how much longer right and how much more money you might have to develop sky. Yeah

154
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,520
Yeah, it's early days doing it a little bit wrong here talks is more of a client

155
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,280
No a server and a protocol you're judging the client one of many fair enough. Yeah

156
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,140
Although his experience sort of echoes experience with the other talks clients

157
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,900
I think just I think there's a I think the underlying aspect of it's still moving and I think of course the top you eyes

158
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,200
You're right. It's more like it's more like HTTP in a sense

159
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,280
It's you can have multiple web browsers that can browse the web. You're gonna have multiple talks front ends, but that might yes

160
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,920
I'm not I'm not

161
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,220
This maybe is going to be a data point to this to this potential

162
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:01,040
But I I think maybe what we're seeing here is this is the wrong approach for this type of product and service

163
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,560
I think you need to have a client that is

164
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:10,640
Integrated at the same time with the back end like it the two things shouldn't be developed in a vacuum. I don't I don't think

165
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,960
This seems like you have to have if you when you put when you build a feature into something that the back end can support

166
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,520
The client needs that and you have to build it, you know

167
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,880
Then see how the client responds to that and adjust the back end to how do you how can these two separate things be?

168
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,820
Fully feature compatible. How will they ever sync up in terms of what the back end can do versus what front ends can do?

169
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,880
And etc. It seems well, you're absolutely right in order to have the back end work

170
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,400
You have to have a front end that works with the back end and if the two do not work together then what's the point?

171
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,440
What do you think dare Devlin? So they are actually from what I understood and I tried all the clients listed on the page

172
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:55,000
Toxic is the client that is been worked and doing that kind of iteration that you're talking

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,420
That's the one I like the most and that one never failed in doing any of the tasks that it already says it does

174
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,000
So it only doesn't do audio yet

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,560
However, it does already the other things ready really well

176
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,960
And I think it's on progress because they are trying to refine it step by step

177
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,080
Other clients are focusing on the experimental

178
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,800
Experimental API that it's available for the toxic library

179
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,560
Well, it's a to the actual protocol and I think it is actually right approach if we want these

180
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,800
produce

181
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,320
Protocol to propagate like there's already people working on that. I have knowledge of that are working on a WebRTC

182
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,920
Proxy that we talks so you can use your browser to communicate with a tax client, which is amazing

183
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,760
WebRTC already works fine. So why does it need to be integrated with talks?

184
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,520
So you don't have to use two apps. So

185
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,000
Your browser and people can use their own desktop application or phone application, which works

186
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,280
we've also I featured a couple of QT based talks cool clients, but

187
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,040
There seem to be the one that actually performs best under most circumstances and tests. Yeah

188
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,880
In my experience, it's just to me so far away from a hangouts or Skype replacement right? Yeah

189
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,760
It's just it is not production ready and there are people who they're people who start Google Hangouts

190
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,160
And then leave them running all day long at their workplace

191
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,240
It's got a long way to go before it's ever gonna hit that level

192
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,840
But maybe for for enthusiasts enthusiasts that are just kind of messing around with friends and stuff like that

193
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,960
It's probably getting close to that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely and toxic

194
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,600
I do have to say I didn't experiment any kind of crash at all

195
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,560
Maybe because I built all the clients on my distribution set up actually

196
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,360
Mmm, that's good theory. Yeah. Yeah, I like that. Let's do a follow-up from Sven

197
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,640
He wrote in on the Linux action show on Sunday about setting up his home server

198
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:53,000
And my main concern was he had he was using like three different distros in his house and he was using CentOS

199
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,840
But he was kind of a Linux noob and I was a little worried that he might be spreading himself too thin

200
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,340
So Sven writes in with some follow-up. He says hey guys. Thanks for reading my question

201
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:06,000
I thought I'd get back to you on the questions you raised so regarding the server OS my reasons for choosing CentOS over core

202
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,980
OS or openSUSE is primarily academic

203
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,200
I researched core OS extensively and would have opted for it

204
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:19,200
But was what got me using CentOS was that I am from time to time called upon to manage Linux servers or a few at work

205
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,320
Which is really stressful when you suck at it since all of our Linux servers and firewalls run CentOS

206
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,520
I decided it was in my best interest to become more versed in that OS once I'm comfortable with CentOS

207
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,720
I'll probably move to core. Yay, Docker. That's a great reason. Yeah, that is great. It's an excellent reason

208
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,920
Yep, so on the topic of using three different distros at home and my concern there was like well if you're gonna use CentOS

209
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,320
Maybe you should just use CentOS though. You just learn one thing

210
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,600
And so he says you're probably right and I feel the same about keeping things simple

211
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,860
But I think for the time being that my wife will need to acclimate to Linux in general

212
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,440
I need a distro that was both easy to use and visually attractive and elementary OS

213
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,120
Represented the least dissonant experience for her as a first-time Linux user

214
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,960
My long-term goal is to empower her to choose her own distro. Yes

215
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,400
And even command-line if she wants and while it would be nice to see her on openSUSE

216
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,980
I want her to learn a distro that she considers home

217
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,960
And then he says that way I can claim ignorance and won't have to answer questions

218
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,560
Regarding backups. So he says my current backup strategy is rudimentary at best since things are still in development

219
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,880
I'm using a series of Python scripts adapted from my old Windows server

220
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,240
They package things into btsync folders from there

221
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,600
It gets uploaded to spider oak and needs something simple that worked right away

222
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,060
So I haven't really given back as much attention. They deserve it this time any thoughts. That's not bad

223
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,160
What do you do for backup Eric? Oh, well

224
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,200
What I do is I use just Deja-dupe and I back up to a SSH server on my home server

225
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,720
Deja-dupe is a great way to go

226
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,800
Oh, yeah, and in this case you could back up to the folder that spider oak is backing up

227
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,560
I like I really like spider oak as my backup system. Yeah, that's a good one it you know, I

228
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,600
I have very little experience with spider oak to be honest. Yeah. Yeah now what you playing with anything back up wise these days

229
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,040
Well, I used to use spider oak, but it just it's so bloaty. It is slow

230
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah, I mean for me it's like it's really bloody so I've been kind of bouncing back and forth

231
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,040
I'm at one time. I used to use jungle disk one time. I used to use spider oak

232
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,960
I think right now I'm pretty much married to kind of going with a bit torrent sync

233
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,040
To a specific box in the house and spread all over the place

234
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,640
Yeah, yeah until I figure out something a little more permanent

235
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,560
I'm kind of in between right now part of my backup strategy is the fact that I got copies of stuff everywhere

236
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,780
Yeah, that is I mean, it's not a great backup strategy, but it is part of it saved my bacon the other day

237
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,680
I actually accidentally

238
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,620
Deleted my music folder what? Yeah, I actually thank God though. I had a bit torrent sync over to my tablet

239
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,560
So did you catch it before it synced the the delete? I sure did. Oh my gosh

240
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,520
Are you hustling like a fool over here?

241
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,080
Here's the funny part is that bit torrent sync what hadn't been running for some reason?

242
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,860
So I went ahead and just grab the SD card out of my tablet in my computer

243
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,200
Just dropped them all back create this create a new sync

244
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:13,780
Yeah, she's Louise. I totally looked I like daredevil ins approach recess. I just swap out hard drives. Yeah, that's a way to go

245
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah, that's another way to go

246
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,500
Oh, yeah, it's simple it works for me. I just have

247
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Video another for music and

248
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,580
Yeah, you know, I always want something automatic yeah, I want something automatic so that's why

249
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,360
Bit torrents he keeps my constant scene going on

250
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,720
Yeah

251
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,480
But then deja dupe does my once a week backup because you have the bit torrent sync isn't really a backup because it could have

252
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,440
Synced the delete action. That's right. It could have synced the delay got lucky. I got real lucky. Yeah

253
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,360
I got well, there's two things that bit torrent sync has going for you in your favor one

254
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,280
There's unless you actually manually set it differently

255
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,560
There is a delay a fairly significant one

256
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,400
And the second thing is the fact that unless you decide to turn off it turn this off in your folder preferences

257
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:03,320
It will actually keep a archive. Yeah, you get the revision. Yeah, that's true. Oh, you get the revision

258
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,400
That's no isn't that what that is? Isn't that what it's like? Oh, it's like a revision copy. You can

259
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,520
Never explored it. I was just like it is in bit torrents. It's gonna just completely it does

260
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,680
Now the where I lucked out and is that it wasn't running on my tablet, right?

261
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,780
So it wasn't running on my tablet. Yeah, right then. Yeah, it was running on my computer, but was not running on my tablet

262
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,480
So I was able to just copy. Yeah, I've always so the here's how I use bit torrent sync

263
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,600
Yeah, is I have obviously I have to have machines that have write access

264
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:40,080
But the majority of my scenes are using the read-only key. Yeah, so that way I so I've never I never delete on the remote

265
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,080
End really almost ever. Well, I have no reason to either because I mean, it's basically I'm just playing back to me

266
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,040
It's like I'm not. Yeah, exactly for me

267
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,160
It's like clips and stuff

268
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,400
Yeah

269
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,920
And that like I don't ever need to delete and then when I do need to delete them

270
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,760
I'm usually sitting at my desk doing like show prep and where I clean things up anyways, and then I have yeah

271
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,040
Go to that machine. Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of just I just do that as a little security thing. Yeah

272
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,080
Um anybody in the mumble room want to chime in on a backup solution?

273
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,620
They're particularly proud of before we move to our next topic. I'm still a big fan of our sink and

274
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,320
I try I try to ob-nam recently

275
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:19,600
An attic and I found they were slow and pretty inefficient. Although, you know the dedupe

276
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,000
Functionality and ob-nam was pretty good, but it took forever. It was really slow. Mm-hmm. Gooky sprite

277
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,680
That's exactly what I'm doing as well. Yeah. Yeah, and you know our sake actually saved my bacon

278
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,120
Oh our things amazing tool and there's a lot of pre-made scripts

279
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,400
You can kind of take and then adjust to work the way you need if you don't want to write it from scratch

280
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,960
And just cron tab and then you never have to worry about it

281
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,760
Yeah, and the other thing is and the thing that's important to me is I understand every single thing that's happening

282
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,880
Was that with BT sink? I'm just I install the software and I just kind of have to hope that it's working magic

283
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
We can see that. Yeah. Yeah

284
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,720
The thing I like about our sink too is you can do the dry run so you can kind of just write get an idea of

285
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,640
What's gonna happen? So is this gonna be a huge massive file transfer?

286
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,280
Is this gonna be a quick thing? And of course it also all my files gonna get deleted. Yeah

287
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,960
And the other thing is you can throw it was sometimes these systems like you'll lose that you'll lose the right date or time or

288
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,960
Last modified and and our sinks really good about this guy an interesting solution. Yeah, go ahead with me

289
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,040
well, like like most of you I'm using our

290
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:31,320
Bit sync to move my data around the place. So all my various workstations and what have you but for backups

291
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,120
I use our snapshot which gives you a point on time recovery. Yes our snaps

292
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,920
The same it's just got I in my opinion just a little prettier

293
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,440
Yeah, our snap that I think we've mentioned on the show before but I think it's been a long time since we gave it a plug

294
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,720
Yeah, so I use our snapshot on open media fault. Oh

295
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,800
We might get into that in a little bit. Yeah, I'll explain how I do that a bit later if you like

296
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:01,200
Yeah, that's a good tease. I like that. All right, that's an our sink front end. I believe right it is. Yes. It's on top of it

297
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,040
Yeah, okay. Got it. Okay, cool. Okay, so we've got we got a follow-up on a couple of other things

298
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,220
We need to get to another email

299
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,100
I want to and a Chrome extension that will actually make YouTube suck less

300
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,260
You're not gonna believe this Chrome extension and what it can do. It's incredible

301
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:20,180
And so before we get to that I want to stop and I want to thank our next sponsor on the unplugged show and that

302
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,340
Is the awesome folks over at team go to linux.ting.com linux.ting.com

303
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:31,740
Linux dot ting.com right now won't you go there because you'll get $25 off your first device if you've already got a ting device

304
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,740
Well, then they'll give you a $25 credit towards your account and ting is super awesome

305
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,560
In fact Kyra is in studio today to tell us about how ting rates work. Ting keeps rates simple

306
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:46,520
We don't make you pick a plan instead. You just use your phone as you normally would how much you use

307
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,360
Determines how much you pay each month. You can have as many devices as you want on one account

308
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,320
That's good

309
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,520
Because when you use more you pay less per minute message or megabyte of data

310
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,720
Your usage plus six dollars per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill

311
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,680
Simple that's what we mean when we say

312
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,320
Mobile that makes sense

313
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,480
You go to linux.ting.com to get started they got a lot of different devices here and feature phones

314
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,400
Ranging from well under $100 like 60 bucks here all the way up to the latest like the Nexus 5 the

315
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,480
All of the latest galaxy lines the iPhone lines. They got it all over there at linux.ting.com. Yeah, you do

316
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,360
Hey, you know what speaking of which if you want you can play a little bit with my L

317
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,040
You want to play with my L?

318
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,520
Yeah, check out how long it's been running on battery you tell the folks how long to you you go if you can find it

319
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,000
Okay, and see if you can tell the folks when you go over to linux.ting.com

320
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,920
To you'll see their savings calculator you go in there you plug in your current usage of what you pay on your current cell phone

321
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,800
Bill and see how much you'd save with ting since ting's only charging you for what you actually use that gives you a ton of

322
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,520
Flexibility and if you're savvy and you know when to make a Wi-Fi call and things like that you would be

323
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,520
Astounded at the savings. I now have three phones on my ting account

324
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,120
And I'm still paying a hundred dollars less a month than I was for one line on my previous provider

325
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,080
It's kind of amazing and what's cool about ting is they're great with however you want to use them if you want to use them

326
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,800
Extensively as as a phone you can if you want to use it mostly as a wireless ISP you can and they have no whole

327
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,760
Customer service if you ever get stuck you call me one eight five five ting FDW and a real person answers the phone

328
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,240
Linux dot ting.com all right, so what's the battery life on that Android L phone there battery life

329
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,960
You've got four days left at 44% and does it say how long it's been running on battery

330
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,440
I couldn't we go up on the go up on the chart if you're on the chart there

331
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
I'll give you the date. I think it's instant

332
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,760
Says the fifth yeah the fifth yeah, so I haven't plugged it in so fair. That's impressive. Yeah

333
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,920
Long yeah, you know what it is. There's two things so it's Android L

334
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,160
That's the first thing second thing is I don't make a lot of calls right so there's three things and the third thing

335
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,280
This is the biggest I believe is that I don't have it signed into my Google account

336
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Oh, so how many days has that been on battery that Nexus 5 well?

337
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,520
Let's see since the fifth and today is the nine eight there you go

338
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,200
And it's got how many days left it's got

339
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Four days now you said yeah

340
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,800
Unbelievable, and I seriously think is because I don't log into my Google account, and it's on Android L

341
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,560
Otherwise it's just a standard Nexus 5 and what's crazy you put sailfish on this and you're or

342
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,400
Ubuntu touch and you blow through it in like two hours. Oh, yeah, yeah

343
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,160
So there's a lot this was so awesome about ting is you're I'm rocking the Nexus 5 I own this outright

344
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,200
I only pay for my usage and I can put my OS on there and it's sailfish Ubuntu touch Firefox

345
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,960
It just jumps on the ting network and work. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, it's awesome Linux dot ting comm

346
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,520
Go help change up the mobile industry by switching to ting

347
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:41,440
make the rest of the industry take note of what ting is trying to do by voting with your wallet Linux dot ting comm and

348
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:48,360
Maybe grab yourself a Nexus 5 and then try out the L beta. I'm kind of impressed. Yeah, I just seeing that

349
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,320
I'm impressed too. Yeah, I mean you got a Nexus 5. How long is your battery last right now? Let's see

350
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,480
I also synced to Google. So yeah. Yeah, that's a huge thing. Ah, just

351
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:05,920
See, I'm thinking I'm thinking I'll have to sign it up with my Google account then see I'm on KitKat and I have 79%

352
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
Remaining I charged it just this morning

353
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,320
I've got four hours 46 minutes and seven seconds on

354
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,560
Well, wow, and he's got four days. Yeah

355
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:24,640
Yeah, that is huge right it's astonishing that's a huge set enough to drag you back to Android then

356
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Maybe we'll see. Oh, I

357
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,160
Battery life is like the killer feature as far as I'm concerned good news. Good news. Look at this

358
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,400
Oh, look at this our Apple videos or our keynote videos already been pulled off off of YouTube

359
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,680
There we go, that was the that was the moment right there right when they're showing the ladies boobs

360
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,880
Right when they're showing the ladies boobs, they're they're pulled down our tech talk today episode a bunch of jerks

361
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,960
Seriously seriously, this has been a bad week. I have one two three marks just from this week

362
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,840
How do you put up with it? I sometimes I just don't even pay attention. I just

363
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,080
All right, the appeals process is easy, right? I mean no

364
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
It's it's fruitless is what it is

365
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:16,240
And in fact, you can even put your account in jeopardy if you try to dispute something that turns out to be legitimate

366
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
Then your account can actually

367
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,920
So Elroy wrote in with our next email to help us all cope with YouTube a little more

368
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
and I

369
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,960
Think I think maybe all of you will want to go grab this

370
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,800
So Elroy writes and he says I've just become aware of the most important

371
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,700
Fantabulous extension for Chrome that's ever graced the face of this earth

372
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:43,000
It's called herp derp for YouTube which significantly improves YouTube comments by replacing them with random herps and derps

373
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:49,020
I'm certain in some way that Matt must have been involved with this great piece of work. It seems inspired one user

374
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:55,120
Explains it thusly in the beginning God created the Internet's and the Internet's were without form and filled with chaos

375
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,340
Trolls and idiots spread upon the face of the deep discord with their fire and rage as their fuel

376
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:07,420
thusly the tanner son of ganner and son of Goden who fought during the legendary battle not known as the flames of boxy and

377
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:13,700
His bacon of hope shined upon the wretched world and tanner said let there be derp and there was herp derp and

378
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,260
Tanner saw the derp and the derp was good

379
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:22,140
No comment even remark was no comment even remotely remarkable was ever missed since that fateful day

380
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:27,560
You can find in the Google Play Store. He included a shortened URL. He says please spread the word of this great extension

381
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:34,840
So there you go herp derp for YouTube. I love it not exactly Linux related, but I think Linux users can

382
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,120
Can probably all say we've suffered a little bit from YouTube comments, so I've already installed in a micro. Yeah, there you go

383
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,400
See I like the before and then the derped so they have the poor than the dirt

384
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:56,320
Here's the first review yeah, you sir are a genius second review. Oh, thank God third review. This is fabulous

385
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,920
Couple of youtubers would love this actually

386
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:14,920
That's great. Matt are sorry Martin writes. Oh my god. How did I live without this extension honor rights? Goodbye to dumb bitches on YouTube?

387
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Exactly, that's it right there

388
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Did you already install it? This is awesome. Yeah, this is great

389
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,920
Bubba says herp herp herp derp derp derp derp

390
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,920
And wow that's awesome

391
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,920
So there you go

392
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,920
I said I can actually read this stuff. Yeah, I figured to make it much more palatable

393
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,920
So even though they're pulling down my videos at least I'll have a good time when I go there to read it

394
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,920
So that I thought that if you click and if you click on each comment it becomes English again

395
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
So if you want to read it you still can

396
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,920
So that's awesome because now I don't care what anyone says this is great

397
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,920
Rekai points out Rekai points out that you could you could pair this sort of like a good wine and cheese

398
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,920
You could pair this with the well-known cloud to butt extension that turns all references of cloud into the word

399
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
But have you guys seen this?

400
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
Oh that's genius

401
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,920
Because you know actually it bit me the other week because we did my cloud exposed

402
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,920
And then somebody sent in a screenshot with the cloud to butt extension where it said my butt exposed

403
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Tech talk today episode 51

404
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,920
So there's a negative side to it as a content creator

405
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
It could be a little awkward

406
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
That's just brilliant

407
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:29,920
But you match up the herp derp for YouTube and the my butt extension and your browser is a much better place I think

408
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
Who needs net neutrality right?

409
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
Yeah, yeah

410
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,920
Okay, we got our last email that came in from a EB

411
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,920
He says proud Papa my 10 and 13 year old boys took to a Chromebook guy gave them

412
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:51,920
I hit up Google and put the thing in a developer mode installed crouton and got Ubuntu installed and they did it all by themselves

413
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,920
As a parent I feel like my work on this world is now done EB

414
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
Good dad

415
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
Right

416
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
Good game

417
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,920
Yeah, that was good

418
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,920
I have the C720 sitting right there

419
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,920
I'm gonna that's gonna becomes Dylan's school computer same thing

420
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,920
I'm not even I don't even think I'm gonna I think I'm gonna leave

421
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,920
My thought is I'll leave the Chrome OS installed for dad

422
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,920
So like if I just need to grab his machine and look something up I'll have Chrome OS

423
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,920
And then when he needs to use it I'll have it in elementary OS

424
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Yep

425
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,920
I don't know about elementary OS though

426
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Oh yeah

427
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
Am I making a mistake?

428
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,920
Ubuntu, sugar on a stick

429
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
Arch?

430
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
I love both

431
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,920
He's looking at what it does not what it runs

432
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,920
So I think

433
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
Yeah, I know he is

434
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,920
But I'm thinking I'm thinking but I would rather have my son run Arch

435
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Yeah, well

436
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
Nice

437
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
Yeah, that's all

438
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
That's the dream you can only hope for

439
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,920
And here come all the Arch fanboys again

440
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
Right

441
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,920
So anyways congrats to EB

442
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,920
And you know that was one of the things that we did that we did this episode on Sunday about the Chromebook

443
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
It's kind of ridiculous

444
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
Yeah

445
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
It is a phenomenon

446
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,920
And one of the other common comments we got is yeah Chromebook is great

447
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,920
I can't wait till those $200 Windows laptops come out like we've talked about before too

448
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Yeah

449
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,920
It's great for Linux

450
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,920
It's funny though because at first it took me a while to sort of recognize it

451
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,920
At first I thought the Chromebook was kind of a threat

452
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Yeah

453
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
And the Chrome boxes

454
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,920
But now that you can replace the freaking BIOS entirely

455
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,920
When you pull off that Chrome OS BIOS

456
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,920
And you put on a custom flashed version of

457
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
Because it's just an open source

458
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
That's right

459
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,920
It is a full fledged laptop at that point

460
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
And you can always flash the Chrome OS BIOS

461
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,920
Yes, I did actually

462
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
Yeah

463
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
I did it as a

464
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,920
Go ahead

465
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,920
I've been super happy with my C720 for like I don't know six months running Ubuntu

466
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,920
I keep it as a backup in my backpack next to my Ultra Pro which runs Arch

467
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
And then when battery life drains

468
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
Because the battery life is insane on the Chromebook

469
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
Yeah

470
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,920
Wimpy you were going to make a comment about compatibility

471
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,920
Well yeah the thing is that because the Chromebooks are running Linux

472
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,920
In the main they're extremely Linux compatible

473
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,920
Totally

474
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,920
More so than some of the you know mainstream PCs

475
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,920
That are preloaded with Windows might be

476
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
Right, right

477
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,920
Well and plus also because you can put CBIOS on there

478
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,920
And then you can have an open source BIOS

479
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
I mean it really is

480
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
Yeah

481
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
Yeah I wonder if

482
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
Yeah I mean Stallman should be happy

483
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,920
Yeah I wonder if these things are getting close to being Stallman approved

484
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,920
I'm sure there must be like stuff for the Wi-Fi or something that's still

485
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
Probably negative in the freedom dimension

486
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:28,920
Yeah in his opinion if anything does allow something that is negative in the freedom dimension

487
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
It's

488
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,920
And the value of this is negative

489
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
Exactly

490
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,920
Yeah that's true, that's true

491
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Alright well let's take a break before we get into our first major topic of the day

492
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
I want to talk about Linux Academy

493
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,920
Go to linuxacademy.com

494
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,920
Right now go check them out linuxacademy.com

495
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,920
And if you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

496
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,920
You can still take advantage of the Summer of Learning 33% discount

497
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
I don't know if you can still technically, is it still in the summer?

498
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,920
Can we still call it that?

499
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,920
I hope so

500
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
Yeah it's summer like

501
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,920
Okay alright I wanted to make sure it was still summer like

502
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,920
Because I don't want you guys not to get the Summer of Learning discount

503
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,920
It is too darn important

504
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,920
There are few things in life that are as important as your education

505
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,920
As your mind as Ben Folds 5 would tell us

506
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,920
Think about your mind

507
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Sitting there floating in space

508
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,920
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

509
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,920
They've got step by step video courses

510
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,920
Downloadable comprehensive study guides

511
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,920
And you'll love this

512
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
If you're in somewhere in the course material

513
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,920
You're getting your learning on like a fool

514
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,920
You're just sucking it up like a sponge

515
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,920
Getting all kinds of smart over at Linux Academy

516
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,920
And you get to a point and guess what

517
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
In the course material you need to build a server

518
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,920
Well this is what really sucks about Linux Academy

519
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,920
You've got to stop what you're doing

520
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
You've got to go build a server

521
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
Take a couple of days

522
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
You've got to get the OS

523
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
You've got to order the parts

524
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,920
You've got to get a monitor and a keyboard and a mouse

525
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
You've got to install your

526
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,920
Not with them

527
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,920
No oh wait that's right

528
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
You don't have to do any of that

529
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Because they spin up a server for you from the fly

530
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,920
Right as you need it boom as the courseware requires

531
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,920
That the server is spun up on the back end

532
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
That's part of the server

533
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
Doesn't matter if it's AWS

534
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
Doesn't matter if it's a Linux box

535
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
Doesn't matter you guys

536
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
They have all of it there

537
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,920
Because they are a bunch of Linux experts

538
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
And educational enthusiasts

539
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,920
Who've built this system for you

540
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
Because it's from the community for the community

541
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
They're all about it

542
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,920
They recognize the issues that exist

543
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,920
With all of the educational platforms out there

544
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,920
The shortcomings

545
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,920
The problems that they have

546
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,920
Trying to reach out to Linux enthusiasts

547
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,920
And they've solved a lot of that

548
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
Almost all of it

549
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Because the only thing that's remaining is the content

550
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,920
And they are working at an unbelievable pace

551
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,920
So many courses are over there right now

552
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,920
It could take you years to work through all of it

553
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,920
And they're not done

554
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,920
They're adding more stuff every single week

555
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,920
I just had a little chat with one of the guys

556
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,920
That runs Linux Academy

557
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,920
And I got just a hint of what's coming

558
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,920
It's gonna put them

559
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,920
It's gonna set them so far ahead

560
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Of anyone else in the industry

561
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
For the next several years

562
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,920
I mean it has never been a better time

563
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
To go over to Linux Academy

564
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
And just double down on yourself

565
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,920
You can take the step-by-step courseware offline with you too

566
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,920
So that way you can educate yourself when you're in the car

567
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
If you're in the shower like Scooby Sprite

568
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,920
You can listen in the shower while you listen to Linux Academy

569
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
You know these kinds

570
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,920
It's flexible

571
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
They also give you the tool set you need

572
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,920
So that way you can attack it in a way that

573
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
Is actually manageable

574
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
That doesn't like induce anxiety

575
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,920
Because for me one of the problems is

576
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,920
I start to get these things that weigh over me

577
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,920
And then it bothers me that I'm not getting it done

578
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
I start to feel like I'm

579
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,920
You know not accomplishing everything I want

580
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
I start to feel kind of bad about that

581
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,920
Linux Academy gives me the tool set

582
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Where I can attack things as I have the time

583
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
Where I can really easily conceptualize

584
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
How long something's gonna take

585
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,920
What's gonna be involved in that process

586
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,920
And what it's gonna require for me to commit to do it

587
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,920
And that gives me the opportunity to succeed

588
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,920
Which just keeps me going

589
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,920
It keeps me going back for more and more all the time

590
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
And if I ever kind of have a lull

591
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,920
They have a really great community support system there that helps me out

592
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,920
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged

593
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
Go check them out

594
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,920
Get the Summer of Learning discount

595
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
And you'll see all the new content they have

596
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,920
I have a list right here I could read off to you

597
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
It's really amazing

598
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,920
And I think you're gonna be impressed

599
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,920
And I'll tell you if you go there right now

600
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,920
There's so much stuff

601
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
There's so much stuff you can start with

602
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,920
It's never been a better time

603
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920

605
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,920
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged

606
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,920
And they have a Nagios tutorial now up there

607
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,920
Which is pretty cool

608
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,920
It's like a five part thing

609
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Which was a big deal for me

610
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,920
When I signed up with them forever ago

611
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,920
I was like, give me Nagios, give me Nagios

612
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
Because I've never done it

613
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,920
I've never set up Nagios

614
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
And they have the whole thing up there now

615
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
We were talking about backups

616
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,920
They have a whole thing on backing up with rsync

617
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,920
So you can go take that course

618
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
Oh really?

619
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Yeah, yeah

620
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
So that's another good example

621
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Or if you want to set up NFS

622
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
If you've been wanting to do NFS file sharing

623
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,920
You're ready to get off Samba

624
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
Because you're just talking Linux to Linux

625
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
And you want to take advantage of the speed of NFS

626
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,920
They've got a whole course on NFS

627
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,920
And the thing is when you walk away from that course

628
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,920
You will have implemented an NFS server

629
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,920
So it's a one to one translatable skill set

630
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,920
And it's great for stuff that you maybe have done

631
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Once or twice for work

632
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,920
Like four years ago or whatever

633
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
And now you need to remember how to do it

634
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
For your home or whatever

635
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,920
That's what I use it for

636
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
Yep, yep

637
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
And let's be honest too

638
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
A lot of us are self taught

639
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
And there's just little areas that I have found

640
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
That even when I go back and take the most basic stuff

641
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
Like I did Linux

642
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,920
I think it's called Linux A Plus

643
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,920
I can't even remember anymore

644
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
Is that even a thing, Linux A Plus?

645
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,920
It was a really basic rudimentary course

646
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
I took years ago

647
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,920
I think it was Linux Plus I think

648
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Oh yeah, Linux Plus

649
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,920
Yeah, thank you

650
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Linux Plus, yeah

651
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,920
It's been a while

652
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,920
I actually found it

653
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
You know what?

654
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,920
It showed me a couple different ways

655
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
I could consider doing things

656
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
I actually kind of like

657
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
It picked my game up a little bit

658
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Even though it was a really intro course

659
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
This was a long time ago

660
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
But I find it to be

661
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,920
And that is true across the whole board too

662
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,920
A Plus is one of those certifications

663
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
Where you can use a mouse and keyboard

664
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,920
Uh huh, uh huh

665
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,920
That's very true

666
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
That is very true

667
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,920
I want to talk a little bit about SystemD

668
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,920
And then we'll do our Open Media Vault review

669
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Okay, so let's do the SystemD thing first

670
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
Because I think this might be a little quicker

671
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,920
We've been following SystemD since the beginning

672
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,920
And we now are in a phase

673
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,920
Where a lot of adoption has occurred

674
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,920
But there's just an immense amount of pushback

675
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,920
And I've been trying to get a sense of

676
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
Where is legitimate complaints?

677
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,920
Where do those follow?

678
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,920
And then what is just like clicker baiting

679
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,920
To get traffic to drive clicks for your ads?

680
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,920
So I've been sort of doing some digging

681
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,920
And trying to get my head around all of this

682
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,920
And I don't know if you guys have noticed this

683
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
But I certainly have noticed that

684
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,920
The vast majority of anti-SystemD articles

685
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,920
Are coming from two places

686
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,920
And they're coming at an unbelievable fever pitch rate

687
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,920
And it makes it seem like

688
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,920
It's just people after people after people

689
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
Talking about this

690
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,920
When in reality, I see two people talking about this

691
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,920
And then the rest of the internet shitting their pants

692
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
Every time they talk about it

693
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,920
And then of course it drives traffic

694
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
And gets everybody talking about it

695
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,920
Let's start with my favorite, Paul Valencia

696
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,920
Over at InfoWorld.com

697
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Paul Valencia recently wrote

698
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,920
You have Windows in my Linux

699
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,920
He says the schism over SystemD

700
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,920
Could lead to a separation of desktop and server distros

701
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Or a mass exodus of Linux server admins

702
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
Leaving to FreeBSD

703
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,920
Okay, that's just one of his many

704
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,920
And what's great is you can go look at Paul Valencia's post

705
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,920
And you can just read through his anti-SystemD crap

706
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,920
Then another, okay so that's InfoWorld.com

707
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,920
Then number two, number two

708
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,920
IT World, Jim Lynch

709
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,920
Oh yeah

710
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
This is the other guy

711
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,920
And in fact, these two guys

712
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,920
Cite each other as examples

713
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,920
To support their arguments

714
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,920
So here was, this one got a ton of traction

715
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,920
Over the weekend when I was prepping for last

716
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,920
Funny how the story didn't make it into the Linux action show

717
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
So here's the headline

718
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,920
SystemD rampages through the Linux community

719
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
Like Godzilla through Tokyo

720
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Oh my god

721
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,920
And I've got a good little collection

722
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
In the show notes of their more recent stuff

723
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
And I just went back two weeks

724
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
I just went back two weeks

725
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,920
Here's another headline

726
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,920
It's time to split Linux in two

727
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,920
Here's another one

728
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,920
These are just the same guys

729
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Over and over again

730
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,920
Writing these kinds of stuff

731
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
And here's another story

732
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,920
All in their thread

733
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,920
All their timeline

734
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,920
Here's another one where he suggested

735
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,920
Here's the other thing I love

736
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,920
This is so great

737
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
When they also

738
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,920
When Paul self-references his own previous articles

739
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,920
To support his new article

740
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,920
I love that one

741
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,920
That's a fallacy right there

742
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,920
This thing I wrote a while ago

743
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,920
In this case last week

744
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,920
Still totes legit

745
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920
So let's just reference that

746
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,920
My insane hyperbolic screed from last week

747
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,920
You know, designed to

748
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
Oh god

749
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
Right

750
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,920
And so here's a couple of things

751
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,920
That we can probably agree on

752
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,920
The arguments against System D

753
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
It violates the Unix philosophy

754
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
Hear that all the time

755
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,920
It's one big thing doing a lot of things

756
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,920
Which is false

757
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,920
Too much stuff crammed into PID1

758
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,920
What's another common System D

759
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,920
Oh, the logging

760
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,920
The binary log

761
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,920
It's bad for servers

762
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,920
This is the new one

763
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,920
Which is insane

764
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,920
This is the new one

765
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,920
It's bad for servers

766
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,920
How is it bad for servers

767
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,920
It was

768
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,920
The concept came for the requirements

769
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
Of modern day servers

770
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
That's why

771
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
Exactly

772
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
Yeah

773
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,920
It was designed for service

774
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,920
The idea that Paul Valencia argues

775
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,920
That what we need to do

776
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,920
Is we need to split Linux into two

777
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,920
And you have System D for the desktop side

778
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,920
And then the server distros don't use System D

779
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,920
Totally madness

780
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,920
Totally madness

781
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,920
Absolute craziness

782
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,920
It is absolute craziness

783
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,920
And I wonder

784
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,920
At some point

785
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,920
Do we just ignore these people

786
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,920
And move on

787
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,920
And does it actually dilute the

788
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,920
You know what

789
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
Okay

790
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,920
You guys know who Alex Jones is?

791
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
Yes

792
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
Right

793
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,920
Everybody's like

794
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Your buddy

795
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,920
Yeah

796
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
Alex

797
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,920
You think I should play the mustache clip?

798
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
Yeah, I think so

799
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
Grrr

800
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
You won't be able to hear the mustache

801
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,920
So you just have to wait a second

802
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Oh, no worries

803
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,920
Grrr

804
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
What's driving me crazy

805
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
Is that photo right there

806
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,920
Zoom in on that

807
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,920
It's one of those cops

808
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
In a black uniform with a mustache

809
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
And you just look like

810
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
An absolute clown freak

811
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,920
That works for murdering terrorists

812
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,920
That jack our food and water

813
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,920
I think you're a big joke

814
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,920
Grrr

815
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
Oh, you got a mustache

816
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
I'll just worship you

817
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,920
Oh, you got a mustache

818
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,920
It's okay

819
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,920
Nothing against mustaches

820
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,920
So my point about Alex Jones

821
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,920
Is like

822
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,920
Some people think that Alex Jones

823
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,920
Is such an out-there conspiracy theorist

824
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,920
That he makes all conspiracies

825
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
About him

826
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,920
But he doesn't

827
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,920
He doesn't

828
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
He doesn't

829
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,920
He doesn't

830
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,920
He doesn't

831
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,920
He doesn't

832
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,920
He doesn't

833
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,920
How does he even know

834
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
That he makes all conspiracy theorists

835
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,920
Look bad

836
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,920
So guys like paul valencia

837
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,920
And Jim lynch

838
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,920
They are just so far out

839
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,920
There with systemd

840
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,920
They make all systemd haters

841
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,920
Look bad

842
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,920
I just want to say

843
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,920
They've been caught

844
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,920
Yeah

845
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
They've been caught

846
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,920
Exactly

847
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,920
Hey, that's a good point

848
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,920
Right there

849
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,920
I mean if you look at it

850
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,920
They've figured out

851
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,920
A way to drive traffic to IT world

852
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,920
And info world

853
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,920
And that's just to keep

854
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,920
Writing about systemd

855
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,920
Yep

856
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,920
And then the linux drones

857
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,920
Just keep clicking it

858
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
That's right

859
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,920
That's right

860
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
And that's because it's controversial

861
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,260
much controversy anymore, not since DBNeo adopted it, I mean where's the controversy

862
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
anymore?

863
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,260
They're making it.

864
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,260
Exactly, exactly.

865
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,160
And is this argument that it's not, okay let's just, let's take the it's not very Unix-like

866
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,580
argument.

867
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,500
Is this a valid argument, A. And B, does it matter?

868
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:10,760
So I think A, I don't think it's a valid argument only in the sense that nothing else implements

869
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:16,560
some of the things that System D does, and so because there's nothing else, it's somewhat

870
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,560
of a valid argument.

871
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,200
Well, it's the most valid argument only in the sense that like it's the one that comes

872
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,400
closest to being factual, accurate, and sense-making, but it's not that great of an argument in

873
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
of itself.

874
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,680
I mean, yeah, sure, you could do, you know, you could control your mouth with, you know,

875
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,160
scripting that you've done, you know, by yourself, but no, System D does it for you.

876
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,160
I don't know.

877
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,160
It makes me angry.

878
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,160
What do you think, Evans?

879
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,520
Well, it's the agglomeration of tasks that are on System D that were separate to a large

880
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,880
degree.

881
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,880
That's the argument there.

882
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,880
Yeah.

883
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,920
Now, I know Evans said he has a counter to that argument.

884
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:55,080
Now, as the importance of the argument, I would say that one of the things we were trying

885
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:01,840
to achieve is POSIX compliance and this POSIX concept was approached because it will allow

886
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,200
us to have portable applications across operating systems.

887
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:11,720
That does require that other distros and other operating systems do apply POSIX standards,

888
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,880
which they all have variations, and to a large degree, the applications still don't work,

889
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,440
so the benefits are not there.

890
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,440
Right.

891
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,040
There's, that would be the, okay, so that's the technical, like Unix compatible definition.

892
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,160
Then you have the philosophical, lots of small tools do one thing really well, working together

893
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,080
in concert to make the overall system.

894
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,320
Well, and the fallacy with that is that System D is a collection of tools, it is not one

895
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,320
single tool.

896
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,320
Exactly.

897
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,500
Well, but it's repackaging all of those single tools into one tool, which is the philosophical

898
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,640
disagreement in terms of like the Unix side.

899
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,600
System D is a re-implementation of some of those tools that have existed for a while,

900
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,920
and I think what people push as the falsehood, which is that it's all crammed into this one

901
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,960
process called System D that happens to be PID 1 as well, which is crap.

902
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,960
It's not all one binary.

903
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,400
I still want to hear what Heaven's Revenge has to say.

904
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,880
Well, I do believe it is very Unix-y.

905
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,700
There is, a lot of people really do still misunderstand what System D is.

906
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,760
It is one thing.

907
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:23,040
It's an abstract scheduler that the user space uses to schedule things.

908
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,240
That's its purpose.

909
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,080
That's its only job.

910
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:31,360
Everything else has been built around that, which uses that functionality.

911
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:37,160
That's why it's so applicable to so many things, and that's why the System D project, the Umbrella

912
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:43,720
project, has grown to encompass so many different things because it's an abstract scheduler.

913
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,080
So many things just need simple scheduling.

914
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,960
We can't use a CPU scheduler.

915
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,200
We need a user space scheduling system.

916
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,200
That's what it is.

917
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,080
It's just an IPC mechanism for communication and a schedule.

918
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,080
That's it.

919
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,080
It is Unix-y.

920
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,080
It's just one simple thing.

921
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,840
It's just so applicable.

922
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,200
So many things can use it.

923
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,200
Okay, Wimpy.

924
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,760
Why don't you jump in?

925
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,760
Okay.

926
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,520
Well, I want to be clear.

927
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,840
I'm not a System D hater by any means.

928
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:15,880
I think it's a great advancement for Linux, but I'm going to be devil's advocate here.

929
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:23,800
One area where System D is squarely not in the Unix philosophy is that you can't pipe

930
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:29,160
the utilities together, so that was really the crux of all of the Unix utilities that

931
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:34,200
everything is text in, text out, and they can be joined together with pipes to make

932
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,240
a new utility by joining them.

933
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,240
And that simple-

934
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,240
I don't care.

935
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,240
Well, there is something to it though.

936
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,400
It gives you the ability to build such an amazingly powerful suite of tools together,

937
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,840
but at the same time, it seems like maybe we've moved from that to a different need

938
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,840
now.

939
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,840
We're modernizing in a sense, and it's not necessarily bad.

940
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,920
It's not necessarily good.

941
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,920
I think it's-

942
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,920
It's called innovation.

943
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,920
I mean, deal with it.

944
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,920
Right.

945
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,760
Well, it's called moving the platform forward to the demands of the future and not just

946
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,760
to the demands of the past.

947
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,760
Totally.

948
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,760
Yeah.

949
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,760
Exactly.

950
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,120
And I think the other thing that I recoil at when I hear people talk about System D

951
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:22,200
is a lot of times people will say, well, System D creates lock-in, and one common example

952
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,600
they will cite is GNOME now requires Login D. Login D is part of System D.

953
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:33,920
So, in extents, to get later versions of GNOME, you must have System D because you need Login

954
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,920
D.

955
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,920
Not true.

956
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,520
Well, and I'd say, is that just because of the binary logs?

957
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,960
I mean, how does a system lock in?

958
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:47,000
It's because Login D implements a set of functionalities that no other project is currently implementing.

959
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Oh, I see.

960
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
But-

961
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It's called progress.

962
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,480
Well, the thing is, is at each level there, there is an API available.

963
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:58,480
Somebody could write a replacement, a Login D, that doesn't require System D. That is

964
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,520
technically possible.

965
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,080
And this week we have seen, and this has actually happened five weeks ago, but this week I saw

966
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,280
the physical 100% truth.

967
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,280
It's in the code.

968
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,120
There is code out there right now called System BSD.

969
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:20,920
And System BSD is a reimplementation of System D APIs for freaking BSD.

970
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:27,120
So you can use things like Login D and Time D on BSD that are supposed to be System D

971
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,120
calls.

972
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:32,440
This is a physical literal demonstration of the portability right here.

973
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,960
They are moving this functionality to a completely different operating system.

974
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,960
That's right.

975
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,240
So the idea that we couldn't reimplement Login D functionality in Gen 2 is bullshit.

976
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,240
Yeah, exactly.

977
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,240
We're moving it to BSD now.

978
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,240
Yeah, exactly.

979
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:53,200
It's also emblematic of how efficacious the whole System D project has become, like Heavens

980
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,400
and Wimpy were saying.

981
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,880
That's one thing Wimpy wanted to talk about, System D shims, I believe.

982
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,880
Oh, go ahead, Wimpy.

983
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,440
Well, this is what Chris has just touched on.

984
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:11,440
One of the GSOC students for OpenBSD this year has created those Dbus APIs to replace

985
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,120
some of the System D layers so that things like Nome 3 can run.

986
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,920
But this is what Canonical have been doing for a little while now.

987
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:26,480
They've got their own System D shim that provides Login D. And that's how you work around that

988
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,280
issue at the moment and why they're able to move their Nome 3 components that they rely

989
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,280
on.

990
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,400
Isn't it, in a sense, almost a good thing because then it just gives us a common thing

991
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,400
for us to ride against?

992
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,400
Exactly.

993
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,400
Of course it's a good thing.

994
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,400
It gets rid of the fragmentation.

995
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,400
It's just IPC.

996
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,400
Yeah.

997
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,640
I mean, good ideas succeed and bad ideas fail.

998
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,720
That's one of the greatest parts about Linux.

999
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,280
When we talk about it at a factual level like this, it seems clear.

1000
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,600
I mean, it seems, yes, there's some disadvantages like we've mentioned, especially when it comes

1001
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,320
to binary logs as an old sysadmin.

1002
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,480
I'll be honest, that's hard for me.

1003
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,480
That's a fallacy.

1004
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,480
We can shoot that one down now.

1005
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:04,320
If you install a syslog daemon on a System D-enabled machine, Journal D will push everything

1006
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,320
to syslog.

1007
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,320
And that's not the only one.

1008
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,320
There's a couple of ways.

1009
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,680
There's a couple of ways to pull it off.

1010
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,680
Yeah.

1011
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,680
That's not...

1012
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,680
Yeah.

1013
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,920
There's a couple of different methods to get your old logging system back, more or less

1014
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,720
running on top of System D. So, blah.

1015
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,720
That's garbage right there.

1016
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,720
All right.

1017
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,740
I mean, we could keep going on.

1018
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:22,880
We could keep talking about it.

1019
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,320
But I just thought with this System BSD shim thing, this was particularly interesting.

1020
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,320
Oh, yeah.

1021
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,080
Narrowing it down to info world and IT world and seeing how they're playing off each other

1022
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,560
to generate a lot of controversy, which it's interesting the way it works, too, is because

1023
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,960
the things they talk about there then sort of leak their way into the communications

1024
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,720
of the regular community, and all of a sudden people take it as their own opinions and their

1025
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,920
own stances and start arguing these points that are being sort of just ginned up for

1026
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,920
traffic.

1027
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,920
Yeah.

1028
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,420
Which is what's scary about it, because these guys are considered to be thought leaders

1029
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:56,400
or whatever in terms of IT or whatever pseudo-IT information you want to, you know, blah.

1030
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,360
And so this just creates just endless controversy that's actually damaging to forward progress.

1031
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,960
I think it's damaging.

1032
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,480
You know, also, I just got to say to both Jim and Paul, if they happen to listen to

1033
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,480
this show, you guys have been caught.

1034
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,480
You're done.

1035
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,480
Busted.

1036
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,480
Busted.

1037
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,480
Busted.

1038
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,480
I almost, you know, like, I don't know.

1039
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,200
I almost wonder, do they do it intentionally?

1040
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,200
Who knows?

1041
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,200
We can't prescribe their motivations.

1042
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,200
Well, no.

1043
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,200
We can't prescribe their motivations.

1044
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:27,080
We can't prescribe their motivations, but at the same time, we can look at it and say,

1045
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,360
these are clickbaity articles.

1046
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,360
They are that.

1047
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,360
Yeah.

1048
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,440
So, yeah, especially with the headlines.

1049
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,480
That's the only explanation I can think of.

1050
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,640
And also, just to them, we have an open mumble room.

1051
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,920
So if either one of those gentlemen would like to join us and talk about it.

1052
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,920
That's right.

1053
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,920
They're absolutely welcome.

1054
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,920
We would love that.

1055
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,360
If they want to call us out on our calling them out, absolutely.

1056
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:49,280
Well, I can speak intelligently on just a piece of it really quickly in that if you've

1057
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,400
ever seen the South Park episode where they explain how Family Guy comes up with their

1058
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,840
show titles, writing in tech is a lot like that.

1059
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:02,160
Our editors give us a big tank full of stuff, and then we pick words and make sentences

1060
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,060
out of them, and then we pick an article topic.

1061
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,240
That's essentially how it works.

1062
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,800
These guys know this is absolutely linkbait.

1063
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,800
There's no debating this.

1064
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,000
I would encourage them to come on here and tell another guy that writes for a living

1065
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
that this isn't linkbait.

1066
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
That's right.

1067
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
That's right.

1068
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
It is.

1069
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Yeah.

1070
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I'm sorry.

1071
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,560
Sometimes I'm paid to do it too, but I try and come up with a little more positive stuff.

1072
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,560
I don't know.

1073
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,560
Yeah.

1074
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,560
Yeah, I think you do a good job of that.

1075
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,560
Well, and that's why I think it's so damaging.

1076
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,640
I mean, I'm speaking from five years of working as a print journalist.

1077
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:35,560
You know, I mean, this is your only two arguments for self-defense for this are either I am

1078
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:40,280
technically illiterate or I am being, or I am a tool.

1079
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:44,520
Well, it seems like peeing in your own pool too, like you're eventually poisoning the

1080
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,480
well that you draw your content from.

1081
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,480
That's right.

1082
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,480
Exactly.

1083
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,480
Generally speaking, yeah.

1084
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,960
A lot of times you've got editors that are like, especially if you've got like someone

1085
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,640
above you that's like saying, you know, if you don't hit this target, guess what?

1086
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,640
You're collecting unemployment tax.

1087
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,640
Yeah.

1088
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,640
Yeah.

1089
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,640
And that's the problem.

1090
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,640
And it's a short term thing, you know, to them.

1091
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,000
It's like, I got to make money for this month.

1092
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,720
Let's pour the turpentine into the aquifer, see what happens.

1093
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,720
Exactly.

1094
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,560
If I just have a few drinks, take a few pills, I can get through this article.

1095
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,560
I'll be all right.

1096
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,560
I can swallow it.

1097
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,560
I can swallow it.

1098
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,560
I can make it through.

1099
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,560
But that doesn't excuse it.

1100
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,560
It just creates a causality.

1101
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,560
This is why this is happening.

1102
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,560
Yeah.

1103
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,560
You know what?

1104
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,560
We'd all be a lot better if they just go write about the iWatch.

1105
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,560
There we go.

1106
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,560
I totally agree.

1107
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,560
That's a good point.

1108
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:27,560
They should go be information reporters for terrorists, you know?

1109
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,560
Yeah.

1110
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,560
That's right.

1111
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,560
That's right.

1112
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,560
Okay.

1113
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,560
All right.

1114
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,560
All right.

1115
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,560
This is getting bad.

1116
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,560
You could tell it's been a long broadcast day.

1117
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,560
Yeah.

1118
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,560
It's been a long day.

1119
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,560
Yes.

1120
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,560
We're getting punchy.

1121
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,560
Yeah.

1122
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,560
So why don't we talk, let's talk about DNF here in a second.

1123
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:49,360
Fedora 21 coming down the pipe, we just last week talked about restructuring from the ground

1124
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,280
up how you deploy software on Linux using butter FS sub volumes.

1125
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,320
I mean, this is not that.

1126
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:58,640
The DNF is not that, but it is still a new tool that's coming to manage software and

1127
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,280
producer Eric has had a little hands on time with it, so we're going to talk about that

1128
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,280
in a second.

1129
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,280
All right.

1130
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,280
I'll thank DigitalOcean.

1131
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,800
Head over to digitalocean.com right now and go get yourself your own server backed by

1132
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,480
SSDs connected to tier one bandwidth.

1133
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,000
Oh, you don't know what DigitalOcean is?

1134
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,720
My friend, let me tell you.

1135
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,720
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

1136
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,620
easy way to spin up a cloud server.

1137
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,080
Users can create a cloud server in less than 55 seconds.

1138
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,800
And pricing plans start only $5 a month, which gets you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte

1139
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:30,000
SSD, and this is the best part, one terabyte of transfer just right there.

1140
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,120
And so, you've got a CPU that backs it, you've got 20 gigabytes of SSD for incredible IO

1141
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,240
density, and you've got it connected to tier one bandwidth with a terabyte of transfer.

1142
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,800
And DigitalOcean has data center locations all over the place.

1143
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,280
They've got them in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, brand new one in London,

1144
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,520
which is great.

1145
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,480
And on top of all of that, they manage it all with their incredible intuitive control

1146
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,580
panel, which power users can replicate on a larger scale with DigitalOcean's awesome

1147
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:57,080
straightforward API.

1148
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:02,360
And they just got a little more awesome with the introduction of CoreOS.

1149
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,760
This is an amazing opportunity for you to go over there and try it out.

1150
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,120
And if you use our promo code, because we've got a promo code for you, unplug September,

1151
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,120
$10 credit.

1152
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:17,040
Like, in the past, when a server grade operating system like this came out that was truly something

1153
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,080
new, that you can tell by the industry response is already a success, it's already on the

1154
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:27,760
path to success, think about how awesome it is that if you go over to DigitalOcean.com,

1155
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,720
if you use the promo code, unplug September, you could create a CoreOS cluster and play

1156
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,520
with one of the most advanced server operating systems on the planet connected to tier one

1157
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:42,760
bandwidth on top of SSD drives using their super fast control panel for free, for two

1158
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,360
months, using the promo code, unplug September.

1159
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,360
It's huge.

1160
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:52,320
I mean, when have we ever been in this position for technology at this scale that has been

1161
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,920
this democratized that we have this level of access to?

1162
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:59,780
It is amazing to see this happen, and it's all backed by Linux on top of KVM.

1163
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,480
This is something that we saw at OSCON.

1164
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,400
People were getting fired up about CoreOS, and now it's available to everyone.

1165
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,400
Yeah.

1166
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,720
Yeah, and I thought about playing with CoreOS, and it's not the kind of thing you're going

1167
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,160
to throw in VirtualBox.

1168
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,640
That's not the right place for that.

1169
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,640
And this is such an opportunity.

1170
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,520
I mean, of course, they've got all kinds of great distros you can choose from.

1171
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,800
CoreOS has just been added.

1172
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,800
It's new.

1173
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,320
They're going to be working with CoreOS, and it's going to be...

1174
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,320
It's a game changer.

1175
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,320
It is totally a game changer.

1176
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,640
DigitalOcean itself is a game changer, matched with a bunch of game changing technology powered

1177
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:31,320
by the open source technology stack that they ride all that on top of.

1178
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,340
Now matching that up, and they didn't just go get a CoreOS image.

1179
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:39,420
They worked with the CoreOS project to make this happen because there's some management

1180
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,420
stuff they needed in there.

1181
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,580
There's some changes they needed to make, and they want to work directly with CoreOS

1182
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:47,040
to make sure that your images are backed by the CoreOS development team.

1183
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,040
It's awesome.

1184
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,480
And that's the beauty about doing that is that they can create their own custom image

1185
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,760
for what they need to give you guys a custom image.

1186
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,020
And then you manage the droplets with their great interface.

1187
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,020
That's right.

1188
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,720
DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code UNPLUGGEDSEPTEMBER when you check out.

1189
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,600
You'll get that $10 credit, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux

1190
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,600
Unplugged.

1191
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,760
Okay, Eric, so let's talk about a package manager, DNF, which literally stands for nothing,

1192
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,760
right?

1193
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,360
DNF has no acronym properties.

1194
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,880
So YUM was what, yellow update, was it manager or...

1195
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,880
Yellow dog...

1196
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,880
Updates.

1197
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,880
I can't remember now.

1198
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,880
Something manager, but yeah.

1199
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,960
Yellow update, yellow dog update manager, modified.

1200
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,760
Yellow dog update or modified is what YUM stood for.

1201
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,760
That's right.

1202
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:37,920
And DNF was created by the Fordora Project and also Red Hat Sponsoring to take what is

1203
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,560
YUM and make it better.

1204
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,560
I know.

1205
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:48,040
But at first I didn't quite understand because I didn't really see a big benefit to DNF.

1206
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:53,920
So for example, I would be using DNF to update my packages, to install a new version of something

1207
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,840
or to install Chromium or something like that, right?

1208
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,400
I would now call on the DNF command instead of YUM command.

1209
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,400
Correct.

1210
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,400
Now here's what it is.

1211
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:06,440
It's a drop-in replacement for YUM that is going to actually take on the name of YUM

1212
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,720
come Fedora 22.

1213
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:11,400
And you actually literally mean drop-in, like you were playing with symlinks and stuff,

1214
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,400
right?

1215
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,400
Yeah, exactly.

1216
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:20,960
I took and I renamed my YUM binary to YUM-Legacy and then I made a symlink for DNF to YUM.

1217
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,160
And now anytime anything in my system calls on the YUM command, it's actually calling

1218
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,160
on DNF.

1219
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,160
Now why did you do that?

1220
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,240
I did that just to experiment to see if it would work and it does.

1221
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,240
It's flawless.

1222
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,720
In fact, it runs faster than YUM.

1223
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,600
DNF is still using RPM packages on the backend.

1224
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,520
It's managing dependency resolution just like YUM does.

1225
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,320
It's using repo files like YUM does.

1226
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,880
It's using the exact same file structure that YUM has.

1227
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,960
The difference is that where YUM pulls down each package individually, when one package

1228
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:53,400
gets done, it will actually pull down several packages simultaneously, therefore using your

1229
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:58,840
bandwidth to the best of its ability and also using your system processes to the best of

1230
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,840
their ability.

1231
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,880
And they've recently introduced Delta RPM support.

1232
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,880
Correct.

1233
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,800
They introduced Delta RPM support by default before that they had it just as an experimental

1234
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,380
setting it could make.

1235
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:09,960
Now it's in there by default.

1236
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,560
And I guess it looks like they have a DNF package history.

1237
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,920
Maybe you could do some rollback stuff.

1238
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,920
I don't know if that's in there yet.

1239
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,920
That's right.

1240
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,920
Is that in there?

1241
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,800
It's in there, but that's one of those things that still has to be enabled by config file.

1242
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:25,660
So it doesn't sound like it's a huge change, but it kind of sounds like it's a direction

1243
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:29,000
to just, it's like we're starting here and we're going to move this forward a little

1244
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
bit.

1245
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Right.

1246
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
It's actually a rewrite.

1247
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,840
I'm not asking if it's completely new or if it's modified.

1248
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,340
It's actually a complete rewrite from the ground up.

1249
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:41,320
And I think this is going to be across Red Hat Enterprise, Fedora, and CentOS will all

1250
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,320
be using DNF.

1251
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,320
Correct.

1252
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,240
By the time those versions release in the future, I mean we're talking, the first one's

1253
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,320
going to be Fedora 22 and then the next one is going to be, well you're going to see CentOS

1254
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:58,440
and Red Hat in whatever version they decide to release that in probably like a 7.2, 7.3.

1255
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:03,040
I was always kind of surprised that we didn't see any other RPM distros adopt YUM.

1256
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,920
I wonder if we'll see DNF adopted by that.

1257
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,920
Yeah.

1258
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:19,040
I see other RPM distros like, Sousa's got Zipper, and Mandrake has RPMI or Mandriva.

1259
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,280
They have their own thing.

1260
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,760
I have yet to experiment with that because I haven't, I don't know, it just seems like

1261
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,760
an irrelevant.

1262
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,480
RPMI was, I don't know if that's what they still use, but back in the day when I was

1263
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,360
a Mandrake user, that was almost RPM good enough for me.

1264
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:35,400
I could almost, Matt, did you ever play with Mandrake's URPMI, I think was what it was

1265
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,400
called?

1266
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,400
No, I didn't.

1267
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,880
I never spent as much time with Mandrake as I should have.

1268
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,240
I kind of toyed around with it a little bit, and then of course the RPM stigma hit me initially

1269
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,240
and I just ran away almost immediately.

1270
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,240
I seem to remember like-

1271
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,240
I remember that.

1272
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,240
I don't remember it.

1273
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,880
I seem to remember URPMI made it easy to add repos.

1274
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,240
It had like a lot of app-like features.

1275
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,240
Oh yeah?

1276
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,240
I always pronounce it your erp me.

1277
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,240
I think they still use it.

1278
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,240
Okay.

1279
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,240
Okay.

1280
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,240
Interesting.

1281
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,240
Anybody in the mumble room had a chance to play with the DNF or the new Fedora release

1282
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,240
with any thoughts?

1283
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,480
I'm looking at you, Colonel Linux, and I'm thinking, you're a CentOS guy.

1284
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,480
I am a CentOS guy, unfortunately.

1285
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,440
I've been out of town for the last week.

1286
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,960
When these kind of things, though, come down the pipe, do you load up Fedora and think

1287
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,680
to yourself, okay, I'm going to learn how this is going to be for my servers in the

1288
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,680
future?

1289
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,320
Or is that like a thing that you Red Hat guys do, or how does that work?

1290
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,600
That used to be exactly what I did.

1291
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:29,520
In fact, it's so much to the point that I would teach myself new features of Red Hat

1292
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,520
on Fedora.

1293
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,760
Unfortunately, it doesn't work like that anymore.

1294
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,920
The projects have split so decidedly in two different ways.

1295
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,120
There's almost no similarity between the two.

1296
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,480
That's interesting.

1297
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:48,240
So I look at... In fact, when I was at LinuxCon, I actually learned that I should stop looking

1298
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:56,920
at CentOS to see what Red Hat's like, because apparently those two are going to become very

1299
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,640
different.

1300
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,640
That's a little confusing.

1301
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,640
That is very confusing.

1302
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,640
Yeah, for real.

1303
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,640
Yeah, but so apparently even now, and I haven't had a chance to confirm this, but apparently

1304
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,320
even with 7, there are differences between Red Hat Enterprise and CentOS.

1305
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:14,080
They're no longer just recompiled binaries.

1306
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,080
That makes me unhappy.

1307
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,080
That's not good, because-

1308
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,560
I'm holding out judgment until I find out exactly what the long-term plan... Because

1309
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:27,160
let's say they take CentOS and make it into an enterprise desktop operating system.

1310
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,320
I'm okay with that, as long as projects like... What's another one?

1311
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,320
Scientific Linux still exist.

1312
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:36,600
As long as it's something I can go to where I can build binaries on some sort of a cost-free

1313
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,320
platform that has access to repos.

1314
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,200
As long as I can do that, I think-

1315
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,080
I think that's going to be Fedora.

1316
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:49,200
I think Fedora.cloud and Fedora.server are going to... Yeah, Fedora.cloud, Fedora.server.

1317
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,960
Whatever they name it is fine with me, as long as I have something.

1318
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,360
And that's one thing that's coming out, is that the next... Fedora 21 is going to be

1319
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,800
the first one that goes by that Fedora Next moniker.

1320
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,800
Yeah.

1321
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:05,280
Boy, that's going to be a transition that is going to take a while to play out, and

1322
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,440
meanwhile Red Hat Enterprise Linux will be standing still.

1323
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:12,240
At some point, Red Hat Enterprise Linux will have to catch up to all this Fedora Next stuff.

1324
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,020
How do they make that transition?

1325
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,840
Because Fedora Next is a totally different beast.

1326
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:21,120
You can have a real minimal Fedora Next, and they're even talking about a Fedora Next version

1327
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,000
that's essentially rolling in a way.

1328
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,640
Well, especially... Well, yeah, they have Rawhide, but if you look at it, they're going

1329
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:31,520
to have to deal with the server, the workstation, cloud, and whatever that fourth one is.

1330
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,520
I'm not talking about Rawhide.

1331
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,520
Yeah, I'm talking about RAIL.

1332
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,620
No, I'm saying in Red... I'm saying one of the things they're talking about in Red Hat

1333
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:39,440
is making it so that way... I don't think they're going to be there yet, but I think

1334
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,800
they are designing it with the intention of sort of like Core OS, where you isolate out

1335
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:48,480
the server applications and the base OS is rolling.

1336
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,320
Yeah, and Fedora's already doing that.

1337
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,760
RAIL's probably just going to take on what they're doing and have a workstation.

1338
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,880
That's one thing RAIL does not have, is they don't have a workstation.

1339
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,200
Fedora could have redhatenterprise.workstation.

1340
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,760
That's right, Red Hat Enterprise Workstation.

1341
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,760
It's going to be CentOS.

1342
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,200
Well, I mean, if you look at the way SUSE does it, they have workstation and server,

1343
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,760
so why doesn't Red Hat have something like that?

1344
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,560
I wouldn't say because SUSE does something, Red Hat should do it.

1345
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,160
Yeah, I'm not saying that.

1346
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:21,080
I'm saying... I just think it's surprising that they don't have something like that already.

1347
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,280
Well, like Noah mentioned when he was down at LinuxCon, it's like, come on, give me a

1348
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:28,200
distro that I can put on the desktops that matches the servers.

1349
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,200
We'll see what they do.

1350
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,200
Yeah.

1351
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,400
Well, I'm looking for... Yeah, there's some Fedora haters in the chat room, but I actually

1352
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,760
think Fedora's starting to become a really interesting project again.

1353
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,760
Yeah, well, honestly-

1354
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:37,760
I agree.

1355
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,640
Honestly, beginning of July, I could have been included with one of those Fedora haters.

1356
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,240
I decided to go ahead and try it.

1357
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,240
You've been running the 21 beta?

1358
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,240
No, I've been trying 20.

1359
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,240
Oh, 20.

1360
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,240
I've just been running the solid 20.

1361
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,240
What are you, a masochist?

1362
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,240
Yeah.

1363
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,240
What's the matter?

1364
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,240
No.

1365
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,240
Come on, man.

1366
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,840
No, I did it because I wanted to get familiar with the system, and I wanted to learn how

1367
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,480
they do it, and what they do-

1368
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,520
Well, you see cool stuff coming out of the project.

1369
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,520
Exactly.

1370
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,520
Yeah.

1371
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,400
You know, I've been saying this for a little while now.

1372
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,040
We're seeing... Most of the innovation is coming from the Fedora project.

1373
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,040
Like ALIGX?

1374
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,040
Yep.

1375
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,040
Wait, what?

1376
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,040
What?

1377
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,040
No.

1378
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,040
Random assortment of letters.

1379
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:20,200
Don't you guys remember ALIGLX versus XGL, and those were the two back-end compositors,

1380
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,400
and then you read Compass Fusion on top of that?

1381
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,400
Come on.

1382
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,400
It's not that old of a reference.

1383
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,400
Jeez.

1384
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,400
Thankfully, perfect.

1385
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:32,360
What I'm saying is that Red Hat and through Fedora is pushing most of the innovation in

1386
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,880
Linux that I'm seeing, other than Canonical with their thing.

1387
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:35,880
Yeah.

1388
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,880
What?

1389
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:37,880
Yeah, I know, right?

1390
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:38,880
Oh.

1391
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,440
No, unless Popey's here, we pretend like Canonical doesn't do anything.

1392
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,440
Oh, okay.

1393
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,760
So, anyways, some British company, I don't know.

1394
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:47,760
I kid.

1395
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,760
Wow.

1396
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,760
Yeah.

1397
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,760
No, I see where you-

1398
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,760
Yeah.

1399
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,760
They're pushing the innovation.

1400
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:53,760
They're pushing things forward, and you wanted to be there.

1401
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,760
You wanted to see it.

1402
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,760
Yeah.

1403
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,360
I wanted to see what it was like, and sadly, I think that as far as they push it, it doesn't

1404
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:02,160
run as well on my hardware for some reason.

1405
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,640
I've got a little bit more experimentation to do, but-

1406
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,600
So maybe back to a different distro for you?

1407
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,600
Perhaps Arch or Ubuntu.

1408
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,600
I don't know.

1409
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,160
Have you considered trying 21, just to see if it runs better?

1410
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,160
I might.

1411
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,320
Yeah, you've got this weird UI leg thing that happens from time to time.

1412
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,320
Yeah.

1413
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,320
That is really strange.

1414
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,320
That would drive me crazy.

1415
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,320
Yeah.

1416
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,920
It's like, and I can watch it in like Ahtop or something, or even Top, and it's like,

1417
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,920
I get this random spike from Gnome Shell, the Gnome Shell process, and it shoots up

1418
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,440
to like 13% and back down, and then 13% back down.

1419
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,440
And that's Gnome 3.12, right?

1420
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,440
That's Gnome 3.12.

1421
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,440
Stable?

1422
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,440
Stable.

1423
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,440
Yeah.

1424
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,440
I don't know why it's doing that.

1425
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,440
It just is.

1426
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,440
Have you played it all with Korora?

1427
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,440
I have.

1428
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,440
Which is a sort of a re-spin of Fedora with some-

1429
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,840
I have not.

1430
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,240
All it really does is include RPM Fusion and a few other things.

1431
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,800
RPM Fusion and like Codex and like Flash.

1432
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,800
Yeah.

1433
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,800
All of which come from RPM Fusion.

1434
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,800
Binary drivers.

1435
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,800
Yeah.

1436
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,800
Yeah.

1437
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,800
So-

1438
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,800
Yeah.

1439
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,800
It just makes it a little bit easier to get going.

1440
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,800
Yeah.

1441
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,800
It does.

1442
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,800
It definitely is a time saver.

1443
01:05:58,800 --> 01:05:59,800
I have yet to actually try it, but it's not a bad idea.

1444
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,800
Just try it around.

1445
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,800
Yeah.

1446
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,680
We'll have a review of Fedora 21 whenever they eventually ship it.

1447
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,680
They've just delayed it again.

1448
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,680
Yeah.

1449
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,680
So-

1450
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,680
Yeah.

1451
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,680
It's been two weeks delayed so far, and we'll see what happens.

1452
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,680
Yeah.

1453
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,680
We'll see what happens.

1454
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,680
I don't know.

1455
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:13,680
All right, Matt.

1456
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,680
Well, I think that was everything we were going to cover in today's episode.

1457
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,880
We'll have episode 330 of the Linux Action Show on Sunday.

1458
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,880
Wow.

1459
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,880
So that'll be a big show.

1460
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:21,880
Yeah.

1461
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,880
Huge.

1462
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:23,880
That's a lot of shows.

1463
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:24,880
Wow.

1464
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,880
That's show after show after show.

1465
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,880
So if you'd like to get a hold of us, we'd love to get your feedback.

1466
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,000
Go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com, click the contact link, and choose Linux Unplugged

1467
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:37,520
from the dropdown, or maybe even better, be part of the in-crowd, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1468
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,480
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com is a great place for comments, feedback, what were you saying?

1469
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:42,480
Open media vault.

1470
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,480
Oh, God.

1471
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:44,480
Yeah.

1472
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,480
We're going to do an open media vault review.

1473
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,480
Yeah.

1474
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,480
All right.

1475
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,480
Geez.

1476
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,480
We better do that before we go.

1477
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,480
I can't-

1478
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,480
These shows have been going long, these shows.

1479
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,480
Oh, it felt like a marathon today.

1480
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,480
It has been a marathon.

1481
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,480
We can do it next week.

1482
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,480
No, no, no.

1483
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,040
No, we said we'd do it.

1484
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,040
We can do it, right?

1485
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,040
I mean, we should do it.

1486
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,040
Yeah.

1487
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,000
We should probably get it done today.

1488
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,040
So let's start with open media vault.

1489
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:10,720
Now, the open media vault is something that we've had many requests to review on the show,

1490
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,680
and it's something I haven't gotten around to, because I'll be honest, I'm pretty happy

1491
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,280
with my FreeNAS setup.

1492
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,440
Pretty happy with my FreeNAS setup.

1493
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,800
But I'd like to hear, well, maybe you guys can convert me away.

1494
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,800
Yeah, yeah.

1495
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:27,240
So Wimpy, do you want to start on the... Because I know you gave it a kick the tires.

1496
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,120
I'm not sure who else in the mumble room today got a shot, but Wimpy, I'd love to hear what

1497
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,600
your thoughts were with it, and maybe what your use case was.

1498
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,600
Right.

1499
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:36,080
Well, I run open media vault at home.

1500
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,440
I've got two open media vault servers.

1501
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:45,240
I've got one which is the current stable version, which is 0.5, and I've got what will be the

1502
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:49,360
1.0 release, which is coming up soon, running on the other box.

1503
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:58,360
And primarily I'm using that for NFS and Samba sharing, and Plex media serving, and torrenting

1504
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:04,360
ISO images, and just about everything you can imagine.

1505
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,800
There's a plug-in for everything.

1506
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,800
Nice.

1507
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:14,680
So the 0.5 version sits on top of a Debian squeeze base OS, and what will be the 1.0

1508
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,480
release sits on a Debian Weezy base.

1509
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:20,200
So you can install from an ISO image.

1510
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:25,240
It's super simple, it's preceded, so you have the ISO in, it tells you it's going to trash

1511
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:30,680
all your disks, which it does, and then you end up with an install, and you can boot into

1512
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:36,600
the web UI, you manage everything from the web UI, and it does, if you've ever used any

1513
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,600
of the...

1514
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,600
It's very FreeNAS-looking.

1515
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,600
Yeah.

1516
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:46,120
Well, the guy that started Open Media Vault actually departed from the FreeNAS project.

1517
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:51,640
So he was one of the original FreeNAS developers, and they had some sort of disagreement.

1518
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:56,360
I'm not quite sure what the details were, but the guy that's doing this is a refugee

1519
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,360
from FreeNAS.

1520
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,360
A refugee.

1521
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,360
A refugee from FreeNAS.

1522
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,360
Wow.

1523
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,360
What was the file system?

1524
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,160
Well, you've got a choice.

1525
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:08,600
So when you actually create your disks, it's got Linux software RAID on there.

1526
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,600
I'm talking about the stable version at the moment.

1527
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:17,360
There's a plug-in for LVM, and then you can choose any of the file systems with the exception

1528
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:21,960
of ButterFS, which is not available in the stable version, because in Squeeze, that's

1529
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,680
really, really experimental.

1530
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:31,280
I hear talk, I don't know how far along it is, that they're working on a plug-in for

1531
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:39,020
the 1.0 release to natively support ButterFS without the use of LVM and software RAID,

1532
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:43,200
so that you could go completely to ButterFS, but I don't know if that's definitely happening

1533
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:47,600
or how far along it is, but I've seen several references to it.

1534
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,120
There has been some talk about ZFS as well, but I can't quite tell whether they're serious

1535
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,480
about that or not.

1536
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:57,600
So disk management, adding additional storage, sort of like if you wanted to go drubble on

1537
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,960
this thing and just sort of add disks over time, sounds like I'm kind of falling back

1538
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:06,800
on traditional disk management utilities in Linux to add capacity and grow volumes and

1539
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,800
things like that?

1540
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,480
Only if you want to.

1541
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:18,520
So for example, I think you've talked about SnapRaid in one of the shows somewhere ago,

1542
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:25,240
and also GreyHole, so you can also use SnapRaid and GreyHole if you want to instead of traditional

1543
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,240
RAID solutions.

1544
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,240
Okay.

1545
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,240
That's not bad.

1546
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,240
I like that.

1547
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,520
I mean, like I said, there's plug-ins for everything.

1548
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,480
There's some boring stuff.

1549
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:38,920
And the plug-ins would be things like, I would assume things like Plex backup, stuff like

1550
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:39,920
that?

1551
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,240
Well, let's look what I've got at the moment.

1552
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:47,320
So at the moment I've got, hang on a sec, let's bring it all up.

1553
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,880
And I'm sure Sync Tools too, right?

1554
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,880
I'm sure that's another...

1555
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:50,880
Yeah.

1556
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,340
So I've got BitSync installed on there.

1557
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:57,760
So when you install the plug-in, it installs BitSync as a service, as a daemon, and then

1558
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:04,640
has a UI that then integrates into the web UI of the OpenMediaVault thing, and you can

1559
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,800
put your shared secrets in there and all that kind of stuff.

1560
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,320
Actually I would say the UI looks a little nicer than FreeNAS.

1561
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,000
It definitely looks cleaner.

1562
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:20,860
I've got a plug-in for Calibre, I've got one for Potato, another one for Cups, another

1563
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:25,660
one which is just a generic downloader which I use for grabbing torrents and web links

1564
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:29,200
and stuff like that and YouTube videos.

1565
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:33,060
It's got a web front-end for navigating your file system.

1566
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:38,080
Like I said, if you want it, it's got Grey Hole which is an alternative storage pool,

1567
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:46,440
file system manager, headphones, mini-DLNA I use for streaming to amps and stuff that

1568
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,080
only speak DLNA.

1569
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:54,440
And then there's a MySQL plug-in, an NGINX plug-in, oh you'll like this one, there's

1570
01:11:54,440 --> 01:12:10,640
a ToneCloud plug-in, OpenVPN, Roundcube mail server, and then RSnapshot which I touched

1571
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,040
on earlier, and then SabNZB and SickBeard.

1572
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:18,620
And all of these plug-ins, they don't just install a bit of software, but they actually

1573
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:23,920
have a front-end GUI that integrates into the OpenMediaVault web UI.

1574
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:24,920
This would sound a killer.

1575
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:25,920
To take a box and dedicate it to this.

1576
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,920
Yeah.

1577
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,920
So it all runs through the browser?

1578
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:28,920
Yeah, yeah.

1579
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:29,920
Oh, this sounds awesome.

1580
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:38,040
And then it looks like the browser management software also will go out and update the plug-ins

1581
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,040
too.

1582
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,040
It does, yeah.

1583
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,040
It has an update manager.

1584
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:45,520
It's like a front-end to app to basically, so there's an update manager.

1585
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,800
I mean there's another plug-in here, I've used it a bit, there's one for VirtualBox

1586
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:58,880
so you can create virtual machines on there, transmission plug-ins, VDR for DVB and DVB-S

1587
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,880
and DVB-T.

1588
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,120
What's it using for a base?

1589
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,120
It's all Debian.

1590
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,120
Wow.

1591
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:08,720
So this is one of the reasons I like it, because although I've got the CUPS plug-in installed,

1592
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:14,000
I've got, I think Google called them a classic printer, which basically means not a cloud

1593
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:21,080
print enabled printer, but because it's all just Debian underneath, I've been able to,

1594
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:26,520
someone's written a native Linux implementation of the cloud print API, which sits on top

1595
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:27,800
of CUPS.

1596
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:36,120
So I've been able to install that on my OpenMedia Vault box to turn my classic printer into

1597
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:40,200
a cloud print printer, so now we can print from our Android phones and tablets.

1598
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,200
Oh, that's cool.

1599
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:45,760
So because it's straight up Debian, I can do everything on the box that I would want

1600
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,760
to do.

1601
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,760
I was just looking for a solution for that.

1602
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,200
Yeah, I was thinking about the same thing.

1603
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,720
So is that also how you got Plex running on it?

1604
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:54,200
Plex is just a plug-in for OpenMedia Vault.

1605
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,200
Oh, this is so cool.

1606
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,200
Yeah.

1607
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,200
Wow.

1608
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:05,400
So the standard plug-ins, there's maybe about a dozen, there's then a website, it's omv-extras.org

1609
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:10,760
and this is where the community publish their plug-ins and this is where you get all the

1610
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:11,760
good stuff from.

1611
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:12,760
omv-extras.org.

1612
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:13,760
Oh yeah.

1613
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:14,760
Oh yeah.

1614
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:15,960
I'm looking at this.

1615
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:16,960
This is great.

1616
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:21,160
And you can see they've got stable testing and unstable repositories.

1617
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,160
WordPress.

1618
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,160
Uh-huh.

1619
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:24,960
Oh, this is pretty awesome, actually.

1620
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,960
It's brilliant.

1621
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:26,960
There's couch potato.

1622
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,960
That's where they're right there.

1623
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,560
See, can you see why I keep banging on about it?

1624
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:30,560
Yeah, I do.

1625
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,560
Yeah.

1626
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,560
Wow.

1627
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,560
Don't stop either.

1628
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,560
Yeah.

1629
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,560
Rochure, WordPress.

1630
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,560
Mumble server if you want it.

1631
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:37,560
I love it.

1632
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,560
A mumble server.

1633
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,560
Wow.

1634
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,560
Mini DLNA.

1635
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,560
I can't believe it's Roundcube.

1636
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,560
I mean, Roundcube.

1637
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,560
Wow.

1638
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,560
You run your mails around.

1639
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,560
Me likey.

1640
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:46,560
Yeah.

1641
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,560
That is really cool.

1642
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,560
This is amazing.

1643
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,560
Makes me want to put on a droplet too for some of the mail features.

1644
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,560
I know, right?

1645
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,560
That'll just open up another droplet right now.

1646
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,560
It's going to happen.

1647
01:14:52,560 --> 01:15:00,800
So if you want to put it on a droplet, I've got some instructions here about how to install

1648
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:08,160
a Debian system and then overlay and I'll paste it in the IRC now.

1649
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,160
Cool.

1650
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,160
I'll grab that.

1651
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:13,360
You can convert an existing Debian install.

1652
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:18,240
You can convert a base Debian Weezy into an Open Media Vault install.

1653
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,240
Wow.

1654
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,240
Score.

1655
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,240
And they also have ISO images, I imagine.

1656
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,240
Yeah, they do.

1657
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,240
They have ISO images for 0.5.

1658
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,240
Log it into the demo right now.

1659
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,240
Yeah.

1660
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:35,080
What I suggest is create a virtual box machine with one disk that you allocate for the OS

1661
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:39,760
and then add like five virtual disks for your RAID.

1662
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:43,720
And when you install it, install it onto the OS disk and then you can actually go in and

1663
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:49,040
use all of the disk management tools and actually experiment with LVMs and RAID or SNAP RAID

1664
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,040
or whatever.

1665
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:54,200
And once you've figured out how to do it in a VM, then you can go and reproduce it on

1666
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,200
real hardware.

1667
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,200
Yeah.

1668
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,200
Boy.

1669
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,200
Wow.

1670
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,400
See, I was kind of expecting Open Media Vault to be a bit of a stinker because I was like,

1671
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,680
how are you going to compete with FreeNAS?

1672
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,760
But it sounds like it's a pretty big contender.

1673
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,760
Big time.

1674
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:08,720
The only difference for me with FreeNAS would be, of course, ZFS support, but...

1675
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:14,160
I wonder if you could just install that.

1676
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,160
I don't know.

1677
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:19,920
I know that in the forum, some people have been talking about it.

1678
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:25,320
So I can't quite tell whether the lead developer is anti-ZFS because of his falling out.

1679
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,360
Oh, that's a good one.

1680
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,360
Right.

1681
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,360
He got burned.

1682
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,600
Whether he just doesn't want to take on supporting it under Linux.

1683
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:37,400
But I think at the moment, very much it's sort of the traditional tools and then the

1684
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:43,960
plugins for SnapRaid and GreyHole, which give you those, you know, disks at random.

1685
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:44,960
Yeah.

1686
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:45,960
I think that would do it.

1687
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:46,960
Yeah.

1688
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:47,960
GreyHole and SnapRaid are pretty good.

1689
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:48,960
Could be a FreeNAS killer.

1690
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:49,960
This looks deadly.

1691
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:56,520
JBLive3 in the chat room says that he installed Open Media Vault on a Debian install with

1692
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,520
LXDE.

1693
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,080
And then he used that to migrate from Windows Home Server when Microsoft pulled the plug

1694
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,480
on that.

1695
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,920
Someone saying that there is a ZFS plugin for Open Media Vault 1.

1696
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:10,440
I can't see that on my system, but apparently it's there.

1697
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,440
Okay.

1698
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,440
Cool.

1699
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,760
Rikai has a link in the chat room right now.

1700
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,760
I will grab that too.

1701
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,800
So I will put links to converting a Debian install to Open Media Vault.

1702
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,840
I'll put a link to ZFS on Open Media Vault.

1703
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:21,840
So we'll have all of that.

1704
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:26,160
Is there anything else we should talk about on Open Media Vault before we run?

1705
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,160
Performance is stellar.

1706
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:32,680
So I've got really, really humble hardware and I'm using it as a Plex server and it does

1707
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:36,800
real-time HD transcoding.

1708
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,840
Wonder how it would run on my Netbook server thingy.

1709
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,640
What sort of processor have you got in it?

1710
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,640
It's an Atom N270.

1711
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,880
Okay.

1712
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:46,880
That's probably better than...

1713
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,880
Hang on.

1714
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:48,880
Let me just find out.

1715
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:49,880
I've got something terrible.

1716
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,880
Are you serious?

1717
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:51,880
Wow.

1718
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:52,880
What have you got?

1719
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:53,880
A couple gigs of RAM on it?

1720
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,880
You're probably right.

1721
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,880
I've got AMD Turion 2 Neo.

1722
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,880
So...

1723
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:57,880
Yeah.

1724
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:58,880
Yeah.

1725
01:17:58,880 --> 01:17:59,880
So mine is more powerful.

1726
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:00,880
So...

1727
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:01,880
This is all cringing.

1728
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:04,640
Well, the other thing I was going to...

1729
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,880
What about...

1730
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,880
It's good and bad.

1731
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,360
On FreeNAS, when you install a plug-in, they're sandboxed.

1732
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,040
They're isolated in a sense.

1733
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:18,000
But on Open Media Vault, when you install Plex, is it able to see all of your file shares?

1734
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,840
Because to me, one of the disadvantages of the way FreeNAS does it is then I have to

1735
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,920
do this funky way to mount my data into that plug-in or into that jail.

1736
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:26,920
Exactly.

1737
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:27,920
Yeah.

1738
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:28,920
Totally.

1739
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:29,920
Right.

1740
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:30,920
But if Open Media Vault could just see the file system, that would actually be better

1741
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:31,920
than Torrent Sync.

1742
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,920
Exactly.

1743
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:33,920
Yeah.

1744
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:34,920
So that's how it works.

1745
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:41,040
So in the UI, you have a section for physical disks, which is just all your drives.

1746
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:45,600
From there, depending on how you want to set it up, you use either LVM or RAID or SNAP

1747
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,980
RAID or whatever.

1748
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:49,280
And then you end up with some file systems.

1749
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:54,000
And those are the things that you actually format with your file system of choice.

1750
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,640
And from there, using the UI, when you're in Plex, and it embeds the Plex UI in the

1751
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:04,320
tool, you can point at anything that the OS can see.

1752
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:09,920
But by default, it wants to use one of the media shares, as they're so called.

1753
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:10,920
Okay.

1754
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:11,920
Yeah.

1755
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,500
So I create a file system.

1756
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,360
On there, I create a shared folder called Music.

1757
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:20,360
And when I go to Plex, I say add the media music.

1758
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,360
And off it goes.

1759
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,360
Easy.

1760
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,880
But you can point it at anything in the system if you wanted to.

1761
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,880
Okay.

1762
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:26,880
Interesting.

1763
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:27,880
That's cool.

1764
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:32,600
That would be a tool that I would want that is not in the plugins page that you referenced.

1765
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,600
The OMV extras.

1766
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,800
I mean, it's pretty awesome.

1767
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,800
Yeah.

1768
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,960
And someone's just posted in the chat room, and I found it.

1769
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:46,880
In the 1.0 version that I'm running, you have to enable the ZFS repository, and now the

1770
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,880
plugin shows up.

1771
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,880
Okay.

1772
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,880
Yeah.

1773
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,640
Rick, I just posted more up-to-date instructions as well.

1774
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:52,640
That's awesome.

1775
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,040
Putting links to all this stuff in the show notes for folks that are listening on the

1776
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,040
downloads.

1777
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,040
You guys can grab that.

1778
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,040
Wimpy, thanks for the review.

1779
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:01,640
Anybody else in the Mumber Room have any Open Media Vault experience to chime in with before

1780
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,640
we run?

1781
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:03,640
Is that?

1782
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,640
That's a good cover.

1783
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,640
We got great coverage from Wimpy.

1784
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:06,640
So, yeah.

1785
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:10,800
I'm going to be checking it out, so thank you very much for filling us in on that.

1786
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,880
And keep us posted as you discover new things or try new things with it.

1787
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,320
Let us know how it goes.

1788
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:18,360
You mind being our Open Media Vault correspondent?

1789
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,920
That's absolutely fine.

1790
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:20,920
Okay.

1791
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:21,920
Good.

1792
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,920
Along with Ubuntu Mate.

1793
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:23,920
Mate.

1794
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:24,920
Yeah.

1795
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:27,440
You know, just add it to the list, Wimpy.

1796
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,440
It's good.

1797
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,440
Yeah.

1798
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,440
Just a few.

1799
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,440
Yeah.

1800
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,440
All right.

1801
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,440
Well, thank you very much.

1802
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,440
Okay.

1803
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,440
So, that will bring us to the end of today's episode.

1804
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,440
Don't forget we do Linux Unplugged live, like today.

1805
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:37,440
Boy, was today live.

1806
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,440
Wow.

1807
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:39,440
Go over to jblive.tv.

1808
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:46,280
We usually start at 2 p.m. Pacific, but jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar has that in your local time.

1809
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:50,320
And if you don't join us for next Tuesday, at least show up on Sunday for the big show.

1810
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:53,520
Linux action show Sunday, 10 a.m. Pacific, jblive.tv.

1811
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,920
Matt, that's going to wrap us up.

1812
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:56,920
Have a great week.

1813
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:57,920
All right.

1814
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,920
Yeah, you too.

1815
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,960
I'll see you on Sunday for episode 330.

1816
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,440
That's crazy.

1817
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,360
Eric, thank you for joining us in the studio.

1818
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,360
It was great.

1819
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,360
Any time.

1820
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,680
And thanks for joining me earlier today.

1821
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:13,600
If you guys want to watch our coverage of the iThink event, it'll be posted on Jupyter

1822
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,600
Broadcasting.

1823
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,720
It might not be on YouTube because they're pulling our crap down like crazy, but you

1824
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:21,840
can hear Eric's commentary and insights as well as mine in the mumble room from today's

1825
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,840
event.

1826
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,320
You can watch that in Tech Talk today, episode 55.

1827
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,320
All right, everyone.

1828
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,600
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1829
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:54,520
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1830
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:25,800
I'm so glad I learned about Open Media Vault.

1831
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,800
Yeah.

1832
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:27,800
That was crazy cool.

1833
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:28,800
That was way cooler than I was expecting.

1834
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:29,800
I mean, you have to-

1835
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,480
I've only covered like half the plugins as well.

1836
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:38,000
I mean, there's just so much to it and there's a bunch built into the stock system.

1837
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,560
I mean, just reading that page is absolutely nuts.

1838
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,320
There's nothing I could think of that I would want from network attack storage.

1839
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,360
And they're the community-contributed ones.

1840
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:52,120
There's a whole heap of useful stuff built in, so I've got the UPS monitoring online

1841
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,120
as well.

1842
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,120
Yeah, I saw that too.

1843
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,120
That's cool.

1844
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,120
Hey, Wimpy, I forgot to ask this.

1845
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:58,320
Is there a way that I could stick it to a virtual machine and just play with for a while

1846
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,720
before I actually install it on real man?

1847
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:00,720
