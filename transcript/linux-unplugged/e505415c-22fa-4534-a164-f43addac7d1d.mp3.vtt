WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
You know, we had a little pre-show topic I thought maybe we could bring up.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
Thanks to Raku Dave who gave us a TLDR and a translation in the Linux Action Show subreddit.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
A little update on the Limux situation. Remember that deputy mayor who was causing a ruckus?

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
Well, the deputy mayor's main complaint has been revealed, and it kind of betrays his total lack of technical expertise.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
The deputy mayor's main complaint is there's no convenient way to access mails and appointments on mobile devices.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Apparently, confusing the Limux desktop with the current groupware solution, which is Colab Enterprise,

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
which is still ongoing as opposed to the old system. They're still rolling out, I guess.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
He then goes on to say that he doubts that the public sector can keep up to date with software that is years behind the latest version,

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
ignoring the fact that they were switching from Windows XP.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
The only valid part of his objection seems to be that Limux is still based on Ubuntu 14.04 and KDE 3.5,

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
but they already have an update scheduled for Q4 of this year to go to LibreOffice, Ubuntu LTS, and KDE 4.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
So this guy, he wants to move off Limux because he's not happy with mobile sync support. This is ridiculous.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Before we start the show, this is kind of a big moment today. I thought maybe...

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Whoa! Whoa!

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Oh, hello. Hello.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
There it is. Maybe do a Valve update.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Whoa, there's a Valve update for you.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
So there's a few games out there in the world that are on people's like, I can't switch to Linux until this game ships for Linux.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
Like, you know, like, oh, as soon as this game's out there, I'm going to switch. You just wait and see.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Well, one of those games is Counter-Strike Global Offensive. I just downloaded it.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
It's not even listed in the Steam store as supporting Linux.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Hey, look what they... Hey, I just played that.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Hey, look at that.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
I guess I could have just done that. I guess I could have just played that.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
So Steam, right? It's Global Offensive. Hello.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Came out today for Linux. I have no idea how to play.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
But I'm going to give it a go. I just thought maybe we'd do this real quick.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Play. Oh, find a game.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Operation Breakout. Okay.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
This should go fine, right, Matt? I shouldn't have any problems.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Absolutely. Absolutely. That's how I play most of my games.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Right? There should be no problem here.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
So, okay. It's initializing the world. I haven't set any graphic settings yet. This is the first time I think...

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I'm watching now so I can kind of be more of help.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
There you go. All right. So I don't even know what I'm doing. I guess it's casual.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
You saw me play Half-Life 2. I mean, that was painful.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
All right. Here we go. Hopefully I don't get swatted.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Spankage.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
The message of the day. What kind of message of the day is that?

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
I'm going to be a terrorist. That sounds like me.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
It's a little laggy. There we go. It's coming in now.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Terrorists win. Terrorists win.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I have no idea what I'm doing. There we go.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Oh! Now that I'm in...

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Oh, wow. You know how you know you're a terrorist because you're wearing a hoodie?

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah, right? Well, now that I'm in, it is smooth and looking clean.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Oh, this looks good.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
I'll be checking this out, actually, because I'm kind of a Counter-Strike guy, so this is pretty cool.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Oh, this is pretty sweet. This is pretty sweet.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Yeah, I'm totally a terrorist.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
I was big into Soldier of Fortune 2 back in the day. I was like my de facto...

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I spent hours doing that.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
I'm going to come up with a backstory. Here's my backstory, Matt, okay?

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
I'm a radicalized, homegrown, lone wolf terrorist.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Radicalized via Instagram propaganda.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
There you go. I like it.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
I have a car full of pressure cookers and this gun and my hoodie.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
The NSA can hear you.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Oh, crap.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Oh, no. Oh, no.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I'm just living out a fantasy, that's all.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Hold on. I didn't get this hoodie for nothing.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Well, he is in a virtual training camp right now. That could be bad.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah, exactly. You know what? I'm being radicalized right now and I'm recording it.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Anyway, so there it is. It's legit.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
You're playing for the wrong side.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I think this is my new first-person shooter for Linux.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
I think this is it. I think we just discovered Chris's new first-person shooter.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Oh, jeez.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Nice little tool tip there.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I was just totally murderated.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
All right, good enough. Good enough.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
How much is that game? Because it looks awesome.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
It's like 14 bucks, I think. Not bad.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
That's reasonable.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
It doesn't have the penguin listed on the Steam store yet, but as you probably just saw, it does actually.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
And pro tip, a lot of times if you add something to your wish list and then it goes on sale, you'll get an email.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Oh, that is nice.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
That's true. I do have a lot on my wish list.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
I always do that because I always forget what game I was looking at yesterday, so I was like, crap, what was it?

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah, my biggest thing is I have trouble justifying to my wife that I spent money on a video game.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Yeah, that is a good one. That's a good challenge.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
You've got to say, oh, hey, look what I was gifted with. Steam has those gift things.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
Or turn it into your work and then say, it's a business thing. I've got to do this.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I'm not advocating lying. I'm just saying you can kind of bend the truth a little bit.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
That's all we're saying.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
It's a birthday gift to myself. It's fine. Whatever, you know.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Your PayPal account is wife don't know money.

04:47.000 --> 05:01.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's powered by a broken USB 3.0 connector.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
My name is Chris.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
And my name is Matt.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
I tell you what, Matt, these USB 3.0 connectors were designed to fail.

05:06.000 --> 05:13.000
I think it's like this giant punk on the entire consumers from the industry because I have this Zalman drive right here.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
It's got junked up. Eric on the pre-show was talking about his drive got broken.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
I think, Matt, maybe we have stumbled upon the greatest conspiracy in all of computing.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
What do you think?

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
I think it's actually time for us to remove the tinfoil hats and realize the tech industry is out to screw us over.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And they do it one plug at a time, Matt.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
That's right.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I just hate it when I break a device.

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
All right, so coming up on today's show, are Canonical and Red Hat about to go at it like we've never seen before?

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Red Hat today announced they are pivoting the direction of the company and refocusing on the cloud.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
But, of course, that's what Mark Shuttleworth has been saying for years.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
In fact, if you look over Mark Shuttleworth's blog, he talks more about Ubuntu in the cloud than he does about Ubuntu on a phone.

05:54.000 --> 06:02.000
So with both of these companies going at the cloud market, specifically OpenStack, where Canonical currently has a major lead, you've got to wonder what that's going to lead to.

06:02.000 --> 06:09.000
So we'll look at some recent statements and including a new announcement from Canonical today about a partnership with Oracle to extend their presence in OpenStack.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
And what Red Hat just made a big announcement about.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
So we'll get to that.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
Plus, we're also going to talk about Debian's recent switch back to GNOME 3.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
But really, we'll do more of a meta conversation about what it might mean for the state of XFCE.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
One of Matt's favorite desktops, is it a dead man walking?

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
We're going to talk about that today, too.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
A lot of stuff, Matt, so we'll start with our feedback.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
That's kind of tradition.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Sounds good.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
You know, what we do here on the Unplugged show.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
And can you believe that we are almost episode 60?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
I don't think we missed a bit.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Already?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Yeah, I know.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Wow.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I don't think we missed a single episode, too, which is awesome.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Awesome.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Okay, Matt.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Our first email comes in.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
And this one's kind of funny.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
It was a follow-up.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
It comes from AR.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
It says, wow.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I've seen and smelt the future of broadcasting.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Hey, guys.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
I've been watching the Linux action show for well over a year and a half now.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
It starts my week with some great Linux content.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
It allows me to deal with the MS corporate world I'm immersed in.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
I just wanted to share with you a surreal experience I had on Monday watching the show.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
I was working on my emails whilst watching your latest episode on Security Onion.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
And unknown to me, my wife had returned from shopping and was preparing some food in the

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
kitchen.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Halfway through your Security Onion section, the smell of cooking onions started to waft

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
into my home office, which had just added an additional dimension to the whole Security

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Onion experience.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
It's like 3D glasses, but way better.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Smell-O-Vision is the way forward.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Keep up the great work.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Highlight of my week regards AR.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
How great is that?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
That is so awesome.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I love Smell-O-Vision.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
How great is it that we're doing Security Onion, and first of all, cooked onions are

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
delicious, and second of all, the smell of cooked onions is delicious, and third of all,

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
it goes perfect with the show.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
He also says he ordered himself a dark blue LASS jacket.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
That's awesome.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Nice.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
So thanks, AR, for the story.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
In fact, you know what?

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
I didn't put this in the show notes, but maybe I will mention we are doing a fundraiser to

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
cover our cost to go over to Ohio Linux Fest and bring you coverage from Ohio Linux Fest.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
And you can help us do that, cover those costs, by going to teespring.com slash jbjacket.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
We have a six-day run left of a limited time fall or maybe spring, depending where you're

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
at in the world.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Linux Action Show Jacket is a zip-up jacket with a hoodie, so it'll be just right for

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
the weather.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
And we've sold 87 towards our goal of 100.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
Now at 100, we break even, and we unlock all of the sales.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
Anything above 100 will greatly help our cost, and we're also donating a dollar to the Ella

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
and Madison Fund, which are some family friends who recently went through a tragedy.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
You can read more about that at teespring.com slash jbjacket.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Right now, we have blue, black, and dark gray.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Keep checking.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
There might be an additional color showing up soon.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
No word on that yet.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Ooh.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Yes.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Teespring.com slash jbjacket.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
Go get yourself a Linux Action Show hoodie.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
You can rock the support for the show.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
If you're at Ohio Linux Fest, you will know who you are.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You'll be like, oh, yeah, it's the last few.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Awesome.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
And if you're not, you can still remotely be there with us in spirit, wearing your jacket,

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
rocking it places.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
I've been wanting a jacket for a long time, but we were waiting for Teespring to get this

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
right.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
They got a great set of materials.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
They've done a couple runs of these now, and the timing is perfect.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
And, you know, we had to keep it a super short run, six days is all that's left, because

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
we want to get them shipped out in time for Ohio Linux Fest, which is going to be epic.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
Like I mentioned on Sunday, my wife Angela will be joining us, co-host of the Fo' Show.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Well, host of the Fo' Show.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
I'm the co-host.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
And she's going to go down there and say hi to folks and shake hands, and we'll go around

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
and do interviews and all that kind of stuff.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
And I'm going to try to get her a jacket, too.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I mean, that seems only fair.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
That seems like maybe, maybe I should do that.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
I think so.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Yeah, I think she'll probably take care of that.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Teespring.com slash JBJacket if you want to help us get out to Ohio and rock some Linux

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
action show swag.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
All right.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
One quick thing I was going to mention about that, too, is when they're coming to the Fest,

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
it's like, what better way to recognize viewers than to see them in the jacket?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
I know, right?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
And other fellow viewers, too.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
So, like, there'll be a sense of community at the Fest because you'll recognize, oh,

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
that's safe territory over there.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
I can go talk to that person.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Exactly.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
They're a human.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
They're a human.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
That's it.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Gordon writes in on the alternative to PFSense topic.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
You know, and I want to mention, too, in the Linux action show, I said, hey, I'd love to

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
get your take on different firewalls.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I've gotten a ton of really good answers.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
I'm not going to necessarily cover which ones have been recommended.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I'm going to wait and summarize all of that.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
So, a lot of them is in there.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
But Gordon managed to touch on the topic that I wanted to kick around with you guys.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
He says, hi, Chris and Matt.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Further, to your plea for alternatives to PFSense.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.000
I ran a Linux-based firewall in our enterprise for years, from IPCOP to SmoothWall, even

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Firewall Builder to just straight-up IP tables.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
The grow your own options became troublesome to administer, and the Linux firewall distros

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
several years ago all seemed to go to a commercial model with community versions lacking in features

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
or maybe even no updates.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
I think your request for a Linux-based box is a bit misguided.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
You need to find the right application for the job, irrespective of the hardware or OS

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
it is sitting on.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
You shouldn't need to go tweaking at the command line with every function that's available

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
in the GUI and with validated sense checking.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
In fact, tweaking on the command line in a firewall distribution could potentially compromise

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
the security of the firewall and cause problems with upgrades.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
To that end, does it matter if it's running Linux or BSD if you never interact directly

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
with the OS?

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
So long as it's open, stop searching for the holy grail when you have found it in PFSense.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
We have numerous support staff who don't do Linux command line stuff, so a GUI was imperative.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
Switch to PFSense at version 1.21 and are currently running version 2.15 in 30 offices

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
dotted around the world.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
It has every feature I need and runs on a very modest hardware.

11:30.000 --> 11:36.000
We run with HA failover, a pair of 8-nit boxes to each site on a modest, fanless,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Atom SSD-based hardware.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Keep up the great work, Gordon.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
So, I wanted to ask you guys, what do you think about Gordon's take here?

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
Gordon's take is, use the right tool for the job, and if in that case it's a BSD box,

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
then you should just buckle down and use BSD.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
And here's where I come at it from.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
It seems like this is something that Linux should be very good at, but it's just we haven't

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
found the right combination yet of it.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
And it seems like as the host of the Linux action show, I should try to use something

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
that is Linux-based.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
So, but then I'm up against the realities that I have a corporate firewall that I need

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
to set up, and I have certain features that I need, and I have restraints like I need

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
to have people who are not Linux admins administer it.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
So, Matt, what do you think I do in this case?

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
So, from my perspective, at first when he said, you know, use the right tool for the

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
job, I was like, oh, that's the easy way out.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
But then I'm thinking about it, and it's like, you know, if it's truly something that you're

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
going to just be front-facing, you're not going to be tweaking or having to do a lot

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
of massaging at any technical level, I can see where he's coming from on that.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
That's fair.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
If you just want something you plug, play, and forget about, okay, because there are

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
tools that we may use in the studio that may not necessarily be the most Linux-specific

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
in the world.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
I mean, that's life.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
The camera may not run Linux.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I mean, there's a lot of things that may, you know, the air conditioner, whatever.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
There are certain tools we use that may not fall into that philosophy.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
If that's one of those tools, I don't necessarily see that as a huge issue.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
It doesn't mean you can't explore the Linux options.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
But at the end of the day, if they're not meeting the need, then, hey, use what you

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
got to use.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
So, Wimpy, you went through the same evaluation.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
You ended up going PFSense?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Yeah.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Yeah, for work.

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
We tested just about every firewall distribution going, regardless of whether it was Linux

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
or BSD-based.

13:28.000 --> 13:35.000
And PFSense is head and shoulders better than anything else that's out there that isn't

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
like, you know, a commercial proprietary offering.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Heavens.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
All right.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
What's your take?

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Well, this time, I do agree with you.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
This time, PFSense at this moment would most likely be the better firewall.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
But I think it's bullshit that our Linux environment doesn't give us a firewall just as kick-ass

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
as PFSense.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
More so.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
But it's good at calling them all off.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
It's good at calling them out and saying, come on, guys, we can do this.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Why the hell are we going to wait for the PFSense guys to kick our ass all over the

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
place?

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
So, Webby Wizard, you want to make the case for IPFire.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
I'm not sure if it's an equivalent to PFSense, but I'd like to hear your take on it.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
So, it isn't an equivalent to PFSense in everything that it does.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
But it does do quite a bit.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
And if you are willing to go and set up the couple rules that you might need to set up

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
that are a little bit extravagant, then you can do almost anything else.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Like, the GUI has been changing.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Extreme.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Like, it's changed again.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
It's changed the last three revisions.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
And it keeps on changing.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
And there's more and more features there.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
So, it's on the way.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
It's just it takes a while.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Mostly because a lot of the people that develop it are in German.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
So, it takes a while for things to get pushed to English and other languages.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
But it's working that way.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
And Colonel Linux, do you think that the Linux community has been friend-zoned?

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
Because we know that there's high-end enterprise equipment that runs Linux that does this.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah, I don't know if it's a friend zone so much as just that there's clearly there's

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
a market in the very high end, right?

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
And when I say that, I'm thinking of Cumulus Networks.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
You know, we interviewed them and clearly that's replacing the very, very high-end thing.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
And I mean, if you have $15,000, then you can get a Linux distro that supports it.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
That's very open, mind you, that you could do your routing stuff and firewall stuff on.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Right.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
But I think probably the reason is because there hasn't been a real need.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
I don't you know, you were just talking about essential or maybe the other gentleman was

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
was mentioning, you know, we look at these things like appliances.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
So if they're doing what we expect them to do, we don't really care what the underlying OS is.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
And it's not that Linux is incapable of it.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
It's just that I don't know that there's been a huge demand.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
And of course, you know, you know, we do, you know, a lot of this stuff all the time.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
And we've gone with Microtech, right?

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Because that's, you know, it essentially runs Linux on the underside.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
I can do all the administration from Linux.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
And as long as I'm not required to use Windows tools, I don't care.

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
And those are probably make pretty good like if just firewalls for setting up like rules and filtering and things like that.

16:03.000 --> 16:10.000
How do they do in terms of adding more advanced features like bandwidth monitoring, QOS, VPNs?

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, we have, you know, so in the hospitality industry, that's huge, right?

16:14.000 --> 16:20.000
They want the if when the front, you know, you have the router set up and then the there has to be two essentially two networks.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
One is the administrative network that runs the front desk and then one's the guest network.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
But you don't want any one guest taking too much bandwidth.

16:27.000 --> 16:36.000
And if all the guests cumulatively are trying to consume a lot of bandwidth, you need to rein them in if the front desk needs to get some administrative tasks done.

16:36.000 --> 16:44.000
So, I mean, yeah, you can set all that stuff up. And actually, one of the viewers of the show after you after you ran after when when I sent you one in and you talked about it.

16:44.000 --> 16:52.000
He actually e-mailed me and said, I have five hotels or four hotels and I need them all connected with essentially like a VPN.

16:52.000 --> 17:00.000
I want to be able to get to all the computers. I want to put one router at each hotel and then I want them all connected so that, you know, essentially with a VPN.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
And he did that. So, yeah, it can they can do very advanced things.

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
I haven't found anything that I could have done in a Cisco environment that I couldn't do with Microtech.

17:08.000 --> 17:15.000
But the same is probably true for PFSense. Well, the nice thing about the Microtech, right, is it comes with a hardware solution.

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
So you can get you can write it. You can get like almost it looks like a switch, but it's running the whole the whole OS.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
Well, and that's what drew me away from PFSense originally was if you want the rack, they sell hardware units.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
But if you want the rack unit, you're looking at like fourteen hundred bucks with with Microtech.

17:31.000 --> 17:37.000
They have they have one new rack unit starting at ninety nine dollars. So, you know, I was that just made more sense for us.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
Yeah. Yeah, really. Yeah. So like the RB201 or whatever is that right? Yeah. Yep.

17:43.000 --> 17:53.000
And so this would be a Linux firewall that I could drop in and it comes with like I assume like I could turn one of these ports into like a mirrored port if I wanted to.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Is that a possibility? Yeah. There are five ports. You configure them however you want.

17:56.000 --> 18:02.000
By default, it will come with port one set up as a LAN port and two, three, four and five set up as a bridge switch.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
But you can you can break those back out and and and yeah, do configure it however you want.

18:07.000 --> 18:16.000
I know you sent me one. I just need to set it up because I need to what I really with the final decision factor for me would be the UI. Do you think that one you sent me is powerful enough to do what we do here at the studio?

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
Absolutely. We will. The one I sent you is the same one that is kind of the stock one we put in the hotels.

18:22.000 --> 18:29.000
The only difference between that one and the ones we put in hotels is that one's in a little plastic white box and the ones we install are in a rack box.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
But it has the same processor, same memory. They're so tiny. That's that's a good thing.

18:34.000 --> 18:45.000
Yeah, yeah. And here's the thing. If if you and I, I strongly suspect you'll never be able to to to to saturate the that bus.

18:45.000 --> 18:52.000
But if you were to saturate it and fill it up, the nice thing is when you go to the next model, you can take your config and drop it into the to the next one.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
And because it's the same interface and the same OS, right? That's right. These are running router OS, right? Yes.

18:57.000 --> 19:04.000
It's all coming back to me now. And if I was going to go to AltaSpeedStore.com, I would oh, I would get this page is not available.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
But maybe that's where I would fix it. But that's where I would probably order something like this. Yeah.

19:09.000 --> 19:15.000
Very cool. If you decided you wanted a bigger one or a rack one, you let me know and one will show up.

19:15.000 --> 19:21.000
Well, if you say the one you send me is going to be able to hold hold the load, then I might just go that route because I've been really stuck with this.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
And will that one that you sent me also it'll do it has all the same features. It'll do a mirrored port and all that. Oh, that is so cool.

19:27.000 --> 19:35.000
No, I think you just well, we'll see. We'll see if that's all. I've also gotten a couple of really good recommendations for a server.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
And a couple of them have been brought up in the in the chat room.

19:38.000 --> 19:44.000
But there's a couple of people have sent in that I've heard about now that I didn't know of before I asked.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
And I'm really appreciative of some of the suggestions I've gotten. So I've already gotten some great ones.

19:48.000 --> 19:54.000
So I'm definitely going to look at those two. Wimpy, did you have an experience with the Microtech routers?

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
Yeah. So I've probably mentioned before that I'm connected to the Internet via shortwave radio.

20:00.000 --> 20:13.000
And that's all running using Microtech routers this end and then power over Ethernet up the side of the house to an antenna and then a Microtech radio dish.

20:13.000 --> 20:21.000
The beams across the countryside to a Microtech system on the other side and using QoS.

20:21.000 --> 20:27.000
And so I guess you like them. I've got QoS profiled for the Mumble server so it doesn't get all patchy and crappy.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
So they work really well and they're nice devices.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
Wimpy, it's like every time we bring something up, you manage to surprise me with something. That's great.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
That's awesome. I mean, really. So there's a good endorsement right there.

20:39.000 --> 20:45.000
All right. So we've got two more emails to get to. One's actually more of a PSA and then one is maybe we've got a great Mumble room today.

20:45.000 --> 20:50.000
So maybe this is something you guys can help somebody solve. It's kind of in the networking category.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
But first I want to mention Ting. Linux.ting.com is where you go.

20:53.000 --> 21:00.000
That'll get you a $25 credit off your first month of Ting service if you've got a Ting compatible phone. They have a BYOD page.

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
However, if you're going to get a new phone like I did when I switched to Ting, well then they can give you $25 off your phone.

21:05.000 --> 21:14.000
So I've done it. I've taken advantage of both offerings and I can tell you that either way it's a great deal because that's just the beginning and it's already in a tremendous value.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
Once you get your phone or you bring your phone over, then you have an incredible service with no BS because there's no contract.

21:21.000 --> 21:27.000
There's no early termination fee. So they're not trying to get you that way and you only pay for what you actually use.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
Ting just takes your minutes, your messages, your megabytes and they just add them up.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
So for three lines right now, in fact I will log into my account while I talk about this.

21:36.000 --> 21:44.000
For three lines right now I am paying somewhere around $35 for an HTC One, a Nexus 5 and an iPhone 5 all on one Ting account.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
And what's awesome is I can go in and drill down and see which phone's using my bandwidth.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
I can set alerts individually for each line if I want to.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
I can also do things like manage the voicemail, the caller ID, name the phones, things like that.

21:56.000 --> 22:03.000
So here, I'm pulling up my Ting account right now. So my current bill is $45. For three phones, $45.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
And you can see right now where our minutes and usage is at. It's really straightforward.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
They use this fuel gauge system so you get a quick snapshot and get a great idea.

22:11.000 --> 22:17.000
Now that's based on my average, which is really cool. So Ting gives me my projected numbers as well as my current numbers.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
So there's no hiding of information. It's just boom, right there. This is where you're at.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.000
Three lines. It's so great and so easy to manage. And they're always doing really cool stuff too.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
Like they just posted, we often talk about how Ting loves to do app picks.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
We've gotten so many more recently. They've had different staff members.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
Like Andrew just picked his top six apps and posted them to the Ting blog.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
So when you go to linux.ting.com, also check out their blog because even if you're not a Ting customer,

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
you could take advantage of some of these great app recommendations they have over on the blog.

22:46.000 --> 22:51.000
So check out the Ting blog when you go to linux.ting.com as well because that's just one of many posts.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
They've been doing a whole series of these app picks and they really do pick great ones. They work really hard on those.

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
Ting also has no hold customer service. So if you get stuck or you move family over or you're part of a small business,

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
you've got staff that has a problem, you're not going to have anybody wasting time.

23:03.000 --> 23:09.000
They just call 1-855-TING-FTW and a real human answers the phone between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. business hours.

23:09.000 --> 23:16.000
Easy peasy, right? So for me, I've never actually taken advantage of that as awesome as it is

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
because they also have an incredible online help system with a very active community.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
Like seriously, how many cell phone providers do you know?

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
Like, hey, so I'm trying to get Ubuntu Touch working on my Nexus 5 and I'm having problems sending picture messages.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
Oh, well you can't do that. Oh, okay. Somebody else has tried this. Yeah, I just tried that. That is great. Thank you.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
Like just even the back and forth. Or yeah, do this or add this MMS server address or whatever it was.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
Like I never had to do any of that kind of stuff. I've actually had other problems like with Sailfish OS.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
Actually, Ubuntu Touch hasn't been a problem at all. But on Sailfish OS, I was able to go in there,

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
I was able to find somebody else using Sailfish OS on Ting and Ting just allows the open conversations

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
and they watch that and they go, well, you know, sometimes they've extracted stuff from that and said,

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
you know, the community is really interested in this. Let's roll this out. And they've done that.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
It's really awesome. There's so many great things to check out. So start by going to linux.ting.com.

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
Try out their savings calculator. Put your actual usage in there and then see how much you'd save.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
Oh yeah, and they're also on Reddit too. They're really savvy about that.

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
Like there's a reddit.com.r.ting you can check out as well. That's pretty neat as well.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
linux.ting.com and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
Ting, you're so awesome. You're so awesome. Can you believe that? Three lines.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
And I got to tell you, one of the people, one of those lines is talking all the time.

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
They're talking all the time. Not me. It's not me, but somebody else. No, no.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
linux.ting.com, a big thanks to Ting.

24:35.000 --> 24:41.000
Alright, so let's see if we can help somebody with an interesting networking conundrum.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
And really what that means is let's help somebody avoid their IT department.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
So Eric writes in, A-R-I-C, Eric? He says,

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
Hey guys, I'm running into an issue at work and I'm hoping you might be able to help me with this.

24:52.000 --> 24:58.000
My laptop is running Mint 17. The Ethernet jack on my laptop connects to our corporate network.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
Ultimately that means my internet activity also goes through the corporate network, which means I hit their filter,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
they block out lots of things and resources I need.

25:05.000 --> 25:12.000
So what I do is I connect my Wi-Fi to a wireless network that just bypasses all the filtering and I can get out.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
Now of course that's always how it works. People always find a way.

25:15.000 --> 25:21.000
I know in Windows you can order the network interfaces so Wi-Fi would be above your local area connection,

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
meaning your traffic would go out that first and then go out the LAN connection if it couldn't find what it needs.

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
The only way I have found to do that in Linux is to hard set static routes.

25:31.000 --> 25:37.000
Do you know of any way in Linux to set your Wi-Fi adapter as the default adapter so I can stop disabling my LAN connection?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Because that's sort of the route he started taking.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
Between last Linux unplugged and tech snap you guys pretty much fill up my morning and evening commutes.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Looking forward to the next show, Eric.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
So I was going to say default routes until he said I don't want to do routes.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
Anybody in the mumble room have a suggestion of a way he could manage this?

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
Does network manager allow you to sort the preference order?

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
Because I'm always usually just on one connection so I don't think I've run into this very much.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Anybody have any suggestions?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Wow.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Nuts coming to my mind.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
We've got like 25 people in this mumble room and nobody's...

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Wow.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
If the network manager can't take care of it then it's like what do you do?

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
Because one thing about Linux Mint, especially the Cinnamon version, is it relies on network manager.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Network manager is a dependency.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
My only suggestion would just use a VPN.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Hmm.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Or a proxy.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Hmm.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Yeah, a VPN might...

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
Yeah, I just pipe all my stuff through a shuttle or SS shuttle.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Yeah, I suppose a VPN would do that.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
So in Windows you can set your network device preference order, right?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I think that's what they call it.

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
You can set your device order.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
There's got to be a way to do it in network manager.

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
VPN or...hmm.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Yeah, I can't really think of another way.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
There must be.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
Well, if anybody out in the audience, there might be somebody screaming at their headphones right now or monitors saying,

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
I know a way.

26:59.000 --> 27:04.000
Go over to the linuxactionshow.reddit.com and find Linux Unplugged in the feedback thread and drop a note in there if you would.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
What he could do is just use a different client altogether and just use Wicked or something.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
Right.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
So this web browser goes here.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Yeah, that might work.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Yeah, that might be a way to do it.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
Or the other thing I was thinking is a VM, right?

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
And have the VM attached to just the Wi-Fi and then just do all your browsing in the VM.

27:20.000 --> 27:26.000
And that also kind of gives you an extra layer of protection from somebody snooping through your machine and looking at your history.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Yeah, that's easier to do in a virtual box.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Yeah.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
Very easy.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Right.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Or even VMware Player or anything.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
So that could be another way to go.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
But I don't know.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
I don't know.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
All right.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
So then we just have a little PSA that producer Eric wanted to pass along to the troops out there.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
There has been a security vulnerability discovered in apt.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
The Google security team discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the HTTP transport code in apt-get.

27:48.000 --> 27:55.000
An attacker is able to do a man in the middle on an HTTP request so you could essentially snag somebody's apt-get request.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Wow.

27:56.000 --> 28:03.000
It can also trigger a binary buffer overflow leading to a crash on the HTTP apt method binary or potentially an arbitrary code execution.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
Two regressions have been fixed in an update that is out for Wheezy.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
You can go get it.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I assume this probably also affects Ubuntu.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I don't know if it's been patched over there.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
This has been known for a little bit.

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
I meant to cover it on Sunday, but I totally skipped my mind.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
But I know we have a bunch of Debian users out there.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
So go get your updates, guys, because that one's a particularly nasty one.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Yeah.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
The big thing is that anything based on Debian is going to be affected by this easily.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Right.

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
So as long as whatever distribution you've got patched it or what have you, then you're probably safe.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Yeah.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
We did have an email regarding systemd.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
And I have one more email to read.

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
I don't want to just get all of our shows marred down in systemd discussion.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
So I've just kept it to one email.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
And this one came in from system developer.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
And he says, hello, Chris, Matt, and the chatroom.

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
I just wanted to comment a bit on the whole systemd thing from a perspective of a low end or I'm sorry, a low level programmer.

28:59.000 --> 29:07.000
If no one takes anything else from this email, please at least understand that modern software does not work the Unix way for technical reasons.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Let's be realistic.

29:08.000 --> 29:15.000
Systemd init was a bunch of shell scripts that had very little in them to accommodate in terms of security, maintainability on a large scale.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Testability and integration as well.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
The reason systemd stores log files in binary format, for example, is for efficiency reasons when communicating between its different components.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
Not to make it impossible for you as the user to read them.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
In fact, it's very easy to get your logs in text form.

29:30.000 --> 29:38.000
Another thing is the reason systemd integrates some of the stuff that we were previously separate as separate programs is it can integrate better with them,

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
i.e. communicating than communicating between shell scripts.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
He says, when was the last time you saw a really good shell script of any complexity whatsoever?

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Yeah, I can't remember one either.

29:48.000 --> 29:54.000
Another thing is that exploiting concurrency and parallelism using shell scripts is practically impossible.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
I'm not even talking about having a nice API, et cetera, et cetera, which systemd also has.

29:59.000 --> 30:05.000
Let's not forget, Unix was built in an age where the internet was simply not a thing and so security concerns were often tossed aside.

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
It was built in an age of archaic hardware that certainly wasn't a quad six or eight core beast,

30:10.000 --> 30:15.000
and it was built in an age when deploying your own personal VPS in 55 seconds wasn't possible.

30:15.000 --> 30:21.000
It certainly is disgusting to hear all the trash talk from the BSD guys who until recently used an archaic compiler,

30:21.000 --> 30:26.000
still use code from 1992, and use an init system that is a bunch of shell scripts.

30:26.000 --> 30:32.000
Go on, develop something systemd competitive and then talk. Let the code speak for itself.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Some big words.

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
Yeah, and I wanted to read that last part again where he says go on and develop something systemd competitive and then talk.

30:38.000 --> 30:45.000
In light of our conversation on Sunday's Linux action show about uselessd or uselessd,

30:45.000 --> 30:53.000
I wasn't super happy with, I got all caught up in their attitude about it because I really hate the,

30:53.000 --> 31:00.000
I hate the we never needed this attitude about it because it seems so uninformed,

31:00.000 --> 31:07.000
and I get really upset when people come with a technical argument that to me doesn't hold up,

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
but yet it still manages for some reason to gain traction in a technical crowd.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Exactly.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
That's very frustrating for me, and that's what I was getting worked up about on Sunday.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
I don't mind the idea of uselessd or uselessd.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
I think bring the competition. I think it's a little bit of shit competition.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
It's based on a super old version of systemd, which is majorly disappointing,

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
which already there makes it feel a little uncompetitive,

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
and I think it's a little bit of shit at the language they're using, so I'm not super stoked about that,

31:36.000 --> 31:45.000
but I do like the idea of a compatible competitive product that could at least offer some folks an alternative to systemd

31:45.000 --> 31:54.000
while still maintaining some compatibility with systemd, so I'm all up for that, and I wish, I don't know,

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
I just wish they could have gone about it differently, and I wish I didn't react so strongly on Sunday, I guess.

31:58.000 --> 32:03.000
Well, I think part of the problem is that with any technical argument, and this isn't just Linux,

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
this is just technology in general, it's like this is good enough for me if you can't figure it out

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
or if you can't make it work, you're an idiot or you're an a-hole or you're whatever,

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
and I see that amongst all platforms, all technologies.

32:15.000 --> 32:20.000
I see it from mechanics, I see it from people in the medical field, I see it across all things.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
I've seen it from painters. It's funny because we dig ourselves in here.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
Go to a cooking class sometime and you'll experience this. It's unbelievable.

32:29.000 --> 32:36.000
So I think we as human beings need to get off our high horse, realize we're not as special as everybody told us we were,

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
and sometimes things that work for us may not, wait for it, work for everybody.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
That's kind of my thing.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
Wimpy, I wanted to let you go first in the mumble room because I know you kind of had the first responses.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
What are your thoughts on this all?

32:49.000 --> 32:53.000
Yeah, pretty much the same as yours, really. It's all a bit disappointing.

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
The only thing that I kind of agree, it's more positive than some of these negative responses

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
in that something's being created as a result of it.

33:03.000 --> 33:08.000
So I do get frustrated when you hear people complaining and moaning about things,

33:08.000 --> 33:13.000
but then they don't move on to something better or something that suits them better or find an alternative.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
They just troll the community and whine and moan.

33:17.000 --> 33:23.000
So useless D or useless D, whatever it is, at least they've created something which is positive,

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
but I'm not a fan of the language in the way that they're presented.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
Yeah, it's very trollish in and of itself.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
Pobi, are you present here? Are you here today?

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
Because I'd like to get your take. So you've watched this from the Ubuntu side of the fence

33:38.000 --> 33:44.000
where things have come out and then there's unending agony over it for months and months and months at a time

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
and it feels like it'll never go away.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
You're sitting back here watching this, running a desktop probably powered by Upstart right now.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
What are your thoughts on all of this?

33:52.000 --> 34:05.000
I don't care. Honestly, I don't care. It's plumbing and I don't particularly care about plumbing.

34:05.000 --> 34:12.000
I care more about the upper level of the stack and I like the fact that the system may start faster with system D

34:12.000 --> 34:21.000
or it may be more reliable or it may be that people are able to build better startup scripts and shutdown scripts.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
That all sounds amazing, but it doesn't sound particularly interesting to me.

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
And I find it tiresome that this is still going on.

34:30.000 --> 34:38.000
Yeah, and I think this has also been part of my reaction is that I'm honestly surprised that people care this much still.

34:38.000 --> 34:45.000
No, actually, I think this cannot be resolved. Some people butt heads so hard that they will never agree.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
Because you think this goes down to fundamental lines?

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
Yeah, they've already decided that they don't like it and they're not going to accept it.

34:52.000 --> 34:58.000
There's no way we can actually convince them otherwise because they are stuck in a rut.

34:58.000 --> 35:03.000
They will not move. They're zombified or petrified. They cannot progress.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
But I think that fair enough to say there could be people on both sides of the debate.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
There's people who will not move away from system D as the future too.

35:10.000 --> 35:16.000
So it's not just one camp over the other. It just seems to be like Matt saying, people are just not really...

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
We have to agree to disagree.

35:18.000 --> 35:27.000
But isn't system D the future actually? I mean, ever since Debian adopted it, how are you going to get away from it?

35:27.000 --> 35:33.000
I've had the same argument where people argue about mixers. It's like, oh, I use a KitchenAid.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
It's like, oh, you sell out. You don't use the hand mixer.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
Yeah, or the barbecues. You get that in barbecues a lot too.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
Barbecues, big time. Propane, charcoal. These guys have fist fights over this stuff.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
It's like, where does it end?

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
My name is Hank Hill and we sell propane and propane accessories.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
Hold on. Wimpy's got some math here. What do you have here, Wimpy? What are you linking to?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Because it got blocked by the sensor in the chat room.

35:53.000 --> 36:00.000
It was a presentation that was given earlier in the year and one of the slides simply read,

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
the amount of energy necessary to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
And I just think that's where we are with this system D debate.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Absolutely.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Wow. Wow. Okay.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
That's awesome.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
All right. So the debate itself is not over. Our coverage itself is not over.

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
I'm just trying to, I honestly want to give it some air. I don't know. We'll see.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
I mean, honestly, we are subject to the whims of what happens and what develops.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
But for right now, I think the best thing is to let it get some air.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
Let everybody kind of think about it and then we'll address it again down the road.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
We'll see if that actually, that's my intent. We'll see if that actually happens.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
I don't know. I'm trying. I honestly am trying.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
All right. Before we get into one of our first big topics this week,

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
I want to thank DigitalOcean.

36:41.000 --> 36:47.000
DigitalOcean rocks. Simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up a cloud server.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
In fact, now I'm not going to put words in your mouth.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
I don't want to set expectations upon you and make you think I'm going to judge you.

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
But you might be able to go create a cloud server in less than about, oh, I don't know, 35 seconds.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
We'll see what you can do.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
Most users get a cloud server spun up in about 55 seconds.

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
Some pricing plans start at only $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM,

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
A terabyte. You know I get a terabyte, which is awesome,

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
which means when I have one of the number one reasons I have my BitTorrent sync server up on a droplet instead of anywhere else

37:20.000 --> 37:25.000
is because I know that I have a terabyte I can burn a BitTorrent sync before I even need to care.

37:25.000 --> 37:30.000
And DigitalOcean's pricing structure is so simple that if I wanted to bump up to the next bandwidth level, I could do it.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
It's really crazy great.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
And part of that is because their control panel.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Their control panel is so simple and intuitive.

37:36.000 --> 37:41.000
And power users can replicate that control panel on a much larger scale using their API.

37:41.000 --> 37:46.000
It's pretty great because you're already seeing a bunch of apps come out from the community to manage your droplets.

37:46.000 --> 37:51.000
And of course DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and London.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.000
Go check them out.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
That interface is so awesome.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
And really their support is fantastic as well.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
I've gotten a number of really great stories from you out in the audience who've had some really good experiences.

38:00.000 --> 38:04.000
When you go over to DigitalOcean.com, you can get a $10 credit.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
You can try out a droplet for two months for absolutely free.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
When you use the promo code, unplug September.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
All one word, lowercase.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Unplug September will give you a $10 credit.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
Try out the $5 rig.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Get it for two months.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Or go fancy.

38:17.000 --> 38:22.000
And one of the cool things you can do over at DigitalOcean is you can sort of pre-charge the funding on your account if you want.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
So this is a really nice way to just go in there, toss that in and get a $10 credit and run it for as long as you need it.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.000
Because you can also use their hourly pricing, which is super cool.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
DigitalOcean.com, promo code, unplug September when you check out.

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
And a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for rocking so hard and their support of Linux Unplugged.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Love it.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
I'm a droplet fiend.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
It's cool, Matt.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
It's cool.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
I admit it.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
I have a droplet problem.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Oh, I keep popping them up.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
It's like the way I go through Cokes in studio is like me with droplets.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
I'm just like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
I'm telling you.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Okay, cool.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
I like that.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
That's a good analogy I can understand.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
All right.

38:57.000 --> 39:02.000
So let's talk about how Red Hat is going to take a machete knife to the throat of Canonical.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
I mean, no, I'm kidding.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Wait, what?

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
I'm kidding.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
I just like to make it sound more dramatic than it really is.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
In fact, if anything, I'm not so sure that is going to be the case.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
But Red Hat CEO announces that they're going to shift to focus on cloud computing.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Surprise, surprise, gasp, surprise.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
We've got several articles in the show notes that cover the announcement.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
But if you didn't hear, this is sort of Red Hat's logic.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
They say this is from their blog.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
The competition is fierce and companies will spend and will have several choices for their cloud needs.

39:30.000 --> 39:35.000
But the prize is the chance to establish open source as the default for the next era

39:35.000 --> 39:41.000
and to position Red Hat as the provider for choice for enterprises and the entire cloud infrastructure.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
To get there, Red Hat will focus on three key offerings.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
It's CloudForm's management platform, it's OpenShift platform as a service, and OpenStack.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
However, it's JBoss middleware and storage solutions will also play a role

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
in helping Red Hat deliver as much infrastructure as it can.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
Red Hat's new cloud focus doesn't mean it will pay less attention to Linux.

40:01.000 --> 40:09.000
It just, it realizes its greatest challenge lies ahead in the data center itself.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
So that's a little dramatic, but that's essentially what they're saying.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
And they say they have excellent reasons for seeing it this way.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
With the rollout of Azure, you have Amazon's EC2,

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
which a lot of these will run Red Hat in some places.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
It's a big market. It's a huge market and it seems to be a big profit center.

40:26.000 --> 40:33.000
And my question to you, Matt, is were they not focused on the cloud before?

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
And did they not get the idea of OpenStack and hosting and all of this?

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
Like this sounds like it's just sort of reaffirming what they've already been doing,

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
but just putting a new marketing spin on it.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I think you hit it with the latter part.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I mean, and they're probably not even doing that on purpose,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
but they're kind of, they're trying to remind people,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Hey, we're still doing this stuff. You should check it out.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
I mean, at the end of the day, I think they're feeling the heat from the competition,

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
whether it be Ubuntu or others.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
And I think they're trying to say, Hey, we're still a thing.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
We're still wanting to grow. We're still a billion dollar company.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Come take a look at us. Come see what we're doing.

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
But I do feel like that if they're not careful, they could end up treading water.

41:10.000 --> 41:16.000
And it does feel like that they could potentially here probably 2015, 2016 end up at that point.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Just call it a hunch.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
Hmm. All right, Daredevil. And you think it's anything more than a marketing strategy?

41:22.000 --> 41:29.000
I think it's a marketing strategy and they are trying to bring attention and setting a playing field

41:29.000 --> 41:35.000
for them to present the new tools that they've been working on that have barely been talked about.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
Here's what I wonder though, but is it that or is it acknowledging,

41:38.000 --> 41:43.000
Hey, we missed the open stack boat a little bit and now we're kind of going to make good on that.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
And we're saying publicly that that area where Canonical is kicking our ass

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
and the server infrastructure, we're going to go for that now.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
That's essentially, isn't that what they're saying is this is a public statement to say, bring it on.

41:54.000 --> 42:01.000
I think it's preparing ground more than anything else because they have tools that they've been developing

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
and they've been working on for a while.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
They're trying to bring them on.

42:06.000 --> 42:12.000
But if you just bring them on, there's no reason for you to be paying attention or to care about Red Hat.

42:12.000 --> 42:18.000
So they need to start making statements so people start looking at them and then suddenly they can see

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
the tools that they're talking about and say, Oh, this is why I go to Red Hat.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
All right, Eric, what do you think?

42:24.000 --> 42:29.000
Well, let's not forget they are the number one Linux provider in the world.

42:29.000 --> 42:35.000
And let's not also forget they have competition in the form of Microsoft, Amazon and Google.

42:35.000 --> 42:44.000
I'm thinking Microsoft in particular because Sasha Nadella, he used to be the head of their cloud infrastructure division.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
And so Microsoft is making that a big focus.

42:48.000 --> 42:53.000
I think Red Hat's basically reacting to that and they're like, well, we've got to get in on this too

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
otherwise we're going to miss the boat entirely.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
And to that point, when you spin up an Azure server, are you getting Red Hat Enterprise Linux?

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Is that running on a Windows box?

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
Is Red Hat Enterprise critical to that infrastructure or is it simply a feature of that infrastructure?

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
And does that sort of scare Red Hat a little bit?

43:08.000 --> 43:14.000
And also, like you said, Sasha Nadella came from the Azure side and that seems like Microsoft's only legitimate future expansion.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
So, of course, that's going to be competitive.

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
And on EC2, Ubuntu, I believe, is the preferred distro that runs over them.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I think it's pretty much the preferred distro on every cloud platform.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
Right, exactly. And this is a huge problem for Red Hat.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
Yeah, they're playing catch up. It's plain and simple.

43:33.000 --> 43:40.000
And today, I don't know, to me, I'm just reading tea leaves here, folks, but today Canonical announced that Oracle and Canonical

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
will collaborate on supporting Oracle Linux on Ubuntu powered infrastructures and vice versa.

43:45.000 --> 43:51.000
So, this is sort of them saying we're going to work together to collaborate on making a common open stack infrastructure

43:51.000 --> 43:57.000
where you'll know you'll have cooperation with either Oracle or Canonical to run their various Linux size.

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
Yeah, that means Oracle Linux is still a thing, of course, but Oracle is in a blog post.

44:01.000 --> 44:08.000
It's important for us to provide choice and interoperability around open stack, i.e. something else besides Red Hat.

44:08.000 --> 44:15.000
Oracle and Canonical are committed to supplying interoperability by supporting Oracle Linux on Ubuntu open stack.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
Our goal is to continue to provide customers with the best in class products and solutions and great customer experience,

44:20.000 --> 44:25.000
i.e. we're going to team up to help continue to push Red Hat out.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
It's funny, when you hear companies talk about interoperability, often what they mean is,

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
we'll allow you to run something else on our platform and that's it, full stop.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
So, Microsoft interoperability for Azure means you can run Ubuntu Linux on Azure.

44:39.000 --> 44:48.000
And for Red Hat, that means you could run CentOS on Red Hat, whereas with the Oracle deal, it's bi-directional.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
You can run Ubuntu on Oracle, you can run Oracle on Ubuntu.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
I guess what I'm not clear on is, how has Red Hat screwed this up?

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
This seems like they were...

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
I don't think they have. They couldn't have. They have a file system called Ceph.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
It's a distributed file system that's pretty much built for open stack usage,

45:04.000 --> 45:10.000
or the other Apache clustering file system that they have to use in those cloud environments because normal file systems don't work.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Right.

45:11.000 --> 45:16.000
They have their own file system built for it and that's what everyone uses and it's XFS based, of course.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
But here's my question, is Oracle Linux still based on RAIL?

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Yeah, that's the funny thing.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
I think so, yeah.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Yeah, they're poisoning the well which they're drawing from, yes.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Exactly.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
You know when conferences and all that stuff happen?

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
For the block layer, all the storage stuff, I always hear that Red Hat is still the biggest.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
It has no competition in the server space.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
Right, right.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
But I guess they're kind of worried about the cloud market.

45:38.000 --> 45:44.000
Well, I think they're dominating a lot of large on-premises installations and a lot of large hosting, a lot of large co-host stuff.

45:44.000 --> 45:53.000
But I think where they're not dominating is this infrastructure on demand, I'm going to go spin up something in a few seconds and deploy it to thousands of endpoints.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
I don't think they're as competitive there and they are definitely building tools.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
They need to sound more sexy again.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
They need to sound more sexy again and be like, we're Ubuntu awesome.

46:01.000 --> 46:09.000
Yeah, Canonical does have a kind of, we sound good, so it's good to have us and it is a selling point, Ubuntu ability.

46:09.000 --> 46:16.000
I would argue that Red Hat isn't the right match for the demands of that type of use case.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
And the reason I say that is it's just a fact of the matter.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
In my opinion, and the only reason I say this is because I've literally set up hundreds of them,

46:25.000 --> 46:32.000
but it is significantly less work to spin up an Ubuntu LTS server than it is a Red Hat server when you're doing certain tasks.

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
And that's if you use task cell and that's if you're more comfortable with apt than RPM.

46:36.000 --> 46:42.000
I grant you those things, but if you accept those conditions, it is faster to set up an Ubuntu LTS system.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
That plays into this.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
That is a factor because I can tell you here at the Jupiter Broadcasting Studios,

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
I don't particularly have one bias to the other, but when we need to spin up a VPS,

46:52.000 --> 46:57.000
I sure as shit don't spin up a CentOS one, I spin up an Ubuntu LTS one every single time.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
Oh yeah, that's not really where the benefit of Red Hat comes in.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
Where the benefit of Red Hat comes in is their support.

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
You can sue them and they give you custom patches for kernels.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
If you have a bug in your company and only you're ever having that problem,

47:13.000 --> 47:19.000
they'll give you a specific custom kernel patch for your problem to make you be operational.

47:19.000 --> 47:24.000
And they'll work with hardware providers and they supply amazing enterprise tools,

47:24.000 --> 47:29.000
but I don't think any of those strengths necessarily play into infrastructure on demand as much.

47:29.000 --> 47:34.000
Not that they're not a player there and not that they're not making changes with Fedora Server and Fedora Cloud,

47:34.000 --> 47:39.000
all that's granted, but I'm just saying that the current conditions on the ground is,

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
there's just certain things stacked against the way you do things on Red Hat, I think.

47:43.000 --> 47:49.000
Well, I think it's admirable that they have the skills to be able to deliver a custom kernel patch

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
for some weird esoteric hardware they're running.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
In the cloud, that doesn't matter. That doesn't matter in the cloud.

47:55.000 --> 48:02.000
It's the same virtual machine. It's a QEMU. It's the same piece of hardware that every Linux distro is running under.

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
And the patches for one vendor will be provided by Microsoft.

48:07.000 --> 48:12.000
The patches for another vendor will be provided by someone else, Amazon or OpenStack or whoever.

48:12.000 --> 48:17.000
And while I think that's an admirable thing they have, I don't think it benefits them in the cloud.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
Good point. All right. So I want to give some other folks a chance to jump in here.

48:20.000 --> 48:25.000
Skyler, you say you kind of have an opinion on what Red Hat's core problem is?

48:25.000 --> 48:32.000
Well, it seems to me that, at least when the younger people think, the younger Linux people think of Red Hat,

48:32.000 --> 48:37.000
we think of this old, the first program, something that everyone uses on the server.

48:37.000 --> 48:46.000
But it's not new. It's not popular. It's just this company that started when Linux first existed,

48:46.000 --> 48:52.000
and now it's here. It exists because it's been forever.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
And it doesn't have that sort of appeal that I think a lot of people started playing with Ubuntu on the cloud

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
because that's what they played with on their desktop.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
So it's the new hotness.

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
Well, it was just what they were playing with at the time when this came around.

49:05.000 --> 49:13.000
When I think of Red Hat, I think corporate. I think Heaven's Revenge hit the nail right on the head.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
I mean, yeah, sure, they'll come out with a crazy kernel patch for whatever esoteric hardware you have.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
If you're a company and you have support content, blah, blah, blah.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
I could never get into Red Hat by virtue of that fact.

49:23.000 --> 49:28.000
Yeah, Red Hat's not for the common man. It's kind of where you have your balls are in a vice

49:28.000 --> 49:33.000
and you're going to get your job fired unless you can actually get this fixed.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
That should be part of a new commercial for them.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
Are your balls in a vice?

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Balls in a vice.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
All right, so Silver Axe, I wanted to give you a chance to respond to.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
It's about needing to spin up these on-demand servers.

49:42.000 --> 49:47.000
You think maybe it's more about what runs those servers?

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
That was your go. No? Okay, all right.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Well, then I'll move on to the next one.

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
Webby, I wanted to give you a chance to chime in too because I know you picked me. Go ahead.

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
Yeah, it was just a lot of the times, especially when you're dealing with management,

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
you're going and you're looking at them and you're saying, you're trying to say,

50:03.000 --> 50:08.000
oh, we should go for this Ubuntu cloud thing and this is going to help us do this or that.

50:08.000 --> 50:15.000
And it's very hard to sell them on something when you just sold them on a bunch of Red Hat boxes a couple months ago

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
and you're like, well, what's the difference here?

50:17.000 --> 50:22.000
And it's like, so when you can already say, by the way, Red Hat is asking

50:22.000 --> 50:26.000
and we have this extra platform on top of this and this will let us do this.

50:26.000 --> 50:30.000
And it's just this little extra platform.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
Okay. All right.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
Wimpy, do you want any closing thoughts on this topic before we run?

50:35.000 --> 50:41.000
Yeah. So when Ubuntu started out, it was squarely aimed at the desktop market.

50:41.000 --> 50:46.000
And although it had server operating systems, you know, bug number one was all about Microsoft

50:46.000 --> 50:51.000
and I think that was fairly squarely aimed at the desktop.

50:51.000 --> 50:57.000
And what happened with Ubuntu's rise in popularity is it attracted developers and administrators

50:57.000 --> 51:02.000
and people got familiar with Ubuntu on the desktop and the skills that they learned

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
were then transferable to the server environment.

51:05.000 --> 51:12.000
And I think this is one of the reasons why you see Ubuntu being so dominant now in the VPS and server space

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
because there's now a generation of developers who've grown up with Ubuntu, who've got the skills

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
and that is their go-to platform.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
And if you look at Red Hat, this isn't just about the cloud

51:22.000 --> 51:26.000
because the other thing they're talking about is Fedora Next and their desktop

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
and making it a developer-friendly thing.

51:29.000 --> 51:34.000
I think it's the Fedora Next desktop and this refocusing on cloud.

51:34.000 --> 51:38.000
And it's those two things together that they're actually trying to go after canonical with

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
because they need to catch up on developer mindshare.

51:40.000 --> 51:45.000
Well, I think it's all good. I mean, I don't know if it's fair to say it's all canonical

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
but I think a lot of the restructuring is because of that.

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
And I think this big press release is a response to them.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
And I don't know if it's too late, maybe not.

51:56.000 --> 52:02.000
But it seems like these kinds of things, these types of technologies, they come in waves.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
And if you miss the wave, then your best bet is to just try to catch the next wave.

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
And I think cheap on-demand servers hit around the same time

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
that people were really starting to experiment with Ubuntu on the desktop

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
and they just happened to nail that timing.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
It's a part of the component.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
And then canonical was smart enough to recognize that and respond.

52:22.000 --> 52:26.000
And not to Red Hat's discredit because Red Hat continued to go off

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
and make billions doing their thing.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
And now they've really locked that down.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
And now I think they're looking back and going,

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
you know, we might have had a little bit of a blind spot

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
and now we're going to try to address that.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.000
And I think that's completely respectable and exactly what you would expect them to do

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
and exactly what they should do.

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
The question is, can they actually truly really pull it off now?

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
Or is it too late?

52:45.000 --> 52:50.000
It'll be glacial in terms of the rate of change and adoption.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
I mean, yeah, of course they can pull it off.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
They have the money.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
Well, and they can stick with it for a long, long time.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Exactly.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
That will be interesting to see.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
We'll follow to see what happens.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
I think this is going to be an interesting little rift

53:02.000 --> 53:07.000
because this is some serious legitimate competition we're going to start seeing go down here.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
And it doesn't have anything to do with phones.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
It doesn't have anything to do with tablets.

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
It's straight up what makes great infrastructure, what makes great support,

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
and I believe it can bring out the best in these companies.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
So as observers, I think we're going to be in for quite a show.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
So we'll see what happens.

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
We've got one more thing I want to get into, and that is the sad state of XFCE

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
and what the Debian project has done about it.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
But before we do that, I want to thank Linux Academy.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
In fact, I'd love to have you head over to Linux Academy right now.

53:34.000 --> 53:39.000
In fact, if you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, you'll get the 33% discount.

53:39.000 --> 53:44.000
And let me tell you, Linux Academy has just rolled out a ton of upgrades.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
And if you're a Linux Academy subscriber, you get them automatically.

53:46.000 --> 53:51.000
And if you haven't been one yet, well, then go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and sign up.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
So Linux Academy is a great resource.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
If you want to learn the backend infrastructure of Linux,

53:56.000 --> 54:01.000
if you want to learn certain things like the software stack, like perhaps maybe Apache, PHP, and MySQL,

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
or R-Sync and things like that, or OpenStack even,

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
or if you want to go down even lower to the networking and stuff like that,

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Linux Academy can accommodate all of that.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
They have step-by-step video courses.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
They have downloadable comprehensive study guides.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
They have 7-plus Linux distributions you can choose from,

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
and then they'll automatically adjust the course where they have on-demand servers.

54:18.000 --> 54:23.000
So as the course requires, they'll spin up a virtual server or an AWS instance in the background for you.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
And they've just rolled out a ton of new things.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
But I think I'm going to talk about learning plans today.

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
Because if you're busy, like I am, this is particularly appealing.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
And it's super, super smart.

54:33.000 --> 54:38.000
And it's such a great way where I can continue to put that carrot in front of me to push myself forward,

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
to learn more, to better myself, but not get burned out and frustrated because I'm too busy.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
They're called learning plans.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
And based on the information that Linux Academy has rolled out to all subscribers,

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
learning plans allow the user to select their daily availability.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
And based on that availability, a study plan is automatically created.

54:54.000 --> 55:00.000
Learning plans will give you the lessons, the quizzes, and the virtual labs that are due on each day.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
And I'll even send you an email reminder if you need it to remind you what's due for that day.

55:04.000 --> 55:09.000
And based on the availability that you set, it will even give you a projected completion date of the course

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
with extra time included for studying.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
I think learning plans is awesome.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
And they've got some great ones for CentOS.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
So we're talking about Red Hat, OpenStack.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
We've been talking about that today.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
They have 14 upcoming courses throughout the remainder of the year, too.

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
And I'll tell you more about those as they get closer.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
Their dashboard lets you pick up right where you left off, gives you estimations of time on each part.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.000
They have a community that can be there for support when you need it.

55:31.000 --> 55:36.000
And they're doing live sessions with the educators more and more so you can ask questions directly to them.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
It's a group of Linux users and educators who got together and said,

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
we can serve the Linux community better.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
And now they're doing it.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
They've created something for Linux users, and it's awesome.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
Go check them out.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
They just got better than ever, too.

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
And a big thanks to Linux Academy for their great support of Linux Unplugged.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
I think it's a really good resource.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
You guys can check it out.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Even if you're a pro, go refresh your skillset.

55:58.000 --> 56:02.000
I think you'll be pretty impressed with the little details you can fill in.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Okay.

56:03.000 --> 56:07.000
So today, or was it today or recently, really recently,

56:07.000 --> 56:12.000
Debian announced that they're going to switch back to GNOME after what was it?

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Guys, what was it?

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
Ten months ago they said they're going to switch to XFCE, or was it even less than that?

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
It was less than that.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
I think it was 10 or 11.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
Okay.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
This is hilarious.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
So not too surprising, right?

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
I mean, so here's what they said.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
According to a Debian developer who is performing this change,

56:26.000 --> 56:35.000
the main reasons for Debian switching back to GNOME from XFCE are accessibility options in GNOME and system deintegration.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
So I think that's pretty interesting.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
It's exactly what I wanted to see.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
Derek Devlin, do you think the Debian users are going to respond well to this?

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
Do you think this is good feedback, that this is something people are going to like?

56:46.000 --> 56:53.000
Yes, and they have the Debian contest, which they use heavily to decide what is default on a Debian installation.

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
So as a Debian user, I am actually pretty happy with it.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
Well, okay.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
But Wimpy, why not Matej?

57:00.000 --> 57:07.000
Well, during the evaluation that took place, Matej scored very highly on the evaluation score sheet.

57:07.000 --> 57:16.000
In fact, coming in just behind GNOME and in fact scoring higher in one area

57:16.000 --> 57:23.000
because Matej can support system D or console kit, which of course on Debian, system D isn't a hard requirement.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Right, right, right.

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
So was it just because it was too new?

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
What was sort of the reason?

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
Or did GNOME just win out in votes?

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
I think GNOME has got a larger group of maintainers behind it,

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
and there's more momentum behind that project in Debian at the moment.

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
Matej is still very fresh.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
Those packages have only just arrived in the last sort of four or five months or so.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
So the team is quite small.

57:48.000 --> 57:52.000
Just a dovetail on that, XFCE has hardly any development currently going on.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Yeah, let me pick up from that point.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
And I want to toss this to Rottencorps.

57:56.000 --> 58:01.000
Isn't this really what we are seeing here is the people,

58:01.000 --> 58:06.000
the Debian community realizing that XFCE is a dead man walking, Rotten?

58:06.000 --> 58:10.000
Well, dogs are barking.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Oh, all right.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
Well, Eric, I'll let you take that.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
Then what do you think, Eric?

58:14.000 --> 58:18.000
Is this a sign that people are waking up and saying, geez, maybe?

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
I mean, let's look at XFCE.

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
Hey, what's XFCE's Wayland plan?

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
There is none.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
Oh, what's XFCE's system D plans?

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
There are none.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Oh, right.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
I mean, mad respect from XFCE, right?

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
Mad respect.

58:33.000 --> 58:41.000
No, look, I've had low-end systems that XFCE has given me the option of feeling like I have a real boy desktop on a low-end system.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
And I have mad respect for that.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
But at the end of the day, Matej is here.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
It's updated.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
It's integrating new features.

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
It has about the same resource requirements as XFCE.

58:51.000 --> 58:56.000
I'm looking at XFCE and I'm thinking, so long.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
And thanks for all the fish.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
Yeah, no kidding.

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
To me, XFCE just doesn't cut it in functionality.

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
Mate or Matej, it's built on all of Gnome 2.

59:05.000 --> 59:10.000
Gnome 2 was in Debian stable for what, 14, 15 years beforehand?

59:10.000 --> 59:16.000
And so it's based on a really solid base, kind of like how X4 was built on the X3 code base.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
They got a solid base.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
Okay.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
All right.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
So are you going to come to XFCE's defense here?

59:23.000 --> 59:29.000
So I'm not going to come directly to its defense, but you really should take it easy on them.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
There are a bunch of university students that are working on this.

59:32.000 --> 59:40.000
There's no people that are hired or there's no XFCE huge team where they have funding every single year for it.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
Right.

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
As opposed to the – and it's especially unfair comparing them to the Matej team who's rolling, right?

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
I mean, I believe they have, what, 25 developers who each make about a million a year working for them?

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
Exactly.

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
Oh, yeah.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
Well, XFCE would be a rhythm of Gnome way back in the day.

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
I mean, obviously, this is always a problem whenever you criticize open source.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
At the end of the day, it's guys and gals working on code in their free time a lot of the times.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
And like I said, I have massive respect for XFCE.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
In fact, it was a go-to desktop for me for a long time.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.000
But at the same time, you know, as users, we also have to say enough is enough.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Katie, you started that way and Gnome started off just as small.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Gnome 2 and X – or Katie 2 and 3 point whatever.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:27.000
If, you know, time comes and they should die or better things actually win out, then so be it.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I totally agree with that.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:36.000
But like by the same token, like XFCE always seems to – you know, when things actually really need to be done, they seem to actually really do them.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
When I need to do something, I start off lost, man.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
What does that mean?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
When something needs to be done, they do it.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
They've released five times in ten years.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Yeah, but I mean like – but it still runs.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
It's still stable.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Because they've changed nothing.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I don't know.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I can comment on that.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
I don't know if I would go with stable.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Wimpy, yeah, just take that.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Can I say something, please?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
All right, yes.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Go ahead, Fred.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Let Fred get in.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Let Fred get in.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
He's been waiting.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Sorry, Fred.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Okay, thanks.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.000
So first of all, if you look at their Git repository, you have about a whole bunch of commits in the past seven days.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000
So they're still like all over – so over a bunch of modules.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Yeah, but what you need to do is then discount all the translations and then look at the actual activity.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000
I mean, translations are still work, you know, that has to be done.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
They are, they are.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:35.000
But by comparison, there's work that needs to be done on things like Upower support, which hasn't been done.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Right.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
And as Rotten alluded to, there hasn't been a stable release for over two and a half years.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
So there's some real big rot in 4.10.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
But the more important thing –

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
That's not necessarily a bad thing.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
So they are –

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
No, it's the bad thing is that it happens every time.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
It's okay.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
It's okay.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Just give them time.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
They are underpowered.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Just give them time.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I'm in the same campus, Fred.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:08.000
And by the way, KDE and GNOME, yeah, they have like great system D plans and they have like great Wayland plans and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah all day long.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Yeah, good plans.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:18.000
By the way, by the way, we're going to watch KDE and GNOME crash a hundred times a day on Wayland until things get better.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Absolutely.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
There is some truth in that.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
But Xfce is going to come later and they're going to look at the lessons learned.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
They're not going to make the same mistakes and they're going to take their time preparing it.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000
But don't you feel like, don't you feel like if there was any distribution in the world that understood that logic, it would be Debian?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Because that's like Debian to a T and yet even for Debian, Xfce is too slow.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
FreeBSD as well.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Or FreeBSD, yeah?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Or the BSDs in general.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Also, I would like to point out that Xfce is like way, way, it's much more of a community project than GNOME as an example.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
GNOME and system D, by the way.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Right, right.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Yes, very good point.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:11.000
But that still doesn't take into effect the fact that every single release is never more – under a year from the last release.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And most of the time they take even more than that.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
That one time they took three years and now they're almost at three years.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And the fact that they even said they were going to release 4.12, which is the one that isn't out yet, they're going to release that in January of 2013 and they massively missed that goal.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
They missed every single goal they ever make.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Okay, just use your desktop and why do you have to care about releases?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Just use the applications.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
That's what it's there for.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Why do you care so much about the desktop?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Well, if I'm building a project that requires GTK3 and then they don't allow you to have GTK3 and then there's a bunch of people asking for an older version and for an older toolkit that no one's using anymore or should use but Xfce is completely dependent on, that's an issue.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
That's the wrong radical changes to underlying system components.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
This is just bad design from other people.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
It's not their fault.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
All right, let's take a pause here because I think we're kind of getting in the weeds and I want to give Wimpy a chance to chime in on a couple more issues and then we'll loop back.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
So go ahead, Wimpy.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I'd just like to answer Fred there about why does it matter?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Why do they need a new release?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And if the underlying libraries and components weren't changing, you wouldn't need to make a new release of Xfce 4.10 because it's a stable desktop.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:41.000
But the fact is the underlying technologies are changing and they haven't had a stable release that keeps up with those changes, which means that now they're at a place where they can't support the underlying technologies.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And for example, there was a uPower 0.99.1 transition proposed for Ubuntu 14.10 and that was effectively vetoed by the Ubuntu team because there's not sufficient support in Xfce for that.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
So it's been deferred until the next cycle.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.000
And we went through similar growing pains in Arch Linux with Xfce.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Wait, has that been deferred only because of Xfce?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Everyone else has plus one to accept Xfce.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Yeah, go and read it.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Yeah, the last few comments.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
And it potentially introduces a blocker on name three.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I absolutely agree.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000
They are underpowered and the underlying system components keep changing.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
For my taste, too quickly that it's becoming really annoying.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
But okay, they are underpowered and I absolutely agree with you.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
They sometimes have to keep up.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Yeah, they're not keeping up with the pace.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
But still, I mean, I'm sorry.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Today, GNOME 3, the great GNOME 3 that everybody is praising right now, just froze.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
It just froze out of nowhere.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Like the applications were still working, but the shell just stopped rendering.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And I had to switch to TTY and kill GNOME shell and then restart it again and so on.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And Xfce has never done anything like that to me.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I'm sorry.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
You have to bear with that.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
That's been my experience.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Yeah, me too.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
All right.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Well, you know what?

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
I think Pope is right.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I mean, we can sit here and we can pitch.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
But one of the things we always talk about is we do have the advantage of actually helping.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
And I guess if Xfce is so important to people, then they should put their money where their mouth is

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000
and either contribute financially or contribute time-wise or even contribute just to promote the project.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And maybe it has a shot.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000
It seems like there's enough people here that give a crap that if people acted on that

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
and maybe helped the project out, it could push through these challenges.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000
It seems like right now Xfce is on the ropes, but it's not out.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
And there's still a legitimate use case for it and people who care about it.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.000
But there's also undeniably legitimate problems that could start affecting.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Actually, you know what?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Pope and Wimpy gave us a great example.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
It has already affected wider things in the Linux system.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
So obviously these are things that need to be taken care of.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:17.000
But I honestly see the way I look at it and I believe this is the overriding thing that we are facing

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:23.000
is there are other alternatives out there that are just simply here today and working.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000
And I would point to Matei and I would also point to the classic mode of GNOME,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
which will give you, if you don't have the hardware restrictions,

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.000
a lot of that classical desktop feel from GNOME 2 and that solves the high-end issue.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.000
And Matei is solving the people who either want something even more classical or resource constrained.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000
And those are two ends that Xfce is now going to have its lunch eaten from.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
And they are not only not keeping up to date with the needs of their end users,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
but they are also now lacking competitively.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And we've all had the problem where icons rearrange in the top bar in Xfce when something happens

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
or our dual displays don't work correctly for some reason.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
We've all had these problems in Xfce and they are kind of getting to the point where it's getting a little old.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:12.000
But what I'm walking away from this conversation is people give a hell of a lot more of a crap about it than I thought they did.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And I think we should try to turn that around and actually make some positive action from it.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Yeah, if people want it, they need to step up, man up or woman up and help out.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
You know what, Wimpy, you're absolutely right.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Bring up, there's another bit of pressure on Xfce, isn't there?

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Yeah, LXQT.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Right. Yeah, absolutely.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Yeah.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
That's really solid.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
There you go.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Yeah, that's another big, yeah, that's another thing that's...

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And I think, frankly, that's going to start putting pressure on some of...

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
That's probably where I would go.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I mean, you know, if they can't fund their stuff, that's, I don't...

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
First of all, if your funding model sucks, that sucks to be you, I'm sorry.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Well, I don't know if it is that.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I think it's just a matter of time and dedicated resources.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Or whatever the issue is.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I mean, I'll just move to another desktop.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I mean, I don't care, but I will tell you right now that, I mean, I have a gaming box that, while it's nothing to write home about, it does the job.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
But for me, it's always been such a waste of effort to run a bloated desktop.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
What's the point?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
What's the point?

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000
I hear that.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Why? Why would I?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Yeah, why waste resources?

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I'd rather put that RAM into my game or something.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Right, yeah.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
No, I hear that.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Yeah, I definitely hear that.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
That's why I just get ridiculous amounts of RAM.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Wow.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I'm sat here like Spider-Man on my Unity machine, and I'm seeing all these people talking about...

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Spider-Man.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
You went for Spider-Man.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Spider-Man memes.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I like that.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And I'm seeing all these options that people have.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I mean, there are so many options.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
And that's, you know, this whole choice thing that, you know, we've often talked about.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Yeah, there's the bleeding edge Unity and Gnome Shell and then this new contender, LXQt.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:52.000
There's still, you know, we're 2014, and there's still loads of choice out there for people to pick something else.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
You know, if a project does wither and die, well, so be it, and, you know, move on to something else.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Ain't it grand.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Ain't it grand.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
And yet we still bitch about it.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Yeah, sure, right?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
That's what we do, right?

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Yeah.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Well, I was just going to say one more thing.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Yeah.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Just, there is this new trend.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:14.000
And so I think at the beginning of the show, you said something about, you know, how system D parallelizes startup and all this stuff.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
And I was talking today with a colleague about that.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:24.000
And it seems like fancy, like lately, fancy seems to trump correctness.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
And I absolutely hate that.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
So XFCE is kind of the tried and true and working well.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Totally.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:43.000
It's still trying out stuff, you know, like a lot of people have had horrible experiences with KDE 5, and it keeps crashing and so on.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
They just didn't take their time.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
XFCE guys are underpowered, and they take their time.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
They're not going to make a release if they don't think it's ready.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:11:01.000
It's very easy to be tried and true when you don't change the core content of your system for 11 years.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
It is really easy to be tried and true at that point.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Well, but that is something that does appeal to some people.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
All right.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Ron's got a horror story that we'll save for the post-show because I think that's going to be interesting.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
And I feel like we've covered it.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
And I think I've said my piece about it.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000
And what I would like to say is, you know, try out, if you are struggling with XFCE, try out other options.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And if it works for you, then just be happy with it.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:35.000
But for me, I think XFCE, I didn't even realize it, but I think I stopped installing it about a year ago.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And mostly that's because there's just other options now, and it just depends on the distro I'm installing.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And I'll either go with Mate or LXQT, and I kind of call it good.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
So I hope that's not the future.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000
There's one other desktop out there as well that's slowly coming to Linux, and that's the Lumina desktop from the BSDs.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Yeah, another QT desktop.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Yeah, and very XFCE-like.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
I tried it out. Give me the file manager, and we don't need Lumina anymore.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000
That's true. The file manager is super sweet, the way it integrates ZFS snapshots. That's really cool.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Yeah, that's the thing that'll bring to everyone else.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
BSD Now did an interview, or actually a walkthrough of the Lumina desktop.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:19.000
If you go to look at the BSD Now back catalog, because Chris Moore, creator of PCBSD and co-host of BSD Now,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
it's his brother that's making the desktop.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
So he just sat down with his brother, and they did a screencast, and they recorded a bunch of stuff.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
So if you're curious about the Lumina desktop, they've got, I think, two episodes on it now.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
So you can check that out.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
By the way, I'd like to advocate one more thing for XFCE.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Please, everybody, try the multiple file renamer from Thunar, the file manager.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Yeah, Thunar is awesome, actually.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I always use the renamer for... I downloaded a lot of things with large playlists.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
That renamer was so very helpful.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Oh, wait a minute. What are you doing there?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
All right, well, we'll get Rotten Corpse's story in the post-show, but, Matt, that's going to wrap us up for today.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Man, we covered a lot of ground in this episode. Holy smokes!

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
No kidding.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
I wonder if I will have a resolution to my firewall conundrum in Sunday's Linux action show.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
You never know, Matt. You never know.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Could happen.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
But I'll see you on Sunday, and hope you have a great rest of your weekend.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Happy post-birthday.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Oh, yeah, thanks.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
We're, like, sandwiched right in between it.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Like, you had your birthday in between last and Linux Unplugged.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
So, super low-key, had a great time.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Good. I'm glad to hear it. Well, happy birthday, and I'll see you on Sunday, Matt.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
See you then.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
All right, everyone. Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Don't forget, we do this show on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
We'll have that in your local time zone.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
You can also go over to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact to send us your feedback.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
That's a huge part of our show.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
And the subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
An awesome place to go. We'll have a feedback thread.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
You can give us ideas if we want you.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
You know, maybe you had an XFCE rant, post it over there. We'll give it a read.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
All right, everyone. Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:21.000
See you right back here next Tuesday.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000
All right, we're out.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Okay, Rodden, why don't you share with us your horror story that happened?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Because I know you got all fired up about XFCE and you were just waiting to rip into him.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
And I didn't want to put that in the main show because I feel like I didn't want to be a bash on XFCE.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
But you obviously ran into something that got you all fired up.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Oh, did I? You had a good gun.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Did I?

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
A little bit.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Oh, I didn't mean to.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I didn't walk in.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Wow. Oh, well, okay. All right.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
I didn't actually think I was being that mean.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
There I go.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I was definitely going to be mean because it essentially crashed my hard drive.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Now, how can that be? How could it crash your hard drive?

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000
You would think it's not a big deal, and I wouldn't have expected it to happen.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
That's why I didn't bother doing what I normally would have.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I basically loaded up a live USB of Xubuntu.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:14.000
And then I mounted my main hard drive for my laptop.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
And then I forgot to unmount it before I turned off my computer.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Any other system I have ever done that in, nothing happens.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000
But with XFCE or Xubuntu specifically, it crashed the hard drive completely.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
It was unmountable.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
I had to just completely rescue it.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
No way. How can that be XFCE's fault, though?

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Yeah.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
It sounds like a bad library somewhere or something.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Yeah.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000
That's why when I put it in the chat room, that's why I said it was Xubuntu's fault because it was Xubuntu's fault.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Yeah, those bastards.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Yeah, you know what?

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
To me, it sounds like a rogue library.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
You had a Cardassian in your Klingon mix or something. I don't know.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I even did it with Ubuntu and Lubuntu before I tried the Xubuntu because I was just playing with some DEs and stuff.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
And none of them had a problem.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
The only one that had a problem was Ubuntu.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:06.000
So it's not an XFCE-specific thing, but it is definitely an Xubuntu-specific thing.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
No, I don't doubt that.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:16.000
It sounds like maybe that particular flavor had some sort of rogueness inside of it somewhere that maybe said, you know what, screw you.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Did you happen to download that ISO from FreeBSD.org?

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:38.000
No.
