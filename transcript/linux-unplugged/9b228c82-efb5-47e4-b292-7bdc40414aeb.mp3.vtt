00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged, a very special holiday edition of the show for 2016.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, the show that promises to be the best of, but how could it actually deliver?

00:23.000 --> 00:30.000
My name is Chris on a very special edition of the show. We decided to give people the week off,

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
and by people, I mean everybody but the beard and I, because this is our collection, our look back at 2016

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
for the Linux Unplugged program, and how could you encapsulate this show in one single best of?

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
It can't be done. And let's be honest, I'm too busy thinking about the presents for my kids to think about this,

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
so we pawned it off onto a bunch of bots. They were powered by the Google Compute Cloud.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
They just had to analyze our inboxes for like a year, and then they came up with the best of topics for us

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
into a spreadsheet, which I have right here, and now we're going to formulate that into a show for you.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
What could go wrong? Some of that is actually true. Some of that is actually true.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Now, coming up on this week's episode, we'll go back over the year for Linux Unplugged,

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
pick out a few of the gems, and see if we can spot a few of the trends too.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
You know, that virtual lug, you never know what you're going to get. It's a random mix.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
The show really is fairly unstructured. When we launch into a Linux Unplugged episode,

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
we have a brief outline of what we want to cover, but the good stuff is always kind of spontaneous.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
It's the juicy stuff, so let's look at this list, see what the Google bots have come up with,

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
and see what might be a little interesting. Now, I'm looking through. I see a couple of things.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
Let's start out here with a server in your pocket. We can start talking about Mate,

01:49.000 --> 01:55.000
and then the classic debates of the traditional desktop versus Unity, versus Gnome,

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
begin marking the first of many debates for 2016.

02:00.000 --> 02:09.000
So Wimpy, I'm interested to some degree to get your perception, because Ubuntu Mate is one of those distros

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
where I have not, to the best of my knowledge, found a single thing when using Ubuntu Mate,

02:16.000 --> 02:24.000
where it makes me feel like I'm on an alternative desktop from standard Ubuntu.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Everything just works. I mean, literally everything just works.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
In fact, so much so that actually all of the production machines that I have here in Grand Forks,

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
with the exception of the one I'm on now, but all the rest of them are actually running Ubuntu Mate,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
because it runs lighter than it does with Unity.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
And I'm wondering, you know, what kind of considerations went into that,

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
and how you guys feel about that, and how that plays out.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
Well, Ubuntu Mate is just Ubuntu. In fact, it is Ubuntu.

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
When you boil it down, you simply, I say simply, it's taken a year and a half to do.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
You remove Unity and you put the Mate desktop on top,

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
but then you keep all of the Ubuntu tools and integrations that already exist underneath the hood,

03:16.000 --> 03:26.000
which is what gives you all of that stability and just works goodness of Ubuntu on a traditional desktop environment.

03:26.000 --> 03:36.000
So, and one of the reasons why Mate is lighter than Unity is that it's based on Gnome 2,

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
with all of the old compatibility stuff from Gnome 1 removed,

03:40.000 --> 03:48.000
and all of the underpinnings upgraded to the latest versions of all the recent technologies.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
And it's all written in C, so it's a very lightweight implementation by, you know,

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
in comparison to what it was when it was Gnome 2 in its sort of last versions.

03:59.000 --> 04:09.000
So, it's kind of happenstance in some respects that Mate has now come out as a lightweight desktop alternative.

04:09.000 --> 04:19.000
Outstanding. Anyone else have thoughts or opinions on desktop environments?

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
Sorry, my audio is terrible. I'm in America for scale.

04:23.000 --> 04:30.000
So, there's a few things. One, whenever anyone says I'm one of the few people who like Unity,

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
I want to slap them because there are millions of people who use Unity.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Watch out at scale. Watch out at scale, Noah.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
And, you know, saying I'm one of the few people.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
What actually is the case is there are a few really negative people who don't like it and who are very vocal.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
And there's a vast number of people who use it and aren't vocal.

04:50.000 --> 04:57.000
So, you know, saying you're one of the few people, you should actually say I'm one of the majority who like Unity, to be fair.

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
So, the original question, you know, from the guideposts on Reddit was about, you know, why don't we just use Gnome?

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
You could use that same argument about every single desktop.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
Why don't you just all pack up and go home and use something else is effectively what you're saying.

05:13.000 --> 05:24.000
And every single desktop has their own niche that they want to fulfill or use cases that they address that others don't.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
Like, you know, for example, elementary have their niche.

05:30.000 --> 05:38.000
I would like to have a, you know, well-designed, pretty robust, you know, functional desktop.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
That sounds like a reasonable thing.

05:40.000 --> 05:52.000
And so, you know, I think it's unreasonable to suggest that the people who are working on those things should throw that away and use something else instead.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
You might just as well say why don't KDE give up and switch to Gnome?

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
It's a nonsensical argument from my point of view.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
That's fair.

06:01.000 --> 06:10.000
So, basically, and I admit that this is a horrible, horrible thing to base a generalization on, but I'm admitting that up front.

06:10.000 --> 06:18.000
But it was a couple months ago, maybe even a year ago, that we did a poll, a straw poll, to find out what desktop environment people were using.

06:18.000 --> 06:26.000
And I was shocked at how many people didn't vote for Unity and Gnome shot way to the top and Unity was down there.

06:26.000 --> 06:39.000
And I guess I've had that correct or incorrect or correct perception that Unity just wasn't preferred by a lot of the people that, you know, that are aware of other desktop environments that are out there.

06:39.000 --> 06:47.000
And I fully admit that, you know, working in the space that you work in, you're going to have a much, much, much more realistic perception.

06:47.000 --> 07:02.000
Or completely biased, and you should throw away my opinion completely, and you should only listen to people who are outside of this bubble, because their opinion won't be tarnished, you know, potentially is one side of it.

07:02.000 --> 07:12.000
But the flip side is, any of these polls are deeply flawed, the same way that using DistroWatch is your measure.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Exactly the same.

07:13.000 --> 07:39.000
It's ridiculous. And people who place any importance on something which is basically a poll, which can be shared amongst a subreddit, which massively skews the numbers for any one distro, plus or minus, when in fact, the actual people who use and like a particular desktop or user interface or application or whatever, are ultimately never going to see that poll.

07:39.000 --> 07:47.000
My mum uses Ubuntu and has used Ubuntu for years. She will never see that poll and never click on anything in that poll.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
That's exactly the point I was thinking is that...

07:49.000 --> 08:02.000
However many millions of people in China use the Ubuntu desktop, they're never going to see this because of things written in English, for one. So it's just ludicrous.

08:02.000 --> 08:13.000
We in particular also are a community of Linux enthusiasts and people who like customization. I think some of Unity's strengths is that it can be widely deployed and it's pretty easy for people to just get it.

08:13.000 --> 08:21.000
The icons are right there on the left. You hit the super key, things just work. So it has a lot going for it. Like you said, your mum can use it. My mum uses it. It's great.

08:21.000 --> 08:33.000
Well, and we also have... Unity is actually the default desktop, not the default desktop, it's the only desktop, on all of our kiosk machines that we deploy. So basically, if you think about the target audience there, it's...

08:33.000 --> 08:48.000
We're taking people from all walks of the technical spectrum and saying that no matter who walks in, if they sit down and they want to check their email, print a boarding pass or check the weather, they're going to be able to accomplish those things quickly, easily and without complaining to the front desk.

08:48.000 --> 09:06.000
Because of course, if they complain, then we lose the contract. And what we found is that little bar on the side of Unity, which by the way requires no tweaking and requires no extensions, which means we don't have to update anything, is incredibly useful in a situation like that.

09:06.000 --> 09:23.000
So I agree that the average person walking around the street is going to sit down and have no trouble using Unity. And I think I even started out by saying, I phrased it poorly, but the gist of the message was, it's my personal belief that Unity is a more polished desktop than GNOME is.

09:23.000 --> 09:41.000
But for whatever reason, and maybe it is just that people are terribly vocal, I guess there is a perception from some people that the Unity desktop is inferior, correct or incorrect?

09:41.000 --> 10:04.000
Well, that's different. Any individual, any Reddit consumer is entitled to have their opinion and it's perfectly fine for someone to say Unity is inferior because of these X, Y, Z reasons, in the same way that someone might not like Enlightenment or someone might not like KDE because it doesn't work their workflow or the apps don't look right.

10:04.000 --> 10:30.000
For whatever reason, it's perfectly fine for people to have their opinions and like buttholes, everyone's gone. The problem is when you try and extrapolate from a poll on a random website somewhere and make bold, assertive statements about whether something is right or wrong or whether something is good or bad based on a button clicked by a bunch of random people on the internet.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
It makes no sense whatsoever to me, but that's just me.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
No, I think that's completely fair.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
Let's talk about my Librem impressions. What's the point of a perfect desktop if you don't have great hardware?

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Okay, Wes, you had some time to, you know.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Yes, I did. You know, it's a nice looking laptop.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
It is. It feels good.

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
Yeah, it's not too heavy. It's reasonably well balanced. It's metal, so that's kind of cool. You don't see that every day on a Linux laptop.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
So what is missing, as far as I'm concerned, on the Librem 15?

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
I will say there are some sharp edges on this thing.

11:00.000 --> 11:07.000
That's true. That's true. That is true. There's something missing, though, that's a pretty big deal to me.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Can you guess what it is?

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
You're looking in the right area right now. You're warm. You're real warm, Wes. You're real warm.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
Well, there's no CD drive, but I don't think that's what you want.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
You're right. That's not it.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
It's got SD card. It's got USB. It's got a TC in. That's important.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
That is important.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
It's got some seemingly mysteriously unlabeled switches.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Yes, it does. Unlabeled switches, hardware switches.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
HDMI?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Yeah.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
I don't know.

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
There's one port that's not there that's pretty important to me. Ethernet.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Yeah, there's no Ethernet, and the one I backed specifically did list Ethernet.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
That's a bummer.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.000
It was one of those little RJ45 drop-down ports that is a half port that you have to pry open.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Pry open before you can actually use it.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
But in the crowdfunding version, it did list Ethernet.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
I don't like being live on the air and relying on Wi-Fi, so that was a bit of a bummer.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
It was the version I got, the edition I got, no Ethernet.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
And I've tried to track down when the Ethernet kind of disappeared, if it was the switch to Rev2 or not,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
but the initial report of Rev2, it would have Ethernet,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
and then there was another post where it doesn't.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
I have a few links in the show notes.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
So I was a little – I –

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
You had to probably use like a USB 3.0 adapter or something.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
Yeah, and it's one of those things where the only reason why I kind of mention it is because I wouldn't have bought it

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
if it didn't have Ethernet, because Ethernet is actually a pretty big deal to me.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
I actually like gigabit speeds, not 802.11 speeds.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And you want low latency for studio stuff anyway.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Yeah, exactly.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
So that was sort of my first impression.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
But outside of that, the metal coloring, like this is not a small thing.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Like they nailed this.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
This looks – mine is not the dark metal.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Mine is like an exact – looks like a MacBook.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
It really does.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Yeah, metal, which is pretty cool.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah, it's not a bad looking machine at all.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
A couple other things, just first impressions that jumped out at me,

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
is the version I looked at online, they had –

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
and let's see if I can pull it up here for you.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Scrolling, scrolling.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
They show – there it is.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
There it is.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
They show what they call the purism key, which is the super key,

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
which is where the Windows key –

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
To make sure everything is pure.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
I'm going to go ahead and open the laptop up, which will wake it up.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
You may start hearing it.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
Wes, if you could just take a look at the keyboard, what does that look like?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
What key?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Does that super key to you look like a square to you,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
or does that look like a Windows key to you?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
No, that looks like the Windows logo, Chris.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Yes.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
So I was a little surprised that the keyboard –

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Are you running Windows on there?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Did it come with Windows?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
No.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
No.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
I was a little surprised that the keyboard had a Windows key.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Not a big deal, but I was expecting the hardware –

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
That's another – you're going to have to get one of those little penguin stickers.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Yeah, yeah.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
The other thing that's challenging about this is the specs that they list online

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
do not match the specs that I was shipped, because I got an older model.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
And the main thing that's really jumping out at me about this one –

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
I don't know if you can hear it, Wes.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Is it windy in the studio, Chris?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
No, Wes.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
I've woken the laptop up, and so that's the sound it makes.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
And it's loud enough, Wes, that –

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
What the heck is that?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
That's the laptop.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
That's the fan.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
That's the laptop.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
I got to tell you, you walk into a room and you can hear this thing.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah, definitely.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I heard it when I walked into the studio this morning.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
In fact, I'm going to put it to sleep again so the sound goes down.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
But it's very loud.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Are you holding it up to the microphone and shaking it around?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Close to it.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
No, no.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
It's – no, my mouth is much closer than the fan.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I now have it off.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
It's very quiet when it's off, so that's an excellent way.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
It sounds like –

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Weird noise.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
It sounds like what other laptops make when they're like totally maxed out.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Well, it might be a little weird because the gate is trying to specifically filter it out.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Right.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Yeah.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
That sounds like you're rendering a video or something.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
So that sort of almost immediately eliminates it for production use.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
Wes, however, brought over a mini screwdriver kit, and I'm considering opening the bottom

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
of it and seeing if I can replace the fan.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
It's not driver control.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
At least take a look, you know.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
So here's what I tried to do.

15:01.000 --> 15:06.000
It ships with Purism OS, which is using Cinnamon for the desktop.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
And the nice thing about that is you can actually manage the trackpad.

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
So I reloaded with Ubuntu 16.04 and did all the installation, set everything up.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
The only proprietary driver in use is the Intel microcode stuff.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
It's got Broadwell Iris 6100 graphics.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
That sounds nice.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Yeah, it's a three gigahertz processor.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
There is nothing you can do thermal management-wise about that fan.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
So I could not – there was no driver to load.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
There was no LM sensors command.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
There's nothing you can do.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
It is just hard set to full blast.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
It's wired just on maximum.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
You probably won't have any overheating problems.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Yeah.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
So my hope is I'm going to pull off the bottom and see if I can replace that fan or whatever.

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
I mean, with integrated graphics and whatnot, I just can't imagine it needs to be running like that.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Especially when you're not actively really doing anything.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Ah, thank you.

15:56.000 --> 16:03.000
So FreeBSDSA says the email from 4 – 2715 states that the RJ45 was removed from Rev2.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Yeah.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Yeah.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Is there UFI settings for it?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Yeah.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Go ahead, Wim.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
You had a question regarding the fan noise.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
No, I've got a potential solution for fan noise.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Oh, yeah.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Mm-hmm.

16:14.000 --> 16:20.000
Though, Entroware ran into this fan noise problem when they were working on the same

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
line of machines.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
And it's a bug in the firmware from the ODM.

16:27.000 --> 16:35.000
And you may be able to work around this by holding the power down for like 10 seconds

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
and hard powering off the machine.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
And that may reset the system and the fans may correct themselves.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Okay.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
So I'm holding it down right now.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Of course, it just went to sleep when I did that.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
But it actually just turned off instantly.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Hmm.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Yeah.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
That I'm willing to play around with.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Yeah.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
That would be great.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I did go through the BIOS and look for like thermal management settings and stuff like

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
that.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I found nothing there.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
The trackpad.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Let's talk about the trackpad.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
I've heard some interesting things about the trackpad online.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
It looks pretty big.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
All right.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
So I'm holding it down for 10 seconds.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
The problem is it instantly turns off and then nothing happens.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
The trackpad is big.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
It works well.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
The problem is both GNOME and Ubuntu by default, they just only allow you to scroll on the

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
very small side here.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Yes, right.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
If you use Purism OS, it comes with Cinnamon.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
And Cinnamon's mouse control panel settings allow you to actually change it to two-finger

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
scrolling, which works better.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Keyboard is pretty good.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
The escape key on mine is a little mushy.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
It doesn't always register.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Mushy.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Yeah, my escape key doesn't always register.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
So I sometimes have to hit escape twice, which means sometimes I have to hit it four times.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
So it's not awesome that way.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I'm holding it down for 10 seconds.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
We'll see what happens.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
I'll keep it at grub so it doesn't boot.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
All right.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
So I should be about five seconds in.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
This thing's really loud.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Yeah, it is.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Okay.

17:55.000 --> 18:00.000
This might be like a workplace hazard.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Still running.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
It hasn't turned off yet.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
I don't know if it's going to turn off.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
I feel like I've been holding it for like 20 seconds.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Feels like it's been like 10 minutes.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Been a while.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Yeah, it's still going.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
I know Mike's listening.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Mike, telegram me.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
There's something else we should be doing.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Did it get quieter?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Is it quieter now?

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
I don't think so.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
No.

18:14.000 --> 18:28.520
What I was expecting is the machine should go off, and it's once it's off, you can then

18:28.520 --> 18:31.360
power it on again, and it may.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.360
It's not guaranteed.

18:32.360 --> 18:33.360
It may.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.360
All right.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.360
So I just let off and turn off the fans.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.360
No.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.360
Huh.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.360
Yeah.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.360
Yeah.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.360
Your GQ is loose.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.360
So FreeBSD, you have yours.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.360
What have been your initial impressions?

18:42.360 --> 18:47.360
It's not a bad piece of hardware.

18:47.360 --> 18:56.800
If I'd have seen it in the store before backing it, I probably wouldn't have bought it.

18:56.800 --> 19:00.440
All in all, it is nice, except for, like I said, the loose GQ.

19:00.440 --> 19:04.520
And of course, when I'm running something other than PROS, I have trackpad problems

19:04.520 --> 19:06.080
that I'm going to work on.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.880
Yeah, that's been my experience, too.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.680
Performance, pretty darn good.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.800
You thought it's been pretty performant on yours?

19:14.800 --> 19:17.200
Yeah, it performs really well.

19:17.200 --> 19:22.760
I've done some full-screen Flash movies on it with no problem.

19:22.760 --> 19:27.420
Now Wimpy, I guess the trackpad has a bit of a rep.

19:27.420 --> 19:30.040
You know a little bit about some of its tricks already.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.040
Yeah.

19:31.040 --> 19:38.560
There's no mainline Linux kernel support for the trackpad that's in the Librems.

19:38.560 --> 19:45.600
So there's been a few of us working on a driver for the BYD trackpad.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.760
And that's currently an out-of-tree patch.

19:47.760 --> 19:55.080
And what Purism are doing is shipping a bespoke kernel with PureOS.

19:55.080 --> 20:03.720
It has the full touch gesture support in PureOS, but if you install any other version of Linux,

20:03.720 --> 20:09.320
then it will revert to a PS2 mouse.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.880
Hence the weird scroll and stuff like that.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.600
So I have a kernel patch I can send you.

20:14.600 --> 20:15.600
Wow.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.960
Take it back like ten years here.

20:16.960 --> 20:20.400
This is not why you buy a laptop dedicated for Linux though.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.840
No, this is the point.

20:23.840 --> 20:31.720
The other thing is, you know when in the past you've talked about System76 don't just take

20:31.720 --> 20:35.600
the ODM equipment and stick their badge on it and ship it out the door.

20:35.600 --> 20:43.280
They actually work on firmware and BIOS enhancements and all the rest of it and get bespoke changes.

20:43.280 --> 20:45.280
Right.

20:45.280 --> 20:51.220
This is the same sort of thing that Entroware have done, and they've overcome some of these

20:51.220 --> 20:56.560
issues that you're discussing now, like the fan for example.

20:56.560 --> 21:00.280
And that doesn't seem to have happened here.

21:00.280 --> 21:01.280
So here's the rig I got.

21:01.280 --> 21:06.280
Eight gigabytes of RAM, 500 gigabyte SSD, which I paid a little extra for.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.080
It's supposed to have a CD-ROM and DVD.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.520
It does not, which I don't care about.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.520
No big deal.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.720
But I'm looking at the specs I bought on Indiegogo.

21:14.720 --> 21:19.760
It is listed as having a CD and DVD ROM.

21:19.760 --> 21:25.360
It also ships with like a 65 watt adapter, which I'm not sure is actually enough.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.360
It takes a while to charge.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.480
The nice thing is it's kind of small.

21:28.480 --> 21:37.120
I paid for a core, this is a three gigahertz Broadwell CPU, Iris 6100 graphics, eight gigabytes

21:37.120 --> 21:44.240
of RAM, I would have preferred 16, eight gigabytes of RAM, 1920 by 1080 display.

21:44.240 --> 21:49.320
I paid $1,824 for this machine.

21:49.320 --> 21:53.800
If I was going to spend $1,800 on a machine today, you could guarantee it's going to come

21:53.800 --> 21:55.200
with Skylake.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.200
You could guarantee-

21:56.200 --> 22:01.800
Probably at least 16 gigs of RAM.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.120
Maybe dedicated graphics at $1,800.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.680
You might get that too.

22:05.680 --> 22:09.520
Now is it going to be something that has hardware switches for a webcam?

22:09.520 --> 22:12.240
Is it going to have something that has hardware switches for the mic and stuff like that?

22:12.240 --> 22:13.640
I actually do really like that.

22:13.640 --> 22:14.640
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

22:14.640 --> 22:18.880
And I also like the idea of supporting a company who is pushing the conversation about privacy

22:18.880 --> 22:22.680
and security forward, and it's their primary leading cause.

22:22.680 --> 22:27.840
So those are things that my money went towards that I still like.

22:27.840 --> 22:31.320
Basically where I'm at right now with this thing is it has a strange USB-C port that

22:31.320 --> 22:32.320
I wasn't expecting.

22:32.320 --> 22:33.400
Yes, I saw that.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.400
That's interesting.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.400
I don't know.

22:35.400 --> 22:36.860
You see, it didn't come with any documentation.

22:36.860 --> 22:37.860
It just came-

22:37.860 --> 22:38.860
So there's no manual.

22:38.860 --> 22:39.860
There's no-

22:39.860 --> 22:40.860
Naked in the box.

22:40.860 --> 22:45.920
It's a very generic box, in fact, when I got the box, I immediately started to feel like,

22:45.920 --> 22:46.920
oh no.

22:46.920 --> 22:51.720
I immediately started like this, it was starting to set my expectations low because the box

22:51.720 --> 22:52.720
was used-

22:52.720 --> 22:53.720
A finished kind of thing.

22:53.720 --> 23:01.000
It had like five or 10 other FedEx stickers on it, and there was not even like a brochure

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
in the box, right?

23:02.000 --> 23:04.280
It was no documentation, nothing.

23:04.280 --> 23:08.400
No thank you for backing our project, sorry it took so long, nothing.

23:08.400 --> 23:11.960
And so that sort of was like, eh, I'm a little worried about that.

23:11.960 --> 23:15.080
That all aside though, one of the things I would have liked to have in the box is what

23:15.080 --> 23:16.200
is this USB-C port?

23:16.200 --> 23:18.320
Because the one I backed doesn't have this port.

23:18.320 --> 23:22.080
The one I backed, where this port's at, was an ethernet port.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.080
And is this USB-C?

23:23.080 --> 23:24.080
Can I charge the device with this?

23:24.080 --> 23:25.080
Because it hasn't-

23:25.080 --> 23:26.080
Is it real USB-C?

23:26.080 --> 23:27.080
It's USB-C with an electricity bolt.

23:27.080 --> 23:30.540
Does that mean I can actually draw power from that port?

23:30.540 --> 23:33.200
What does that do?

23:33.200 --> 23:34.200
I got nothing.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.200
I got no-

23:35.200 --> 23:41.680
There's also questions if this is actually HDMI 2.0 or not, I'm not sure about that.

23:41.680 --> 23:42.680
Those are issues.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.080
Have you tried the SD card slot?

23:44.080 --> 23:45.080
No.

23:45.080 --> 23:47.840
But I think the other thing I like is it looks like perhaps that's a physical switch for

23:47.840 --> 23:48.840
the SD card slot.

23:48.840 --> 23:49.840
Oh wow.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.860
Perhaps physically turn it off, I'm not sure.

23:51.860 --> 23:56.120
If I could get this fan replaced, this is a pretty-

23:56.120 --> 23:59.920
The thing I do like about this is it is a damn unique one-off laptop.

23:59.920 --> 24:00.920
Yes it is.

24:00.920 --> 24:01.920
And it is-

24:01.920 --> 24:03.160
It looks pretty special, whatever you are with it.

24:03.160 --> 24:06.120
It's a great showcase for a lot of really good stickers because it's completely unbranded

24:06.120 --> 24:07.120
all over.

24:07.120 --> 24:08.120
It really draws your eye.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.920
There's no Big Mac logo or Dell logo.

24:09.920 --> 24:11.280
No Intel sticker, no nothing.

24:11.280 --> 24:15.560
In fact, the only sticker on the bottom is a UPC barcode, a small one.

24:15.560 --> 24:18.040
And other than that, it is untouched.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.220
It is a metal housing that is untouched.

24:20.220 --> 24:21.560
It feels good in the hand.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.920
It has that MacBook angular slope to it.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.480
Yes it does.

24:25.480 --> 24:30.600
It's got one, two, three, four USB 3.0 ports plus the USB-C port.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.640
That's like four times as many on that MacBook.

24:32.640 --> 24:38.280
HDMI out, and it has headphones out, and it has an SD card slot reader.

24:38.280 --> 24:40.120
I like that.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.120
This could-

24:41.120 --> 24:46.460
My XPS 13 doesn't have an Ethernet port either.

24:46.460 --> 24:49.760
If I can get this fan fixed, this could replace the XPS for me.

24:49.760 --> 24:50.760
But it can't-

24:50.760 --> 24:53.680
I don't know if it can be a production machine without-

24:53.680 --> 24:59.200
The lightning bolt by the Type-C port means it may support Thunderbolt, says North Ranger.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.200
Is that true, North?

25:00.200 --> 25:01.200
Is that really a thing?

25:01.200 --> 25:06.880
A lot of vendors, especially if you have a Broadwell system, are using an Intel add-on

25:06.880 --> 25:15.560
chip in the chipset that provides not only Type-C USB support, but also 40 gig Thunderbolt,

25:15.560 --> 25:17.520
things like external graphics cards.

25:17.520 --> 25:18.520
That would be-

25:18.520 --> 25:19.520
I was about to say that, yeah.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.520
If I could hook up-

25:20.520 --> 25:25.960
See, that would make me feel a lot better if I could hook up a high-end Ethernet adapter

25:25.960 --> 25:28.120
to that USB-C port.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.700
Here's FreeBSA's.

25:30.700 --> 25:32.320
He sent this to me when he got his.

25:32.320 --> 25:36.040
There he was listening to episode 131 of Unplugged, where we're like, where the hell is my laptop?

25:36.040 --> 25:38.800
And there's his purism right there.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.520
What was your out-of-the-box experience like FreeBSD?

25:41.520 --> 25:45.640
Was it the same kind of rattle experience, or did you get some documentation, did you

25:45.640 --> 25:46.640
get a nice-

25:46.640 --> 25:48.760
What was your initial experience like?

25:48.760 --> 25:52.840
Yeah, documentation, nonexistent.

25:52.840 --> 25:56.240
I haven't played with the hardware switches yet to figure out what they turn off, but

25:56.240 --> 25:59.240
it would be nice if there was some information.

25:59.240 --> 26:05.000
I even looked on the hard drive to see if there was documentation in the form of a PDF,

26:05.000 --> 26:06.520
and I don't see anything on there.

26:06.520 --> 26:09.200
All right, so I'm turning it back on.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.200
I'm going to check-

26:10.200 --> 26:11.200
There's proof.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.200
Yeah.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.200
Wimpy wanted to know if-

26:13.200 --> 26:16.480
Now the BIOS, I want to give purism credit here.

26:16.480 --> 26:21.000
The BIOS is like, every setting you could ever want to tweak is available.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
That's cool.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.880
Some OEMs, basically all of them, they really kind of limit down the BIOS, and this one,

26:26.880 --> 26:30.560
you can tweak everything from overclocking to everything.

26:30.560 --> 26:35.320
So that being said, there's so much in here, it actually takes a little while to find stuff.

26:35.320 --> 26:42.000
I'm looking through here right now, and I don't know if I see Bluetooth, chipset, security.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Look at all this stuff, Wes.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
I mean, look at all-

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Wow.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
And all of these have submenus to them too.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.840
Like, there's just a ton of stuff in here.

26:47.840 --> 26:48.840
Yeah.

26:48.840 --> 26:53.120
What specifically are you looking for, Wimpy?

26:53.120 --> 26:58.920
Does it have a Bluetooth device in it?

26:58.920 --> 27:00.800
And the reason I'm asking you to look in the BIOS-

27:00.800 --> 27:01.800
The BIOS?

27:01.800 --> 27:05.440
Well, I believe it's a BIOS, isn't it?

27:05.440 --> 27:06.440
Mm-hmm.

27:06.440 --> 27:07.440
Yeah, it has a BIOS.

27:07.440 --> 27:08.440
Yeah.

27:08.440 --> 27:16.560
Is because I'm not sure if the Bluetooth device that's in the machine is supported by Linux,

27:16.560 --> 27:18.760
so it may not go up.

27:18.760 --> 27:22.880
I could- I don't see anything in the BIOS, but you know what I'll do is I'll boot into

27:22.880 --> 27:29.120
Antegros Arch, which boots- I mean, one thing, by the way, is once Linux is installed, this

27:29.120 --> 27:30.120
thing freaking flies.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.160
Like, it is nice to have a nice modern computer again.

27:32.160 --> 27:33.160
I tell you, it's been a while since I've had it.

27:33.160 --> 27:36.240
It looks like it got that Samsung SSD in there.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.880
And that thing is fast.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.160
So I'll see- I can log in right now, Wimpy.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.160
It just boots that fast.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.160
I just already- I've already booted.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.720
I'm already in GNOME system settings.

27:42.720 --> 27:43.720
So I will take a-

27:43.720 --> 27:44.720
Fucking hell.

27:44.720 --> 27:46.580
It does look like it supports UEFI, right?

27:46.580 --> 27:48.400
It must support- yeah, it does.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.400
Actually, look at that.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.400
It's discovering the Bluetooth devices.

27:50.400 --> 27:53.280
It is discovering the Bluetooth devices around me right now.

27:53.280 --> 27:54.280
So it must have Bluetooth.

27:54.280 --> 27:55.280
Oh, right.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.280
Okay, cool.

27:56.280 --> 27:57.280
That works then.

27:57.280 --> 27:58.280
That's great.

27:58.280 --> 27:59.280
Yeah.

27:59.280 --> 28:00.280
Cool.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.280
Yeah.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.120
That was something that they'd mentioned may not work at some point in the past, so they

28:03.120 --> 28:04.120
must have changed their-

28:04.120 --> 28:06.520
You know, I haven't tried the webcam either.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.720
Let me try the webcam real quick.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.080
Yeah, webcam works.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.080
Hey, look at that.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.080
It's me.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.080
Hey, look, Wes, there's you.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.080
See?

28:15.080 --> 28:16.080
Well, it's me.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.080
Yeah, webcam.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.080
So the webcam works.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.080
That's good.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.080
Frame rate's a little low.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.080
I'm going to keep playing with it.

28:21.080 --> 28:27.320
I think that my next big task is to see if I can alter that fan, and then on top of that,

28:27.320 --> 28:28.920
I'm going to just benchmark the shit out of this thing.

28:28.920 --> 28:29.920
Yeah.

28:29.920 --> 28:32.520
I mean, it's already going to sound super loud, so you might as well, you know, make

28:32.520 --> 28:33.520
it do some work.

28:33.520 --> 28:34.520
Yeah.

28:34.520 --> 28:37.320
Well, it's funny how mentally in the back of my mind, I associate loud laptop with high

28:37.320 --> 28:38.320
CPU usage.

28:38.320 --> 28:42.440
So, like, after I've been working on this thing for about 20 minutes, I was sort of

28:42.440 --> 28:44.920
just, you know, getting into the flow of things.

28:44.920 --> 28:47.480
And I remember thinking- I stopped my work phone and I go, why is my computer working

28:47.480 --> 28:48.480
so hard?

28:48.480 --> 28:49.480
Oh, wait, no, no.

28:49.480 --> 28:50.480
It's fine.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.480
Yeah.

28:51.480 --> 28:54.720
So if anybody knows anything about the fan noise, I would love to hear your-

28:54.720 --> 28:56.480
If you could get that solved, I mean.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.480
Yeah.

28:57.480 --> 28:58.480
Yeah.

28:58.480 --> 28:59.480
But that aside, I'm going to put that aside.

28:59.480 --> 29:03.320
I'm going to keep working with it and see what kind of things I can get done with it.

29:03.320 --> 29:07.140
So just to recap, I paid $1,800 for this thing.

29:07.140 --> 29:09.920
It did ship 286 days late.

29:09.920 --> 29:13.040
It was originally expected to ship on April 2015.

29:13.040 --> 29:16.560
I backed it in November of 2015, I believe.

29:16.560 --> 29:19.640
November 22nd, 2015, I believe, is when I backed it.

29:19.640 --> 29:20.640
I'm sorry, 2014.

29:20.640 --> 29:21.640
2014, right.

29:21.640 --> 29:22.640
Sorry.

29:22.640 --> 29:27.880
I wouldn't necessarily buy it today.

29:27.880 --> 29:32.560
But that said, I think it would be interesting, like, I'm picturing bringing it to conferences

29:32.560 --> 29:33.560
and whatnot.

29:33.560 --> 29:34.560
Yeah.

29:34.560 --> 29:36.600
You would, you know, it might be a pretty good machine, especially if you can just-

29:36.600 --> 29:37.600
Yeah.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.600
A little quieter.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.760
And the feel in the hand is good.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.560
The hinge is good on the laptop screen.

29:43.560 --> 29:45.480
And it's nice to have something that feels like that.

29:45.480 --> 29:46.480
Yes.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.520
Oh, I bought a MacBook and I put Linux on it.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.520
Right.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.520
It's like, this is something totally different.

29:50.520 --> 29:51.520
Yes.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.520
Exactly.

29:52.520 --> 29:53.520
So that's exactly how I'm feeling right now about it.

29:53.520 --> 29:54.520
So this is the Rev 2.0.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.480
One more thing I wanted to show you, which I'm not super happy with.

29:56.480 --> 30:00.120
I'm going to talk more about this on last, and I'll have visuals to show you guys.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.080
It does have a backlit keyboard.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.720
And all of the Fn keys work.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.920
But I want to show you what the backlit keyboard looks like with.

30:05.920 --> 30:07.720
Oh, hold on a second.

30:07.720 --> 30:08.720
It's not working.

30:08.720 --> 30:09.720
Oh, there you go.

30:09.720 --> 30:13.600
So that's the, so the keys are backlit, but the actual letters themselves are not translucent.

30:13.600 --> 30:14.600
No.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.680
There's just, there's light around the keys, but you can't actually see.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.680
It doesn't seem like that would be that bright at night.

30:18.680 --> 30:22.040
It doesn't work because the keys themselves are black objects in the night and there's

30:22.040 --> 30:23.760
just light around them.

30:23.760 --> 30:27.960
The keys have, there's basically an LED light behind the keyboard, but the keys themselves.

30:27.960 --> 30:31.800
So if you were concerned about where the keyboard was, it would help you find that, but not

30:31.800 --> 30:32.800
the individual keys.

30:32.800 --> 30:33.800
Exactly.

30:33.800 --> 30:34.800
That's just a, you know.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.800
Yeah.

30:35.800 --> 30:36.800
They were confused about that.

30:36.800 --> 30:37.800
Exactly.

30:37.800 --> 30:42.320
So if you ever need to find your keyboard, it can, it can do that pretty well, but you

30:42.320 --> 30:46.120
can't find individual keys.

30:46.120 --> 30:53.020
So I guess the, at the end of the day, I would say if I was betting the farm on a laptop

30:53.020 --> 30:59.880
right now and that was my machine, I could make it work, but I would be very disappointed.

30:59.880 --> 31:02.520
How about a little followup on the Librem?

31:02.520 --> 31:03.720
I still have the Librem 15.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.000
I have a lot of thoughts on it.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.600
So let's talk about the Librem and the Apollo.

31:08.600 --> 31:19.360
So I, as you may have been aware, Wes, last week, after 445 days of waiting, I had a chance

31:19.360 --> 31:21.440
to try out the Purism Librem.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.440
Ultimate Linux laptop.

31:22.440 --> 31:26.080
And I don't know if, you know what, to get the timing right on this, so we're going to

31:26.080 --> 31:30.560
go to the horse's mouth directly here just for a moment, but my recollection goes down

31:30.560 --> 31:31.560
like this.

31:31.560 --> 31:36.360
In the time since I bagged the Purism, a company I'd never heard of called Entroware has come

31:36.360 --> 31:41.720
around and they started shipping laptops preloaded, by the way, with Ubuntu Mate and they have

31:41.720 --> 31:43.480
a couple of different products out there.

31:43.480 --> 31:47.840
We'll talk more about that in a sec, but the one that I want to talk about today is Entroware's

31:47.840 --> 31:51.160
Apollo laptop.

31:51.160 --> 31:56.080
I think it starts at base price around 700 US greenbacks, somewhere around there, depending

31:56.080 --> 31:57.680
on the conversion rate.

31:57.680 --> 32:03.880
It is a 13-inch laptop and I have it here in my hands and they sent me a version of

32:03.880 --> 32:09.360
the Apollo, pretty well-specced, to see how it stacks up to the Librem 15 and others in

32:09.360 --> 32:12.400
terms of build quality, performance, and all of that.

32:12.400 --> 32:18.320
So I have it here, have had it for about 24 hours, and before we go any further, I want

32:18.320 --> 32:20.360
to introduce Mike from Entroware.

32:20.360 --> 32:23.840
Mike, welcome to Linux Unplugged and tell the folks listening what you do over there

32:23.840 --> 32:24.840
at Entroware.

32:24.840 --> 32:25.840
What is that title of yours?

32:25.840 --> 32:33.000
Hi, I'm the co-founder of Entroware and we build Linux computers for the UK at the moment

32:33.000 --> 32:36.400
and soon some with Europe.

32:36.400 --> 32:45.720
And the Apollo arrived on my doorstep yesterday and it is a 13-inch laptop, very similar in

32:45.720 --> 32:53.760
sort of a look to say a MacBook Air or really the Apollo 15 only, or I'm sorry, the Librem

32:53.760 --> 32:58.440
15 only 13 inches, very, very, very good build quality.

32:58.440 --> 33:03.720
And so Mike, I'm just curious, I don't actually think, are you selling these in the U.S. at

33:03.720 --> 33:04.720
the moment?

33:04.720 --> 33:08.560
No, we're not selling them in the U.S. for a while.

33:08.560 --> 33:11.920
The reason why yours has got a U.S. keyboard layout is because we're going to be shipping

33:11.920 --> 33:15.960
them to some EU countries because they also use that layout.

33:15.960 --> 33:16.960
Oh, I got you.

33:16.960 --> 33:17.960
I see.

33:17.960 --> 33:18.960
I got you.

33:18.960 --> 33:22.100
So a little bit about the Apollo, if you would, can you give me some background on how this

33:22.100 --> 33:27.120
computer came to be and any kind of interesting details about the Apollo?

33:27.120 --> 33:35.000
Yeah, we started selling Windows computers about a year and a half ago, maybe two.

33:35.000 --> 33:43.040
We got a lot of requests for an Ultrabook and we just found an ODM in China where we

33:43.040 --> 33:48.800
could have them built and shipped over.

33:48.800 --> 33:52.640
You make it sound so simple, but what I find to be remarkable about it, and this is something

33:52.640 --> 33:59.680
that every single person that I have put this in their hands has said, is it feels really,

33:59.680 --> 34:02.800
really sturdy, really well built.

34:02.800 --> 34:06.200
And people often tell me it feels a little heavy, which I think adds to that it feels

34:06.200 --> 34:07.880
well built.

34:07.880 --> 34:13.820
And so I'm curious, was it a matter of finding the right builder?

34:13.820 --> 34:17.560
What is it that Entraware has been able to accomplish here when it comes to build quality

34:17.560 --> 34:30.540
that other vendors sort of in the space maybe haven't gotten to?

34:30.540 --> 34:32.840
Is it just happened to be the partner builds a good machine?

34:32.840 --> 34:36.800
Because I mean, it seems, feel wise, it's pretty significantly well built.

34:36.800 --> 34:43.040
Yeah, so we approached a few people and these are one of the few that did solid aluminum

34:43.040 --> 34:48.880
chassis so we chose them obviously because they have just bad build quality.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.840
And then the keyboard also, I don't know what the processors have selected in the keyboard,

34:52.840 --> 34:56.580
but versus some of the others, the keyboard is pretty nice too.

34:56.580 --> 35:01.400
And feels good in the hand, the keys are actually translucent so the backlighting shines through,

35:01.400 --> 35:02.400
which is nice.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.640
And the fan isn't running crazy loud.

35:05.640 --> 35:10.840
The fan actually seems to properly cool the machine, which was a nice surprise when I

35:10.840 --> 35:12.680
took it out of the box.

35:12.680 --> 35:16.200
Is there any particular tricks you guys had to pull to make this thing work properly with

35:16.200 --> 35:17.200
Linux?

35:17.200 --> 35:18.200
Or was it all pretty easy?

35:18.200 --> 35:23.400
Well, at first, the first revision we had, there was a few problems with the fan, but

35:23.400 --> 35:27.440
we had the mind out in the firmware, so that's now gone.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.400
Yeah, I would agree.

35:29.400 --> 35:32.520
So there was definitely some problems with the fan if you ran into the same problems

35:32.520 --> 35:33.520
I did.

35:33.520 --> 35:37.920
So if I wipe the OS that this came loaded with, will the fan still work fine or will

35:37.920 --> 35:38.920
it stop working normally?

35:38.920 --> 35:41.780
No, it works exactly the same as what it's doing now.

35:41.780 --> 35:42.880
So it's firmware level then.

35:42.880 --> 35:43.880
It's totally hardware level.

35:43.880 --> 35:44.880
Well, that's awesome.

35:44.880 --> 35:45.880
That's great.

35:45.880 --> 35:46.880
I got it.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.760
So my first impressions of this are this is one of the most well-built laptops I've ever

35:49.760 --> 35:50.760
held.

35:50.760 --> 35:51.760
Would you agree with me?

35:51.760 --> 35:52.760
Oh, yeah.

35:52.760 --> 35:53.760
I really want one now.

35:53.760 --> 35:54.760
Yeah.

35:54.760 --> 36:00.480
So it's got one, two USB 3.0 ports plus USB-C. It's got an SD card slot reader, full-size

36:00.480 --> 36:04.000
HDMI out, and a headphone jack.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.920
Entraware was kind enough to include a USB ethernet adapter in the box too because there's

36:07.920 --> 36:09.680
no USB ethernet on this.

36:09.680 --> 36:15.840
It's got a 13-inch screen, 1080p resolution on it, two hard drives, a 500-gigabyte spinning

36:15.840 --> 36:19.800
for the home and a 120-gigabyte SSD for the root.

36:19.800 --> 36:23.600
Yeah, two hard drives in a 13-inch laptop too.

36:23.600 --> 36:31.880
Mike, that's a pretty impressive spec, Skylake Intel processor, and it's silent.

36:31.880 --> 36:33.920
I haven't heard it sound since I've been here.

36:33.920 --> 36:34.920
Yeah.

36:34.920 --> 36:37.080
That's a pretty impressive piece of hardware.

36:37.080 --> 36:40.880
Are the Apollo cells meeting your expectations?

36:40.880 --> 36:46.040
Yeah, they keep growing as we get more publicity on them because they are really good for the

36:46.040 --> 36:47.040
price.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.040
Yeah.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.040
Base $700.

36:49.040 --> 36:52.840
Now, the base $700 I think has like an i3 and 4 gigs of RAM, but you just bring it up

36:52.840 --> 36:53.840
from there.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.180
Yeah, that's right.

36:56.180 --> 37:00.240
And then, Mike, could you talk a little bit about the choice to work with Ubuntu Mate?

37:00.240 --> 37:02.080
What drove that and how's that going?

37:02.080 --> 37:09.000
Well, I was approached by Martin about a year ago, and we just had a back-and-to when I

37:09.000 --> 37:15.200
was a big fan of the project, so it was obviously a good move to start shipping them on machines.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.240
Yeah, it feels fast.

37:17.240 --> 37:18.560
It's my first experience with it.

37:18.560 --> 37:22.920
When you get a machine with a nice, fast Skylake processor and plenty of RAM, and then you

37:22.920 --> 37:29.120
throw the Mate desktop on there with the Ubuntu base, it feels really snappy.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.120
Just ready to go.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.120
Yeah.

37:31.120 --> 37:33.600
We don't have numbers yet, but the battery life has been pretty good, and I think part

37:33.600 --> 37:37.040
of that is because the desktop environment just isn't really very demanding.

37:37.040 --> 37:42.080
So you feel like you get a nice performing computer with a very reasonable modern desktop.

37:42.080 --> 37:45.760
Plus, you get someone like Introware here, where they're a company, right?

37:45.760 --> 37:49.440
So if you have problems longer term, you know they're going to be around to support them

37:49.440 --> 37:50.440
and to fix them.

37:50.440 --> 37:57.120
So the number one question, Mike, that everybody in the chat room has is, how likely and possible

37:57.120 --> 37:59.800
is it for Introware to eventually start selling in the US?

37:59.800 --> 38:02.640
Is that a possibility for you guys, or is that just a lot of trouble?

38:02.640 --> 38:09.160
It is a possibility, but we're going to wait for a few more, a larger amount of orders

38:09.160 --> 38:10.640
before we start shipping over there.

38:10.640 --> 38:14.280
We're going to make sure all of the use is sorted first.

38:14.280 --> 38:15.280
Yeah.

38:15.280 --> 38:16.280
You get it nailed there.

38:16.280 --> 38:17.280
That makes a lot of sense.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.280
We'll have to work on a JB group order.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.280
Yeah.

38:19.280 --> 38:20.280
There you go.

38:20.280 --> 38:21.280
Yeah, a group order.

38:21.280 --> 38:22.280
This thing is...

38:22.280 --> 38:25.160
Boy, I can't wait to just keep trying it over the week.

38:25.160 --> 38:27.720
This is going to be my main machine for the week.

38:27.720 --> 38:30.720
It seems like a great little just getting stuff done laptop.

38:30.720 --> 38:31.720
Yeah.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.440
I'm really looking forward to putting it through its paces.

38:33.440 --> 38:38.840
So far, it sounds like it's silent, and silent is a big deal for me.

38:38.840 --> 38:41.320
So I'm really happy about that.

38:41.320 --> 38:46.440
One thing I may be continuing to troubleshoot, and I don't know if it's just the Wi-Fi here

38:46.440 --> 38:51.280
or what, but I've had a couple of Wi-Fi issues where either the transfer rate has been real

38:51.280 --> 38:55.760
bad, like I'm talking like I'm getting 2,000 millisecond pings, or it just won't find the

38:55.760 --> 38:56.760
network.

38:56.760 --> 39:00.680
So in both cases, it actually could be interference.

39:00.680 --> 39:04.840
So I'm going to take it out to a known good location where I only have one Wi-Fi access

39:04.840 --> 39:06.160
point.

39:06.160 --> 39:11.960
There's no other Wi-Fi access points around, or access eyes, and see if I have any issues.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.960
But so far, other than that.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.480
And then with the Ethernet adapter, of course, I've had zero problems.

39:16.480 --> 39:19.400
And Ubuntu Mate has been pretty great too.

39:19.400 --> 39:22.040
I really like the design.

39:22.040 --> 39:25.840
Because it's a little bit smaller than the Librem, it feels a little tighter.

39:25.840 --> 39:28.840
There's a notch where you put your finger that kind of is reminiscent of the way the

39:28.840 --> 39:30.760
MacBooks do it.

39:30.760 --> 39:31.760
Which looks nice.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.480
It really all comes together.

39:34.480 --> 39:38.760
It's got a bottom plate that could be removed with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

39:38.760 --> 39:40.560
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 screws.

39:40.560 --> 39:44.320
So you remove 12 little Philips screws, and it looks like the bottom plate would come

39:44.320 --> 39:45.320
off.

39:45.320 --> 39:46.320
It seems like such a good laptop.

39:46.320 --> 39:49.080
Like you show up at a conference, and it's just a little different.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.960
And you've got it running Linux, and it works well.

39:51.960 --> 39:52.960
Yeah.

39:52.960 --> 39:53.960
Yeah.

39:53.960 --> 39:54.960
I really like it.

39:54.960 --> 40:02.240
I'm happy that the keys are actually, the letters are translucent, so the backlit key

40:02.240 --> 40:04.360
light actually shines through the keys, which is nice.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.360
Because otherwise it's kind of pointless to have the backlighting.

40:06.360 --> 40:10.360
Mike, is there anything else you want to add about the Apollo before we move on?

40:10.360 --> 40:12.160
No, that's it.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.160
Very good, sir.

40:13.160 --> 40:17.400
And Wimpy, was there anything you wanted to add?

40:17.400 --> 40:18.400
Any thoughts?

40:18.400 --> 40:19.400
There's something I'd like to add.

40:19.400 --> 40:20.400
Yeah.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.400
Yeah.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.080
Mike's being far too modest.

40:23.080 --> 40:27.880
Mike has a relationship with a company that you'd be very interested in hearing about,

40:27.880 --> 40:28.880
I think.

40:28.880 --> 40:29.880
Tell me more.

40:29.880 --> 40:30.880
They're our Valve partners.

40:30.880 --> 40:31.880
Valve?

40:31.880 --> 40:32.880
Okay, Mike.

40:32.880 --> 40:37.440
Are you bearing the lead here?

40:37.440 --> 40:38.440
Hold on.

40:38.440 --> 40:39.440
We have ourselves a little Valve story.

40:39.440 --> 40:40.440
I've got to hear it.

40:40.440 --> 40:41.440
Tell me about it.

40:41.440 --> 40:42.440
Yeah.

40:42.440 --> 40:46.200
So we're official Valve partners, so we're going to be building a Steam machine and shipping

40:46.200 --> 40:48.720
them out in a few months.

40:48.720 --> 40:51.240
Very cool.

40:51.240 --> 40:52.960
Have you already begun testing?

40:52.960 --> 40:53.960
Come on now.

40:53.960 --> 40:54.960
Are you a gamer, Mike?

40:54.960 --> 40:55.960
Yeah.

40:55.960 --> 40:56.960
Cool.

40:56.960 --> 41:05.920
We had one prototype at our camp this year for people to use, and it got a good reaction.

41:05.920 --> 41:11.840
So Mike, I've got to say, I don't know a lot about Entraware.

41:11.840 --> 41:16.200
My initial impressions are, you guys are very clever.

41:16.200 --> 41:21.560
So it struck me just in the name of this device.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.080
It's a pretty great device.

41:23.080 --> 41:28.480
And you went with the name Apollo, which, when I say Apollo, Wes, what's the next thing

41:28.480 --> 41:29.480
you think of?

41:29.480 --> 41:30.480
Fast.

41:30.480 --> 41:31.480
Oh, you do?

41:31.480 --> 41:32.480
Well, I don't know.

41:32.480 --> 41:33.480
I think 13.

41:33.480 --> 41:34.480
I think Apollo 13.

41:34.480 --> 41:35.480
Oh, 13.

41:35.480 --> 41:36.480
Right.

41:36.480 --> 41:37.480
And what is this?

41:37.480 --> 41:38.480
It's a 13-inch Mac.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.480
It's a 13-inch laptop.

41:39.480 --> 41:40.480
It's brilliant.

41:40.480 --> 41:43.560
I mean, it shows you a little bit of the...

41:43.560 --> 41:48.320
To me, I think it sort of demonstrates a little bit of the thought that goes into it.

41:48.320 --> 41:54.080
It's an Apollo 13, but of course, the product name is just Apollo because the 13 just sort

41:54.080 --> 41:55.080
of comes naturally.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.080
It's part of it.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.080
And it makes you think, what laptop did Chris get?

41:57.080 --> 41:58.080
He got that Apollo.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.080
And how big was it?

41:59.080 --> 42:00.080
Oh, yeah.

42:00.080 --> 42:01.080
It was 13 inches, Apollo 13.

42:01.080 --> 42:02.080
That's clever.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.080
Yeah.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.080
And the 15 should be called Creed.

42:04.080 --> 42:05.080
No.

42:05.080 --> 42:06.080
No.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.840
Nothing ever gets called Creed.

42:07.840 --> 42:08.840
That has been banned.

42:08.840 --> 42:09.840
But yeah.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.640
So I think it's pretty good.

42:11.640 --> 42:14.560
Kitson, you had something you wanted to add to...

42:14.560 --> 42:16.600
Go ahead, sir.

42:16.600 --> 42:23.160
When you said Apollo, I actually thought art and illumination like the Roman slash Greek

42:23.160 --> 42:24.160
God.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.160
Yeah.

42:25.160 --> 42:26.160
Yeah.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.160
Okay.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.160
All right.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.160
Okay.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.160
Fine.

42:30.160 --> 42:31.160
Not everybody thinks Apollo 13.

42:31.160 --> 42:32.160
But it does have proper backlit keys.

42:32.160 --> 42:33.160
So illumination is accurate.

42:33.160 --> 42:34.160
Yes.

42:34.160 --> 42:35.160
All right.

42:35.160 --> 42:36.160
Okay.

42:36.160 --> 42:37.160
Fine.

42:37.160 --> 42:38.160
Fine.

42:38.160 --> 42:39.160
All those are good.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.160
See, it's a clever name.

42:40.160 --> 42:41.160
Nonetheless, it is a clever name.

42:41.160 --> 42:42.160
So I have a...

42:42.160 --> 42:43.160
If you're listening to the audio version and you're curious, what the hell does this thing

42:43.160 --> 42:44.160
look like?

42:44.160 --> 42:45.160
And probably a lot of you are listening to the audio version.

42:45.160 --> 42:50.240
But in the show notes, I have a link to an album I took up at my campsite.

42:50.240 --> 42:52.560
And I posted pictures of it because I was like, hey, you know what?

42:52.560 --> 42:54.760
You know what makes a good background for photos?

42:54.760 --> 42:55.760
The freaking Pacific Northwest.

42:55.760 --> 42:56.760
Yes, it does.

42:56.760 --> 42:57.820
It's a pretty good looking state.

42:57.820 --> 42:58.880
So Washington is.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.760
So I put that up there.

43:00.760 --> 43:03.400
And yes, it does have an Ubuntu button.

43:03.400 --> 43:05.400
Actually, it's a Matei button.

43:05.400 --> 43:06.400
So that's pretty cool.

43:06.400 --> 43:07.400
Yeah.

43:07.400 --> 43:08.400
I like seeing you can customize that right on the website.

43:08.400 --> 43:09.400
That's great.

43:09.400 --> 43:10.400
Yeah.

43:10.400 --> 43:11.400
Yeah.

43:11.400 --> 43:12.400
And it's a sticker, but it's a translucent sticker.

43:12.400 --> 43:15.760
So it doesn't block the light, which makes it...

43:15.760 --> 43:17.240
Look at that attention to detail.

43:17.240 --> 43:18.240
Yeah, it is.

43:18.240 --> 43:20.920
It's very well done.

43:20.920 --> 43:26.160
So right now I'm running Ubuntu Matei 15.10 or Mate or whatever edition on there.

43:26.160 --> 43:29.920
I may stick with that.

43:29.920 --> 43:36.540
I don't know what exactly it is, but this particular hardware has made me also want

43:36.540 --> 43:40.240
to just see what it would be like to have elementary OS on it, just to kind of go all

43:40.240 --> 43:41.240
the way.

43:41.240 --> 43:45.400
I don't know though, because the thing is, is right now for testing, Ubuntu makes such

43:45.400 --> 43:50.240
a great low-key desktop environment that it's like you just get all of the machine's performance

43:50.240 --> 43:51.240
out of it.

43:51.240 --> 43:52.240
So I just don't know about it.

43:52.240 --> 43:53.560
Wimpy, you had one more comment.

43:53.560 --> 43:54.560
Go ahead.

43:54.560 --> 43:55.560
Yeah.

43:55.560 --> 44:00.880
The version of Ubuntu Matei that you're running there is actually sort of Ubuntu Matei 15.12.

44:00.880 --> 44:01.880
Really?

44:01.880 --> 44:02.880
Oh.

44:02.880 --> 44:03.880
Yeah.

44:03.880 --> 44:04.880
Yeah.

44:04.880 --> 44:07.660
So what you've got there is Ubuntu Matei 15.10.

44:07.660 --> 44:14.560
And then I worked with Mike to get the Matei 1.12 desktop on there, rather than Matei 1.10.

44:14.560 --> 44:23.360
And the reason I did that is because in Matei 1.12, we introduced in the control panels

44:23.360 --> 44:27.000
two-finger, three-finger touch configuration.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Yes.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.040
And I do really appreciate that.

44:30.040 --> 44:31.040
Yeah.

44:31.040 --> 44:34.440
So that's why we've just given you a slightly custom version.

44:34.440 --> 44:40.520
But so if I reloaded the OS, I might not get the trackpad configuration stuff?

44:40.520 --> 44:41.520
No.

44:41.520 --> 44:48.120
The trackpad works on all OSes, but Matei didn't have two- and three-finger touch options

44:48.120 --> 44:49.800
until just recently.

44:49.800 --> 44:54.440
That is actually exceptionally nice, because so it is a good-sized trackpad.

44:54.440 --> 45:01.000
And when you go into the mouse settings in Matei, you can say two fingers down is a right

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
click, or in the corner is a right click.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.800
I want to scroll by touching the right side of the trackpad, I want to scroll by using

45:05.800 --> 45:06.800
two fingers.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.560
Like all of that is available for you.

45:08.560 --> 45:09.560
Wow.

45:09.560 --> 45:10.560
Yeah.

45:10.560 --> 45:11.560
Really nice.

45:11.560 --> 45:12.560
So that's good to know.

45:12.560 --> 45:13.560
Yeah, I think I might stick with it.

45:13.560 --> 45:16.600
I just, I really have very little reason to replace it once I have it all set up.

45:16.600 --> 45:17.920
It really works super good.

45:17.920 --> 45:19.960
The only thing I might want to replace it with-

45:19.960 --> 45:20.960
Sorry.

45:20.960 --> 45:25.080
I was going to say, you'll be fine when you go with Antergos as well, because I know Mike

45:25.080 --> 45:26.080
runs Arch.

45:26.080 --> 45:27.080
Oh, really?

45:27.080 --> 45:28.080
Oh, okay.

45:28.080 --> 45:29.080
Cool.

45:29.080 --> 45:33.920
Yeah, and I was also thinking, all the other thing I might do is I might do the 16.04 version

45:33.920 --> 45:34.920
of Ubuntu Matei.

45:34.920 --> 45:35.920
Yeah.

45:35.920 --> 45:36.920
Yeah, and just do that.

45:36.920 --> 45:40.680
And that would likely still have the configuration options, right, for my trackpad?

45:40.680 --> 45:42.920
Yeah, that's all built into 16.04.

45:42.920 --> 45:43.920
Boom.

45:43.920 --> 45:44.920
Boom.

45:44.920 --> 45:46.040
I loves it.

45:46.040 --> 45:49.720
I have not done the distro balance the chatroom was asking, so yeah, there they go.

45:49.720 --> 45:52.240
But I might by the time LAS comes around.

45:52.240 --> 45:55.740
I think if all goes as planned, this will be my review for LAS, and we'll compare it

45:55.740 --> 45:56.740
to the two.

45:56.740 --> 45:58.400
I might try to do some performance stuff.

45:58.400 --> 45:59.400
Yeah, you should.

45:59.400 --> 46:04.720
So if anybody has any questions, or even better yet, suggestions of ways to benchmark a system

46:04.720 --> 46:11.160
like this that actually produce information that we care about, and that is relevant,

46:11.160 --> 46:16.140
I would love to know that, linuxactual.reddit.com, you could link the benchmarks there, or something

46:16.140 --> 46:17.140
like that.

46:17.140 --> 46:22.560
Oh, okay, so Wimpy, I will absolutely have to have Loki if I want to try it on this machine.

46:22.560 --> 46:23.560
Why is that?

46:23.560 --> 46:24.560
Yeah.

46:24.560 --> 46:25.560
For elementary.

46:25.560 --> 46:30.400
Elementary is based on 14.04, which doesn't have Skylake support.

46:30.400 --> 46:31.400
Right.

46:31.400 --> 46:32.400
Right.

46:32.400 --> 46:33.400
And Loki is based on 16.04.

46:33.400 --> 46:34.400
Yeah.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.400
Okay.

46:35.400 --> 46:36.400
All right.

46:36.400 --> 46:37.400
Well, I'll see.

46:37.400 --> 46:38.400
You need 15.10 or better.

46:38.400 --> 46:40.760
See, somebody's got to make me a Loki eye, so just watch.

46:40.760 --> 46:44.660
Because it looks like, it looks like if you, here's my thinking, right?

46:44.660 --> 46:48.640
You put that on here, and then you go to like a mall or somewhere, you say, look at the

46:48.640 --> 46:49.640
new MacBook, what do you think?

46:49.640 --> 46:50.640
Let's see what they say.

46:50.640 --> 46:53.720
Should we enter prankster, Chris?

46:53.720 --> 46:58.960
You know, before we walk away and say, oh, it's a big MacBook ripoff, I want to actually

46:58.960 --> 47:00.600
make sure I'm clear.

47:00.600 --> 47:03.680
When I look at it, I actually don't get the impression that it's trying to rip off from

47:03.680 --> 47:04.680
the MacBook.

47:04.680 --> 47:08.920
What I get the impression of is aluminum makes pretty good material for this.

47:08.920 --> 47:09.920
Exactly.

47:09.920 --> 47:12.640
And when you make a 13-inch machine, there's only so much room.

47:12.640 --> 47:16.960
I actually, in some ways, I would say there's potential the keyboard may be better than

47:16.960 --> 47:17.960
the MacBook keyboard.

47:17.960 --> 47:20.680
I'm going to type some more and tell you the truth if that's... I don't know about the

47:20.680 --> 47:23.200
trackpad, but the keyboard I think might be better.

47:23.200 --> 47:29.960
And this thing with one, two, three USB ports, I think outclasses the MacBook in terms of

47:29.960 --> 47:36.080
connectivity, plus a dedicated HDMI out port and an SD card slot reader.

47:36.080 --> 47:40.640
This thing might outclass the MacBook in connectivity, but I'm not sure about that.

47:40.640 --> 47:44.920
And so I don't actually... I think it's selling it short to say, oh, it's copying the MacBook.

47:44.920 --> 47:48.160
I think what it is, it's taking design cues from a good design.

47:48.160 --> 47:54.000
And it also, I think, is its own product, very much its own product.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.120
And I like it a lot.

47:56.120 --> 47:57.680
That's my first impression.

47:57.680 --> 48:00.840
If you want to check out some pictures, go to the show notes.

48:00.840 --> 48:03.840
And if you've got ideas on things you want me to do to test it, let me know.

48:03.840 --> 48:07.800
So Skylake has got Intel graphics, so we'll see what happens.

48:07.800 --> 48:09.280
We got two drives in there.

48:09.280 --> 48:13.080
Those are some significant pieces of hardware for this year, and it's interesting to look

48:13.080 --> 48:15.680
back at those reviews now.

48:15.680 --> 48:19.080
Next we're going to talk about another piece of hardware that was way more important for

48:19.080 --> 48:20.320
everyone else out there.

48:20.320 --> 48:24.240
I actually got one myself, but first I want to thank DigitalOcean for sponsoring this

48:24.240 --> 48:25.920
episode of the Unplugged program.

48:25.920 --> 48:28.840

48:28.840 --> 48:31.040
You just apply it, and you get a $10 credit.

48:31.040 --> 48:35.240
Now that's awesome, because you can run serious workhorses for like three cents an hour, or

48:35.240 --> 48:37.720
just run a machine for $5 a month.

48:37.720 --> 48:40.800
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

48:40.800 --> 48:46.280
easy way for you to spin up an awesome Linux rig when you want it on their infrastructure,

48:46.280 --> 48:52.560
which is all backed by SSDs, KVM for the virtualizer, Linux for the host system, 40 gigabit E connections

48:52.560 --> 48:53.840
into the hypervisor.

48:53.840 --> 48:58.520
I'm talking this is a serious infrastructure wrapped up with the industry's best interface

48:58.520 --> 49:00.300
and most straightforward API.

49:00.300 --> 49:01.480
It's unbelievable the pricing.

49:01.480 --> 49:06.180
They have data centers all over the world, entire Linux systems, or just the base system,

49:06.180 --> 49:09.300
and with Fedora 25 too, DigitalOcean.com.

49:09.300 --> 49:13.880

49:14.880 --> 49:18.840
DigitalOcean.com, DOUNPLUGGED, and thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged

49:18.840 --> 49:22.280
program for all of 2016.

49:22.280 --> 49:24.720
DOUNPLUGGED, one word.

49:24.720 --> 49:31.200
The Raspberry Pi 3, wow, what an interesting device, and I ended up getting one pretty

49:31.200 --> 49:34.000
quickly to try out a few different projects on it.

49:34.000 --> 49:44.520
Okay, so the Raspberry Pi 3 has landed, wait, what, oops, sorry, I think I just dropped

49:44.520 --> 49:45.520
it down the toilet.

49:45.520 --> 49:46.520
Hold on.

49:46.520 --> 49:47.520
It's so small.

49:47.520 --> 49:53.720
It is going to be 35 US bones, has a 64-bit CPU, is my understanding, but it ships with

49:53.720 --> 50:02.120
a 32-bit version of the OS, two USB ports on that thing right there, go ahead, go ahead,

50:02.120 --> 50:03.120
jump in any time.

50:03.120 --> 50:09.280
Oh, by the way, Wi-Fi like we've had before, and four USB ports, if I'm correct.

50:09.280 --> 50:10.280
Yeah.

50:10.280 --> 50:13.440
So, Whitby, can you say how long have you had this?

50:13.440 --> 50:16.600
A little bit, right?

50:16.600 --> 50:18.280
Since Friday last week.

50:18.280 --> 50:19.880
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

50:19.880 --> 50:24.600
So you've obviously been working on this thing, trying to get Ubuntu Mate desktop, working

50:24.600 --> 50:25.600
on it.

50:25.600 --> 50:30.480
What were your initial impressions of the hardware when you sat down to work with it?

50:30.480 --> 50:34.200
It looks, well, it is the same form factor as the Raspberry Pi 2 and the Raspberry Pi

50:34.200 --> 50:36.200
B+.

50:36.200 --> 50:42.200
So the number of ports and its size and its arrangement is almost identical.

50:42.200 --> 50:46.800
There's one minor change, and that's the location of the LED lights.

50:46.800 --> 50:51.720
But other than that, it looks like a Raspberry Pi.

50:51.720 --> 50:58.560
I hooked it up, tried to boot my existing image for Ubuntu Mate, and got a very colorful

50:58.560 --> 51:03.960
rainbow screen, which basically meant do not pass go.

51:03.960 --> 51:07.080
So yeah, then started work on making it work.

51:07.080 --> 51:15.280
Once I got it working, it's obvious where the performance improvements come from with

51:15.280 --> 51:16.280
this device.

51:16.280 --> 51:17.280
Oh, really?

51:17.280 --> 51:22.320
Yeah, across the board, and in some unexpected places as well.

51:22.320 --> 51:30.560
So it's got a new SOC, so it's a Broadcom 2837, called 1.2 gigahertz.

51:30.560 --> 51:35.720
It's an ARM V8 Cortex A53.

51:35.720 --> 51:41.360
It's clocked at 1.2 gigahertz, which is up from 900 megahertz as the stock clock on the

51:41.360 --> 51:44.520
Pi 2.

51:44.520 --> 51:52.040
And by and large, more or less, just about everything is about 50% quicker on the Pi

51:52.040 --> 51:56.140
3 compared to the Pi 2.

51:56.140 --> 52:00.760
So you see that in everything in terms of the responsiveness of the applications.

52:00.760 --> 52:05.720
But where you really notice it is it really starts to close the gap in terms of things

52:05.720 --> 52:12.220
like if you've got a web browser open and you're scrolling the web pages, that's much

52:12.220 --> 52:16.000
more fluid now, much more fluid.

52:16.000 --> 52:21.880
And so you've mentioned that there's Bluetooth and there's Wi-Fi now.

52:21.880 --> 52:25.960
So they're integrated on the SOC.

52:25.960 --> 52:35.880
They're using Broadcom 4343 something chip.

52:35.880 --> 52:40.680
And the interesting thing here is that in the past, one of the criticisms of the Raspberry

52:40.680 --> 52:49.840
Pi was that the SD host controller and the Ethernet were on the same USB bus.

52:49.840 --> 52:58.320
So if you were doing a file copy over Ethernet, the performance could really take a dive.

52:58.320 --> 53:07.080
The Wi-Fi is implemented on the SOC and on its own MMC controller and not on the USB

53:07.080 --> 53:08.080
bus.

53:08.080 --> 53:10.320
Now, I haven't tested this yet.

53:10.320 --> 53:12.840
This is what I want to test.

53:12.840 --> 53:20.080
But my working hypothesis is it should move data around quicker over Wi-Fi than it can

53:20.080 --> 53:21.080
over Ethernet.

53:21.080 --> 53:22.080
Hmm.

53:22.080 --> 53:26.800
It's a good excuse not to bother trying to find an Ethernet plug for it.

53:26.800 --> 53:27.800
That would be pretty cool.

53:27.800 --> 53:30.360
That would be that would be pretty damn impressive.

53:30.360 --> 53:33.960
OK, so the hardware impressions, I mean, a 50 percent improvement across the board.

53:33.960 --> 53:34.960
That is damn.

53:34.960 --> 53:35.960
Same form factor.

53:35.960 --> 53:36.960
That is damn impressive.

53:36.960 --> 53:37.960
I like that a lot.

53:37.960 --> 53:41.680
And I'm kind of curious to see how that might actually play out with multitasking and things

53:41.680 --> 53:42.680
like that.

53:42.680 --> 53:46.280
How did that translate, Wimpy, for you when getting whatever you needed to do to make

53:46.280 --> 53:49.880
Ubuntu Mate work on the Raspberry Pi 3?

53:49.880 --> 53:51.040
Because two things jump out at me.

53:51.040 --> 53:55.640
Number one is you kind of had to go back and retrofit the released version of Ubuntu Mate

53:55.640 --> 53:56.720
to make it work, right?

53:56.720 --> 53:59.880
Because you couldn't just say, well, go if you want to make it work, go use 16.04.

53:59.880 --> 54:00.880
Or did you?

54:00.880 --> 54:08.480
No, I because there wasn't much time to do this, I went with the build system I had for

54:08.480 --> 54:16.040
16.10 because aside from the new feature enablement, I knew the rest of the thing worked.

54:16.040 --> 54:18.440
So you know, minimize things.

54:18.440 --> 54:23.680
That said, I still only got about six hours sleep between Friday and Sunday working on

54:23.680 --> 54:25.720
this.

54:25.720 --> 54:26.720
Last down the wire.

54:26.720 --> 54:27.720
Yeah.

54:27.720 --> 54:28.720
Yeah.

54:28.720 --> 54:30.900
But to your credit, you got it right out on release day.

54:30.900 --> 54:31.900
So that looked pretty good.

54:31.900 --> 54:32.900
And that's impressive.

54:32.900 --> 54:33.900
Yeah.

54:33.900 --> 54:34.900
Yeah.

54:34.900 --> 54:35.900
It needs some work.

54:35.900 --> 54:40.920
And despite the assistance I got from the Raspberry Pi Foundation over the weekend,

54:40.920 --> 54:46.440
so they had some engineering assistance, mostly from Phil Elwell, who has just been brilliant.

54:46.440 --> 54:52.960
I haven't got the Bluetooth working in on the Raspberry Pi 3 for Ubuntu Mate yet.

54:52.960 --> 54:56.880
But I'm yet to hear and maybe over the next couple of days, we'll start to hear.

54:56.880 --> 55:00.820
I haven't heard if anyone's got Bluetooth working at all yet.

55:00.820 --> 55:06.040
It's a bit complicated to get going, and I was sort of groping around in the dark a little

55:06.040 --> 55:12.640
bit because I was sort of being drip fed, oh, you need this binary blob and this still

55:12.640 --> 55:13.640
doesn't go.

55:13.640 --> 55:19.360
And then, oh, no, you need this blob as well, which patches that other blob.

55:19.360 --> 55:20.940
You need these patches for this.

55:20.940 --> 55:25.220
So it was all good because I got all the information, but I just couldn't quite get the thing to

55:25.220 --> 55:26.800
enable the Bluetooth.

55:26.800 --> 55:33.440
So I've decided just to sit back for a few days and see what happens with the official

55:33.440 --> 55:34.440
images.

55:34.440 --> 55:35.780
Yeah, so I'm going to start taking a look at the new images.

55:35.780 --> 55:42.120
So today, this evening, I downloaded all of the new packages that have gone into the Raspberry

55:42.120 --> 55:46.600
and Archive to do with Bluetooth and firmware, and I'm sort of picking through those to see

55:46.600 --> 55:51.120
if there's anything different that I may have missed or overlooked.

55:51.120 --> 55:55.320
So Bluetooth will come in due course, and it will be delivered via an update, I should

55:55.320 --> 55:56.320
think.

55:56.320 --> 55:57.320
Very good.

55:57.320 --> 55:58.320
Okay.

55:58.320 --> 56:05.400
Now, there is another thing about the Raspberry Pi, the Raspberry Pi 3 that I think is probably

56:05.400 --> 56:06.480
more important.

56:06.480 --> 56:10.040
I think the Raspberry Pi 3 itself is the hors d'oeuvre.

56:10.040 --> 56:12.640
This is not the main event.

56:12.640 --> 56:22.160
So in the Pi 3, the video core, the graphics processor, has been upclocked.

56:22.160 --> 56:29.400
So the video core was running at 250 megahertz, it now runs at 400, and the 3D graphics processor

56:29.400 --> 56:33.080
was running at 250 and now runs at 300.

56:33.080 --> 56:39.880
One of the benefits of that is that you can now run 1080p video at 60 frames per second,

56:39.880 --> 56:42.120
which is good.

56:42.120 --> 56:46.640
And the other thing is that there's been an awful lot of work going on behind the scenes

56:46.640 --> 56:54.120
at the Raspberry Pi Foundation to do all of the graphics enablement in kernel mode setting

56:54.120 --> 56:58.080
and direct rendering manager and Mesa and gallium.

56:58.080 --> 57:01.540
And that's sort of experimental at the moment.

57:01.540 --> 57:06.880
But I have had it working for brief periods of time.

57:06.880 --> 57:17.320
And when that works, it's a game changer, because you can turn on the OpenGL renderer

57:17.320 --> 57:27.720
in VLC and get smooth video playback in VLC, nice, not the rather clunky can't quite keep

57:27.720 --> 57:39.120
up software version, and you can also run OpenGL accelerated software providing OpenGL

57:39.120 --> 57:40.120
versions match up.

57:40.120 --> 57:45.160
So if you've ever played Neverball or Neverpup, I've had that running full screen, 60 frames

57:45.160 --> 57:47.400
per second, no problem.

57:47.400 --> 57:51.400
And there are other examples of where that on the Pi 3.

57:51.400 --> 57:52.400
On the Pi 3.

57:52.400 --> 57:53.400
Yeah.

57:53.400 --> 57:54.400
Wow.

57:54.400 --> 57:55.400
Yeah.

57:55.400 --> 57:56.440
That is a big deal.

57:56.440 --> 58:05.520
So when that lands properly, it's GLES warheads, GLES is the implementation for the Pi 3.

58:05.520 --> 58:11.040
But when that lands later in the year as a fully finished thing, that takes an awful

58:11.040 --> 58:14.560
lot of burden off the CPU.

58:14.560 --> 58:22.640
And I think that is where this sort of pseudo desktop use case really comes into its own

58:22.640 --> 58:30.560
and will start to grow because using things like composited desktops becomes a reality

58:30.560 --> 58:34.040
and alleviates burden from the CPU.

58:34.040 --> 58:35.040
This is good.

58:35.040 --> 58:36.040
Yeah.

58:36.040 --> 58:39.480
But as it is, it makes a very usable desktop experience.

58:39.480 --> 58:46.560
I mean, imagine if for $35, you could buy a computer and plug in a USB microphone and

58:46.560 --> 58:49.920
join a mumble room and have a podcast just like we are now.

58:49.920 --> 58:50.920
Oh, yeah.

58:50.920 --> 58:51.920
Oh, yeah.

58:51.920 --> 58:52.920
That is great.

58:52.920 --> 58:53.920
That is all plugged into a Raspberry Pi 3.

58:53.920 --> 58:54.920
I'm talking about.

58:54.920 --> 58:55.920
That is great.

58:55.920 --> 58:56.920
Oh, Wimpy.

58:56.920 --> 58:57.920
Drops the bomb.

58:57.920 --> 58:58.920
Well played, sir.

58:58.920 --> 58:59.920
Well played.

58:59.920 --> 59:08.120
You know, I was going to ask you if you think this is, I mean, wow, I mean, there you go.

59:08.120 --> 59:10.440
Podcasting is, that's probably something you can barely even do from a tablet.

59:10.440 --> 59:15.240
I mean, you can, but it's, I just, when I see this, at $35, Wimpy, isn't that a big

59:15.240 --> 59:19.840
part of the Raspberry Pi 3 is the performance for the price?

59:19.840 --> 59:20.840
It's not $50.

59:20.840 --> 59:21.840
Yeah.

59:21.840 --> 59:22.840
It's not even $45.

59:22.840 --> 59:23.840
Yeah.

59:23.840 --> 59:28.560
It's 35 US greenbacks, and that seems like that's sort of as a game changer, and your

59:28.560 --> 59:30.880
downloads must be bearing that out.

59:30.880 --> 59:31.880
Yeah.

59:31.880 --> 59:32.880
Yeah.

59:32.880 --> 59:36.600
I haven't looked since the new images have gone up.

59:36.600 --> 59:42.640
I'll check in a week or so to see how things are going, but yeah, so the Raspberry Pi is

59:42.640 --> 59:48.360
known to be something that retails for $35, well, or at least the traditional ones is

59:48.360 --> 59:51.880
obviously the zero now for $5.

59:51.880 --> 59:56.560
And as I understand it, they're trying to keep that $35 price point.

59:56.560 --> 01:00:02.640
So they will introduce features to that price rather than just introduce features because

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.560
they can, which I think is kind of neat because, you know, it's always going to be $35.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.560
Yeah.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.560
It keeps the expectation.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.560
Yeah.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.560
Yeah.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.420
It's a step change in performance, definitely.

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:18.080
And I think that it's very early now, you know, we're in day two.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:23.960
I think, you know, a few months from now, we'll be able to see the full, hopefully the

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.960
full potential.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.640
A smart move, though, on their part to keep the form factor, right?

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:35.560
By keeping the form factor the same, like groups like, groups like Mycroft, though,

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:38.600
like Mycroft saying, hey, we're now doing the testing, and if everything works out,

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.400
we're just going to include the Raspberry Pi 3 in with the Mycroft units because it

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.400
just snaps right in.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.400
Bam.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.400
Upgrade.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.400
Isn't that, don't you think that's a big deal?

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.400
And it's the same price.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.400
Yes.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.400
It's a huge deal.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.040
I think that means that people that are building things, I mean, for predictability like that,

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.800
when you're building something, right, to have that kind of predictability, that's important.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:00.420
Now for others, there might be other boards out there, but for some of us, that is a huge

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:01.420
component just right there.

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:05.180
No, $35, about the same form factor, I can snap it in.

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:08.760
When you buy it, probably the same software you used before, we'll just install to it.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.120
I think it's pretty neat.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.600
Any other thoughts, Wimpy?

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.720
Well, the only other major change that sort of just juxtaposes what you've said is that

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.840
it does require slightly more power now.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.560
So in the past, 1.8 amp or 2 amp power was recommended.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.120
So that's a bit of a twist, yeah.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.560
Now it's 2.4 amp.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:38.800
So if you've got existing power supplies that were kind of on the edge of being acceptable,

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.480
chances are you're going to need a new power supply.

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:50.280
I use an Atrix lap dock to connect Pi 2 to work on them, and I'm pleased to say that

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.040
that still powers the Pi 3.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:56.800
Yeah, I mean, 2.4 amps is not too uncommon, so yeah, that should, yeah.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:04.160
Also, if Mute or Raspbian isn't your flavor, Windows 10, look at this, Wes, Windows 10

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:07.120
Internet of Things Core for Raspberry Pi 3 is out.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.120
There's even a video.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.800
Look at this right here.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.080
It's Windows powering a wheel like a hamster.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.360
Go, Windows, go.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.360
Just like the hamster.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.360
It's learning, Chris.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.360
You got to be nice.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.080
So Windows 10 on the Raspberry Pi 3 controlling a closed loop wheel.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.080
You ready for this, Wes?

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:26.600
So Raspberry Pi 3 running Windows 10 IoT Core.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.560
The wheel represents a common situation in robotics when you need to know exactly how

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:33.960
fast a robot's going or how far it's traveling.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.200
Here I have a display connected to the Raspberry Pi 3.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.480
You can see the speed of the wheel, the speed I've chosen, and the power output to the motor.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:43.960
I just can't ever imagine why you would want the overhead of Windows for such a simple

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.960
task.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.960
I know.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.640
It's just, that's never going to, that's never a value argument.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.640
You're going to win.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.640
It's crazy.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.640
Absolutely.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:51.640
But, you know, go to Microsoft and try it.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.680
It's going to be the people who already have all that chain there.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.680
Yeah.

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.680
What do you think, Wimpy?

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.680
What do you think?

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.080
Oh, that's cute and everything, but let's see them come on a podcast on how we're using

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.080
a Raspberry Pi 3.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.080
That's right.

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.080
That's right.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:06.520
Raspberry Pi 3 is a nice piece of kit, but what about getting software installed on your

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:07.740
distro of choice?

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.740
Let's take a moment.

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.760
Let's talk about 1604 and snap packages.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:15.240
Now, there are many things to discuss in regards to this review, and I want to cover all of

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.840
them as much as we can.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.860
If you have not had a chance, it's not a prerequisite, but I would invite you to listen to episode

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:27.400
413 or watch episode 413 of the Linux Action Show, where we did our review.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.040
And just as a background, because I don't know if I really went into this in the show

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:36.400
or not, but basically every machine in my life, except for that one right there, that

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.120
Bonobo, got reloaded to Ubuntu 1604.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.120
Wow.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.960
Ubuntu edition was the one I ran with the longest, and then I put the neon packages

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.840
on there because I loves me the fresh neon.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:53.840
And I guess actually going back further, it really started the day I got the Apollo.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:59.120
I got really excited by what a good implementation Ubuntu Mate 1510 on the Apollo was, and then

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.420
as soon as it felt reasonable, I brought that up to 1604.

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:05.640
And then I started bringing all my other machines to 1604.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.640
One by one.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.640
Yeah.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:15.280
And so I spent a real solid month in Ubuntu, which for me was a big transition again going

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:16.280
back.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.280
Yeah, I feel you there.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:21.640
But part of the reason I wanted to do it is because I really wanted to spend – when

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.280
you just do it for a couple of days, you get totally overwhelmed by all the little rough

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.880
edges that are just different, just because it's not comfortable and familiar, it just

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.540
– it feels abrasive.

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:35.320
But if you actually spend time with it, you learn, oh yeah, I do it this way, this now.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.120
Learn the true character of what it's doing.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.360
And so I really wanted to give it its due.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:43.960
And so when we walked away, I walked away with some impressions that I had reflected

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.320
on for that whole month.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.800
And those definitely took the stage of the review, I think, the bulk of the stage.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:54.120
But there's a lot of things covered in the 1604 review.

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:58.280
And I was curious, Wes, if you – why don't we do this?

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:04.440
If you'd be up for this, let's get your impressions sort of at the top.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:09.280
Then let's go to the Mumble Room, get some of their updates and follow-up and their impressions.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.880
And then towards the end of this shenanigans, let's talk about some of the things that

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:17.620
have changed already or fixed already since Sunday's episode of the show.

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.920
So like a full spectrum coverage.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:26.240
So as follow-up to our 1604 review, Wes, what are your sort of out-of-the-first-gate impressions

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.240
of this brand new LTS release?

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:34.480
Okay, so for context, both in work and kind of at home, I both skipped at work the 1404

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.480
release.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:38.320
And then I used that at home, but I didn't use too much of 15.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:43.600
I guess this is kind of like, for you, a huge upgrade.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.440
Yeah, it really is a huge upgrade.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.440
That's an interesting perspective.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:51.400
So you've been stuck at 1204 for years and a majority, you know, I use some 1404.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:55.040
I do have like one system at 1510, but yes, there's a lot of 1204.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:58.320
And so there's so much new and so much I'm excited about.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:02.960
I mean, I've used Ubuntu on system D before, but I just, I love doing, you know, system

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.040
control status and just seeing that breakdown.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.280
I'm really excited to see it at servers on work.

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.760
Now did you play with the in-between ones?

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.000
Yeah, I played with them a little bit.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Okay.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
You just didn't use them widespread.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I just, yeah, I didn't really deploy them anywhere.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Yeah.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
And I'm kind of in the same boat.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.280
I just traditionally just stick to the LTS.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.280
Right.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:25.040
You know, and it seems like a good point right now where once it's out, it'll have fresh

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:29.400
packages for quite some time, and then you have the snap packages, and you have CFS right

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.400
there.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.760
Have you played with CFS on 1604?

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:36.960
I haven't on 1604, but I've used it, you know, building it myself or overloading myself installing

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.800
it third party on earlier versions.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:44.600
So like I'm really excited also about like LXD 2.0, which just came out.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:45.680
I like LXD.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.600
I like that model and Ubuntu supports it very well.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:53.640
So do you use a lot of other desktop environments other than just Unity?

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.640
Yeah.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.840
I almost never use Unity really.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:56.840
So I'm trying it out right now.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.160
It's not bad.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.680
The animations are pretty slick and it's definitely, I've seen the touch-ups from what I'm used

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:07.660
to, you know, especially seeing it work a lot of the deployments I've done before.

01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:10.920
So Unity is nice, but you know, normally I use a Cinnamon a lot for Linux Mint or I use

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:16.200
a tiling window manager, but I'm really excited for just having like, I feel like 1604 will

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:19.320
be a release I can deploy in almost every part of my life.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:23.400
The places where I don't need firsthand management or where Arch doesn't make the most sense,

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:27.180
you know, maybe for less minimal stuff, but anywhere where I just need a general Linux

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:30.320
where I know that the packages will be what I need, there'll be a way, especially with

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.320
snap packages.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:36.320
There'll be a way to get the software that I want and I can figure out the way I need.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.320
I'm really excited.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.320
Yeah.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.800
That's sort of my takeaway too.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:43.800
And I kind of wanted to, I joked a lot during the livestream, but I actually am kind of

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:50.240
curious on Popey's take for it because not just because he worked with Ubuntu and works

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:54.240
at Canonical, but honestly because he's obviously been following this for a long time and has

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.500
good insight on this.

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:59.840
And I wonder too if maybe these are some of the elements that he's excited about.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:03.920
And I know I've kind of asked him to dance it like a monkey before on this topic, but

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:07.760
I know that the snap packages are sort of the weakest area of coverage in our review

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.040
and it's sort of, I feel like the biggest long-term ramifications of 1604.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.680
And so I don't know, Popey, do you have any, just sort of take on our review and thoughts

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.280
on it and maybe thoughts on snap packages specifically?

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:22.120
Can't talk Chris, I'm busy playing games on 1604.

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.120
Nice.

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.120
Yeah.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.120
Okay.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.120
You know what?

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:29.000
That's another thing is it is a great platform for Steam games.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Yeah, I kid.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I'm joking.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I was actually playing 1604.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Yeah, I believe you.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:43.440
But yeah, the snap stuff, you know, when I first heard about this a couple of years ago,

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:49.200
I was kind of skeptical because the guy who was telling me about this was outside a hotel.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:54.440
You know, we'd all had an intro to what Snappy was and only a few people have been involved

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.500
in what it was going to be.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.200
And I didn't quite get it.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:07.000
And it's only now that I realize how many people depend on things like AUR in Arch or

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.240
self-updating applications like Chrome and other things that just like sort themselves

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:15.080
out and nobody has to worry about it, right?

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:20.740
And you know, we used to think that PPAs were a marvelous way to get stuff to users.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:26.880
But actually, it's quite abrasive to get from, you know, I want to have the latest version

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:34.780
of whatever, Atom or, you know, Sublime or whatever, whether it's free software or proprietary.

01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:39.880
It's quite abrasive to get from I want that thing to getting that thing.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:47.520
And I think Snap can make that a whole lot easier and also make it so that you can have

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:52.560
the latest version of stuff up to date all the time on your system and that is compelling

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.560
for a lot of people.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.560
Yeah, extremely.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:10:00.520
And I know every year I talk to Frank about this problem from ownCloud and this, I'm really

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.720
curious this year to say, what do you think about this?

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:03.840
What are your thoughts on this?

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.000
I know they're relying right now on the openSUSE build service.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.520
And so one of the things that we kept going around and around about is this seems maybe

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.600
like a little bit too late, Pobi.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.320
It seems like maybe this should have come about.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:23.160
But if you look at the origins of where Snap packages were originally created for, there

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:30.680
is almost no no route to here without having gone through the Ubuntu phone process, right?

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.240
Yeah, we learn a lot from click packages on the phone and

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:36.240
Click packages.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.240
That's click packages.

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.240
Thank you.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:39.240
Yeah.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.240
Yeah.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.240
So, you know, like, I'll give you a good example.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:49.720
There's a developer who created a game for Ubuntu phone called Balls.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.840
And it's written in SDL2.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.720
It works on the phone.

01:10:54.720 --> 01:11:03.020
And he cranks out a new version once, maybe twice a day, how he can just push a new version

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:04.680
to the store.

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:10.760
And it's on his customers handsets, or his users or whatever you want to call them that

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:16.240
the people who play his game, he can build a new level in 15 minutes that he has to work

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.800
on his game.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.560
He can build a new level, crank out a click package, shove it in the store, and thousands

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.480
of people have it straight away, right?

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:27.640
And so that works great on the phone.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.520
But you know, you and I both know, I'll give you a little secret, right?

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:34.880
We don't have millions and millions of phone users, right?

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:39.440
But we do have millions and millions of Ubuntu desktop users.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:46.680
So take that technology that we used on the phone to deliver applications super fast to

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:53.160
the users on the phone and bring that to the desktop, then all those millions of users

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:57.400
can potentially have super up-to-date packages with all the lessons we've learned from the

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.400
phone.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.400
Hmm.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.400
I do like that.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:03.360
I feel like it's one of those things that we won't see pay off for quite a while though.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:04.360
Potentially.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.120
I mean, we're working on tools to make it easier.

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:12.760
So like, you know, we're all working on snapifying, we call it.

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:13.760
Not formally.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.560
That's just like a stupid term.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.680
Not snap-crafting, or...

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:21.040
Yeah, there's not a verb for it really.

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.040
Snapping?

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.040
Snapping, yeah.

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.040
You don't want to snap.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.040
Yeah.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.240
So we're all working on, yeah, snapification sounds good.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:30.640
Sounds very George W. Bush.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:35.200
And we're all doing a bit of that to iron out all the kinks and figure out, you know,

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:39.440
because every application is different and some things have different requirements, and

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.520
because of our security model to ensure that one application can't stomp on the files of

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:52.120
another or you don't get one file, you know, able to access the data from another application

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:58.720
and like send your key presses elsewhere, the security side of things is super critical

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:05.880
and we're just discovering the edge cases of, you know, what each application needs

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.520
in terms of security with Snappy.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.880
And so we're pushing the boundaries of that, trying to make sure that we're getting all

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:16.840
that done so that when a developer comes along and wants to snappify their app, it's all

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.840
ready for them.

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:24.200
This is something that I want to talk to you about because I was just arguing with Noah

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:29.200
that one of the emails we get all the time on quarter radio, and one of the things that

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:34.320
Mike has run into, is he says, right, okay, I'm going to develop for Ubuntu.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:38.480
I'm going to release an app for the Ubuntu desktop for Ubuntu users.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:47.000
And I'm going to use which SDK, which toolkit, which backend language, and I distribute it

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.160
to my end users with reliable, secure updates.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.160
How?

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:57.480
Okay, so if I want to distribute for Ubuntu reliably via software update, how do I do

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.480
that?

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.320
And if I'm just saying, just say I'm like, say I'm the developer of your favorite application

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.720
that's available for another platform that just has decided now is the time to target

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:06.120
the Linux desktop.

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.360
How do they figure this out?

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:15.360
They either, A, somehow get it submitted to Debian downstream so it gets included in the

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.840
Ubuntu repos and thus gets updated when their system updates.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:23.840
They figure out how to create a Launchpad account and create PPAs and publish their

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.520
own repo.

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:31.960
They figure out how to package a deb file or pay somebody, which is a common thing that

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:37.960
developers do, is just hire some guy or gal to package a deb file for them, and then they

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:41.680
post it on their website, which then means you don't get to take advantage of any of

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.000
the built-in package management.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Nope.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Check back.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.840
And so what Mike and I have kicked around a ton on Coderadio is this is a shitty story

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.400
to tell developers.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.720
This just doesn't work for them.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:53.720
They can't bank on that.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.880
They can't take that to the bank.

01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:02.720
And so I think that the SNAP packages is probably the best answer to this, and I think it answers

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.720
a bigger question than we all realize is being asked.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:09.320
Do you agree with my sort of rough assessment, Popi?

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.320
Right.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:16.520
And for a slow-moving free software project, there's a good argument for you should put

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:21.720
it in Debian or AUR or wherever that hits the most number of free software developers.

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:25.040
But that's not really practical for a lot of people that are maybe bringing something

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.640
over to the Linux desktop for the first time.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.640
Right.

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.920
And that's just one method.

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:36.120
I'm just trying to say that putting it in Debian is not inherently a bad thing.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.120
Right.

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.120
There's nothing inherently wrong with that.

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:39.800
If you could do it, it's great.

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:40.800
Right.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.200
But we've seen – or if you can find a Debian developer to sponsor your upload or whatever

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.200
the process is.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:53.480
But we've seen recently friction in Debian where an upstream developer wants more recent

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:59.920
versions of their application in the distro, and the Debian policy doesn't allow that

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:00.920
to happen.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:01.920
Right.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.240
You're referring to the X-Screen saver thing.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.240
Right.

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:09.800
And so with a system where the developer is put in control of how they distribute their

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:16.760
code and with automated reviews and sandboxing, these three things put together means that

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:20.440
developers are happy because they can distribute the version of their software that they're

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.260
happy with when they want to.

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:27.200
Users are happy because they get the latest version of Crack that they want, and users

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.080
are also happy and sysadmins are happy because the system is secure because the apps are

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.720
siloed from each other.

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:36.400
So it seems like a win-win-win all the way around.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:40.240
R Brown, I wanted to give you a chance to jump in because also – I mean, we've seen

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.640
this play out in a lot of instances, but own clouds are probably one of the more prominent

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:44.640
ones.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.640
Wouldn't you agree?

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:46.640
Yeah.

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:52.520
They're a pretty good example of one of those projects where, yeah, they're really – well,

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:57.680
in the case of the Debian one, it wasn't just a case of not able to get the version

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:03.200
in there, but also the Debian developer putting in what own cloud considered was an unsafe

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.200
upgrade path.

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.200
Right.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:10.120
Now, Richard, I just want your frank opinion, not even as a representation of SUSE, just

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:14.680
as a representative of the Linux community.

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.200
Do you bang your head against your desk?

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:20.580
Do you facepalm a little bit when you go, guys, guys, guys, we've got the open bususa

01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:21.580
build service.

01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:22.780
It's working great.

01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:25.040
Projects like own cloud are using the hell out of it.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.840
Don't reinvent the wheel of snap packages.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.120
Just put it in the open build service.

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:35.120
Is there a facepalm moment for you or do you see it in a different light?

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.360
There is to a large extent.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:43.920
When you mix in the Ubuntu mobile thing, there's maybe a case to be made there, but I'm not

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:44.920
sold on it.

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:45.920
No.

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.920
Hmm.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:47.920
Yeah.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:48.920
This is where our debate was going –

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:49.920
I see.

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:53.600
– in the living room, and – no, no, I don't know.

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:59.560
When we talked about it, my take was – see, I guess it's – I have two opinions because

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:05.280
snap packages on their own right are pretty slick technology and a pretty great idea and

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:11.200
something that I think pretty much anyone who's new to the scene, you can look at how

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:16.400
to build these things, how to write the description file, and you're going to get it.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.800
It's going to be easy.

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:18.800
I love that a lot.

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.600
And it might be familiar for how you're doing packaging things for other systems already.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:23.600
Sure.

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.600
Yeah.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:25.600
Yeah.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.840
So that – I'm pretty jazzed about it in the big picture.

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:35.880
At the same time, I don't want to say this in a flamey way, but if Ubuntu would have

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:39.440
just – if it could have gone like this, like what if it could have gone like this?

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:43.840
Like Canonica would have been like, all right, we're going to go focus on mobile for a bit,

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:48.960
so what we're going to do is if you want to worry about getting desktop software on

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:52.720
our desktop, we're just going to hook in with the openSUSE build service.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:56.120
And we're just going to hook in with that, and that's going to be sort of our official

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.760
avenue for getting software on our desktop.

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:03.740
And I feel like that would have been a game changer for desktop Linux because instead

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:10.920
of now getting packages bundled for Debian and Ubuntu out of the goodwill of the developer,

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:15.600
it would have been a standardized method to deliver software to the Linux desktop.

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:21.160
What guarantee would Canonical have had that the openSUSE build service would have kept

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:24.720
their values and their priorities in mind?

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:27.040
Besides the fact we've been doing it for 10 years now?

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:33.280
Well, so I guess what I'm asking is Canonical has – Canonical invented the PPA system

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:37.600
and for better or for worse, they have these devs that are available on the download, but

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.960
that was – at the time that that came out, that was far and away better than anything

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.720
else we had had on Linux, and so I think it's a little unfair to say that because other

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:50.600
competition has rose up around them and they are now taking those steps to advance it,

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:55.240
I think it's a little unfair to say, well, all of a sudden Canonical has just done it

01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:56.240
all wrong.

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:57.240
And I guess –

01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:01.160
No, I don't want to come across to saying they've done it all wrong because I don't

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.160
agree.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:05.280
I think that PPAs were a decent addition.

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:11.080
And so here's where I'm coming from on this, and just really quickly is Seuss Martin

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:17.280
in the Linux action show subreddit said, sorry, Chris, no offense.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.280
Which is always –

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.280
I'm about to say something offensive.

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.080
Yeah, I just pissed in your flower bed.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:23.080
Not to upset you.

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:24.080
Anyways –

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.080
That's good.

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:31.880
But that was not a review, more like an hour-long monologue about how bad PPAs are, and I want

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:32.880
to stop right there.

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:37.000
I actually think as far as PPAs go, they're not an awful system.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.680
I don't think it's that bad.

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:42.800
I think it was a good addition when PPAs were launched a long time ago.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.640
I'm trying to look at Wikipedia to find out the date, but they don't have it.

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.640
2009.

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:48.640
Thank you.

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:52.120
They certainly filled the need.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.120
Right.

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.680
Yeah, this was solid in 2009.

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:55.680
Great idea.

01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:00.760
2009 is too long ago now, and it needed to be iterated on continuously since then.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:06.080
And what happened, in my estimation, is it just didn't become a priority.

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:10.200
And then the cloud took off, and then rapid software development took off, and people

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:17.280
start creating entire applications that run on the web based on Node.js and plug-ins that

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.520
can be completely revoked.

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:21.380
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:23.960
And in days, they have a new web application.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:26.080
And then in months, they have iterated three times.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:31.160
And all of a sudden, we now find ourselves in a world where, unarguably, OpenSUSE were

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:37.120
the leaders, where Fedora has a very competent solution, where Arch has a crushing lead with

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.040
the user repository.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:42.840
We now find ourselves in a world where Ubuntu is behind in this regard.

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:45.220
I'm not saying PPAs are bad.

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:50.240
I'm saying that if we could have switched over to another solution by now, I like the

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.160
build service just as my personal one.

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:53.360
Yeah, it works well.

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:57.260
We would have fundamentally changed how software is distributed for Linux.

01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:03.160
The answer for developers that I talked about earlier would have been target the build service

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:07.600
with clear documentation, a large community, and it would have made it available to just

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.440
about every damn distro on the planet.

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:16.680
Now I'm very excited for Snap packages, but at the same time, I kind of feel like it's

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:19.840
too little to, well, not too little, but it's too late.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:24.840
16.04 and Snap packages, definitely notables from 2016.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:28.320
One of the next segments that's coming up is one of the first really, well, not really

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:33.160
one of the first, but one of the many super solid technical contributions that Wes has

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.280
brought to the show.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:38.900
It's been great having Wes on the show in 2016, and our next segment is a great example

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:39.900
of that.

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:43.080
And it's so great because he's not caught up in all the buzz and the hype around some

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:46.800
of these things, and he gives you a real practical, straightforward, working with us every day

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:47.800
kind of take.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:51.360
First, speaking of working with things every single day, your education is one of them,

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:52.720
and that's Linux Academy.

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:57.120
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged is where you go to support the show and get a seven-day

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.120
free trial.

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:02.000
Linux Academy is a platform created by Linux enthusiasts for you to learn more about all

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.880
things Linux and the great stuff built on top of it.

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.680
And they're just geniuses about the way they've set this up.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:12.220
They have self-paced, in-depth video courses for every Linux and cloud and DevOps topic.

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:17.180
They have labs that give you hands-on, scenario-based training, which helps me with my testing anxiety.

01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:19.800
Future mentoring is available when you need it, actual human beings.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:23.400
And then if you're not quite sure what path to take, well, they have learning paths for

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.260
you, a series of courses and content planned by those human beings.

01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:29.880
They have cert training if that's the route you want to go, nuggets for tiny bits of sparkly

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:34.860
wisdom, course schedulers to work with your busy schedule, study guides and comprehensive

01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:40.500
downloads that have audio or PDFs that you can read or listen to offline, and note cards

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:44.920
that are forked and worked on by the community, and the community is full of Jupyter Broadcasting

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:45.920
members.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:46.920
I love it.

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:49.080
Twitter.com slash unplugged is where you go.

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:55.640
And kind of fun to watch their feed right now on Twitter, twitter.com slash linuxacademycom.

01:23:55.640 --> 01:24:00.760
They're at an AWS event that's going on, and they have a booth there, and there's a lot

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.140
of shenanigans going on, and they're giving away drones, too.

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:05.140
This is awesome.

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.140
And they have giant plushies.

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:07.140
What?

01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:10.540
I want a giant plushie and a drone.

01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:11.540
This is pretty cool.

01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:12.540
Their Twitter feed's great.

01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:15.760
You can learn about new content coming to Linux Academy and see some of the shenanigans

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:16.760
they're up to.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:20.940
Again, that's linuxacademycom on Twitter if you want to see that, and some of the video

01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:22.820
from the AWS event they're at.

01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:26.060
It's cool to see them down there and getting hands-on with all the big stuff that Amazon's

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:30.540
announcing today, so that way they can integrate it into their courseware pronto.

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:32.620
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:36.020
Go there, support the show, and sign up for a seven-day free trial.

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:40.100
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the show all

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:41.100
year.

01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:42.100
LXD.

01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:45.580
It's like the non-hyped Docker, and Wes has had some real hands-on experience.

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.180
I love this contribution to the show.

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:52.860
All right, Mr. Wes, so you said to me, okay, Chris, I know we've talked about Ubuntu 16.04

01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:55.340
a lot, but let's be real.

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:58.260
We've mostly focused on the desktop, where we've trashed on it a little bit.

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:01.020
Plus, I mean, does anyone even use Linux on the desktop?

01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:02.020
I don't know.

01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:03.020
No, I could, obviously.

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:04.020
Obviously.

01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:05.020
Oh my gosh.

01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:06.020
Oh my gosh.

01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:07.020
Whew.

01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:11.300
But, you know, there's the whole other element of the Ubuntu server.

01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:13.860
The server, where it's actually hugely successful in a big way.

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:14.860
So have you used it at all?

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:15.860
Yeah.

01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:16.860
Oh, yeah.

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:17.860
Yeah.

01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:18.860
Wait.

01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:20.940
Do I have any local 16.04 servers?

01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:21.940
No.

01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:22.940
No, I don't.

01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:29.140
I only have Digital Ocean Droplets, but we've got a handful of them now, and I don't really

01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.140
have anything to say.

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:32.140
I guess that's a good thing in a server, right?

01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:33.140
Yeah.

01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:34.140
They just freaking run.

01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:35.940
We've set up a software on them.

01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:40.500
We have some 14.04 Droplets we want to move to 16.04, because we... I'll tell you one

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:41.500
... Okay.

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:42.500
Okay.

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:43.500
Okay.

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:45.740
Okay.

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:50.540
It is a pain in the ass now to like... It is a major pain in the ass to write init scripts

01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:54.900
for Upstart, and it's like the last thing I want to do, or it's the last thing anybody

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:57.820
on the JB crew wants to do, is learn Upstart at this point.

01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:58.820
Oh my gosh.

01:25:58.820 --> 01:25:59.820
Yes.

01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:00.820
Who wants to learn Upstart?

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:01.820
No.

01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:02.820
It's dead.

01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:03.820
Yeah.

01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:04.820
Exactly.

01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:05.820
And here's the other thing, is tons of the projects I've been using for a while now have

01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:06.820
systemd init scripts.

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:07.820
Yep.

01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:08.820
They come.

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:09.820
They're right there.

01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:10.820
Yes.

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:11.820
Yes.

01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:12.820
Yes.

01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:17.320
And so I can use those examples and things, but that's pretty much the entire summary

01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:18.840
of my review from the servers.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:19.840
It works.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.140
I don't really have any complaints, and it does everything I expect, which, by the way,

01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:25.560
exactly what I want on my server.

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:26.560
It just is.

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:27.560
Yeah.

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:28.560
It's consistent.

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:30.940
So you, however, have had a bit of a bigger route change.

01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:33.900
I'm in the weird position of like... I mean, I use Arch for a lot of things.

01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:36.060
It's what I'm most familiar these days with.

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:40.260
I know how to bend it to my will, get whatever I need to do done with it.

01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:43.780
I'm in the weird position where I'm considering switching to Ubuntu for a lot of my larger

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:51.060
server uses, mostly because of LexD, as they call it, which is LexD 2.0 is just released,

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:56.940
and that's their container lighter visor, they jokingly call it, and it's meant to be

01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:02.660
a new way to interact with the Linux container, or LexC, subsystem and the infrastructure

01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:03.660
they've set up.

01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:10.100
So if you're not familiar, you can go to linuxcontainers.org, backslash.org, and you can go to linuxcontainers.org,

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:14.140
backslash LXD, backslash try-it, which we will have a link in the show notes.

01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:16.340
And you can give it a try right now, and it's a...

01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:17.340
Now hold on.

01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:23.260
When you say give it a try, you mean I can go to a webpage and I can spin up a LXD container

01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:24.260
in real time?

01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:25.260
Yeah, let's try it.

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:26.260
Let's do it right now.

01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:27.260
Are you ready?

01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:28.260
You want to do it?

01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:29.260
Okay, here we go.

01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:34.740
So I am at linuxcontainers.org, slash LXD, slash try-it, again, link in the show notes.

01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:37.540
Yeah, where's the FPV6 connectivity, Chris, at the studio?

01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:38.540
Come on.

01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:39.540
I know, right?

01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:41.740
You've accepted the terms of service, because of course I do.

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:42.740
They're pretty reasonable.

01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:44.820
Now, they are going to start the container on the fly now.

01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:48.700
Because we just gave out the URL, it's going to get slow here, but before it gets slow,

01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:50.780
you can see right here, Wes, right here, boom!

01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:56.520
I got a console, I got an LXD container, I'm now root inside a container nested inside

01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:58.900
an LXD install, which is sort of like LXD inception.

01:27:58.900 --> 01:27:59.900
Yes, right.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:00.900
What am I seeing here, Wes?

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:01.900
What am I seeing?

01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:07.580
You're seeing they ran LXD exec container name bash, and it just gets you executed as root

01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:09.780
inside the container a bash shell.

01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:10.780
This is pretty cool.

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:11.940
This is a pretty cool way to do it.

01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:12.940
Yeah, it's pretty neat.

01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:16.660
So one of the neat things that they've, LXD was pretty complicated to use.

01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:20.860
It's really neat to use, if you've ever tried it, if you need system-level containers.

01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:25.020
But there's a lot of things to learn, and a lot of configuration things to set up.

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:26.020
Sure.

01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:29.740
LXD, or LXD, it's a lot simpler, and so you can kind of just get an image going, and they

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:30.900
have default profiles set up.

01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:37.700
So the default one, it runs as an unprivileged container, meaning that it actually runs in

01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:41.260
a user namespace, so that root in the container is no longer root on your host.

01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:46.760
It's actually matched to UID 1 million or something like that, and hopefully that get

01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:48.660
you some added security.

01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:50.540
But it also has default profiles.

01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:54.500
If you want to run Docker in there, you just change your container to be on the Docker

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:58.280
profile, and they tweak some of the security settings and the nesting settings so that

01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:00.460
you can run Docker inside your container.

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:01.460
Huh.

01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:03.860
So you're just starting to play with this, but how's the workflow bit?

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:04.860
Is it pretty easy to use?

01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:05.860
It's neat.

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:09.420
So LXD used kind of a template workflow, so where you'd use something like packstrap or

01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:13.180
debootstrap or whatever to get your container implemented on the machine you're running

01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:14.180
it on.

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:20.020
LXD uses an image-based format, so you actually just have a tar gz of your container root

01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:24.140
file system, and it also takes great advantage of CFS.

01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:25.140
It's awesome.

01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:29.340
So in 16.04, you just install the userland tools, the kernel module's built for you,

01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:30.620
you just load that up.

01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:36.140
It has a pseudo-LXD in it, and it'll walk you through it, it'll even set you up like

01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:39.860
a loopback-mounted ZFS file system if you want, right?

01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:41.540
So that's what I'm using on the laptop here.

01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:44.340
Or if you want to have, you know, you have an actual pool of disks to use, you can use

01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:46.340
that, or use one that you already have.

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:50.500
And so what that means is, when you want to use like a new, they give you some image servers

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:55.260
by default with the, you know, Ubuntu 16.04 container image, you can just pull that down,

01:29:55.260 --> 01:30:00.380
but once you have that image, every new container you start, it's just a, it's just a copy-on-write

01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:01.380
copy of that, right?

01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:04.300
So you, you, it's basically free, except for what you change it.

01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:05.300
That's slick!

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:06.700
And all, again, super easy to set up.

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:09.980
And I've already set up like an arch verge, so they don't have, they have like Alpine,

01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:10.980
they have Fedora.

01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:15.580
So wait, so you're saying, you're saying you have, okay, so, for example, if I were to

01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:21.380
do this on a, on a droplet, I could have an Ubuntu 16.04 droplet, but in the container,

01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:22.380
run arch.

01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:23.380
Yep, absolutely.

01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:25.340
So they don't have one provided on there.

01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:30.260
They have like an image, images.linuxcontainers.org, where they have like Fedora, Cora, like lots

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:34.380
of pre-built stuff for you, but arch wasn't one of them, but you just take a, you know,

01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:37.620
you make a reasonable arch file system, you package it up in a tar and it's really easy

01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:38.620
to get it as your own.

01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:42.340
And then you can, they, the other neat thing is it's a networked, like it's all done over

01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:43.460
a REST API.

01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:44.980
That's like, that's how the client talks to it.

01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:45.980
That's how you can talk to it.

01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:49.020
They have Python bindings and it also talks over the network.

01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:53.460
So I can have a server here and then a server on a droplet somewhere, and I can go make

01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:55.420
myself a new image, have containers here.

01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:58.500
And if I make a container I really like here, I can just push it over to the server and

01:30:58.500 --> 01:30:59.500
it will run there.

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:00.500
That is nice.

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:01.500
Talking about rapid development.

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:04.820
You can even snapshot up here, then push the snapshot up to the, it's, it's, I'm really

01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:05.820
excited.

01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:07.740
I might have to change a lot of my infrastructure to use this now.

01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:09.260
That is super, super neat.

01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:14.140
I like Wes's discussion about LXDE and while we're talking about things that are very practical,

01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:18.220
let's talk about the Linux desktop in terms of pragmatic reasons and philosophical reasons

01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:19.220
to use Linux.

01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:20.220
All right.

01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:23.740
So I, I'll, I don't want to go too far in this without bringing in the mumble room because

01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:26.140
this is sort of the segment I wanted to give them a chance to shine.

01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:30.900
However, I got to ask you, I don't think I actually know the answer to this question

01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:31.900
either.

01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:35.060
I was just trying to think if I knew what you were going to say.

01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:45.460
Do you today use the Linux desktop for idealistic reasons or for purely pragmatic practical

01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:48.460
reasons today?

01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:54.500
And is that different than when you first tried Linux?

01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:57.500
I think I've kind of come full circle.

01:31:57.500 --> 01:31:59.060
You know, I grew up kind of playing with windows.

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:03.100
I remember trying to change the like windows boot screen and breaking the family computer

01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:04.780
for a while, that kind of thing.

01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:08.220
And you quickly figure out like what you can and what you cannot change with windows.

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:12.860
And so Linux started out as this like wonderful playground and like I knew what open source

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:13.860
was.

01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:16.380
I kind of like started trying to program, but it was, it didn't mean a lot.

01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:18.100
I couldn't really use it to do any, you know what I mean?

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:21.980
Like, I mean, I could do a lot and I loved all this software, but it was like, this is

01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:22.980
just fun.

01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:25.020
This let me like really deep dive.

01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:30.220
And I think somewhere in the middle there, I really stuck around because, I mean, at

01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:33.580
some point I started going to school and like, well, I mean, Linux was very important for

01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:34.580
that.

01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:37.140
You know, you can write a paper on just about any operating system.

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:43.460
So I think it really, the, the idle ideology, it really did, it really did sink in.

01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:46.820
You know, and it, you know, it made me, it made me want to try more distributions.

01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:50.700
It made me want to try to, you know, you can play with free BSD or something else, look

01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:53.300
at the little different ideology.

01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:57.260
But I think today, I don't think there's another platform where I could get what I need to

01:32:57.260 --> 01:32:58.260
get done.

01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:00.700
Like there's definitely both parts, like both parts are very important.

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:03.980
I think the ideology is, it's important.

01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:04.980
I think freedom is important.

01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:08.660
I think open source is important, but it's also just, I need to, I need an operating

01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:11.080
system that is malleable and where I can change things.

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:17.460
And like the ideology definitely informs that, but at some day, be it as long as it is free,

01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:18.460
I think I can make it work.

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:19.460
You know?

01:33:19.460 --> 01:33:20.460
Okay.

01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:21.460
All right.

01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:22.980
So let's, let's bounce to the mumble room and then I'll give you my thoughts.

01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:25.780
So BC, I'll let you go first.

01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:29.220
Do you use it today for ideal, idealistic or practical reasons?

01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:31.180
And is that how you started using Linux?

01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:32.180
Yeah.

01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:36.020
So the first time I installed Linux, it was like 15 years ago.

01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:37.020
Yes.

01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:38.620
Coming directly from Windows.

01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:46.340
I started, just wanted to check out what exactly it is right now as I use Linux full time.

01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:48.980
I'm just much more productive with it.

01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:57.780
However, it's not just productive because I try to use as little close software as possible.

01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:04.460
So in reality, both interesting thing there too, because you can kind of reach a limit

01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:05.780
where you're like, well, I want to be free.

01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:09.740
And then sometimes you hit that area where you're like, well, my operating system is

01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:12.700
free, but this application is proprietary and I need it.

01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:13.700
Yeah.

01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:15.220
I use Windows for some things.

01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:21.180
For example, game development, I use KVM with GPU pass-through, unfortunately.

01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:22.180
Yeah.

01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:23.180
Okay.

01:34:23.180 --> 01:34:24.180
All right.

01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:25.180
Good.

01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:28.780
And it sounds kind of like sort of a similar situation, Uber Panda, I want to hear your

01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:29.780
thoughts.

01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:30.780
Yeah.

01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:36.180
Yeah, so I started using Linux because of battery life reasons.

01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:41.900
My laptop on Windows lasted like one hour and I just started using AuctionX and it lasted

01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:43.620
for two and a half hours.

01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:46.140
So I used that.

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:50.580
And then I understood what was free software, that kind of thing.

01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:57.140
So it became an ideology and now I think free software is good and Windows is also a terrible

01:34:57.140 --> 01:34:58.140
operating system.

01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:00.980
So I use Linux for both reasons.

01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:01.980
Yeah.

01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:02.980
Interesting.

01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:03.980
I love it.

01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:04.980
I think that's pretty, I think that actually makes a lot of sense.

01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:08.780
Now, okay, Mr. Heaven, so it sounds like you've been around the block a couple of times,

01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:12.180
including over into the FreeBSD camp and then ended back on Linux.

01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:16.900
So is that for idealism or is that because just made more sense, practically speaking?

01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:25.860
Well, the reason why I went, or at least let's say during my first bit of open source adventures,

01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:28.380
of course, I like the technical things.

01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:33.700
So I went into a, you know, adventure and benchmarking a whole bunch of file systems.

01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:37.500
I found XFS while I was on Linux and I loved it.

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:43.940
Thing is, my philosophy is closer to the BSD philosophy versus the Linux one.

01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:49.820
So I actually went over to desktop BSD and whatever that other one was and FreeBSD and

01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:51.620
I went there for a while.

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:56.640
Thing is, the XFS port wasn't up to stuff, it wasn't up to date enough.

01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:02.540
So even though I love FreeSP's philosophy of true freedom, it allows you to keep secrets

01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:08.060
if you want, but Linux pretty much prevents you from keeping secrets if you, you know,

01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:11.520
regardless if you want to or not, other than the LGPL.

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:17.980
So I went back to Linux because of XFS, because all of my storage was XFS and FreeBSD didn't

01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:20.260
actually provide what I needed.

01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:24.380
So that's, that's a practical, that'd be a practical reason there.

01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:27.980
That is actually a practical reason, even though it's slightly philosophical as well.

01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:29.540
Oh man, that's so interesting.

01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:35.860
All right, Mini MC, your practical or idealism for your initial adoption of Linux and where

01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:38.300
you're at today?

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:40.780
So I wanted to know something new.

01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:47.900
I started with Linux 6.1, I just wanted to see something new and all missing stuff was

01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:52.980
really hard to replace and then from time to time it became a feature.

01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:55.980
So now Linux changed my whole workflow.

01:36:55.980 --> 01:37:00.980
So it stripped me down to the basics and I'm much faster, much clearer in my workflow than

01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:02.980
I was before, I guess.

01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:03.980
Interesting.

01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:05.980
Yeah, I know.

01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:10.060
What's been interesting for me just on the workflow part is I've had the opportunity

01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:15.060
now of moving a couple of different types of workflows onto Linux, started as just moving

01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:21.100
like desktop Microsoft workflow, like Office and Outlook, getting that running on Linux

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:24.940
and doing interacting with Windows file shares and that workflow was a major workflow.

01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:29.660
And I, it took me a while, I mean it took me a while to make that more efficient under

01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:34.140
Linux to be able to justify running Microsoft applications on Linux, but I got there.

01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:39.060
I eventually got there and then I moved, I went as a consultant, I had to move that workflow

01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:45.420
onto Linux when I did IT consulting for a while and then, you know, just here at Jupyter

01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:50.500
Broadcasting there have been so many workflows that are sort of, they start with the Mac

01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:54.660
and then I was like I have to move this to Linux and definitely one of the biggest ones

01:37:54.660 --> 01:38:00.640
for me was my unfilter clip editing and workflow because that just, it started out as such

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:07.100
a Mac centric just couple of tools that I just hated using and it just was a mess and

01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:12.500
moving that over to Linux and finding that to be, and being able to then use all of my,

01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:16.420
you know, my traditional Linux skills on the command line and being able to take advantage

01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:19.500
of things like Quake and being able to take advantage of things like Avid Mux and being

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:24.860
able to install codecs, you know, by just a command away, it made it very practical

01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:26.580
in that case to move that workflow over there.

01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:31.100
So that workflow element and just because I have a better workflow sometimes is enough

01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:32.100
of a reason.

01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:35.020
And more options in how you make that workflow, right?

01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:38.820
So Rotten, I wanted to hear your practical or idealism.

01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:46.060
Well, I started as a practicality thing because I was a beta tester for Windows 7 for about

01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:51.100
a year before it was released and when it came to the point where they were about to

01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:54.700
release it, they said all beta testers now had to pay for it.

01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:58.600
So and it wasn't like, you know, you had a certain amount of time to pay for it.

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:01.140
They stopped your Windows 7 from working.

01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:02.140
Oh yeah.

01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:03.140
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:07.900
Yeah, so it was completely like just stripped away from me and they gave me, I think like

01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:13.900
a week ahead of time, you're going to lose the access to run the system that you've been

01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:20.180
working for free to fix bugs and, you know, find problems that we've obviously have not

01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:22.280
finished fixing yet.

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:26.500
And then it to the point where I was just like, you know what, out of spite, screw it.

01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:29.660
And I was already dual booting at the time, but then I just kind of like just wiped it

01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:34.700
and went to the Linux way and been there the whole time.

01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:37.860
And now it's become both.

01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:40.020
I didn't really know what the ideology was at the time.

01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:41.020
Exactly.

01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:42.020
Right.

01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:43.020
Yeah.

01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:44.020
It's hard to pick up on it.

01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:45.020
Yeah.

01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:46.020
Yeah.

01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:49.860
So now it's more like the ideology made me stay and the practicality made me come over.

01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:50.860
That's a good way to put it.

01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:55.020
Landrash, I wanted to hear your ideology versus practicality, where you started and where

01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:57.380
you ended up.

01:39:57.380 --> 01:40:04.140
I started in school with using it when I needed to for courses and stuff, going over to practicality

01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:08.540
when I got used to it and basically getting the only way I could do things was with Linux

01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:10.020
because I needed the tools.

01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:11.740
I had the tools I needed there.

01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:16.180
I'm going to Windows for like shooting myself in the foot and doing it 10 times slower.

01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:18.340
I think we've all been there.

01:40:18.340 --> 01:40:19.340
Yeah.

01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:20.820
He's finding that school's pretty cool.

01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:24.060
Okay, Mr. Ranger, how about yourself?

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:29.460
I'm another one that I started out practical because back in the late 90s, early 2000s,

01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:34.260
worked at a computer shop where we needed easy internet sharing and IP chains was where

01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:35.260
it was at.

01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:36.260
Nice.

01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:42.180
Similar to your banking story, we had a point of sale system that was crashy and the networking

01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:43.580
on it was horrible.

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:50.100
And oddly enough, the perfect solution was to run it in DOSBox.

01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:56.540
And even to this day, just a few months ago, I was an officiant at my sister's wedding

01:40:56.540 --> 01:41:02.180
and I needed some random government form and I was trying to figure out how to modify this

01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:08.420
the way that I needed and Scribus was one command line install away.

01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:14.660
So I'd say practically, Linux is so easy to get software for and so easy to find software

01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:18.140
that does whatever task you need that day.

01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:20.580
So for me, way practical.

01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:21.580
Cool.

01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:25.420
I think that's an interesting thread in what Swift 110 here is commenting.

01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:28.700
It's interesting how practical is so different.

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:32.900
There's a lot of enterprise cases or if you're a creative type where it's less practical

01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:35.900
because the tools you need are proprietary and expensive.

01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:41.220
But there's a lot of other cases where the ideology of freely available makes for these,

01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:46.220
if you're underprivileged, if you're out of budget for the quarter and you really have

01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:49.700
a problem that you want to get solved, free software is there for you.

01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:50.700
Yeah.

01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:51.700
Yeah, it really is.

01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:53.900
In fact, I'm going to touch on that one.

01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:56.860
I'll share mine here at the end, but I'm glad WW wants to share his.

01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:57.860
Go ahead, WW.

01:41:57.860 --> 01:41:58.860
What's yours?

01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:07.180
So I started back in Red Hat 5.1 in 96, 97.

01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:08.700
I didn't have LUNTS back then.

01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:10.740
I lived in the desert.

01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:17.740
So I was lucky enough to have friends that were into Linux and into ham radios.

01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:23.120
And you can walk into a software, et cetera, and buy Mandrake Linux or whatever.

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:29.020
Or if you weren't lucky enough, you can have an independent ISP and order Linux online

01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:30.480
and get it.

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:33.260
And so I think I should have been on it longer.

01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:39.140
I should have been on it before, since Windows 3.1, because I always like to dig into the

01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:44.580
system and figure out how it's running and what it's doing and how to change it or how

01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:45.780
to move it around.

01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:51.540
So for me, practically, it's been something that I've been striving to be more on, even

01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:57.560
though I've been someone that dual boots and still uses Windows for what I really need

01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:59.480
to do.

01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:02.980
It's ultimately where I hope I end up is more on Linux.

01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:07.580
And I'm not sure about the ideological side.

01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:09.940
I like to be more pragmatic.

01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:13.280
So for me, it's more of a practical reason to be on Linux.

01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:19.380
And that makes more sense in the long term than being stuck on a closed system that you

01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:27.040
will never be able to open and openly use a way you believe it should be used.

01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:32.300
So long term for me, I think it's going to be practical.

01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:39.980
Maybe once I get a chance to read more into the ideological stuff, it'll be both for me

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:40.980
right now.

01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:41.980
So more of a practical reason.

01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:46.460
You know, I think what I'm really picking up, and it echoes mine, is sometimes you come

01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:50.740
at it from what feels like a very practical reason, and then you get there and you discover

01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:51.740
the philosophy.

01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:57.740
So I'll tell you, mine really started as a need to solve a limitation of Windows.

01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:02.460
Windows just simply at the time, Windows NT4, was not good enough for the job I needed it

01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:03.460
to do.

01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:05.020
And so I had to find another solution.

01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:07.940
It started very practical.

01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:12.980
I think particularly for me, if you watch the back catalog of the Linux Action Show

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:19.740
with this in mind, you can see where I switch from a pragmatist to more of an idealist.

01:44:19.740 --> 01:44:25.260
And now I'm on Linux simply because I can't stand to use any other platform.

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:28.460
I couldn't imagine having to use Windows as my daily driver.

01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:30.860
I don't know what I would do.

01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:34.980
So you could claim that's practical, but I think really I'm here now for the idealism.

01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:39.700
And I'll tell you, for me, it took a while for it to sink in, mostly because there were

01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:44.740
so many problems I needed to solve, and it didn't really hit me until I started thinking

01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:47.700
about it in the way that affected my own bottom line.

01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:53.380
And then it clicked, and it was really in the sense of my clients kept getting screwed

01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:59.100
over by companies like Microsoft and many other proprietary companies that would just

01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:04.160
extort them for support contracts that were unbelievable and that would change and drop

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:10.140
features at a moment's notice and completely leave them off on this old version that was

01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:15.620
no longer supported for a decade because the next version up completely uplifted their

01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:16.980
workflow.

01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:23.260
And what I discovered over time, both in a sense of software and hardware and in contracts,

01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:27.740
is that vendor lock-in can be paralyzing for a company sometimes.

01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:33.720
And so that was in which the lens that I first looked at the advantages that a core open

01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:39.540
source infrastructure gives you, the kind of visibility into the long-term viability

01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:44.580
or even the emergency eject lever of forking and maintaining it by hiring your own developer.

01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:46.420
It's a really interesting business case for that.

01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:47.820
You get a lot of freedom there.

01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:52.140
It's huge, because I can tell you, you can deploy your infrastructure on this, and worst

01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:57.820
case scenario, if they stop making this thing, you can go hire a developer, and that developer

01:45:57.820 --> 01:46:02.060
can continue the thing because all of the code is completely free and open source.

01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:04.660
And for an enterprise, that's not a crazy proposition.

01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:05.660
No.

01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:07.540
They already have developers, or they can hire one.

01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:08.540
Yes.

01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:12.180
And if it's a core piece of their business that makes them money, they like having that

01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:13.180
flexibility.

01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:16.820
And so it's with that perspective that looking at open source, the way that it would solve

01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:22.180
that problem that I realized, oh, shit, this is the killer feature.

01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:24.200
It's not the great package management.

01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.420
It's not the stability.

01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:26.540
It's not the security.

01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:28.400
It's not the transparency.

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:33.300
It's not all of the incredible minds and diverse opinions that are contributing to this.

01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:40.940
It's this fundamental open license, this GPL, that is the actual killer feature of this

01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:41.940
platform.

01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:47.780
And it took me a while to get there, but now it is based upon that, which I look at everything

01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:49.460
else.

01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:57.300
You can't have a practical Linux desktop experience without that idealism that led to the GPL

01:46:57.300 --> 01:46:58.300
and the GNU stack.

01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:02.780
You can't have the full practical Linux desktop, which is a sensible reason that we're all

01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:03.780
using.

01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:04.780
It wouldn't exist without that.

01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:11.100
And so once I sort of made that sort of transition, that revelation, I realized, oh, I'm actually

01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:13.020
an idealist.

01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:17.180
And when I make decisions based on that, in the long run, those always tend to be the

01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:19.060
ones that pay out.

01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:24.160
And when I make a decision that's not oriented towards that, it tends to screw me eventually.

01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:28.500
And that has bared out in my personal life for stuff I just use myself, and it's bared

01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:31.220
out in my professional life with my clients and whatnot.

01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:35.780
And I'm very, very, very, very, very proud of the fact that I can go back to almost any

01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:40.060
of my clients and any of the Linux and open source solutions that I implemented are still

01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:42.580
maintainable and supportable today.

01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:46.660
And I cannot do that.

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:51.540
It's literally not possible because aging them out is part of the process, and locking

01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:54.500
you into their support path because that's where they make all of their money in the

01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:56.860
enterprise is part of the process.

01:47:56.860 --> 01:48:01.300
And so it took that particular doorway in which I saw it, then it really sort of lit

01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:02.300
up for me.

01:48:02.300 --> 01:48:03.300
But it was very pragmatic.

01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:05.260
It's funny how linked these two are.

01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:08.700
I feel like a lot of people, that pragmatism, especially if you're, I feel like networking

01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:10.900
is a huge part where you're like, I want my internet gateway.

01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:14.340
And I feel like it actually that's a more solid foundation because if you're just in

01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:18.580
it for the idealism, then that idealism is going to last you as long until you want to

01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:21.620
watch something on Netflix or you're going to watch a TV show.

01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:23.260
I mean, where do you draw the line at that point?

01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:29.060
Do you abandon all the proprietary lockdown media altogether?

01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:30.060
That's pretty hard.

01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:31.580
And maybe you do, and maybe that works for you.

01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:35.220
But to me, it seems like that eventually after a certain amount of time, unless you're freaking

01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:37.460
Richard Stallman himself, you're going to give.

01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:39.660
That dam eventually is going to break.

01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:42.520
And then what do you have if all you have is the idealism?

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:47.660
If there's not the pragmatic thing that you're also grounded with, I feel like it's not quite

01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:48.660
as strong as a grip.

01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:50.620
If you can't get anything done, then what's the point?

01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:51.620
Yeah.

01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:52.620
Yeah.

01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:53.620
So it's a fascinating topic.

01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:57.140
And there's a couple, it popped up a couple of times on Reddit in the last couple of days.

01:48:57.140 --> 01:48:58.980
And so we thought we'd ask it here in the show.

01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:01.700
And I'd like to hear your stories to linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:02.700
Please go.

01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:03.700
That's a great forum.

01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:06.420
I always enjoy those Linux desktop discussions.

01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:08.900
I could probably do it every single week.

01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:10.980
I know you guys would get sick of it, so I don't.

01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:11.980
But I freaking love it.

01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:16.980
I just something about like having that conversation with the virtual lug and Wes is super satisfying

01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:17.980
for me.

01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:18.980
You know what else is super satisfying?

01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:21.300
Seriously, saving a ton of money on my wireless.

01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:24.260
I can't even believe what people pay.

01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:25.260
Ting is brilliant.

01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:29.400
Linux.ting.com is where you go to get $25 in credit or off a device, and then you only

01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:31.580
pay for what you use with no contract.

01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:33.180
No termination fee.

01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:34.900
They don't block updates.

01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:38.260
They're just simply on a mission to make mobile make more sense.

01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:42.340
They're backed by two cows, so they've been around forever, and it's so great to just

01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:43.340
pay for what you use.

01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:46.500
If you got Wi-Fi at home and work, you're going to be shocked with how much money you

01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:47.500
can save.

01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:54.340
And for me, what I love about it is I have a Ting CDMA and a Ting GSM MiFi.

01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:58.700
When I travel, I use whichever one works better, and I just pay a little bit more that month

01:49:58.700 --> 01:49:59.820
for my data usage.

01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:04.380
It's not a big deal because all of the other 10 or 11 months out of the year, I'm not

01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:08.240
traveling, and so it totally works out saving me tons of money.

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:11.060
You can find out more by clicking on the Ting Savings Calculator.

01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:14.620
One of the other things I really love about Ting, and with the holidays coming up, you're

01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:19.220
gifting cellular service, you get a $9 Ting GSM SIM, and you want to put it in the stocking.

01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:20.220
I'm serious.

01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:21.220
Why not?

01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:22.220
$9 SIM cards?

01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:26.020
Yeah, it's really, with no contract nor the termination fee, just pay for what you use.

01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:28.420
That's seriously awesome, but you're giving away to friends and family.

01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:29.540
You don't want to have to play tech support.

01:50:29.540 --> 01:50:30.860
Well, you don't have to worry about it.

01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:32.840
Ting has crazy great customer service.

01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:35.980
They have real human beings that sit on the phone and work with you.

01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:36.980
Calling Ting.

01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:37.980
This is Isabelle speaking.

01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:38.980
How can I help you?

01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:39.980
Hello?

01:50:39.980 --> 01:50:43.220
Thanks for calling Ting.

01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:45.220
This is Isabelle speaking.

01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:50.980
Hey, this is Isabelle at Ting.

01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:54.340
People never believe it's a real person, but it is, and I think that's really kind of a

01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:56.180
cool service that Ting offers.

01:50:56.180 --> 01:51:00.380
They have great prices, unbelievably cheap devices, all the way up to the Cadillacs or

01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:01.380
just the SIM.

01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:06.100
You just get started by going to linux.ting.com, and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the

01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:11.180
Unplugged program now for the whole year, linux.ting.com.

01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:14.520
Now there's a big moment for me personally in Linux Unplugged this year.

01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:19.760
That's when I gave Wes a challenge to get Arch Linux working on my 2013 MacBook Pro

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:21.980
Retina by the end of the show.

01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:27.260
I was super skeptical, because in the past, MacBooks have been such a headache.

01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:29.660
Well, Wes was up for that challenge.

01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:34.460
So the question is going to be coming in pretty soon, because rumors have it that your friends

01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:37.140
in Cupertino will be releasing a new MacBook soon.

01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:39.260
Hey, oh, it's been about time.

01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:41.820
Jeez, it is ridiculous.

01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:43.620
And you know what's going to happen.

01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:48.820
The current models, which are still perfectly usable, will go up on eBay, and people can

01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:51.460
buy them for a reduced price.

01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:54.420
And we have a pretty common question that comes into the show.

01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:56.220
How do you install Linux on the MacBook?

01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:57.220
Does it work?

01:51:57.220 --> 01:51:58.220
What should I know about?

01:51:58.220 --> 01:52:01.020
And is it worth the amount of effort that might be required?

01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:02.540
Have you ever done this before?

01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:07.740
You know, I have, but it's been, oh boy, probably three years at least.

01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:08.740
So this week...

01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:09.740
Actually, I was installing Debian.

01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:10.740
Really?

01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:11.740
Yeah.

01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:12.740
Great.

01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:16.540
I'm going to see if by the end of the show, Wes can get Arch Linux, or maybe Fedora Linux,

01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:18.700
we'll see, running on a MacBook.

01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:21.500
It's like a late 2013 model, I think.

01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:24.300
And we'll kind of give you a report of what it's like to try it.

01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:28.180
If he can get the dedicated graphics working, the wireless working, and we'll give you a

01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:29.180
review.

01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:31.540
So that way, some people out there, they just want that hardware.

01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:33.860
This is an old production rig that we have that's like, it's good.

01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:37.380
I'd like to see if you could leave macOS on there, because I think a lot of people are

01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:38.580
going to want to do that.

01:52:38.580 --> 01:52:42.180
Based on the emails we've received, people want to do a boot, and I can understand that.

01:52:42.180 --> 01:52:43.180
Yeah, absolutely.

01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:44.180
And if you want to do firmware updates...

01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:51.100
Wes, I officially am handing you this Linux-unplugged branded thumb drive, which contains the latest

01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:54.220
official released Antigros image from last month.

01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:55.220
Sure, it's signed with the JBSign.

01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:56.220
Oh, yeah.

01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:57.220
Oh, yeah, I checked it for sure.

01:52:57.220 --> 01:52:58.220
Oh, yeah, for sure.

01:52:58.220 --> 01:52:59.220
Absolutely.

01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:00.220
So there you go, Wes.

01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:01.220
Good luck to you.

01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:02.220
Oh, thank you, sir.

01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:03.220
There is a...

01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:04.460
It is already partitioned into two separate...

01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:09.420
Well, there's the OS X partition, because I've played with Linux on there before, is

01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:10.740
like already shrunk down.

01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:11.860
And so there is like a...

01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:14.980
There's like right now, I just made it like fat or something for you that you can mess

01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:15.980
around with.

01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:17.060
So there you go, Wes.

01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:20.340
The challenge is officially launched.

01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:26.420
I wanted to mention something that I think was well said, and it started a conversation

01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:29.500
that I think probably wasn't necessary.

01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:35.020
But I wanted to give a shout out to Ninja Aaron, who 23 hours ago created a Linux action

01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:38.820
show subreddit post saying a quick comment about the ButterFS coverage on the latest

01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:40.220
Linux action show.

01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:46.220
And that's where we discussed the fact that the official ButterFS project Twitter account

01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:48.740
recommended people use ZFS or ZFS.

01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:49.740
That's pretty wild.

01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:50.740
That was wild.

01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:53.180
And our story was really about the reaction to that.

01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:54.860
But you know, he makes a great point.

01:53:54.860 --> 01:54:00.940
He says that ButterFS is definitely having its issues, but he makes a couple of good

01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:03.620
use case for ButterFS in this post.

01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:10.340
And I guess I did want to mention like, I'm not necessarily opposed to the idea of people

01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:14.940
that want to use ButterFS on their laptop that has an SSD drive.

01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:20.980
I don't really think ButterFS is like the devil file system.

01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:28.020
Really where I have an issue with the ButterFS advocacy, it really comes down to when people

01:54:28.020 --> 01:54:32.060
try to advocate that it should be used in a business slash enterprise setting, however

01:54:32.060 --> 01:54:36.220
you want to describe that.

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:41.300
I started in IT in the year 2000, about 99.

01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:44.700
Well actually really, actually that's not true, 97 was when I actually officially got

01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:51.020
paid in IT when I was at that time desktop tech support.

01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:54.980
But one of the things that I had two – there was – I had two challenges over my career

01:54:54.980 --> 01:55:00.540
that were very much about data retention and then I had many challenges beyond that.

01:55:00.540 --> 01:55:06.260
But there were some that were very particular legally mandated, very, very, very carefully

01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:10.980
audited use cases that I can't even really go into.

01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:16.900
And in these scenarios, you know, back then we used very, very cutting edge file systems

01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:22.620
that were very risky, mostly because that was all that was available at the time.

01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:27.860
And so it's not that I'm also like some holier than thou soapboxer who says, oh you should

01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:29.700
never use ButterFS because you're a lunatic.

01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:33.300
I mean I've been the guy that's been putting in a file system that's a little edgy in

01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:34.300
production.

01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:35.660
I have on a lot of my systems.

01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:43.060
But there is sort of – I guess there is sort of this – it feels to me like there

01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:47.540
is this failure to look within a bit to sort of self-analyze and say we've made a mistake

01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:48.540
here.

01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:51.900
And so I wanted to acknowledge that while I have been sort of anti-ButterFS in the last

01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:56.180
few weeks as there's been more flaws, I also think there's many useful use cases

01:55:56.180 --> 01:56:01.820
for it and I wanted to give a shout out to Mr. Ninja Aaron for kind of very well stating

01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:06.860
that case and making me reflect on it a bit and go, you know, I myself if I – actually

01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:10.460
for this MacBook here, I would absolutely consider ButterFS on there.

01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:12.460
You should have said that like two minutes ago.

01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:16.860
You're getting the XT4 just because I figured you wouldn't mind if it was safe and solid.

01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:17.860
I don't mind.

01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:18.860
So you're actually that far, huh?

01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:19.860
It's installing right now.

01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:22.500
So then in order for you to be that far, that means you've got wireless working.

01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:23.500
Oh yeah.

01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:24.500
Ah.

01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:27.780
Now that wireless fix, this is one of the interesting things, that wireless fix will

01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:31.580
not persist once you reboot into the main OS after it's been installed.

01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:35.940
No, but maybe I'll be smart enough to root into and install that preemptively.

01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:36.940
Thank you for the reminder.

01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:37.940
Damn it.

01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:44.180
You know, Wes, I'm actually pretty impressed that you got the Wi-Fi working without any

01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:45.640
other connectivity.

01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:47.220
So what did you do?

01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:48.220
What did you do?

01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:51.820
Because this is going to be – the number one challenge is these MacBooks, any recent

01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:55.700
MacBook doesn't have an Ethernet port and everybody that's going to be doing this

01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:58.020
is going to run into this problem where they're not going to have Wi-Fi when they get in a

01:56:58.020 --> 01:56:59.020
live environment.

01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:01.980
What did you do to enable networking without having a connection?

01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:06.380
Well I had conveniently – we're installing Antigros here and I had an Arch Linux little

01:57:06.380 --> 01:57:07.660
laptop right here.

01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:14.580
So I just ran make package, built the package, copied it on a USB drive, installed it, mod

01:57:14.580 --> 01:57:17.820
probed the BroadCam drivers and away we went.

01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:18.820
Well played, sir.

01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:19.820
Which I was very pleased.

01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:20.820
Everything worked perfectly.

01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:21.820
Well played.

01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:22.820
Network manager picked it right up.

01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:24.100
We were on the network.

01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:25.100
Damn.

01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:28.020
And also I'm impressed that you remembered the Wi-Fi password too.

01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:31.220
Because I didn't tell you what that was and you still – good job.

01:57:31.220 --> 01:57:34.740
Anybody have thoughts on ButterFS in the mumble room before we move on to just a quick shout

01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:35.740
out I have?

01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:39.460
I'll just say I'm excited for BcashFS.

01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:42.420
We'll see when that's actually usable.

01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:46.020
Is that a B-tree kind of like RAM based?

01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:47.020
Yeah.

01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:48.020
I'd second that.

01:57:48.020 --> 01:57:49.020
Yeah.

01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:50.020
Okay.

01:57:50.020 --> 01:57:51.020
All right.

01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:52.020
Tease me a little bit.

01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:53.020
Let's see.

01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:54.020
There's actually a Patreon for it.

01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:55.020
Are you serious?

01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:56.020
Wimpy, why are you looking forward to it?

01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:57.020
Let's throw it right there.

01:57:57.020 --> 01:57:58.020
Oh my god.

01:57:58.020 --> 01:57:59.020
Okay.

01:57:59.020 --> 01:58:00.020
Maybe that'll explain it better than I could probably.

01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:11.940
Bcash is something that I've used to accelerate spinning drives by putting a Bcash partition

01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:20.140
on solid state to effectively create sort of a level two cache.

01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:21.140
This is great.

01:58:21.140 --> 01:58:26.100
And the authors behind Bcash realized that they were very close to actually having a

01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:28.380
full block file system.

01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:34.020
So they're going the next step to implement it as a copy on write file system.

01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:35.340
They only have 38 patrons.

01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:38.820
I feel like maybe we could bump that up a little bit for them.

01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:44.060
So it's going to be a copyright on write file system like ZFS or ButterFS.

01:58:44.060 --> 01:58:45.300
They aim for good performance.

01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:49.300
They say significantly better than existing copy on write file systems comparable to the

01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:51.340
performance of Extended4 or XFS.

01:58:51.340 --> 01:58:52.340
Hello.

01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:53.340
We really need this.

01:58:53.340 --> 01:58:54.340
Oh wow.

01:58:54.340 --> 01:58:59.660
Metadata and data checks on multiple devices including replication and other types of RAID,

01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:03.620
caching, compression, encryption, snapshots, and scalable.

01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:07.320
It's been tested up to 50 terabytes and will eventually scale higher.

01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:12.260
Already working on stable with a small community of users.

01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:14.700
This is super exciting.

01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:18.420
And what I really like about it is, and this is where I was trying to get to in the conversation

01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:23.100
on Sunday but I think I went off track, is ButterFS, when you look at the model, almost

01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:29.340
seems like this funding model makes a lot of sense.

01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:34.380
It's just they would need way more support because it really is a full-time job.

01:59:34.380 --> 01:59:40.300
It is a lot of work to do this properly and this is great.

01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:44.700
So Bcash, I'll put a link to the Patreon in the show notes so that could be really cool.

01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:46.340
I'll check it out more after the show.

01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:49.100
Okay Wes, I heard you rebooting during that spot.

01:59:49.100 --> 01:59:50.100
I heard you.

01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:52.100
How's it going over there?

01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:53.100
It's installed.

01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:55.100
Now we're working on getting it to show up in the bootloader.

01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:56.100
Do you have a preference?

01:59:56.100 --> 01:59:57.100
Do you want Refind?

01:59:57.100 --> 01:59:58.100
Do you not?

01:59:58.100 --> 01:59:59.100
I don't know.

01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:01.140
I don't know what's the difference.

02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:02.140
This is all new to me.

02:00:02.140 --> 02:00:05.580
I mean you can get it to work with the native EFI bootloader.

02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:06.580
That seems good.

02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:10.620
Okay, but you can also install Refind which is kind of just a nice, better bootloader.

02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:15.020
What would make it easier to get the NVIDIA graphics working because that's part of this.

02:00:15.020 --> 02:00:16.020
That's a good question.

02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:19.260
Because I think that's like a kernel boot parameter because otherwise I think it uses

02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:21.860
the Intel graphics by default.

02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:26.620
So I want to talk about why this is happening because this is some crazy bull crap.

02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:33.260
I mean actually I will be, in full disclosure, I will be honest with you.

02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:38.220
The number one question we have ever gotten into the Linux Action Show and Linux Unplugged

02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:44.700
and I am literally talking since episode one over a decade ago of Linux Action Show, the

02:00:44.700 --> 02:00:50.220
number one question we have gotten is how do I get Linux working on a Macbook?

02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:55.500
And we answer it from time to time but we never really fully go into it and it's one

02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:59.860
of these things that we're simply sick and tired of getting the question asked and so

02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:02.040
we just don't address it a lot.

02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:10.620
And I was, I've been using the Entraware Apollo as my daily driver at home pretty much since

02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:13.780
my review and absolutely loving it.

02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:19.980
And it is light, the battery lasts for hours, it's small enough that I can carry it and

02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:23.260
just bring it to work when I need it and not have to worry about bringing the power adapter

02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:31.340
and it is a very nice machine and I have all my stickers all over it, I really enjoy it.

02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:38.220
But then No Man's Sky came out and that damn game, I can't help but love it and it requires

02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:46.260
OpenGL 4.5 support and SSE 4 I think and basically dedicated graphics and that's where the Macbook

02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:47.260
came in.

02:01:47.260 --> 02:01:51.980
And then I connected with, okay, so I sort of visualized myself as an audience member.

02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:57.180
I've either bought a used Macbook, I've inherited a Macbook or I'm sick and tired of Mac OS

02:01:57.180 --> 02:02:00.780
and Apple is not getting around to updating this thing.

02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:03.980
And one of the things that I know from previous testing experience is that Linux runs a hell

02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:06.460
of a lot faster on the Macbook than OS X does.

02:02:06.460 --> 02:02:12.300
So the fact that this is a 2013 is going to feel, it's going to feel, I estimate under

02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:14.580
Linux it's probably going to feel like a brand new machine, like it's probably going to feel

02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:18.220
very fast, I mean it's got the PCI SSD in there, it's got dedicated 7.

02:02:18.220 --> 02:02:21.980
I thought about using F2FS or whatever.

02:02:21.980 --> 02:02:28.820
It's got dedicated Nvidia graphics, it's got a wonderful retina screen on it, it's a pretty

02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:29.820
nice laptop.

02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:30.820
Yeah, it is a nice laptop.

02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:32.980
And people generally accept that the Macbook is built well.

02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:37.900
So the question has always been how reasonable would Linux be on the Macbook because my intention

02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:42.380
is, and I know this sounds ridiculous, is to then install Wine and then install No Man's

02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:43.380
Sky.

02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:48.260
But eventually I plan to also put OBS on there and do some broadcasting from it because it

02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:49.780
does have a four core processor as well.

02:02:49.780 --> 02:02:51.660
Oh sure, yeah, that would work well.

02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:57.740
So that was sort of the impetus for myself to want to try Linux on the Macbook.

02:02:57.740 --> 02:03:01.300
And then that sort of sent us down the path of trying to figure out, well what do you

02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:02.940
need to know before you put Linux on a Macbook?

02:03:02.940 --> 02:03:06.460
And it definitely seems to be one of the things you have to get your head around is what model

02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:08.060
of Macbook do you have?

02:03:08.060 --> 02:03:13.620
And this is somewhat not obvious since Apple just calls everything Macbook.

02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:17.420
And if you have Mac OS on your system, you can actually entertain this by going into

02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:18.420
the About Mac system.

02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:21.300
And I have a screenshot of this in the show notes.

02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:25.380
You go in there and it'll tell you it's a late model something something.

02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:31.500
You Google Macbook Pro late model 2013 and it will tell you the specific model number.

02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:34.020
It's 11 comma two or something like that, right Wes?

02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:35.180
Yes, I believe so.

02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:38.020
Yeah, and there's like other ones, like older ones are like, you know, different.

02:03:38.020 --> 02:03:42.140
So it's a major model number comma minor model revision.

02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:47.020
And you can find like arch wiki entries, which for mine I've linked in the show notes, that

02:03:47.020 --> 02:03:52.020
specifically tell you about the little kind of esoteric tweaks you have to make to make

02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:54.620
it work on your particular Macbook model.

02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:59.980
And as I look at this, I think this could be a really great Linux box if all of this

02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:01.180
works out.

02:04:01.180 --> 02:04:03.500
So I'm kind of really interested to see where it goes.

02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:07.840
I'll try the Thunderbolt out and then I can report back to the audience on some of my

02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:09.940
adventures with it.

02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:13.380
I also was kind of wondering, I was kind of wanting to pick Wimpy's brain and ask him

02:04:13.380 --> 02:04:17.940
if he hears many people in the Ubuntu Mate community that are running it on the Macbooks.

02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:21.340
Because that also crossed my mind as a possible distro if we couldn't get Arch working.

02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:31.140
Yeah, it does crop up from time to time, mostly in discussions in the Ubuntu Mate community.

02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:35.580
And if it's something that you're interested in doing, then that is the place to first

02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:42.540
search because it's a discourse so you can find the right discussions easily.

02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:47.920
And if your model hasn't been discussed, then start a new thread and there are a few people

02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:52.100
in there that can assist you with that.

02:04:52.100 --> 02:04:55.220
It doesn't come up a lot.

02:04:55.220 --> 02:04:58.140
It comes up a bit, but not loads.

02:04:58.140 --> 02:05:03.700
It's certainly not a major platform I'm seeing people use Ubuntu Mate on.

02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:04.700
Good.

02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:08.340
At this point, I don't know if I feel like recommending it, although maybe I'll feel

02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:10.140
differently after we try this.

02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:15.680
I do see it as like, a couple of things have changed recently.

02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:21.740
First of all, based on some of my reading, the roadblocks of getting the wireless working,

02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:25.380
the Broadcom wireless, have been significantly reduced.

02:05:25.380 --> 02:05:30.340
But the big change, which is in the more recent kernels, been around for a little while now,

02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:36.740
but it depends on your distro, there is built-in kernel-level support with the Synaptics driver

02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:40.780
for the MacBook trackpad or whatever you want to call it.

02:05:40.780 --> 02:05:44.380
And that was something that used to be a sticking point on my particular model.

02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:47.260
Have you had to do anything to get the trackpad working or has it been working?

02:05:47.260 --> 02:05:48.820
No, it's just been working.

02:05:48.820 --> 02:05:53.060
It's not quite as nice as the default one, but I've got scrolling, I've been impressed

02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:57.340
with the media keys have working even in the live media.

02:05:57.340 --> 02:05:58.340
What about the...

02:05:58.340 --> 02:06:01.140
I can see the high DPI support in GNOME working nicely.

02:06:01.140 --> 02:06:02.140
Really?

02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:06.020
You can see the tiny text on the console boot up and then once you've got to the login screen.

02:06:06.020 --> 02:06:07.020
Really?

02:06:07.020 --> 02:06:08.020
Did GNOME just automatically go high DPI mode?

02:06:08.020 --> 02:06:09.020
Yeah.

02:06:09.020 --> 02:06:10.020
No way.

02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:11.020
Really?

02:06:11.020 --> 02:06:12.020
Yeah.

02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:13.020
At least in the integration.

02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:16.820
Now, what about the keyboard backlight?

02:06:16.820 --> 02:06:17.820
That's a great question.

02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:18.820
Is that working?

02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:19.820
Can you turn that on?

02:06:19.820 --> 02:06:20.820
Oh, yeah.

02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:23.260
And it even has the scrollable GNOME menu.

02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:24.260
Shut up.

02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:25.260
Shut up.

02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:26.260
Really?

02:06:26.260 --> 02:06:27.260
Yeah.

02:06:27.260 --> 02:06:28.260
Wow.

02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:29.260
That's actually pretty...

02:06:29.260 --> 02:06:30.260
Look at GNOME kicking ass on that thing.

02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:36.180
So are you in the live media right now or are you in the installed OS?

02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:37.820
Well now I'm in the installed OS.

02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:39.900
Actually I have to review how it actually got here.

02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:44.540
I was just kind of troubleshooting that, but I rebooted again and I expected it to go into

02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:48.260
Mac OS X, but it went right into yours.

02:06:48.260 --> 02:06:51.140
This is really going to be nice to be able to play No Man's Sky at home if you get this

02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:52.140
working with.

02:06:52.140 --> 02:06:53.140
I'm pretty excited.

02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:54.140
All right.

02:06:54.140 --> 02:06:55.140
So where are you at with that thing?

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:56.140
I've got it booting.

02:06:56.140 --> 02:07:02.820
I'm making sure the bootloader is actually working and getting the Wi-Fi back up.

02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:03.820
Nice.

02:07:03.820 --> 02:07:04.820
All right.

02:07:04.820 --> 02:07:05.820
Let's go...

02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:06.820
We'll see about that.

02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:07.820
Proprietary driver.

02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:08.820
JB titles.

02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:09.820
JB titles.

02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:12.580
So this is a MacBook with an NVIDIA chip in it.

02:07:12.580 --> 02:07:13.580
Yes.

02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:14.580
Yeah.

02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:16.380
I think it's a 750, I think, or a 760.

02:07:16.380 --> 02:07:19.540
And is this a new computer or one that went around?

02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:26.300
It's one that I used back in like before, I think even before I hired Rekai for editing.

02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:28.620
And then once Rekai came on board, he had...

02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:29.620
750M.

02:07:29.620 --> 02:07:30.620
Okay, 750M.

02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:34.980
He got the dedicated Mac and then this sort of became like every time I wanted to do a

02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:38.780
comprehensive video editing project, this was my machine I would go to and still do

02:07:38.780 --> 02:07:42.620
to some degree, but I've been transitioning to Cadian Live more and more.

02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:47.080
So I've had this sitting around and it's a late 2013 model that...

02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:50.860
And I actually think with an old MacBook, you have a better success rate with a slightly

02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:54.220
older model, which is kind of bears out why I think you'll probably see more of these

02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:58.140
showing up on eBay when the new model comes out because it's literally been too long.

02:07:58.140 --> 02:07:59.380
And so they'll probably...

02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:04.140
People throw their old models on eBay and you might have Linux users who want a particular

02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:08.940
build quality of a machine grabbing these and snapping these up perhaps.

02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:12.020
So this is a Pro 15 or some description, is it?

02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:13.020
Yes.

02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:14.020
Yeah.

02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:22.820
It's a late 2013 MacBook Retina 15-inch with the 750M and the one terabyte SSD, PCI SSD

02:08:22.820 --> 02:08:26.220
and 16 gigabytes of RAM.

02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:28.300
And Wes, did you decide on a bootloader?

02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:32.460
Well, right now it's just using the built-in EFI.

02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:34.920
So like when you hold down the option key or whatever it is?

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:36.460
That's what I'm working on confirming for you.

02:08:36.460 --> 02:08:37.460
Interesting.

02:08:37.460 --> 02:08:41.820
But we might just install Refind anyway because it's awesome.

02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:47.660
It would be interesting to compare battery life between the systems, you know, TLP installed

02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:48.660
and all that.

02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:54.300
It would really interest me because they say Linux is not well optimized for these kind

02:08:54.300 --> 02:08:55.300
of computers.

02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:58.820
Well, to be fair, the cards are definitely stacked against Linux.

02:08:58.820 --> 02:09:05.180
However, I was reading the Arch Wiki and it appears that LM Sensors now has some support.

02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:10.700
But see, honestly, the core issue why I've never really been super compelled to do this

02:09:10.700 --> 02:09:12.720
is the way Macs are built.

02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:18.140
They are Intel machines, absolutely, but they use a completely different power management

02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:22.540
and cooling management architecture than a standard desktop PC.

02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:26.740
And honestly, if I were Apple, I would too because ACPI and all of that is just total

02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:27.740
shit.

02:09:27.740 --> 02:09:30.340
So what Apple did is they created the SMC controller.

02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:35.500
And the SMC controller is both hardware and software and the software component is only

02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:37.920
available in Mac OS X.

02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:41.900
There's no open source equivalent to it because Apple holds all of the information.

02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:48.620
And the SMC controller is used by Mac OS X to escalate the fans with CPU usage.

02:09:48.620 --> 02:09:55.260
So the OS is constantly monitoring the demands and predicted demands, the predicted demands

02:09:55.260 --> 02:10:00.600
if you can even believe that, of the OS workload based on your average workload and it preemptively

02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:06.060
throttles the thermal management of the Mac based on whatever metrics that Apple has come

02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:07.700
up with with their black magic.

02:10:07.700 --> 02:10:11.860
And there's just literally no way to translate that to Linux or Windows.

02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:15.820
It's the same problem for boot camp users who decide to run Windows 7 to 10 on their

02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:17.800
Mac hardware.

02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:19.740
They have the same exact issue.

02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:24.980
And in the past, what I had done is I got a program called SMC control.

02:10:24.980 --> 02:10:27.720
And SMC control is a Mac OS program.

02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:33.700
What you do is you can use SMC control to hard set your fans to a certain RPM.

02:10:33.700 --> 02:10:38.080
So that way at least there's some thermal cooling because otherwise what happens is

02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:44.780
without the SMC controller kicking in via software ignition, then the thermal limits

02:10:44.780 --> 02:10:47.540
of the actual hardware are what dictate the fan usage.

02:10:47.540 --> 02:10:48.540
Yeah, it's not what you want.

02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:49.540
No.

02:10:49.540 --> 02:10:53.180
So when you actually get to the full thermal limits of the Intel i7 processor, that's when

02:10:53.180 --> 02:10:54.240
the fans cool.

02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:58.020
When you get to the thermal limits of the GPU, that's when the fans kick on.

02:10:58.020 --> 02:11:04.860
So by using SMC controller in Mac OS X, I could set the fans at a steady 5500 RPM or

02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:09.140
4000 RPM depending on my workload and then restart in the Linux.

02:11:09.140 --> 02:11:13.300
If you shut down, then the SMC controller reset.

02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:17.620
And so if I booted from a cold boot right into Linux, I have no fan control.

02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:22.560
But if I would first boot into Mac OS and then use SMC control, which is a third-party

02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:26.580
utility that only supports most Macs, and then use that to set the fan and then reboot

02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:30.100
from that into Linux, I could have proper thermal management.

02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:33.980
So one of the things that appears to have changed since I had to do that rigamarole

02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:40.860
was LM Sensors appears to have some capacity to control the thermals on the MacBook now.

02:11:40.860 --> 02:11:46.060
And so that could make a significant difference in battery life and it's absolutely an area

02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:50.060
I'm going to test versus Mac OS, whatever the current release is.

02:11:50.060 --> 02:12:00.900
I was just looking on eBay in the UK at that spec and they still sell used for around £1,200

02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:01.900
which is about $1,500.

02:12:01.900 --> 02:12:02.900
Isn't it amazing?

02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:08.260
See, I think Apple has always managed to have super good resell because they only at best

02:12:08.260 --> 02:12:10.420
release a model a year it seems.

02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:22.420
So by their apparent nonchalant attitude towards their Mac hardware customers, they have created

02:12:22.420 --> 02:12:29.460
a very robust aftermarket value for the MacBook.

02:12:29.460 --> 02:12:33.540
But every time a new one comes out, everything shifts down a bracket.

02:12:33.540 --> 02:12:38.540
So I believe this MacBook will probably shift down to about $800 once the new MacBook comes

02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:40.060
out in September.

02:12:40.060 --> 02:12:42.300
And this, a Core i7...

02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:45.980
So is that still a current model even though it's been around for a few years?

02:12:45.980 --> 02:12:46.980
No, no, no, no.

02:12:46.980 --> 02:12:51.780
But because the current model will shift down a price range and because this is a model

02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:56.700
or two below the current model, this is going to come down significantly to about $800.

02:12:56.700 --> 02:12:57.700
That's my estimation.

02:12:57.700 --> 02:13:00.640
I could be totally wrong but that seems to be the history is because this is like two

02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:06.300
models or three models behind, this is going to be the real bottom basement, like still

02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:13.180
get an i7, still get Thunderbolt, still get Retina, still get PCIe storage, but under

02:13:13.180 --> 02:13:14.180
$1,000 easily.

02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:17.220
I believe that will be the price of this machine.

02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:21.260
And at that price range, it almost becomes reasonable to experiment with Linux on it

02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:22.980
and just see, well, what the hell?

02:13:22.980 --> 02:13:28.500
Because it's a $600 to $800 MacBook depending on spec and at the end of the day, if it doesn't

02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:31.140
work, I could just do Mac OS X with Linux and VMware.

02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:33.860
And so I think you're going to have a lot of Linux users that will pick this thing up

02:13:33.860 --> 02:13:38.660
because the cult of hardware worship around the MacBook, they'll pick this thing up, they'll

02:13:38.660 --> 02:13:39.660
try putting Linux on it.

02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:42.900
And so I was like, this is probably something that I'm going to get a whole new wave of

02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:43.900
V-mails about.

02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:47.020
I'm kind of preemptively guessing that.

02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:48.540
I'm still rocking Arch on the MacBook.

02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:52.380
I'm dual booting Final Cut OS and Arch and I'm keeping it up to date every single week.

02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:53.580
I love it.

02:13:53.580 --> 02:13:58.100
Now let's stop right here and reflect on the fact that Vim's birthday gave a moment for

02:13:58.100 --> 02:14:01.340
us nano users to unite.

02:14:01.340 --> 02:14:05.580
Let's celebrate a very important birthday that almost just passed us right by.

02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:06.580
I know, right?

02:14:06.580 --> 02:14:12.260
But we did manage to catch it and it's something that we all can relate to.

02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:18.300
It's at a milestone, the 25th birthday where Vim's car insurance finally goes down in price.

02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:20.540
Happy, happy birthday to Vim.

02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:23.540
This is a rowdy crowd.

02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:26.340
Come on, guys.

02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:27.340
You're in my house.

02:14:27.340 --> 02:14:28.340
Hold on.

02:14:28.340 --> 02:14:29.340
That's right.

02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:34.220
Over 25 years ago, over 25 years ago it was started.

02:14:34.220 --> 02:14:39.220
You see, the problem was is that Bram, he wanted something like Vim for his Amiga.

02:14:39.220 --> 02:14:41.060
He was a big user of VI.

02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:42.060
I'm sorry, I should say VI.

02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:45.220
He wanted something like VI but they didn't have anything like that on the Amiga.

02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:53.740
So in 1991, on November 2nd, he released the first version of VI, Imitation Edition, after

02:14:53.740 --> 02:14:57.340
three years of working on it, the VI Imitation Edition.

02:14:57.340 --> 02:15:02.700
Two years later, with the version 2.0, so the first version took three years, second

02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:08.120
version took two years, two years later, with version 2.0 of Vim, the feature set had exceeded

02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:12.500
that of the original VI or VI.

02:15:12.500 --> 02:15:19.420
And so they changed the acronym from Vim Imitation to Vim Improved.

02:15:19.420 --> 02:15:20.860
Isn't that great?

02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:22.080
That is really cool.

02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:23.500
That is really cool.

02:15:23.500 --> 02:15:27.500
That is, you know, that is a big milestone, 25th birthday.

02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:30.820
And indispensable to, I mean, think about where it's gone and how widely it's deployed

02:15:30.820 --> 02:15:31.820
today.

02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:32.820
Thank God we have Nano.

02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:33.820
I mean, what?

02:15:33.820 --> 02:15:34.820
No.

02:15:34.820 --> 02:15:35.820
Come on.

02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:36.820
And they still don't know how semantic versioning works.

02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:43.380
I used Nano once in a video recently and I've been getting crap about it for two weeks.

02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:44.860
Chris, you used Nano?

02:15:44.860 --> 02:15:47.340
You just got to say it's for the new Linux users.

02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:48.340
You know, you're trying to be friendly.

02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:49.340
What are you doing?

02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:50.340
What are you doing?

02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:53.780
That's where they, I thought you would use VI or Emacs.

02:15:53.780 --> 02:15:57.780
Why are you using Nano?

02:15:57.780 --> 02:15:58.780
I think it's nice.

02:15:58.780 --> 02:15:59.780
What are you doing, man?

02:15:59.780 --> 02:16:00.780
Nano-W, Nano-TACW forever.

02:16:00.780 --> 02:16:01.780
I don't even know what TACW does.

02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:02.780
Enlighten us.

02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:03.780
Oh, man.

02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:12.780
It just supports wide characters without cutting it off.

02:16:12.780 --> 02:16:16.580
So it's like when you've got config files, that's all it does.

02:16:16.580 --> 02:16:22.540
But you know, I just, I actually, if I'm editing the file, I don't know what this is.

02:16:22.540 --> 02:16:25.900
If I'm editing the file, I tend to use Vim because I got like my colors and all that

02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:26.900
kind of stuff.

02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:32.420
But if I'm viewing a file and I don't want to use cat or more or whatever, like if I

02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:37.320
don't want to just like look at the file, I just want to just like for some reason open

02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:39.020
it up but not edit it.

02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:42.220
Like when I'm going to look at a file and I'm going to dig around, but I'm not going

02:16:42.220 --> 02:16:45.500
to use pseudo, I use Nano for some reason.

02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:50.700
And then when I'm going to edit the file with root privileges, I pseudo, VI, then the file.

02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:51.700
Okay.

02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:52.700
Isn't that weird?

02:16:52.700 --> 02:16:53.700
That is weird.

02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:55.100
But I mean, I can see, you know, if it's just something you've learned in your fingers now

02:16:55.100 --> 02:16:56.460
and you just type it, right?

02:16:56.460 --> 02:17:00.780
It's like the one is my viewing editor and one is my editing editor.

02:17:00.780 --> 02:17:03.500
Not sure viewing editor is a consistent idea.

02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:06.180
It's so dumb because I do every now and then when I'm already in there, Nano-W, I'll just

02:17:06.180 --> 02:17:07.180
change that real quick.

02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:08.180
Right.

02:17:08.180 --> 02:17:11.740
And then it's like, I go to save and it's like, you don't have the privilege because

02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:12.740
you're in pseudo.

02:17:12.740 --> 02:17:15.220
And you don't have that Vim trick of using pseudo-T to get out of it, right?

02:17:15.220 --> 02:17:17.460
It's so stupid.

02:17:17.460 --> 02:17:18.460
But it's habit.

02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:23.220
It's habit from a decade ago when I was revolting and I wanted to find a new text editor.

02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:30.220
And I had this boss who was the only other Unix slash Linux guy in the office with me

02:17:30.220 --> 02:17:33.180
and we would prank each other constantly.

02:17:33.180 --> 02:17:38.500
And so I remember like I had replaced Vim like when he would use VI, it would echo like

02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:40.020
Bruce Stinks or something like that on there.

02:17:40.020 --> 02:17:41.740
Bruce is a monkey on the...

02:17:41.740 --> 02:17:46.220
And we did things like we'd set up cron jobs to send system-wide messages on the hour so

02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:49.140
every user logged into the system would see Bruce smells like a monkey and things like

02:17:49.140 --> 02:17:50.140
that.

02:17:50.140 --> 02:17:51.140
We'd mess around with each other.

02:17:51.140 --> 02:17:54.780
And I remember Nano was sort of the prank we would use.

02:17:54.780 --> 02:17:58.060
We'd set up an alias just so things would launch in Nano or whatever.

02:17:58.060 --> 02:17:59.060
There was all these...

02:17:59.060 --> 02:18:02.620
So I think that's where it started and then it just sort of became...

02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:03.620
Because I got pranked.

02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:04.620
I think I just stuck with it.

02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:05.620
And he's just like, well, I'm not gonna let this...

02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:06.620
Screw this.

02:18:06.620 --> 02:18:07.620
I'm not gonna let this defeat me.

02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:08.620
I will use this editor.

02:18:08.620 --> 02:18:09.620
Yeah.

02:18:09.620 --> 02:18:10.620
That's exactly...

02:18:10.620 --> 02:18:11.620
And it is a file editor.

02:18:11.620 --> 02:18:15.060
So here I am years later and I'm getting crap from the internet and it's like, okay, you

02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:16.060
guys don't understand.

02:18:16.060 --> 02:18:19.220
That's how a lot of stories end.

02:18:19.220 --> 02:18:26.620
So I just pasted you a command you can run which shows the most popular 10 commands in

02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:27.620
your Bash history.

02:18:27.620 --> 02:18:28.620
That's awesome.

02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:29.620
Oh, that's a great one.

02:18:29.620 --> 02:18:37.580
And for me, the top five, number one is LS by a factor of two above the next thing I've

02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:39.380
ever run, which is CD.

02:18:39.380 --> 02:18:44.420
Right, so LS and CD and then pseudo, which is not unreasonable on Ubuntu where you don't

02:18:44.420 --> 02:18:45.700
get root account by default.

02:18:45.700 --> 02:18:46.700
Yeah.

02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:49.740
And then the next one is my editor of choice, which I'm not gonna name because I'll just

02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:50.740
get hate.

02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:53.220
And then there's other stuff after that.

02:18:53.220 --> 02:18:57.340
But yeah, LS and CD and pseudo, they seem like reasonable things to have at the top

02:18:57.340 --> 02:18:58.340
of your list.

02:18:58.340 --> 02:19:02.140
So I think you should say, and we can debunk a myth here.

02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:05.660
Well, I'll go first.

02:19:05.660 --> 02:19:07.460
My favorite editor is Nano.

02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:14.420
Were you here earlier in the show where I admitted to getting crap for the last two

02:19:14.420 --> 02:19:16.020
weeks because I use Nano?

02:19:16.020 --> 02:19:23.180
I heard you mention it and I wasn't here to back you up, but I've been using Nano forever.

02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:31.140
This is mostly because the first Unix system I used, Pine was the email client and consequently

02:19:31.140 --> 02:19:35.140
Pico was the editor.

02:19:35.140 --> 02:19:37.180
Nano is a Pico clone.

02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:43.260
So hard coded into my DNA is all the key bindings for Nano.

02:19:43.260 --> 02:19:48.220
I knew there was a reason I liked you, Martin, that must be it.

02:19:48.220 --> 02:19:52.580
All these people that say that Vim and Vi are so powerful and there's all these key

02:19:52.580 --> 02:19:53.580
bindings.

02:19:53.580 --> 02:19:56.420
Well, there's all these key bindings in Nano as well.

02:19:56.420 --> 02:20:00.340
And if you know them, it's just as fast and productive.

02:20:00.340 --> 02:20:01.340
I love you.

02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:02.340
That is amazing.

02:20:02.340 --> 02:20:05.500
I forgot about Pico and that absolutely, and Pine, yes.

02:20:05.500 --> 02:20:06.500
Yes.

02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:08.940
So is it Nano for you too, Popey, that I take it?

02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:09.940
Yep.

02:20:09.940 --> 02:20:10.940
All right.

02:20:10.940 --> 02:20:13.300
Now, JDA, I think I saw that go by.

02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:14.700
You also use Nano.

02:20:14.700 --> 02:20:21.860
Yes, I also use Nano and I'll say as a visually impaired Linux user, yeah, I'm low.

02:20:21.860 --> 02:20:28.460
So it's a lot more user friendly when you're zoomed in to a pretty high degree on a monitor

02:20:28.460 --> 02:20:33.920
than the alternatives out there and just as someone who's tried all the different ones

02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:39.180
and accessibility standpoint, Nano takes the cake and I just wanted to throw my two cents

02:20:39.180 --> 02:20:40.180
in there.

02:20:40.180 --> 02:20:42.420
I can't believe we started this show out with me admitting to all the crap I was getting

02:20:42.420 --> 02:20:44.860
and Ben, you use Nano as well?

02:20:44.860 --> 02:20:45.860
Yeah, man.

02:20:45.860 --> 02:20:46.860
Look at you.

02:20:46.860 --> 02:20:47.860
Nobody stood up.

02:20:47.860 --> 02:20:48.860
Nobody said anything.

02:20:48.860 --> 02:20:49.860
Yes.

02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:50.860
Club Nano.

02:20:50.860 --> 02:20:51.860
There we go.

02:20:51.860 --> 02:20:52.860
A wrong has been righted.

02:20:52.860 --> 02:20:53.860
Wait a minute.

02:20:53.860 --> 02:20:55.460
You see guys, I am visually impaired too.

02:20:55.460 --> 02:20:59.760
I have to wear glasses because I have a stigmatism and light problem and truthfully, I just got

02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:04.940
to use Nano because of my sight and because, you know, I also have autism, so it's kind

02:21:04.940 --> 02:21:07.380
of hard for me to wrap my head around other areas.

02:21:07.380 --> 02:21:08.380
So yeah.

02:21:08.380 --> 02:21:09.380
You don't have to justify it.

02:21:09.380 --> 02:21:10.380
Just embrace it.

02:21:10.380 --> 02:21:11.380
That's right.

02:21:11.380 --> 02:21:12.380
I love the Nano.

02:21:12.380 --> 02:21:13.380
It's fine.

02:21:13.380 --> 02:21:16.140
Here's some funny follow up from that Nano users unite episode.

02:21:16.140 --> 02:21:21.700
Since episode 170 weeks ago, I'm still getting emails and trickle tweets about other Nano

02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:24.600
users who are coming out and their love for Nano.

02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:28.820
We truly have united, which is, I don't know what that is.

02:21:28.820 --> 02:21:29.820
It's funny.

02:21:29.820 --> 02:21:30.820
If nothing else, I guess.

02:21:30.820 --> 02:21:31.820
I don't know.

02:21:31.820 --> 02:21:32.820
I don't.

02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:36.500
It's like I'm not sure we need to now we need to support some sort.

02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:40.100
We need to form like some sort of support group, I guess, right?

02:21:40.100 --> 02:21:41.100
I will.

02:21:41.100 --> 02:21:42.100
That brings us to the end.

02:21:42.100 --> 02:21:47.500
I hope this wasn't your first experience for the unplugged program because this is not

02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:49.140
how this show normally goes.

02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:52.700
I don't normally have a fireplace behind me.

02:21:52.700 --> 02:21:54.500
If you're listening, I have a fireplace behind me.

02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:58.060
I don't normally have presence in the studio.

02:21:58.060 --> 02:22:00.020
We don't normally play clips of our own show.

02:22:00.020 --> 02:22:02.620
It's not really how this show actually coming.

02:22:02.620 --> 02:22:05.540
If this is your first time watching, this might have been the perfect episode because

02:22:05.540 --> 02:22:08.260
you now kind of get an idea feel for what we talk about.

02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:11.180
You can submit contact Linux action show at reddit.com and shared subreddit with Linux

02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:12.180
action show.

02:22:12.180 --> 02:22:15.540
You can go to jupyterbroadcasting.com contact and found out and find out when we're live

02:22:15.540 --> 02:22:16.540
at the calendar page.

02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:17.820
Thanks for being here.

02:22:17.820 --> 02:22:41.900
See you next week and happy holidays.
