WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.240
So let me tell you about the, uh, before we just start, uh, actually maybe I'll save it

00:05.240 --> 00:06.240
for the show.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.240
I'll save it for the show.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.240
That could be how we start the show.

00:08.240 --> 00:27.080
Alright guys, this is Linux Unplugged episode 239 for March 6th, 2018.

00:27.080 --> 00:32.800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's all over the world this week.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.800
My name is Chris.

00:33.800 --> 00:34.800
My name is Wes.

00:34.800 --> 00:35.800
Hello, Wes.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.080
I miss, I miss being in the same studio with you.

00:38.080 --> 00:41.760
You know, I don't, I don't get to watch you, you know, stare at you as you talk in the,

00:41.760 --> 00:42.760
I mean, what?

00:42.760 --> 00:44.920
No, that definitely doesn't happen.

00:44.920 --> 00:48.920
We'll be reunited soon, but it's amazing that this isn't working at all and I'm very glad

00:48.920 --> 00:49.920
to be here.

00:49.920 --> 00:50.920
Yeah, yeah, it is.

00:50.920 --> 00:51.960
And we've got a great show.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.780
So we've got a couple of interesting things that I want to chew on today, like some big

00:54.780 --> 00:55.960
picture stuff.

00:55.960 --> 01:01.000
It does involve Microsoft and other companies and maybe what your company is doing wrong

01:01.000 --> 01:05.160
in open source and how some of these other companies have figured it out, companies that

01:05.160 --> 01:06.160
used to battle it.

01:06.160 --> 01:11.860
Plus, we've got some interesting project updates, some weird things happening with Java Enterprise

01:11.860 --> 01:18.060
and some Ubuntu news, some other things, as well as a few anecdotes from the road, Wes.

01:18.060 --> 01:20.240
So I think it's going to be like a fun one.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.560
It's like the pre-scale storm now.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.040
Yeah, road check, road trip check in.

01:25.040 --> 01:28.800
You know what's great about this is, so this setup right now that we're doing, I'm connected

01:28.800 --> 01:36.280
to you through a microphone, a USB interface, and a box running Chrome.

01:36.280 --> 01:37.880
That's so lean.

01:37.880 --> 01:43.280
It was going to be my XPS 13, but I ended up actually, I'm on the, you remember the

01:43.280 --> 01:44.980
old MacBook that you set up running Arch?

01:44.980 --> 01:45.980
How could I forget?

01:45.980 --> 01:47.800
We've had such a tender relationship.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.040
Yep, yep.

01:49.040 --> 01:54.840
So I've got that in here and so I have that running Chrome and connected to a MiFi and

01:54.840 --> 01:55.840
that's how we talk now.

01:55.840 --> 01:56.840
Well, you sound great.

01:56.840 --> 01:57.840
This is incredible.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.680
It's amazing what we can do in this modern day, and we haven't even turned this thing

02:00.680 --> 02:04.480
up to 11 because we have remote controls into the studio so that way I can do things like

02:04.480 --> 02:06.000
bring in the Mumble Room.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.320
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.320
What's up?

02:09.320 --> 02:10.320
Hello.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.320
Hey, hey.

02:11.320 --> 02:12.320
Woo.

02:12.320 --> 02:13.320
That was amazing.

02:13.320 --> 02:14.320
That was good.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.320
Good job, Mumble Room.

02:15.320 --> 02:16.320
That was really good.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.320
Yeah.

02:17.320 --> 02:18.320
You guys are on point.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.600
You know, Wes, I'm kind of missing out right now.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.840
Levi and Hadir are out exploring Sacramento as I record.

02:23.840 --> 02:24.840
That sounds way better.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.840
Yeah.

02:25.840 --> 02:30.560
Maybe I'll just jump out of the studio, go join them and good luck on your own, Chris.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.080
They're like, well, see you later.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.080
I'm like, what?

02:33.080 --> 02:34.080
And we're going to go explore the capital.

02:34.080 --> 02:39.120
She got an Uber and they're out walking around Sacramento while I'm inside the RV and it

02:39.120 --> 02:41.520
is surrounded by wasps.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.560
Down in California, apparently there's bees already and they're like crawling all over

02:45.560 --> 02:48.840
my mirrors trying to get in while I do this show.

02:48.840 --> 02:49.840
That's my situation.

02:49.840 --> 02:50.840
Oh, okay.

02:50.840 --> 02:51.840
Wow.

02:51.840 --> 02:52.840
Yikes.

02:52.840 --> 02:57.360
I have no choice but to just sit here hunkered down and podcast.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.360
So that's what we'll be doing.

02:58.360 --> 03:01.040
Well, at least you have us to join you in your suffering.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.980
So we're going to start with a couple of big meta topics that I think might come up later

03:03.980 --> 03:05.260
on in the show.

03:05.260 --> 03:08.160
First one doesn't really have anything to do with Linux other than, well, we're going

03:08.160 --> 03:10.320
to get to it in a roundabout way.

03:10.320 --> 03:19.780
Jeff Bezos has spent $42 million building a clock that will run for 10,000 years.

03:19.780 --> 03:22.120
This is part of the Long Now Foundation.

03:22.120 --> 03:28.800
It was created in 1996 in the hopes to provide a counterpoint to today's accelerating culture

03:28.800 --> 03:32.560
and help make long-term thinking more common.

03:32.560 --> 03:38.400
One of its initiatives is the Clock of the Long Now, which is designed to run for 10

03:38.400 --> 03:42.200
millennia without any need for human intervention.

03:42.200 --> 03:47.680
And Bezos took interest in it six years ago and has invested $42 million.

03:47.680 --> 03:52.280
Think about trying to build a system that could last 10 millennia without any human

03:52.280 --> 03:53.280
intervention.

03:53.280 --> 03:54.280
You can do that with Linux, right?

03:54.280 --> 03:55.280
You can do that, Wes?

03:55.280 --> 03:56.280
Come on.

03:56.280 --> 04:00.120
I mean, I certainly wouldn't try to do it with Windows.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.440
I suppose not.

04:01.440 --> 04:08.080
The heart of the clock is a titanium pendulum that beats once every 10 seconds.

04:08.080 --> 04:14.080
Now the falling weight that powers the clock can be wound by hand, but it is otherwise

04:14.080 --> 04:16.680
kept wound by solar power.

04:16.680 --> 04:21.880
It shines into an aperture in the 500-foot deep chamber in which the clock sits.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.000
Oh, that's great.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.400
It then strikes the air-filled cylinder.

04:25.400 --> 04:29.040
The expansion of the cylinder provides enough energy to lift the falling weight slightly

04:29.040 --> 04:33.480
and also provide some correction for solar noon timing.

04:33.480 --> 04:39.240
And one key feature of the clock, and this is kind of weird if you think about it, the

04:39.240 --> 04:46.480
displays are not active until a human enters the clock chamber and fully winds the mechanism.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.480
Interesting.

04:47.480 --> 04:50.600
So it's still keeping time, but it doesn't display time until there's a human there to

04:50.600 --> 04:51.600
observe it.

04:51.600 --> 04:56.360
But yet it's built to last 10 millennia without humans, but if there's no human there to observe

04:56.360 --> 04:58.680
it, it never displays the time.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.840
Just sits there in silence, displaying nothing, keeping time.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.240
That's so weird.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.640
That is so weird.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.560
And he spent $42 million on this.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.560
What do you think?

05:07.560 --> 05:12.720
10 millennia, 42 million, you think that like dollars per millennia is a pretty good deal

05:12.720 --> 05:13.720
for this or no?

05:13.720 --> 05:14.720
Well, actually.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.320
I mean, it kind of does seem like it's a decent deal, doesn't it?

05:17.320 --> 05:19.600
I got to be honest with you, Wes.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.600
It does actually seem pretty legit.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.280
Also, I imagine the people designing this have had a lot of fun.

05:23.280 --> 05:28.400
It seems like a great project, just in that it's weird and kind of interesting.

05:28.400 --> 05:34.080
So it's neat that the, you know, crazy rich can fund one-off projects like this.

05:34.080 --> 05:41.000
Now I know that this isn't going to appeal to you, but some of you out there are on Windows.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.200
Now don't deny it.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.200
I know it's true.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.000
I've seen the download numbers.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.640
A good number of you are on Windows, and it just may be getting a little bit easier to

05:49.640 --> 05:50.640
run Ubuntu.

05:50.640 --> 05:55.160
We talked about this on Linux Action News, and now with only three mouse clicks, once

05:55.160 --> 06:01.040
this is completed, you'll be able to get an Ubuntu VM that offers full clipboard integration,

06:01.040 --> 06:05.680
drive redirection, and enhanced display performance.

06:05.680 --> 06:11.720
Right there, three clicks in the Hyper-V Gallery, boom, Ubuntu 18.04, ready to go.

06:11.720 --> 06:16.040
You know, some of the really cool stuff that they've done, and I don't know a lot about

06:16.040 --> 06:24.400
this, but they've worked with the open source XRDP project to bake in communication to Hyper-V's

06:24.400 --> 06:29.080
communication bus, which there's already like a socket that's been upstream to the Linux

06:29.080 --> 06:31.800
kernel to enable this communication.

06:31.800 --> 06:38.900
So it goes from the kernel socket to the Hyper-V socket, and they talk, well, XRDP to transmit

06:38.900 --> 06:45.000
the graphics, and it makes it a really fast interface and really low latency for the remote

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
graphics of the VM, which are not actually remote, depending on how you're using it.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.480
Anyways, when you combine it with drive integration, clipboard integration, and XRDP integration

06:54.480 --> 07:01.120
over this HVhook or HVsock system, this is going to be a pretty compelling step up from

07:01.120 --> 07:03.840
the Windows subsystem for Linux on a Windows 10 machine.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.520
You know, you're sitting there, you're hacking away on something under the subsystem, ah,

07:07.520 --> 07:08.520
screw this.

07:08.520 --> 07:09.520
What's left?

07:09.520 --> 07:13.480
Well, now three clicks and you have this really hyper-integrated Ubuntu VM.

07:13.480 --> 07:16.400
What do you think about this, Wes?

07:16.400 --> 07:19.720
Is this the death knell for a virtual box on Windows?

07:19.720 --> 07:21.040
Oh, yeah.

07:21.040 --> 07:25.200
Yeah, you know, I was going like, what does this mean for people switching from Windows

07:25.200 --> 07:26.440
to Linux?

07:26.440 --> 07:27.640
My brain's been racing with that.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.200
I hadn't thought about the competitors.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.720
This is like home turf advantage.

07:32.720 --> 07:37.160
I also know a lot of people who haven't yet been able, for enterprise policy reasons or

07:37.160 --> 07:41.260
otherwise been really able to work the subsystem into their workflow, but are already using

07:41.260 --> 07:42.260
virtual machines.

07:42.260 --> 07:45.720
So it seems like this rolling out when it does will have an immediate impact there as

07:45.720 --> 07:46.720
well.

07:46.720 --> 07:49.700
I can also imagine developing, you know, as you're saying in the subsystem, but then still

07:49.700 --> 07:53.520
having a fleet of, you know, development servers running locally in these VMs and be able to

07:53.520 --> 07:54.520
test there.

07:54.520 --> 07:58.000
I almost don't need a Linux laptop, and that's a little scary.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Yeah, yeah.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
I mean, there's two ways to look at it.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, that is scary.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
You're right.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.840
Because it is, it could potentially mean less Linux switchers.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.220
That's definitely a possibility, but there's another way to look at it.

08:10.220 --> 08:12.560
It's possible that now more people will be using Linux.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.960
Yeah, the barrier to entry now is a lot lower.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.240
They get hooked on the good sauce, right?

08:17.240 --> 08:19.760
And they're like, why am I running this in a virtual machine?

08:19.760 --> 08:20.760
First taste.

08:20.760 --> 08:21.760
Yeah, yeah.

08:21.760 --> 08:27.240
Yeah, once they get the first taste for free, right, and then they'll go out and buy.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.240
How insidious.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.240
Yeah, no.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.920
Also, speaking of this kind of stuff, oh, does somebody else have something they want

08:32.920 --> 08:33.920
to add from?

08:33.920 --> 08:39.960
By the way, I think they just added Debian and Kali Linux support in the Windows Store

08:39.960 --> 08:40.960
as well.

08:40.960 --> 08:47.280
Yeah, that's what I was just going to mention is Kali Linux is in there now as part of the

08:47.280 --> 08:49.480
subsystem, I guess.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.680
Or is this part of the Hyper-V stuff?

08:50.680 --> 08:51.680
I don't really know.

08:51.680 --> 08:52.680
It's a subsystem.

08:52.680 --> 08:53.680
Hmm.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.920
And it doesn't have the hacking tools.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.960
Like, you have to install that separately.

08:57.960 --> 09:01.800
So I mean, I'm sure it's pretty easy to do that.

09:01.800 --> 09:14.840
Yeah, well, this is what Kali Linux is one of those tools that, you know, Windows administrators

09:14.840 --> 09:18.800
still end up using because it's just a really good tool to test yourself.

09:18.800 --> 09:22.400
And it has everything and often it often comes with a lot of things pre-configured, perhaps

09:22.400 --> 09:23.400
not in this case.

09:23.400 --> 09:27.480
Yeah, but if it has scripts to set that stuff up, that's probably legit.

09:27.480 --> 09:28.480
Yeah, I could be legit.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.480
I don't know.

09:29.480 --> 09:34.760
I'm not super jazzed up, but yeah, yeah, we're all kind of like, man, man, it's good to see

09:34.760 --> 09:35.760
it.

09:35.760 --> 09:36.760
And it means more users for Kali.

09:36.760 --> 09:41.240
But they probably might just run it in one of those fancy new VMs anyway.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.280
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.280
You could.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.280
You could.

09:45.280 --> 09:51.240
If that XRDP stuff goes upstream, which Microsoft did submit it upstream, and the HV hook stuff

09:51.240 --> 09:55.860
is already upstream and it's integrated into kernel 4.15, then any distro could really

09:55.860 --> 09:57.180
take advantage of that.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.360
So yeah, you're right.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.960
That would probably be a great way to use Kali because then you would have the full

10:00.960 --> 10:01.960
Kali.

10:01.960 --> 10:06.200
I'm just trying to think if there's any network stuff that wouldn't work because of the virtualized

10:06.200 --> 10:07.600
card because that could be a possibility.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.080
You would have to configure that depending on what you're trying to do.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.080
That's for sure.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.080
Yeah.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.080
Yeah.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.080
I don't know, Wes.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.960
You know what the only way to find out would be for you to get a Windows 10 machine and

10:15.960 --> 10:16.960
test it.

10:16.960 --> 10:17.960
I guess you have to.

10:17.960 --> 10:18.960
You're right.

10:18.960 --> 10:19.960
Oh.

10:19.960 --> 10:22.800
You know, I want to take a moment and thank Ting.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.520
Why don't we do that right here?

10:24.520 --> 10:26.640
Go to linux.ting.com.

10:26.640 --> 10:31.880
I was really, really impressed yesterday when I sat down, I compared all the different carriers

10:31.880 --> 10:36.960
that I had with me and the Ting CDMA was the fastest, but more importantly, the lowest

10:36.960 --> 10:37.960
latency.

10:37.960 --> 10:41.760
And sure enough, sure enough, here I am now in Sacramento, same thing.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.840
I would have sworn it would have been the GSM network.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.880
That's what I love about Ting is they have both and I just turn these devices on when

10:46.880 --> 10:49.720
I'm traveling because it's $6 for the line.

10:49.720 --> 10:54.200
And so honestly, if you have a backup line or a data device you need to use occasionally

10:54.200 --> 10:59.800
or a phone that you can just be kind of savvy about using Wi-Fi, well then $6 a month.

10:59.800 --> 11:00.800
That's nothing.

11:00.800 --> 11:01.800
That's nothing.

11:01.800 --> 11:06.460
Linux.ting.com is where you go to get started and you get $25 off a device or if you bring

11:06.460 --> 11:11.560
one that's compatible, just check their BYOD page, they'll give you $25 in service credit.

11:11.560 --> 11:17.680
Now your average Ting bill is going to be around $23 all in, probably before Uncle Sam's

11:17.680 --> 11:18.680
cut.

11:18.680 --> 11:22.120
$23 for your minutes, your messages and your megabytes and the $6 for the line.

11:22.120 --> 11:27.000
So a $25 credit will probably pay for more than your first month because that's how Ting

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
rolls.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Linux.ting.com.

11:29.000 --> 11:35.360
Go there and then check out their blog post about comparing their Wi-Fi, I mean their

11:35.360 --> 11:36.700
internet connection with Wi-Fi.

11:36.700 --> 11:39.200
So their LTE with Wi-Fi and the differences there.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.640
I was super impressed.

11:40.640 --> 11:46.920
I was just talking to Wes on the pre-show, I pulled up, I was getting 22 down, even got

11:46.920 --> 11:50.600
as high as 28 up and I was getting, yeah, I know, it was just nuts.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.240
Those are some numbers.

11:52.240 --> 11:57.520
But the thing was that really rocked is I was getting around 18, 20, 15 millisecond

11:57.520 --> 11:59.960
ping time to the different servers.

11:59.960 --> 12:04.160
And right now where I'm at, I'm getting around 30 milliseconds, which is still really, really

12:04.160 --> 12:05.160
outrageously great.

12:05.160 --> 12:08.240
That puts it in that territory where you start thinking about differently, right?

12:08.240 --> 12:14.400
It's not just this shaky Wi-Fi connection, it's a real first class internet connection.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.080
We can use it for broadcast, which is great.

12:17.080 --> 12:21.360
In fact, I'm thinking about when we get to the next story, I'm tempted to try turning

12:21.360 --> 12:25.120
up the broadcast quality another notch because I haven't turned down right now because I'm

12:25.120 --> 12:29.120
also remote team viewer into machines in the studio.

12:29.120 --> 12:32.520
I'm thinking about just pushing Ting to the limit and turning it up another notch.

12:32.520 --> 12:37.200
I don't even know what the software would do, but damn if it isn't tempting.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.200
So you know what?

12:38.200 --> 12:39.200
I'm going to do it.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.200
Go to linux.ting.com.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.200
One way this is going to work or another.

12:41.200 --> 12:44.240
So I would imagine this is going to disconnect Wes and then reconnect.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.240
Okay, we'll hang tight here.

12:45.240 --> 12:49.920
Finish up, you tell people to go to linux.ting.com and then we can go over to the Ubuntu story,

12:49.920 --> 12:50.920
but I'm going to hit the button.

12:50.920 --> 12:51.920
I'm going to go up another notch.

12:51.920 --> 12:55.920
I don't know, in three, two, Ting save me.

12:55.920 --> 12:56.920
See we can't do it without Ting.

12:56.920 --> 12:57.920
That's it.

12:57.920 --> 12:58.920
Oh really?

12:58.920 --> 12:59.920
Was that it?

12:59.920 --> 13:00.920
That's it.

13:00.920 --> 13:01.920
Wow.

13:01.920 --> 13:02.920
It did it.

13:02.920 --> 13:03.920
Wait.

13:03.920 --> 13:04.920
Oh, I bet you I have to refresh.

13:04.920 --> 13:05.920
I bet you it hasn't kicked in yet until I refresh.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.160
I'm still tempted to try it, Wes.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.160
I know.

13:08.160 --> 13:09.160
All right.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.160
I'm going to hit refresh.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.160
You ready?

13:11.160 --> 13:12.160
Okay.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.160
Wish me luck.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.160
Here I go.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.160
Good luck.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.160
Oh, okay.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.160
Well, there we go.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.560
Now we know it was real.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.640
It's all possible with Ting.

13:19.640 --> 13:24.600
Head on over to linux.ting.com so you can be as impressed and satisfied.

13:24.600 --> 13:28.320
And now we're happy to welcome Mr. Chris Fisher back to the Linux Unplugged program.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.320
That's awesome.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.320
That is great.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.320
That was a lot of fun.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.320
Oh, that was great.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.840
That's like living on the edge.

13:33.840 --> 13:34.840
Talk about adrenaline rush.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.680
Real time doing it live.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.280
Now we're up a whole other notch.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.280
We're at 128 kilobits now.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.280
So I don't know.

13:41.280 --> 13:45.080
Are we going to start talking about the big exciting news that will probably happen just

13:45.080 --> 13:46.560
a little bit after this show?

13:46.560 --> 13:47.560
Jump right in.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.560
Okay.

13:48.560 --> 13:53.280
So I may just take a back seat and actually let Simon jump here in a moment, but as we

13:53.280 --> 14:01.240
record this, if things go as planned, going by the schedule here on the Ubuntu Wiki, we

14:01.240 --> 14:08.600
should see beta 1 for 1804, if not tomorrow, probably the day after or somewhere around

14:08.600 --> 14:09.960
there, March 8th.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.520
And then the Optin flavors as well.

14:11.520 --> 14:15.480
But right before the show started, Simon started telling us about this and I said, wait, wait,

14:15.480 --> 14:16.480
save it for the show.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.640
So Simon, pick back up where you left off.

14:18.640 --> 14:23.940
What's sort of the story that you had to share with the 1804 beta release?

14:23.940 --> 14:30.200
So with the 1804 beta, we just, this is something that we are sort of working on today, actually.

14:30.200 --> 14:34.520
And I've been working with Dustin Krysek, who's also here.

14:34.520 --> 14:41.240
We were just sort of gauging interest because for the first two alphas of this release,

14:41.240 --> 14:45.320
it ended up being bad timing because we had the Spectre and Meltdown stuff that went on.

14:45.320 --> 14:50.040
So they disabled all the Launchpad builders, so we couldn't build anything.

14:50.040 --> 14:56.020
And then after that beta or alpha 2, we also had some other difficulties in it.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.320
This is the first 1804 milestone.

14:59.320 --> 15:03.460
So you're going to see a couple of different things that you would usually see in like

15:03.460 --> 15:04.800
a daily build.

15:04.800 --> 15:10.360
Like just today, for example, we landed a new point release for Qt.

15:10.360 --> 15:14.200
That's something that I was working on specifically, otherwise the flavors that I know of participating

15:14.200 --> 15:19.480
right now in this are Lubuntu, where it's just general bug fix.

15:19.480 --> 15:24.720
Lubuntu Next is also participating in this release, which Lubuntu Next is going to see

15:24.720 --> 15:30.040
a huge overhaul of things with different applications coming in and different theming and that sort

15:30.040 --> 15:31.080
of thing.

15:31.080 --> 15:37.520
Then there's Ubuntu Budgie, Zubuntu is participating, all different sorts of flavors.

15:37.520 --> 15:45.000
But this is really a sort of a community release because the Ubuntu desktop, they don't participate

15:45.000 --> 15:47.260
in any milestone besides the final beta.

15:47.260 --> 15:51.160
So this is a really good time, I think in my opinion, to go and see what's going on

15:51.160 --> 15:58.280
in each of the flavors because this is really the first milestone of the 1804 release.

15:58.280 --> 16:02.720
So it's really, like I said, it's a really good way to see what people have been working

16:02.720 --> 16:04.280
on thus far.

16:04.280 --> 16:08.640
Yeah, and I am tempted to do it.

16:08.640 --> 16:13.320
It's funny, 1804 is sort of like 1710, although not quite as strong because it's not the switch

16:13.320 --> 16:14.320
to know.

16:14.320 --> 16:21.360
But I have a lot of people in my circle of friends and family that I take care of their

16:21.360 --> 16:25.720
computers and they're all kind of due now.

16:25.720 --> 16:31.800
Some of them weren't on 1604, like Dylan, he's on, I think he's on Loki Elementary OS

16:31.800 --> 16:38.800
and Hadia, I think is on the last LTS, before 1604, I can't remember, but she's due for

16:38.800 --> 16:41.940
two of her machines to get replaced.

16:41.940 --> 16:45.600
And my dad has a system, I don't even know if he's using it anymore that I got to contact

16:45.600 --> 16:46.600
him about.

16:46.600 --> 16:50.440
1804 is going to be one that I think a lot of people in my circle are going to end up

16:50.440 --> 16:52.640
using that I maintain their computers for.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.160
People have been waiting, letting things bake.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.160
Yeah, you're right.

16:55.160 --> 17:00.240
It will be kind of how 16 felt like a similar moment in some ways, it will get wide deployment

17:00.240 --> 17:04.320
and suddenly everyone will be on the latest Ubuntu.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.240
Including probably Westpain, huh?

17:06.240 --> 17:08.240
Are you sticking with the plasma?

17:08.240 --> 17:09.240
Including me.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.240
What's going on?

17:10.240 --> 17:11.240
Oh.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.240
Including JJ too.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.240
Yeah.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.240
What's the plasma status?

17:14.240 --> 17:16.040
I so far have stuck with it.

17:16.040 --> 17:20.640
Yes, I have been sticking with it as well.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.880
It's been really smooth.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.920
I think I got enough configuration down.

17:23.920 --> 17:27.240
I know a little bit more about how to tweak the things that I actually care about where

17:27.240 --> 17:30.040
I think I could replicate that pretty quickly on a new install.

17:30.040 --> 17:34.320
I'm actually thinking about paving and doing that just to make sure that I'm right there.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.640
And with that down, I feel a lot more comfortable with it.

17:36.640 --> 17:40.560
Before it was just that, you know, GNOME had defaults that I really liked and worked really

17:40.560 --> 17:41.560
well for me.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.000
Now that I have that on KDE, it's great.

17:45.000 --> 17:54.760
I think the thing that's helped me set up the Neon workstation was I did all KDE Neon,

17:54.760 --> 17:55.760
so it's all the same distro.

17:55.760 --> 17:59.760
It wasn't a mix this time of Ubuntu and Arch, which is what I've done in the past a lot.

17:59.760 --> 18:02.400
That could be more complicated.

18:02.400 --> 18:08.660
And I also just sat down once, and the first time I launched Dolphin, I went through and

18:08.660 --> 18:10.580
changed all of the defaults I don't like.

18:10.580 --> 18:14.880
The first time I logged in, I changed all of the desktop environment settings that I

18:14.880 --> 18:15.880
don't like.

18:15.880 --> 18:21.240
And so I just, each time, just said, OK, there's going to be a slight tax each time.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.640
But then once I've done it once, they stay.

18:23.640 --> 18:28.680
I've gone now for weeks, and I haven't had settings revert, windows reopen where I want

18:28.680 --> 18:29.680
them.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.360
The console stays the same size I had it last time.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.360
I know.

18:32.360 --> 18:35.280
It's so simple, but it's so nice.

18:35.280 --> 18:39.400
And you know, you're sitting down there using AirMaster, and you haven't had to reboot it

18:39.400 --> 18:40.400
before.

18:40.400 --> 18:44.760
You could use it like we were having with Unity 7, which means none of the...

18:44.760 --> 18:48.800
So when you do have to reboot it, say, for an update or something, it's better at remembering

18:48.800 --> 18:51.120
the display output options into the OBS capture.

18:51.120 --> 18:55.080
That is such a tiny thing, but it's like killer for our use case.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.080
Yeah.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.080
Yeah, it really is.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.080
It's one of those nice little things.

18:58.080 --> 19:01.120
So hashtag Rodden was right.

19:01.120 --> 19:05.040
It's a great professional desktop.

19:05.040 --> 19:10.640
And I think if a company came along, even a company like, oh man, I really shouldn't

19:10.640 --> 19:11.640
go down this rabbit hole.

19:11.640 --> 19:18.600
But a company like System76, you know what would make Pop OS 10 times more compelling?

19:18.600 --> 19:21.280
Is if they were doing something that wasn't Gnome.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.460
Because really what people could do is, right?

19:24.460 --> 19:28.520
You could just go get their theme on Gnome, on stock Ubuntu and call it good, and then

19:28.520 --> 19:30.880
you're close to mainline, you're close to what you're running in production, and you

19:30.880 --> 19:32.700
still have their design aesthetics.

19:32.700 --> 19:37.700
But if they were taking their design aesthetics and applying it to the Plasma desktop and

19:37.700 --> 19:43.440
really just sort of getting down those rough edges, man, that would be, I would be a really,

19:43.440 --> 19:44.740
really compelling distro.

19:44.740 --> 19:47.040
And it'd really stand out, you know, be something that's different.

19:47.040 --> 19:50.240
Yeah, you know, there's not a lot of that shipping, and there might be a lot of value

19:50.240 --> 19:54.440
add they could have in just having it really well configured from the start.

19:54.440 --> 19:58.000
Now what do you think, Simon, we don't give enough love to Kubuntu?

19:58.000 --> 20:05.080
Yeah, I think it's going to have a nice release because no, the 1604 really, really wasn't

20:05.080 --> 20:06.640
that good of a release for Kubuntu.

20:06.640 --> 20:13.880
The 1804 is going to be interesting because it's going to be the latest LTS Plasma on

20:13.880 --> 20:20.440
top of the latest LTS cubes, and it's going to be baked in with the LTS Ubuntu.

20:20.440 --> 20:28.400
So while you do have KDE Neon, with them sunsetting the user edition, or the LTS edition, it might

20:28.400 --> 20:34.800
be a good opportunity if you want to try Kubuntu, if you want a really rock-solid, stable KDE

20:34.800 --> 20:35.800
Plasma experience.

20:35.800 --> 20:42.280
Are we calling it sunsetting, is that what we're calling it, of the LTS edition, because

20:42.280 --> 20:43.280
it's still there.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.280
It's still there.

20:44.280 --> 20:45.640
No, it's gone.

20:45.640 --> 20:46.640
It's going away.

20:46.640 --> 20:47.640
Okay.

20:47.640 --> 20:48.640
So it's sunsetting.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.840
It's not able to download, but it's going away.

20:51.840 --> 20:56.720
It's just like right now you can still use it, and the repos are still there, but they're

20:56.720 --> 21:01.920
focusing away from the LTS version of Neon because there's really no reason for it to

21:01.920 --> 21:07.200
be there, because the majority of the time they put their effort into the regular user,

21:07.200 --> 21:10.880
and that was kind of like the original point of Neon in the first place.

21:10.880 --> 21:17.240
They just kind of made the LTS version because it made sense at the time, but now with Kubuntu

21:17.240 --> 21:24.600
providing an LTS solution on an LTS base with a solid LTS release of Plasma, there's really

21:24.600 --> 21:25.600
no need for it.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.600
Yeah, okay.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.600
I can see that.

21:27.600 --> 21:33.480
I don't think Kubuntu is going to have a lot of interesting updates for the release of

21:33.480 --> 21:37.040
1804, because I'm participating in making those updates.

21:37.040 --> 21:40.640
Oh, can you get any teases, any hints of what we should look for?

21:40.640 --> 21:47.760
Well, I mean, if you just boot the Kubuntu 1804, you will notice a change immediately

21:47.760 --> 21:51.680
with the theming much different.

21:51.680 --> 21:57.560
So one of the things that I did not like about Plasma, like there's a few things

21:57.560 --> 21:59.640
that Plasma doesn't do good by default.

21:59.640 --> 22:04.960
I'm trying to fix those, and Kubuntu are very receptive to those, so that's really awesome.

22:04.960 --> 22:11.400
One of the biggest things that I've convinced them to change is that the default breeze

22:11.400 --> 22:18.640
theme is super bright, and it's kind of awkward for the panels and widgets and menus and stuff.

22:18.640 --> 22:25.480
So they've switched it so that you have the dark theme breeze for the panels, the menus,

22:25.480 --> 22:28.320
and the widgets with a bright theme for the windows.

22:28.320 --> 22:30.680
So it's like a hybrid approach.

22:30.680 --> 22:31.680
Okay, nice.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.680
Well, good on you.

22:32.680 --> 22:36.320
I like that sound, Ron, because I got to tell you, yeah, I got to tell you guys, I have

22:36.320 --> 22:39.560
light sensitivity in my eyes, and that's why I wear glasses.

22:39.560 --> 22:45.600
So one of the reasons why, other than my stigmatism, and I got to tell you, light themes just hurt

22:45.600 --> 22:47.360
the heck out of my eyes.

22:47.360 --> 22:54.440
So this is a good notice for me, as well as another thing I wanted to mention was Xfce

22:54.440 --> 23:01.280
and especially Xubuntu, I've been waiting like hell for good Xfce high DPI support.

23:01.280 --> 23:10.720
So I'm thinking of until that happens to have Kubuntu installed and have this with my MacBook,

23:10.720 --> 23:16.640
because I got to tell you, I hate that Xfce doesn't have good high DPI support right now.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.640
Yeah, yeah.

23:17.640 --> 23:18.640
And that's a ways out.

23:18.640 --> 23:20.680
So I'm thinking of switching to Kubuntu for this, man.

23:20.680 --> 23:21.680
That's a ways out.

23:21.680 --> 23:27.040
Switching to Kubuntu, because I know that they have decent high DPI support, so I'm

23:27.040 --> 23:28.800
thinking of going to Kubuntu instead.

23:28.800 --> 23:32.360
Well, I'll tell you this, Ben, is if you try it out, you're not going to go back.

23:32.360 --> 23:33.360
That's what's going to happen.

23:33.360 --> 23:34.360
You won't go back once you try it.

23:34.360 --> 23:39.680
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of doing is downloading Kubuntu 18.04 and just chucking

23:39.680 --> 23:40.680
that on there instead.

23:40.680 --> 23:41.680
Yeah, yeah.

23:41.680 --> 23:42.680
You're going to like it.

23:42.680 --> 23:43.680
Yeah, that's my plan.

23:43.680 --> 23:44.680
Yeah.

23:44.680 --> 23:48.240
People tweeted last week or the week before and said, hey, how come you guys didn't talk

23:48.240 --> 23:49.360
about the plasma update?

23:49.360 --> 23:50.720
It's just sort of now we're there.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.280
We're using it and we're not switching.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.520
And it's stuck.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.760
And I really, really like it.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.680
Yeah, it is the new normal.

23:57.680 --> 24:01.760
So I'm going to transition from that and I'm going to mention why I'm on the road just

24:01.760 --> 24:03.640
because people probably already know.

24:03.640 --> 24:09.480
But just in case it's your last chance, Scale16x, the 16th annual Southern California Linux

24:09.480 --> 24:10.480
Expo.

24:10.480 --> 24:14.720
It's going on at the Pasadena Convention Center March 8th through the 11th.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.960
So it's starting in just a couple of days.

24:16.960 --> 24:21.400
I will be in the Pomona area Wednesday evening.

24:21.400 --> 24:26.360
And Wes, it's funny, when I get into California, because I've got the live tracker going at

24:26.360 --> 24:27.360
the jupyterbroadcast.com.

24:27.360 --> 24:28.640
I was going to ask.

24:28.640 --> 24:29.640
That's perfect.

24:29.640 --> 24:30.960
We can all creepily follow along.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.060
Well, people do.

24:32.060 --> 24:33.060
And I totally encourage it.

24:33.060 --> 24:39.440
It's great because what happens is as soon as I get into California, it's New York, California

24:39.440 --> 24:41.320
and Salt Lake City.

24:41.320 --> 24:46.240
When I'm in either one of those areas, it goes from like, yeah, let's go out and get

24:46.240 --> 24:47.240
a bite to eat.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.240
Yeah, that sounds cool.

24:48.240 --> 24:49.600
Let's meet up and get a bite to eat.

24:49.600 --> 24:52.480
And it goes from, well, OK, we've got a big group.

24:52.480 --> 24:53.840
So we're going to have to go do a meet up.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.600
Where can we go where we can fit like seven people?

24:56.600 --> 25:00.960
It's just way more people because everybody's so densely packed in here in New York and

25:00.960 --> 25:03.800
in California and apparently Salt Lake City.

25:03.800 --> 25:08.480
And so I may potentially be going out to dinner with five different listeners.

25:08.480 --> 25:09.480
That's incredible.

25:09.480 --> 25:10.480
I know.

25:10.480 --> 25:13.200
After driving like a madman.

25:13.200 --> 25:18.060
We got on the road before sunrise, before 6 a.m. and drove, drove, drove, drove to get

25:18.060 --> 25:21.080
here so that way we could sit and park somewhere and do the show.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.640
And I've just been getting telegrams and tweets.

25:23.640 --> 25:24.640
It's great.

25:24.640 --> 25:28.600
And I've already got listener Jeff on the way to meet up after we get off the air with

25:28.600 --> 25:29.880
Unplugged here at the RV.

25:29.880 --> 25:30.880
Oh, wow.

25:30.880 --> 25:31.880
So do you think you're ready?

25:31.880 --> 25:33.880
I mean, does the scale starts on Thursday?

25:33.880 --> 25:34.880
Is that right?

25:34.880 --> 25:35.880
Pumped.

25:35.880 --> 25:36.880
Yeah, I'm pumped.

25:36.880 --> 25:37.880
I'm pumped.

25:37.880 --> 25:43.920
I have some listener Ryan, a tech guy who a couple of years ago helped us out by letting

25:43.920 --> 25:48.920
us borrow his Cadillac when we got into Pomona because it's about 45 minutes between Pomona

25:48.920 --> 25:51.720
and Pasadena, which is Pasadena is where scale's at.

25:51.720 --> 25:55.160
And so Ryan's like, well, you're not planning to drive your RV in there, are you?

25:55.160 --> 25:56.160
And we're like, no.

25:56.160 --> 25:59.740
He's like, I don't think you realize how expensive that's going to be on Uber.

25:59.740 --> 26:02.320
Why don't you borrow my car?

26:02.320 --> 26:03.800
And we're like, OK.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.800
Whoa.

26:04.800 --> 26:05.800
OK.

26:05.800 --> 26:11.280
So he shows up and it's a Cadillac and which I just have an affection for because my grandparents

26:11.280 --> 26:14.360
always had Cadillacs and so it was, you know, it's pretty great.

26:14.360 --> 26:19.200
So Ryan reached out to me again this year and said, hey, you need another ride?

26:19.200 --> 26:21.840
I could I could meet you Thursday morning and bring you into scale.

26:21.840 --> 26:26.240
So yeah, Ryan and I are going to be meeting back up again and riding the Cadillac into

26:26.240 --> 26:29.320
town and going to scale Thursday morning.

26:29.320 --> 26:33.440
I think Noah is going to arrive in town like Thursday evening.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.600
So I'll be there in the morning to get like the beginning, do the meet and greets with

26:36.600 --> 26:40.960
with folks and meet a few people, get some interviews lined up, all that kind of stuff.

26:40.960 --> 26:41.960
And I don't know.

26:41.960 --> 26:42.960
It just go.

26:42.960 --> 26:43.960
You know, this is the scale.

26:43.960 --> 26:48.000
So scale was talking to us and they're like, so do you do you want the booth?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.760
And we're like, no, we don't want the booth.

26:50.760 --> 26:51.760
You don't want a booth?

26:51.760 --> 26:52.760
Nope.

26:52.760 --> 26:54.200
But how are you going to do a live show?

26:54.200 --> 26:57.320
We're like, well, maybe you could give us a room somewhere that's quiet.

26:57.320 --> 26:58.320
What?

26:58.320 --> 27:00.600
Like, yeah, that's how we want to do it this year.

27:00.600 --> 27:01.600
No booth.

27:01.600 --> 27:02.600
Totally different.

27:02.600 --> 27:07.480
We're just going to go enjoy ourselves and try and really try to get a sense of where

27:07.480 --> 27:12.480
Linux is going in 2018 because you got a lot of good projects there, a lot of different

27:12.480 --> 27:13.840
industry representation.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.440
That's one of the reasons I'm taking all this effort to go to scale is because it's like

27:17.440 --> 27:22.240
the biggest event in the States.

27:22.240 --> 27:26.040
And so I wish it was Linux Fest Northwest, which because that's up there.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.800
That's a big one, but it's not as big a scale.

27:28.800 --> 27:33.120
And in fact, the folks from Linux Fest Northwest usually go to scale to represent.

27:33.120 --> 27:38.000
And so I got to go to scale if I want to go to like the big community event.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
The big community event.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.040
And you know, it's another side of the community.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.560
There's different people that can make it there.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.320
So I'm sure it's a lot of fun.

27:44.320 --> 27:47.360
Yeah, I am so, so, so looking forward to it.

27:47.360 --> 27:51.640
I'm trying to document bits of the journey too as we go down in Tech Talk today.

27:51.640 --> 27:59.480
I just published episode 264, Parking Lot Podcaster yesterday and kind of captured the

27:59.480 --> 28:02.760
first bit of the trail and the trek down here.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.720
Tech Talk dot today is where you can go to get that.

28:04.720 --> 28:10.080
And if you want to track me live as I'm making my way down to scale, Jupiterbroadcasting.com

28:10.080 --> 28:14.840
slash Rover, that tracker is in the RV, not in, not on me.

28:14.840 --> 28:19.360
So people like people show up at the RV and they're like awkward about it and they're

28:19.360 --> 28:22.040
like hanging out around the RV and I'm not there.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.680
I'm not there.

28:23.680 --> 28:24.680
It's not on me.

28:24.680 --> 28:27.960
Like, you can get to the RV by watching that, but you got to telegram me or tweet me to

28:27.960 --> 28:29.520
actually find where I'm at.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.520
But if it's during scale...

28:30.520 --> 28:33.120
Oh, so you move around outside of LadyJubes?

28:33.120 --> 28:34.680
Turns out I leave LadyJubes.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.100
Yeah, I know.

28:36.100 --> 28:39.080
People have asked me, well, could you just put the tracker in your pocket?

28:39.080 --> 28:41.200
And I feel like that's the line where that's too far.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.200
That's too far.

28:42.200 --> 28:45.200
It's like, no, it's installed in LadyJubes.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.120
I've considered it.

28:47.120 --> 28:50.080
When we were in New York for a short period of time, we did remove it from LadyJubes and

28:50.080 --> 28:51.680
we installed it into Dia's car.

28:51.680 --> 28:57.000
But yeah, well, I love this app that you found, Wes.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.800
It's like a, it's like salvation for Slack users.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.200
Not that anybody ever uses Slack.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.320
No, certainly not.

29:03.320 --> 29:04.840
I wouldn't.

29:04.840 --> 29:10.880
Nobody on this show, nobody in the mumble room uses Slack, nobody in the IRC or Discord,

29:10.880 --> 29:12.320
nobody listening ever uses...

29:12.320 --> 29:14.120
We only use what mattered most.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.120
Yeah.

29:15.120 --> 29:18.080
Yeah, and there is some.

29:18.080 --> 29:19.080
There is definitely some of that.

29:19.080 --> 29:21.240
I think the same value is Slack at work.

29:21.240 --> 29:22.240
Do you?

29:22.240 --> 29:23.240
Yeah.

29:23.240 --> 29:25.200
Is it pretty entrenched into the workflow?

29:25.200 --> 29:30.240
Actually yes, because we use it for most of our communication, especially my department

29:30.240 --> 29:33.800
when we're away from each other or inter-campus, that kind of thing.

29:33.800 --> 29:39.440
Yeah, and I know, Wes, I know you use it with the network, but you also have a day job use

29:39.440 --> 29:40.440
for it too.

29:40.440 --> 29:43.960
So you're pretty heavy into Slack, just for work reasons, right?

29:43.960 --> 29:46.520
Yep, definitely it's on all my devices just for that.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.240
If not also the network, you're absolutely right.

29:49.240 --> 29:57.480
So I want to try to find different ways to use Slack that are quick and easy and low

29:57.480 --> 29:58.480
bandwidth.

29:58.480 --> 30:02.920
And so that's why I love this app that you found, Wes, Slack Term, which is a Slack client

30:02.920 --> 30:04.640
for your terminal.

30:04.640 --> 30:10.800
And it's simple, install away, and you just download a binary for your system and run

30:10.800 --> 30:11.800
it.

30:11.800 --> 30:12.800
I think it's written in Go, yeah?

30:12.800 --> 30:13.800
Did you check and look?

30:13.800 --> 30:14.800
I think it's a Go app.

30:14.800 --> 30:15.800
I think it's a Go app.

30:15.800 --> 30:16.800
Let's take a look here.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.320
And it's got a whole set of keyboard commands.

30:18.320 --> 30:19.320
Yep, it's a Go app.

30:19.320 --> 30:20.320
Yeah, it's written in Go.

30:20.320 --> 30:23.440
So you get a nice static binary you can run, yeah.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.880
And it really is, I mean, if you just look at the interface, it's pretty minimal.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.080
I like that it may not have all the features that you want.

30:29.080 --> 30:32.580
But if you just want to be able to reply quickly, not jump out of your terminal, this might

30:32.580 --> 30:34.320
be the thing for you.

30:34.320 --> 30:40.080
I love the idea of SSH sessions running with certain applications just omnipresent.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.640
I don't know.

30:41.640 --> 30:47.000
I do it rarely, and then it all falls apart, and I stop using all of it, and then I build

30:47.000 --> 30:54.920
things back up over time, like torrent clients, and SSH, and IRC, and things like that.

30:54.920 --> 30:59.200
And then I sort of tear it all down, depending on my use case.

30:59.200 --> 31:02.440
But like a team up session where you could stick this in there and just come back to

31:02.440 --> 31:04.080
it anytime you needed it.

31:04.080 --> 31:09.600
Or I've done X2Go as well, which is also really nice, and just have it up in an X session.

31:09.600 --> 31:14.120
But anyways, this is sort of like a low bandwidth way to take care of Slack.

31:14.120 --> 31:19.260
But the point I was getting at here is you can build a set of tools like this.

31:19.260 --> 31:27.080
So what I had set up was an X2Go session on a DigitalOcean droplet that was just always

31:27.080 --> 31:28.080
running.

31:28.080 --> 31:32.280
It's still running right now, which is great, because I'm on a MiFi connection, so maybe

31:32.280 --> 31:35.000
something really big and intensive comes up.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.240
The MiFi connection is fast enough to do an X2Go session.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.800
And that's secured over SSH, right?

31:40.800 --> 31:44.720
And so then I'm working on a machine that's on a DigitalOcean droplet that has a 40-gigabit

31:44.720 --> 31:47.540
connection, digitalocean.com.

31:47.540 --> 31:52.540
Go over there and create your account, and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

31:52.540 --> 31:56.440
And for a limited time, depends on engagement, there's a great deal.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.560
And Wes, do you have the paper there?

31:58.560 --> 31:59.560
There's like a URL.

31:59.560 --> 32:02.560
It's like do.co slash unplugged, I think.

32:02.560 --> 32:06.520
There's like an email somewhere on the table there.

32:06.520 --> 32:10.120
There's a note there.

32:10.120 --> 32:13.760
Okay now, here's why I wanted to make sure he got that, because that's the email where

32:13.760 --> 32:16.440
DigitalOcean is informing us that for a limited...

32:16.440 --> 32:17.440
Yeah, that's great.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.440
Nice.

32:18.440 --> 32:19.440
That sounds good, Wes.

32:19.440 --> 32:24.680
It's a limited time $100 credit for your DigitalOcean account if you're a new customer.

32:24.680 --> 32:25.680
Wow.

32:25.680 --> 32:30.680
Because honestly, the $10 credit is more than enough because you could run the $10.

32:30.680 --> 32:31.680
Pretty great, yeah.

32:31.680 --> 32:32.680
Yeah.

32:32.680 --> 32:34.080
So $100 credit, that's insane.

32:34.080 --> 32:36.440
And the reason is because they've got new systems.

32:36.440 --> 32:39.600
They've got mix and match droplets where you can mix and match the different resources

32:39.600 --> 32:41.200
that you need for your application.

32:41.200 --> 32:46.400
They've really improved the competitive pricing on their standard droplets too.

32:46.400 --> 32:47.840
Basically all my rigs just got an upgrade.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.800
My $0.03 an hour rig is just unstoppable.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.600
You didn't do anything, and now they're better.

32:52.600 --> 32:53.600
And you were there.

32:53.600 --> 32:54.600
Weren't you there?

32:54.600 --> 32:55.600
We were doing something for...

32:55.600 --> 32:56.600
We did it live.

32:56.600 --> 32:57.600
It was beautiful.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.600
Yeah, we were doing something for TechSnap.

32:58.600 --> 32:59.600
We were doing an experiment.

32:59.600 --> 33:03.760
This is a great use case that we do with DigitalOcean all the time is Wes and I are about to talk

33:03.760 --> 33:07.720
about something on TechSnap, and we had a question functionally about how it worked,

33:07.720 --> 33:12.280
and we wanted to be able to speak from a position of experience, so we spun up a droplet.

33:12.280 --> 33:15.360
In this case, it was a droplet that I already had some of the tools installed on, so I upgraded

33:15.360 --> 33:19.920
the droplet, installed the applications I needed within seconds, and within 10 minutes

33:19.920 --> 33:22.320
total we had run through different scenarios.

33:22.320 --> 33:26.720
We had tested the application, and we were able to incorporate that into our notes for

33:26.720 --> 33:28.160
the TechSnap program.

33:28.160 --> 33:32.040
And it's that kind of flexibility when you're trying something out, when you want to learn

33:32.040 --> 33:35.880
something, or when it's just time to build something and put it in production.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.720
There's all kinds of great uses for DigitalOcean.

33:37.720 --> 33:38.720
Go over there.

33:38.720 --> 33:44.600
They have great documentation, do.co slash unplugged, simplicity at scale and unbelievably

33:44.600 --> 33:46.240
easy to use interface.

33:46.240 --> 33:51.960
That's why companies like Slack and Tesla and Jupiter Broadcasting and many, many others

33:51.960 --> 33:59.840
and lots of open source projects use DigitalOcean, do.co slash unplugged, and go check out their

33:59.840 --> 34:02.640
documentation as well.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.000
Thank you, DigitalOcean, for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.200
So let's talk about Java just for a moment because I don't know what the hell is going

34:08.200 --> 34:09.200
on here.

34:09.200 --> 34:15.040
Oracle has handed over Java Enterprise Edition to the Eclipse Foundation, and now that the

34:15.040 --> 34:23.280
Eclipse Foundation has taken over Java Enterprise, they're renaming it to Jakarta, and they're

34:23.280 --> 34:26.000
dropping the Java trademark stuff.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.800
There's no Java trademarks now.

34:27.800 --> 34:34.600
They're calling the new Java Enterprise Jakarta, and it's under the guise of the Eclipse Foundation.

34:34.600 --> 34:38.160
Did all those words I just said make sense to you?

34:38.160 --> 34:40.040
I think so at a high level.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.040
They barely did.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.040
Yeah.

34:42.040 --> 34:47.440
But it's, I'm still not clear, will Oracle still be publishing their own version?

34:47.440 --> 34:49.660
Will people start actually calling it Jakarta?

34:49.660 --> 34:51.800
What's actually happening here?

34:51.800 --> 34:59.880
I think it is a handover, and the thing that screwed me up is that Jakarta isn't a new

34:59.880 --> 35:01.640
name.

35:01.640 --> 35:08.200
The Apache Foundation used the name Jakarta, which was their open source Java efforts in

35:08.200 --> 35:14.480
the late 90s, till recently, at least till 2011.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.480
So that was an Apache thing.

35:17.480 --> 35:22.920
So then this thing comes along, and it's really confusing, but my understanding is that essentially

35:22.920 --> 35:29.640
it's a group of Java experts, including the Java creator, James Galsling, and others that

35:29.640 --> 35:33.240
wrote Oracle and said, hand it over to us.

35:33.240 --> 35:38.000
And they wrote a long list of reasons, and I think Oracle has complied.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.240
This is all news to me, and I barely, barely care.

35:41.240 --> 35:46.480
But it seems like we may have a new product on the market called Jakarta EE, which is

35:46.480 --> 35:50.180
Java, but now under the Eclipse Foundation.

35:50.180 --> 35:52.160
So that's my takeaway story from this.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.960
Is that thick or what?

35:53.960 --> 35:56.480
Yeah, I mean, of course it is.

35:56.480 --> 35:59.960
We're talking about Oracle here, and so there's obviously going to be a lot of details that

35:59.960 --> 36:03.440
have to be argued over and then lawyers involved.

36:03.440 --> 36:06.560
Is there any chance somebody in the Mumba Room has a better breakdown of the story,

36:06.560 --> 36:11.520
and perhaps could summon some bit of courage to actually care a bit more than I could?

36:11.520 --> 36:12.520
I just...

36:12.520 --> 36:13.520
No?

36:13.520 --> 36:14.520
Nobody?

36:14.520 --> 36:15.520
Okay.

36:15.520 --> 36:18.760
We'll get the Well Actually email, and they'll set us straight, I'm sure.

36:18.760 --> 36:19.760
They'll tell us.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.400
That's why we love you, audience.

36:21.400 --> 36:26.040
Now, Mr. Foray couldn't join us today, and it's my bad, because I believe he's in my

36:26.040 --> 36:28.100
neck of the woods right now.

36:28.100 --> 36:31.260
So I should have caught a hold of him and said, why don't you come over to LadyJuice

36:31.260 --> 36:32.260
and have...

36:32.260 --> 36:33.260
Oh, that would have been amazing.

36:33.260 --> 36:38.960
Yeah, I could have shared this pineapple cider with him, which is prickly pineapple.

36:38.960 --> 36:39.960
Prickly pineapple?

36:39.960 --> 36:41.800
Say that 10 times fast.

36:41.800 --> 36:46.960
And he could have told us about Juno, which they're now actually starting the hype machine

36:46.960 --> 36:47.960
on.

36:47.960 --> 36:52.240
And they don't talk a lot about their future releases, but we're starting to see some updates.

36:52.240 --> 36:54.720
And there is a couple of things that jumped out at me.

36:54.720 --> 36:59.840
Number one, besides just an overall refinement to almost all aspects of the user interface

36:59.840 --> 37:04.840
and the photos app and the terminal, but they have a new nightlight function.

37:04.840 --> 37:05.840
Nightlight?

37:05.840 --> 37:06.840
Which you probably...

37:06.840 --> 37:08.480
Yeah, you probably can guess what that is.

37:08.480 --> 37:13.080
It's a nightlight tab under the new display settings area that there's a new function

37:13.080 --> 37:14.080
there.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.040
And you can set the temperature and the schedule.

37:16.040 --> 37:21.200
And then there's a really nice dropdown indicator where you can set there and adjust the shade

37:21.200 --> 37:22.200
from a dropdown indicator.

37:22.200 --> 37:23.200
They just really...

37:23.200 --> 37:27.440
I don't know if you've seen the screenshot of this, Wes, but they've really done a good

37:27.440 --> 37:31.800
job of taking a feature that I rely a lot on.

37:31.800 --> 37:38.480
This nightshade feature combined with dark user interfaces is sort of my trick to using

37:38.480 --> 37:40.800
my computer late at night.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.280
Sometimes I just don't sleep.

37:43.280 --> 37:49.260
And what happens is, don't tell her I said this, but I go to bed and I get a real good

37:49.260 --> 37:50.260
sleep going.

37:50.260 --> 37:51.260
You know what I mean?

37:51.260 --> 37:52.260
Like a solid sleep.

37:52.260 --> 37:53.260
One of those, oh yeah.

37:53.260 --> 37:54.260
Mm-hmm.

37:54.260 --> 37:55.320
I'm out.

37:55.320 --> 38:02.480
And then Hadia comes to bed or gets up and does something or the kids or the dog wakes

38:02.480 --> 38:07.160
me up like 20 minutes into this nice sleep and I never fall back asleep for the rest

38:07.160 --> 38:08.280
of the night.

38:08.280 --> 38:13.360
And so what I have learned is after about an hour or so, maybe two hours, I just give

38:13.360 --> 38:14.360
up and I go work.

38:14.360 --> 38:18.120
You might as well get something done instead of restlessly sitting there.

38:18.120 --> 38:22.280
I'm cracking open that XPS 13 in the middle of the night.

38:22.280 --> 38:26.000
Sometimes it's like 2 a.m. or whatever when I've finally given up.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.520
And if Redshift isn't kicked in just right or whatever, it's a blast of blue light that

38:30.520 --> 38:33.120
almost guarantees I'll never go back to bed.

38:33.120 --> 38:38.000
And this functionality sometimes can be too much when I'm editing and I need to turn this

38:38.000 --> 38:39.240
down or turn it off.

38:39.240 --> 38:42.080
And so it's really just a slick implementation they've done.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.080
There's all kinds of things.

38:43.080 --> 38:46.280
I really like the work they've done with the terminal too.

38:46.280 --> 38:51.840
It's those little tweaks that often I think set elementary apart just in that, you know,

38:51.840 --> 38:53.140
for you and I, it's not a problem.

38:53.140 --> 38:57.920
We can install any of the tools that exist to do similar things, but to just have it

38:57.920 --> 39:01.280
right in the OS that you've installed with that came on your computer, have it be a first

39:01.280 --> 39:05.080
class in the UI and in the settings menu, that makes a big difference, I think, especially

39:05.080 --> 39:07.720
people coming from Mac or other fancier platforms.

39:07.720 --> 39:11.320
Yeah, I almost wish I wasn't all in on Plasma now.

39:11.320 --> 39:13.840
It's looking so good.

39:13.840 --> 39:16.440
But the Plasma hype beast has me hard right now.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.440
There's just no way.

39:17.440 --> 39:21.240
You know, once it's out, I won't blame you if you want to flirt around for a while.

39:21.240 --> 39:22.240
That's okay.

39:22.240 --> 39:26.480
You know, what we need is somebody in the mumble room to be like a third party arbiter

39:26.480 --> 39:30.400
because, you know, Dan's going to say it's great if he shows up.

39:30.400 --> 39:32.680
And I'm not trying to right now because I'm all in on Plasma.

39:32.680 --> 39:36.880
So we need somebody from the mumble room to step up and be our elementary OS ambassador

39:36.880 --> 39:42.920
and try this out and let us know how it's going and be like our 1804 on the scene reporter.

39:42.920 --> 39:43.920
It could be you.

39:43.920 --> 39:44.920
Somebody's got to do that.

39:44.920 --> 39:45.920
It could be.

39:45.920 --> 39:46.920
So if you want to do that, let us know.

39:46.920 --> 39:51.640
Go to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact or hang out in our mumble room, mumble.jupytercolony.org

39:51.640 --> 39:56.520
for info on that and be part of the virtual log because it's going every Tuesday.

39:56.520 --> 40:02.040
We do the show at, we try to start around somewhere in like the 1.30 to 2 o'clock time

40:02.040 --> 40:06.400
range Pacific and then we go until Noah's done with Ask Noah.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.680
So it's a good time to hang out.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.480
A wonderful afternoon of Linux.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.480
Heck yeah.

40:10.480 --> 40:15.440
jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for the lifetime for that.

40:15.440 --> 40:16.440
There you go.

40:16.440 --> 40:20.600
If you want to see Daniel's post on that, they have a update for the last couple of

40:20.600 --> 40:22.960
months and it's looking really good.

40:22.960 --> 40:25.440
It's looking like they're really putting some serious work into that and you can go check

40:25.440 --> 40:26.440
that out.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.840
There's all of our links, jupyterbroadcasting.com.

40:28.840 --> 40:31.120
Go over there and then find the episode.

40:31.120 --> 40:35.040
This is episode 239 and you'll have links to everything in there.

40:35.040 --> 40:36.040
I don't know, Mr. West.

40:36.040 --> 40:37.040
What do you think?

40:37.040 --> 40:42.080
Do you think, oh, you know what I was going to mention too is I'm going to try to, well,

40:42.080 --> 40:43.080
you know what?

40:43.080 --> 40:44.080
I'll save it.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.080
I'll save it.

40:45.080 --> 40:46.080
You are a tease today.

40:46.080 --> 40:47.080
We'll tease it.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.080
We have this.

40:48.080 --> 40:49.080
Actually, okay.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.080
Let's get into this.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.080
Let's do this.

40:51.080 --> 40:57.640
So just really quickly, earlier in the show, we talked about Jeff Bezos' clock and Microsoft

40:57.640 --> 41:05.480
making Hyper-V friendly version of Ubuntu, also Kali Linux coming into the subsystem.

41:05.480 --> 41:07.360
I went down to Microsoft.

41:07.360 --> 41:10.860
I had some interesting conversations with them.

41:10.860 --> 41:14.840
It's almost quaint now to just kind of like, what's Microsoft doing with open source?

41:14.840 --> 41:20.000
There's something I actually want to talk about in this area and the topic that Tech

41:20.000 --> 41:28.360
Republic ran with was what Microsoft understands about open source that your company doesn't.

41:28.360 --> 41:32.720
It's an interesting post, so I want to talk about that for a moment, but before we do,

41:32.720 --> 41:35.920
let's thank Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.820
Thank you Linux Academy for sponsoring the show.

41:37.820 --> 41:42.260
It's a platform for you guys to go to, to learn more, to get more out of your career,

41:42.260 --> 41:46.320
to maybe advance it, or to just challenge yourself, whatever you think might help build

41:46.320 --> 41:47.320
the resume.

41:47.320 --> 41:51.280
It's a full-featured training library with everything you need to learn new skills, self-paced,

41:51.280 --> 41:56.240
in-depth video course on every cloud and DevOps topic, hands-on scenario-based labs that give

41:56.240 --> 42:00.480
you experience on real servers, and if you ever need help, they have full-time instructors

42:00.480 --> 42:03.640
that are there to advise and answer your questions.

42:03.640 --> 42:06.600
And they have learning paths, which are a series of courses and contents planned by

42:06.600 --> 42:08.960
instructors for specific career tracks.

42:08.960 --> 42:12.960
Are you ready to either switch track or go deeper?

42:12.960 --> 42:13.960
Really recommend that.

42:13.960 --> 42:18.060
And now, a lot of you ask about certifications, and yes, they have courses created specifically

42:18.060 --> 42:20.440
to prepare you for certification exams.

42:20.440 --> 42:23.560
They also have practice exams and quizzes to prepare you.

42:23.560 --> 42:27.740
They have flashcards, which use custom randomized decks of cards to help you study.

42:27.740 --> 42:30.600
They get forged by the community and made better all of the time.

42:30.600 --> 42:34.600
They have iOS and Android apps so you can study on the go, and they have a deep content

42:34.600 --> 42:35.600
library.

42:35.600 --> 42:39.800
They have staff that are adding to that and also going back and keeping it relevant all

42:39.800 --> 42:42.720
the time, so that way your subscription is always valuable.

42:42.720 --> 42:47.960
And if you're ready to learn AWS or OpenStack or even Azure, they have great courseware

42:47.960 --> 42:48.960
and all of that.

42:48.960 --> 42:54.500
They're really becoming the leader with all of that stuff, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

42:54.500 --> 42:58.640
Go there and sign up for a free seven-day trial, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and

42:58.640 --> 43:03.060
a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

43:03.060 --> 43:07.320
So the sub-headline is, Microsoft understands that its future depends upon contributing

43:07.320 --> 43:14.640
to open source, not just using it, and your company needs the same strategy.

43:14.640 --> 43:24.320
And when I was talking with Jeffrey, the technology fellow at Microsoft from the Azure group,

43:24.320 --> 43:31.360
he talked about, well actually let me reframe this, I told him the reason why it's hard

43:31.360 --> 43:36.160
for us to understand what Microsoft's overall strategy is, is because from the outside we

43:36.160 --> 43:38.220
just see these big code drops.

43:38.220 --> 43:40.920
So.NET Core, boom, code drop.

43:40.920 --> 43:44.640
Visual Studio Code, boom, just code drop.

43:44.640 --> 43:48.160
And then all of a sudden PowerShell Core, boom, code drop.

43:48.160 --> 43:54.960
And it just looks like this sporadic, like now we're doing this is open source because

43:54.960 --> 43:59.120
developers, and now we're doing this is open source because developers.

43:59.120 --> 44:06.680
And it feels like it's an attempt to just take a shotgun approach to solving a problem.

44:06.680 --> 44:15.140
But what I realized, which is obvious if you have any kind of insight inside a company,

44:15.140 --> 44:22.300
what I realized is these are the manifestations of three or four year long processes.

44:22.300 --> 44:26.920
Like Joey, who was in some of our interviews a couple of weeks ago, he was hired like four

44:26.920 --> 44:34.120
years ago to help specifically begin the snowball effect of this process, which involved training

44:34.120 --> 44:41.640
the team on using Git, which involved getting people on Mac and Linux, which quite frankly

44:41.640 --> 44:47.600
involved firing people who weren't on board with the new program and were always Windows

44:47.600 --> 44:48.600
first.

44:48.600 --> 44:56.700
And it was this realignment that they have been doing internally to not just make money

44:56.700 --> 45:01.040
off of open source, which is what they're doing, but the way they're making money off

45:01.040 --> 45:07.320
open source is by trying to contribute to open source and get legitimate...

45:07.320 --> 45:10.400
Get legitimate, I don't know if standing is the right word.

45:10.400 --> 45:14.400
So I'll give you an example of where I'm going with this.

45:14.400 --> 45:22.720
They talked at length internally about how the open source community would react to them

45:22.720 --> 45:29.520
open sourcing PowerShell and what they could do to sort of appease that reaction, to sort

45:29.520 --> 45:32.080
of address some of those concerns.

45:32.080 --> 45:38.280
And they specifically had to jump into action when the developer of Curl was one of the

45:38.280 --> 45:43.760
first people to submit a bug and it was, hey, you've got to remove your alias of Curl so

45:43.760 --> 45:45.380
people can actually use real Curl.

45:45.380 --> 45:50.000
And then they have this big conversation, like, okay, now we've got to make sure we're

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
responding.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
This is what we're doing now.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.440
This is what we're doing here.

45:53.440 --> 46:01.120
And it wasn't just like our PR department's doing this now, our developers are working

46:01.120 --> 46:02.120
internally.

46:02.120 --> 46:05.200
It was the people actually touching the code had to get involved.

46:05.200 --> 46:11.040
And there was some sort of shift that they had, some sort of mind shift that they had.

46:11.040 --> 46:14.960
And I wouldn't be surprised if it was perhaps just watching how Red Hat does it and figuring

46:14.960 --> 46:18.660
out how Red Hat's making money and going, well, geez, they're actually contributing

46:18.660 --> 46:19.700
code upstream.

46:19.700 --> 46:23.760
They're actually writing that stuff for their competitors to use and they're still making

46:23.760 --> 46:27.320
money on it and they're being taken serious and they're considered legitimate.

46:27.320 --> 46:28.680
Well, maybe we should do that.

46:28.680 --> 46:33.160
So it's not like there wasn't somebody out there for them to look at, but they actually

46:33.160 --> 46:34.160
got it.

46:34.160 --> 46:38.560
And so what we're seeing today is sometimes something that's been in the works for four

46:38.560 --> 46:43.420
or five years now that they're just getting around to dropping on us.

46:43.420 --> 46:49.640
And so the key point that this Tech Republic article makes is if you actually want to be

46:49.640 --> 46:54.040
taken serious at like a platform level or at a tool level, you've actually got to go

46:54.040 --> 46:55.040
all in.

46:55.040 --> 46:58.840
You can't just be like the PR division or a part of it.

46:58.840 --> 47:04.360
And I kind of take some of this and I kind of direct some of this at Dell right now.

47:04.360 --> 47:11.240
Like Dell is pretty all in on Linux on the server side and on the Sputnik line, but,

47:11.240 --> 47:15.200
you know, I mean, it feels like there's more they could do.

47:15.200 --> 47:19.560
They do contribute source code upstream, but I feel like there's more, like there's further

47:19.560 --> 47:20.560
steps for Dell to take.

47:20.560 --> 47:21.880
And I don't know exactly what they would be.

47:21.880 --> 47:27.320
I mean, they still, they will definitely still, quote unquote, recommend Windows 10 for the

47:27.320 --> 47:29.160
laptop that they're trying to sell you.

47:29.160 --> 47:30.160
Yeah.

47:30.160 --> 47:31.160
Yeah.

47:31.160 --> 47:33.400
And I guess, yeah, I guess that's understandable for business.

47:33.400 --> 47:34.400
Absolutely.

47:34.400 --> 47:35.400
No, it absolutely is.

47:35.400 --> 47:37.040
But it doesn't, you know, there's a lot of conflicting feelings.

47:37.040 --> 47:41.560
You're not quite sure like, well, how, how much, how invested in this are you?

47:41.560 --> 47:46.960
So you and I talk about a lot of, on TechSnap, a lot of tools that people can use to manage

47:46.960 --> 47:51.680
their server infrastructure and their crazy container sprawl and all that stuff.

47:51.680 --> 47:55.520
And can you think of any of those tools that are really serious, like what are the big

47:55.520 --> 47:59.920
ones in that space that are completely commercial where they don't have like a, like half the

47:59.920 --> 48:00.920
tools open source?

48:00.920 --> 48:04.040
Like what, like, is Ansible all open source?

48:04.040 --> 48:05.040
What's the...

48:05.040 --> 48:08.520
You know, the Ansible tower component didn't used to be, but it is now.

48:08.520 --> 48:10.600
It really has been the trend.

48:10.600 --> 48:15.400
There still are, you know, some like enterprise focused proprietary systems for monitoring

48:15.400 --> 48:18.760
and configuration management, but they're definitely not the things that you end up

48:18.760 --> 48:23.220
seeing at big tech companies or a lot of startups or, you know, maybe if you've been paying

48:23.220 --> 48:25.680
for them for 20 years and it's part of your workflow, sure.

48:25.680 --> 48:28.080
But it's not, it's not where the momentum is.

48:28.080 --> 48:31.680
The only thing I could think of that's server based is web server cPanel.

48:31.680 --> 48:32.680
Yep.

48:32.680 --> 48:33.680
Yeah.

48:33.680 --> 48:34.680
Yeah.

48:34.680 --> 48:38.680
I was thinking cPanel is definitely something that's more consumer facing, but yeah.

48:38.680 --> 48:40.320
Is cPanel still strong?

48:40.320 --> 48:41.320
Is it used much?

48:41.320 --> 48:42.320
Yeah.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.320
It's one of the top ones.

48:43.320 --> 48:44.320
Still, huh?

48:44.320 --> 48:45.320
What a nightmare.

48:45.320 --> 48:46.320
That and Plask.

48:46.320 --> 48:47.320
Yeah.

48:47.320 --> 48:48.320
Oh yeah.

48:48.320 --> 48:53.320
Wes, when's the last time you used cPanel or Plask?

48:53.320 --> 48:57.160
Thankfully quite some time, but I definitely have friends, you know, or people in unfortunate

48:57.160 --> 48:59.440
situations and you're right.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.480
They're still, they're definitely still out there.

49:01.480 --> 49:02.480
Yeah.

49:02.480 --> 49:03.480
Yeah.

49:03.480 --> 49:06.960
It seems though like if you want to be like a legitimate platform player, you have to

49:06.960 --> 49:07.960
open source.

49:07.960 --> 49:09.440
I mean, look at Apple with Swift.

49:09.440 --> 49:13.240
You had to open source Swift to be taken seriously anymore.

49:13.240 --> 49:15.560
I think it's a pretty big statement right there.

49:15.560 --> 49:20.440
And Apple is an example of a company who's like half in with open source.

49:20.440 --> 49:25.160
They obviously use a lot of it, a lot of the BSD tools, CUPS, a lot of that stuff is open

49:25.160 --> 49:27.840
source in the development chain.

49:27.840 --> 49:31.720
Even Darwin itself is open source, but it feels like that's more of an open source out

49:31.720 --> 49:36.720
of convenience where there is a different type of commitment level to open source coming

49:36.720 --> 49:39.280
out of Microsoft now.

49:39.280 --> 49:42.600
And you can, you know, you can be listening to this and be skeptical and say, oh, Chris

49:42.600 --> 49:47.040
has bought into the Kool-Aid, but I went down there and I talked to the people and they,

49:47.040 --> 49:52.040
they said the things that you say when you're legitimately trying hard and you're a large

49:52.040 --> 49:53.040
company.

49:53.040 --> 49:57.700
And I think that that formula that they've cracked is going to be one that other companies

49:57.700 --> 50:02.680
are either going to have to try to try to copy or they're going to be just perceived

50:02.680 --> 50:03.680
as disingenuous.

50:03.680 --> 50:04.680
Yeah.

50:04.680 --> 50:05.680
I mean, it was like a legitimate.

50:05.680 --> 50:09.560
It feels like almost like you almost have to assess it from that perspective in terms

50:09.560 --> 50:12.540
of open source is just what you have to do now.

50:12.540 --> 50:16.840
So even if you don't trust Microsoft, still don't like Microsoft, whatever, they're smart

50:16.840 --> 50:20.120
enough, savvy enough, at least it appears that even if they didn't genuinely believe

50:20.120 --> 50:23.520
these things, they're willing to do so just in their own interest.

50:23.520 --> 50:27.920
You know, what's going to be, you know, what's going to be weird is to see where Google goes

50:27.920 --> 50:32.800
in the next few years with open source because they've got Project Fuchsia.

50:32.800 --> 50:35.320
They've got Android One.

50:35.320 --> 50:36.600
It's a little bit different of a thing.

50:36.600 --> 50:45.360
But there's also today there is news that Google has unveiled a 72 qubit Bristol Cone

50:45.360 --> 50:54.080
processor, which they say brings them to quantum supremacy in the quantum computing race.

50:54.080 --> 51:00.400
Now it's not like we're not talking like they're cracking Bitcoin crypto codes yet, but that

51:00.400 --> 51:04.080
is going to be a really interesting thing to see where this all goes with Google and

51:04.080 --> 51:09.960
where where they still continue to contribute to open source and where they become more

51:09.960 --> 51:14.600
Apple to try to stay competitive with Android, you know, that line that they walk.

51:14.600 --> 51:15.600
Very much so.

51:15.600 --> 51:17.720
And it's funny you mentioned that because just the just the other week to Microsoft

51:17.720 --> 51:21.280
released their quantum development kit, including support for Linux.

51:21.280 --> 51:23.640
So it's they're all they're all playing in these spaces.

51:23.640 --> 51:26.660
I think it will matter like, how genuine do they believe it?

51:26.660 --> 51:31.900
Is it a Google style kind of it is open source, but all the good stuff gets put proprietary?

51:31.900 --> 51:35.200
Or will it really be first class open source?

51:35.200 --> 51:38.320
That seems to be the way it's going to it's like these big centralized obviously, because

51:38.320 --> 51:41.880
of just the cooling requirements and all this crazy stuff when they build these quantum

51:41.880 --> 51:42.880
computers.

51:42.880 --> 51:43.880
IBM is doing that, too.

51:43.880 --> 51:44.880
Did you see that there?

51:44.880 --> 51:47.400
There's like some IBM Center down in Texas.

51:47.400 --> 51:49.840
If you're a local, you can go use IBM's quantum computer.

51:49.840 --> 51:50.840
Yeah.

51:50.840 --> 51:53.080
And then they have an API you can use over the web as well.

51:53.080 --> 51:54.080
Really?

51:54.080 --> 51:55.080
Yeah.

51:55.080 --> 51:56.080
Oh, my gosh.

51:56.080 --> 51:57.600
Well, there you go, Wes.

51:57.600 --> 51:59.560
Maybe we could encode some podcasts on there.

51:59.560 --> 52:00.560
Let's give it a shot.

52:00.560 --> 52:01.880
I don't think so.

52:01.880 --> 52:02.880
No, I don't think so.

52:02.880 --> 52:03.880
No, I don't think so.

52:03.880 --> 52:04.880
All right.

52:04.880 --> 52:08.720
If you want to contribute something to the show, go to linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

52:08.720 --> 52:10.880
That is our subreddit linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

52:10.880 --> 52:12.220
Yes, we have a subreddit.

52:12.220 --> 52:13.960
We don't mention it very often.

52:13.960 --> 52:15.400
But it's over there.

52:15.400 --> 52:17.720
I'm not big on Reddit these days.

52:17.720 --> 52:21.960
So I just shut down our Jupiter broadcasting subreddit.

52:21.960 --> 52:23.920
Because I was in there and I was like, this is a fuck.

52:23.920 --> 52:28.380
This is, I shouldn't swear, but this is a dumpster fire is what my thoughts were.

52:28.380 --> 52:32.080
But the unplugged subreddit still seems to be chugging along just fine.

52:32.080 --> 52:39.280
And there is a post in there that was submitted an hour ago by Mr. Motang about Skype bragging

52:39.280 --> 52:45.200
that their maintenance updates could be easier because of snaps.

52:45.200 --> 52:53.400
Now, I think there's also the possibility that we could see more things coming down

52:53.400 --> 52:54.400
this channel.

52:54.400 --> 52:55.400
I don't know how much I can say.

52:55.400 --> 52:56.400
Yeah.

52:56.400 --> 52:57.560
I don't think I can actually say what I know.

52:57.560 --> 52:58.560
Do you remember we talked about it?

52:58.560 --> 53:02.480
It does seem like there's some momentum behind the scenes that we aren't, I don't get to

53:02.480 --> 53:06.480
be privileged to, but just quiet releases of things.

53:06.480 --> 53:07.480
That's got to be building.

53:07.480 --> 53:14.680
Well, see, here's like, I'll tell you, there's a capability when you have a confined application

53:14.680 --> 53:19.640
and you ship with its own libraries, if it's using, if the application is typically doing

53:19.640 --> 53:24.400
something wrong, there might be a way via packaging to solve it.

53:24.400 --> 53:28.980
So say you had an application like Skype that was broken into two pieces.

53:28.980 --> 53:33.960
You had an electron version of Skype and then inside Skype, you still had like a C plus

53:33.960 --> 53:38.000
application to do like all of the voice calls that actually was the voice engine.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.400
Let's say this is theoretically new Skype is set up.

53:41.400 --> 53:46.040
Well, new Skype uses electron wrapper for like the chat and all of that.

53:46.040 --> 53:49.880
And of course, because it's new Skype, that's using pulse audio.

53:49.880 --> 53:53.760
But core Skype that's like embedded in that electron app that's doing all of the management

53:53.760 --> 53:56.720
for the voice calls, that's still using ulsa.

53:56.720 --> 53:57.720
Fun.

53:57.720 --> 53:58.720
Okay.

53:58.720 --> 54:01.240
I totally believe that that would happen in this theoretical Linux universe.

54:01.240 --> 54:02.240
Exactly.

54:02.240 --> 54:09.280
And it's possible that perhaps one is communicating at ulsa with one rate and it's communicating

54:09.280 --> 54:12.960
and then the electron apps communicating to pulsa with a completely different rate.

54:12.960 --> 54:13.960
You see what I'm saying?

54:13.960 --> 54:19.240
I can't, I mean, I don't, I certainly can't hear what you're saying because that sounds

54:19.240 --> 54:21.040
like an audio clusterfuck.

54:21.040 --> 54:22.040
Sorry.

54:22.040 --> 54:27.680
I would, are you talking about sample rate or yeah, yeah, we might be, we might be, we

54:27.680 --> 54:29.720
might be talking about sample rate, not bit rate.

54:29.720 --> 54:30.720
That might be what we're talking about.

54:30.720 --> 54:34.160
Maybe you're talking like 44 Hertz versus 48 Hertz.

54:34.160 --> 54:35.160
You know what I'm saying?

54:35.160 --> 54:36.160
That kind of thing.

54:36.160 --> 54:41.440
Like perhaps the electron app is at 44 Hertz and perhaps the C plus plus or the C plus

54:41.440 --> 54:47.100
apps at a 48 you saw, you know, who knows, I'm just spitballing here and via packaging,

54:47.100 --> 54:50.480
you might be able to have some libraries in there that solve this problem and fix this

54:50.480 --> 54:55.240
problem for the vendor that, that doesn't require them doing a complete rewrite of their

54:55.240 --> 54:56.240
application.

54:56.240 --> 55:00.560
And so that vendor may be very excited about the packaging format because of the possibilities

55:00.560 --> 55:03.280
of solving problems for them on the Linux platform.

55:03.280 --> 55:06.160
That could be potentially what we're dealing with here, but I don't know.

55:06.160 --> 55:07.160
I'm just speculating.

55:07.160 --> 55:09.160
You see what I'm saying?

55:09.160 --> 55:10.160
Yeah.

55:10.160 --> 55:13.720
I could see a sample rate mismatch, but not so much a bit rate mismatch because that would

55:13.720 --> 55:16.520
just make a compression sound weird.

55:16.520 --> 55:21.720
A sample rate mismatch would actually speed up or slow down the audio.

55:21.720 --> 55:22.720
Yeah.

55:22.720 --> 55:23.720
Yeah.

55:23.720 --> 55:26.240
Hadea just got back from, uh, from the Capitol with Levi.

55:26.240 --> 55:28.440
Levi, welcome in little buddy.

55:28.440 --> 55:29.440
Yeah.

55:29.440 --> 55:30.440
Levi is now here.

55:30.440 --> 55:31.440
He's here.

55:31.440 --> 55:32.440
Come here, Levi.

55:32.440 --> 55:33.440
Come here.

55:33.440 --> 55:34.440
Come say hi to the unplugged program.

55:34.440 --> 55:35.440
Come here.

55:35.440 --> 55:36.440
Come up here.

55:36.440 --> 55:37.440
Come here.

55:37.440 --> 55:38.440
Come here.

55:38.440 --> 55:39.440
So yeah, he's nice and warm here.

55:39.440 --> 55:40.440
Lick the microphone for me.

55:40.440 --> 55:41.440
There you go.

55:41.440 --> 55:42.440
Yeah.

55:42.440 --> 55:43.700
He likes to sit and he likes to sit up here and look out the window.

55:43.700 --> 55:44.700
But how was that?

55:44.700 --> 55:45.700
Was that good?

55:45.700 --> 55:46.700
Yeah.

55:46.700 --> 55:47.700
Yeah.

55:47.700 --> 55:48.700
Is it warm?

55:48.700 --> 55:49.700
Yeah.

55:49.700 --> 55:50.700
It looks pretty warm out there.

55:50.700 --> 55:51.700
I'm getting pretty warm in here.

55:51.700 --> 55:52.700
Did you just turn on the air?

55:52.700 --> 55:53.700
Okay.

55:53.700 --> 55:54.700
Nice.

55:54.700 --> 55:55.700
Yeah.

55:55.700 --> 55:56.700
All right.

55:56.700 --> 55:57.700
Well, so, uh, Mr. West, I have just a couple of parting bits to talk about before we get

55:57.700 --> 55:58.700
out of here.

55:58.700 --> 55:59.700
Let us in on your secrets.

55:59.700 --> 56:01.440
Do you have, do you have any secrets you want to share with the people?

56:01.440 --> 56:03.480
Maybe like a Twitter place they could check out something like that.

56:03.480 --> 56:06.660
You can find me over at, uh, at West Payne.

56:06.660 --> 56:07.660
Very good.

56:07.660 --> 56:10.720
You can follow me at Chris LAS and why not check out the Instagram.

56:10.720 --> 56:11.720
I'll post a few pictures.

56:11.720 --> 56:12.720
Yes.

56:12.720 --> 56:13.720
I said it.

56:13.720 --> 56:14.720
Do it.

56:14.720 --> 56:18.000
As long as, as long as there's Levi pictures, I will be there.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
You know what?

56:19.000 --> 56:20.800
I'll make sure I put a Levi picture up there just for you.

56:20.800 --> 56:21.800
Okay.

56:21.800 --> 56:22.800
Just for you.

56:22.800 --> 56:23.800
Um, Insta Chris LAS on there.

56:23.800 --> 56:27.580
I'll be posting some pictures on the road to scale tech talk dot today for the story

56:27.580 --> 56:29.200
as we get to scale.

56:29.200 --> 56:33.920
And if you're in the Pasadena area, let me know at Chris LAS on the Twitter or on the

56:33.920 --> 56:34.920
telegrams.

56:34.920 --> 56:39.800
I'd love to talk to you guys and Jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar for our live time.

56:39.800 --> 56:42.460
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of unplugged and we'll see you right

56:42.460 --> 56:48.160
back here next week.

56:48.160 --> 57:00.920
All right, well, now we just got to pick a title and then we're out of here.

57:00.920 --> 57:02.560
Let's get that titles on everyone.

57:02.560 --> 57:04.440
Noah may be stopping in a little bit too.

57:04.440 --> 57:05.440
Noah that dog.

57:05.440 --> 57:06.440
I know, right?

57:06.440 --> 57:07.440
I know.

57:07.440 --> 57:08.440
Boom, JBtitles.com.

57:08.440 --> 57:11.960
Go get your vote heard right now.

57:11.960 --> 57:16.280
The only election that matters, JBtitles.

57:16.280 --> 57:18.480
I shall be back after game the kid.

57:18.480 --> 57:19.480
What'd you say?

57:19.480 --> 57:21.940
We'll just put quantum in there a whole bunch?

57:21.940 --> 57:23.440
That's probably what we want.

57:23.440 --> 57:28.760
We were, you know, we have, uh, it's funny how you notice how like the mumble room attendance

57:28.760 --> 57:32.720
is pretty decent today, but it could be double this some weeks, you know, and it just sort

57:32.720 --> 57:33.720
of ebbs and flows.

57:33.720 --> 57:34.720
It really does.

57:34.720 --> 57:35.720
We should get some graphs on that.

57:35.720 --> 57:38.600
That would be really interesting.

57:38.600 --> 57:44.200
On Twitter, check out the trends in the US player one is trending and it seems to be

57:44.200 --> 57:52.440
all retro, um, movie titles and or, uh, retro characters feeding, um, being, uh, subbed

57:52.440 --> 57:54.480
in with a ready player one.

57:54.480 --> 57:55.480
Oh really?

57:55.480 --> 57:56.480
It's right.

57:56.480 --> 57:59.440
When's ready player one coming out?

57:59.440 --> 58:00.440
I'm ready.

58:00.440 --> 58:01.440
My body is ready.

58:01.440 --> 58:03.440
My booty is ready.

58:03.440 --> 58:07.600
All right, Wes, I'm going to go find a Levi picture for you right now.

58:07.600 --> 58:09.800
Wow, what a dear.

58:09.800 --> 58:14.720
How about, uh, we call, here's one that we call, uh, Levi the Copi.

58:14.720 --> 58:20.440
Levi the Copi.

58:20.440 --> 58:22.260
He's so cute.

58:22.260 --> 58:23.480
Now he's been to California.

58:23.480 --> 58:24.480
Look at that.

58:24.480 --> 58:30.080
Uh, he may have before because, uh, you know, he's from Texas.

58:30.080 --> 58:33.440
We had, uh, we parked somewhere where the people that parked next to us, they had a

58:33.440 --> 58:35.240
rescue dog from Texas too.

58:35.240 --> 58:36.240
Nice.

58:36.240 --> 58:37.240
Did they get along well?

58:37.240 --> 58:38.240
They did.

58:38.240 --> 58:39.240
You know, you know Levi.

58:39.240 --> 58:40.240
Yeah.

58:40.240 --> 58:41.240
You know.

58:41.240 --> 58:42.240
He just wants to be everyone's friend.

58:42.240 --> 58:43.240
Yeah.

58:43.240 --> 58:44.720
There ain't nobody Levi don't get along with.

58:44.720 --> 58:45.720
Know what I mean?

58:45.720 --> 58:46.720
Yeah.

58:46.720 --> 58:47.720
Right.

58:47.720 --> 58:48.720
And if so, I don't trust that person.

58:48.720 --> 58:52.320
They've clearly done something wrong.

58:52.320 --> 58:58.160
It'll release on the 29th of March.

58:58.160 --> 59:01.640
Oh man, that's, that's forever.

59:01.640 --> 59:06.680
That is forever, dude.

59:06.680 --> 59:07.680
Yeah.

59:07.680 --> 59:08.680
Could be worth the wait.

59:08.680 --> 59:13.680
Plus it, I think, uh, Spielberg is directing.

59:13.680 --> 59:17.400
There you go, Wes.

59:17.400 --> 59:18.400
Just for you.

59:18.400 --> 59:19.400
Posted Levi the Copilot.

59:19.400 --> 59:20.400
Oh.

59:20.400 --> 59:21.400
Boom.

59:21.400 --> 59:30.160
Um, all right, so we got to name this thing.

59:30.160 --> 59:32.400
This is going to be a, this is going to be a weird Poe show.

59:32.400 --> 59:33.400
Yeah.

59:33.400 --> 59:36.200
This is a weird Poe show, but that's just what happens sometimes, you know?

59:36.200 --> 59:37.300
Yeah, it is.

59:37.300 --> 59:39.640
It's a weird week because it's a low mumble attendance.

59:39.640 --> 59:42.720
It's kind of a light news week and-

59:42.720 --> 59:44.400
Everyone's too excited about scale.

59:44.400 --> 59:46.120
How are you going to-

59:46.120 --> 59:47.160
And yeah, yeah.

59:47.160 --> 59:51.040
And also this is put kind of put together at the last minute because, you know, road

59:51.040 --> 59:52.040
trip.

59:52.040 --> 59:55.280
Well, you're not supposed to reveal that part.

59:55.280 --> 59:56.280
Okay.

59:56.280 --> 59:57.280
All right.

59:57.280 --> 01:00:01.640
Scaling, unplugged, remote access, unplugged, unplugged on the road, uh, unplugged road

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:11.000
show, um, what about, uh, what about, uh, what about Jeff's clock or something like

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.320
that?

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.960
Or cleaning, cleaning Jeff's clock.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.080
Oh, cleaning Jeff's clock, huh?

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.640
Uh, millennium Linux.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.640
Microsoft strategy.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.640
Microsoft strategy.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:22.640
Microsoft strategy.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.640
Because it wasn't-

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.640
That was too bad.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.960
And it has, we have, we had two stories at least.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:35.240
Uh, the Microsoft, uh, the Microsoft millennium, the Microsoft, uh, Microsoft millennium.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:40.080
The uh, let's see, really what you got here is, you know what I was going to go with?

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.760
You know what I forgot to, you know what I forgot to put in there was where I was going

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:48.640
to go is both Microsoft and Amazon are really powerfully positioned to, uh, just dominate

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:54.280
for a couple of years and, uh, Amazon more so I think.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:57.880
And I wanted to kind of work that into the segment because that's kind of where this

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.880
is headed.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.420
It just, it didn't work.

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:01.420
There's too much going on.

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:02.420
I don't know.

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:03.420
We didn't get there.

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:08.120
But, uh, that's where this is all going is Amazon is going to become like the titan of

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:12.960
our industry because look at, they already run the internet with EC2, um, they're gonna,

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:18.680
they're gonna turn our own homes into stores with ring video doorbell and the echo devices

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:23.220
and the security products they're about to launch and then home delivery of prescriptions.

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:27.360
They're going to just own our home completely or our own, they're with the echo tubes and

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:30.800
dash buttons and all these other things.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.960
They just turn your, they don't need a store because your house is the store.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:38.800
Um, and then they have amazon.com and, uh, then they're going to have their media section

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:44.960
with the prime stuff, the prime video stuff and, uh, they're opening up another headquarters.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.680
So do you feel like a little pawn being bounced back and forth between like three big tech

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.360
companies kind of deciding what your life is like?

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.360
Yeah.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:57.800
Did you guys mention about the, uh, gaming, uh, service that they just bought?

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:06.200
No, no, no gaming, game streaming service.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.560
So the future is theirs.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:13.120
The future is like, what do we, what can we, where can we go with a title from this?

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.120
Microsoft millennium.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:22.080
Um, the next Microsoft millennium, the next Microsoft decade.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.080
Yeah.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:31.960
I don't know about you guys, but I'm not allowing any Amazon echoes into my, uh, this, uh, residence.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.960
Next Microsoft.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:33.960
It's kind of long.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:34.960
I don't know.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.960
People just think it's about Microsoft.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.960
Yeah.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.960
Right.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:42.960
Um, the future is open source.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.480
Uh, hmm.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.040
That's closer.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.040
That's not bad.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.880
It's not great.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.880
It's kind of generic.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:58.040
It's probably more in the direction, um, open source millennium by the way, can we check

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.720
the IRC discord poll?

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.520
Oh yeah.

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.520
Yeah.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.720
Uh, yeah, it is.

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.720
It's in the, it's in the show notes from two weeks ago.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.800
If you want to check it while we, while we tile it up, uh, there you go.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.120
Levi, the co-pilot picture posted just for us.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.120
Boom.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.120
Yep.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.120
Look at that.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.120
It's beautiful.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.120
Got it up here on the stream.

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.120
Isn't he a dog?

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.120
Oh yeah.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.120
He does get very sleepy.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.120
Yeah.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.480
He, he does get very sleepy.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.280
You're on the road a long day traveling.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.400
It takes it out of a little pup.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.200
It does.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.200
Poor little guy.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:38.720
Oh gosh, he's so cute with his little sweater too.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:42.000
He probably hardly needs it in your warm California air.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Yeah.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
It's off now.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
That was earlier this morning when it was up in the twenties.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Okay.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.160
What else do we got here?

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.160
Anything new?

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.160
Unplugged on the road.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:04:02.600
I've been unplugged everywhere.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.720
Hashtag rotten was right.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:05.720
That's great.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:15.520
Um, plasma millennium, well we only really talked about plasma just as the check-in.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:21.800
Let's see here.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.800
Okay.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.760
It looks like IRC is winning over discord with 77%.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:26.760
Yeah.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:27.760
Yeah.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:28.760
Yeah.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.760
Yeah.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.760
That is surprising.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.960
I think 77 is down from 79 from last check.

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:34.960
Correct?

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:35.960
Oh, it is.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.960
Huh?

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:37.960
Oh, there you go.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:41.320
Uh, diddle it, did it, did it, Morty.

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.120
Just use an external USB sound card.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.120
Don't use the sound card built into your laptop.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.120
Yeah.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.120
For hiss.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.120
So, okay.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:05:00.760
Um, something about Jakarta, um, no, selling, selling, selling out for open source.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:04.400
Oh, that's kind of, that's actually not bad.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.400
Yeah.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.160
It's kind of, it's kind of nuanced.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.840
There could be multiple interpretations.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.760
It's got open source in there.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.600
Let's say Microsoft, but it's obviously what we're talking about.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.600
Huh.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.240
I kind of like it.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.240
I like it too.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.240
You're making me like it.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.240
You're making me like it, Wes.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.240
I could, I could live with that.

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.240
All right.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.240
Okay.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.240
Maybe we'll do that.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.240
Hmm.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.240
Selling out.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.240
I mean.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.920
Well, who are we talking about?

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:31.920
We may not be.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:32.920
Yeah.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:38.320
We may be talking about, um, Apple, I don't know.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.320
Oracle.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.320
Yeah.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.320
That's, that's who we're talking about.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.320
Yeah.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.320
I like that.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.320
Yeah.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.320
I don't know.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:49.120
Dumpster fire.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:53.720
If I had, if I had, if I had better connections at Microsoft and more time, I would be tempted

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:57.160
to go to build this year and see how much they're talking about open source at build.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.160
That would be fascinating.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.160
Because that's their big developer conference.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.160
Yeah.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:05.880
Speaking of Microsoft connections, did you get a contact with anybody significant yet?

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:10.680
Um, well, what do you mean?

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:16.040
Because I sent your email over to the contact I have, uh, at, uh, who's a co-host of twight

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.560
who's from, who is a Microsoft development head of the graph.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.560
Oh, Lou.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.560
Uh, no, but I've been talking to other people.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.560
Yeah.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.560
Yeah.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.560
I've been talking to other people.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.560
Yeah.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.560
Yeah.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:28.560
Yeah.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:31.560
Lou would be a good perspective to have on, uh, on the show with regards to the Microsoft

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.560
graph.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:37.000
So, and he runs a Linux on occasion.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
How dare he?

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
How dare he?

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.480
Well, I mean, it is open now with such an Adela.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.480
No, we're just teasing.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.480
We're just teasing.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.480
Sorry.

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.480
I see that sense of humor.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.480
Oh, there he is.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.480
There he is.

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.480
The moment we've all been waiting for.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480
Yeah.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:54.480
Welcome.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.480
Hallelujah.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.480
Hi there guys.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.480
You saw today.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.480
Hooray.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:06:59.480
Did I, did I sound bad before?

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.480
I don't know.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:05.480
There was a, there was a week ago or something.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:12.480
There was that one live stream where your audio was garbage and then we had to, yeah,

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.480
we had to ruin that.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.480
We had to bail on the pre on the post show cause it was so bad.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.480
Yeah.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.480
Yeah.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:18.480
That was last week.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.480
Yeah.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:23.480
That was, well, no, that was, to be fair, that was not, that was my studio audio.

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:26.480
I was, I was on my laptop or something like that.

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.480
Not my fault.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.480
It's not my fault.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.480
I love you though.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:30.480
Yeah.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.480
I wouldn't go that far.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.480
It wasn't my fault.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.480
It just, you know, you know.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:39.580
So you're at, you're in your regular old Graham Forks studio, you know, just old boring studio

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.200
that's been custom built for you.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:42.200
Just old boring.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:46.280
Well actually, so I, I don't know how, I know you get excited more on the studio side of

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:50.640
things than the transmitter side, but we got a new transmitter and this, it's a transmitter

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.640
made for Chris.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.640
Chris.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.640
Oh yeah.

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.640
Yeah.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.840
The whole thing is a web UI.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:59.960
So you log in and you can set the power and you can turn it on and off.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.600
It's got, it's got so many bells and whistles on the stupid thing.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:06.520
I get emails from my transmitter now telling me your audio is a little bit low and it's

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.560
not modulating quite as much and it's not quite as loud as the, as this station that

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:10.560
I'm listening to.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.520
And so you might want, it's crazy.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:13.520
Ooh.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:17.800
It's like, like, what do you mean, what do you mean like it, like the software emails

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.800
you?

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:19.800
Like it's not a human.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:20.800
No.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:21.800
Yeah.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:22.920
It's, it's actually, it's a little arm computer that's inside of that process.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.400
It's inside of that transmitter and monitors for a bunch of different things.

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:31.280
And like, even, even like when I show you the interface, even though you're not much

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:34.240
of a, you're, you're not like, I don't, I don't think you, at least I don't think you

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.840
get gung ho over like the, the RF side.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.360
You'd look at it and be like, man, that is cool.

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.120
I don't even know what that is, but I want to play with it.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.280
Oh, that's a, that's a strong selling point.

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.280
Yeah.

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:44.280
I could see that.

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:45.280
I could totally see that.

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.760
So what's coming up on the show today?

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:50.000
Oh, we are doing some, we are doing some really exciting things.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:57.280
We are talking today about all of the tools and software packages and stuff that people

01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:03.720
self host on their home servers, on their business servers, and how those tools work,

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:07.200
what the best ones are, what are ones that you might want to stay away from.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:10.680
And if you don't want to host them yourself, what are some of the alternatives you can

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:15.680
go to, to get some, to, to, to pay somebody to host that stuff, is there a managed provider

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.680
that provides that?

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.680
Yeah.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:18.680
Yeah.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.120
I, I've been wanting to do a home server hoedown on the Unplugged program for a few

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.120
weeks.

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.680
That's, that's, I think I love, I love that topic, something, you know, you can self host

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:27.920
or not.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.920
It's exploding in the industry, which is why it's so interesting to me.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:31.920
Whoa, really?

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:32.920
Really?

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:33.920
Yeah.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.080
I was, you know, I get monthly sales reports of where we make the most amount of our money

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:46.080
and this month, the only, the one thing that I can say has, that brought in the most money.

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:52.440
If I was to categorize something, it is maintenance support or installation of self hosted services.

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:53.440
Huh?

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.440
Good.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.440
I know.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.440
I know.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.440
I know.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.000
That's also good longterm too, for you.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Yeah.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Yeah, it really is.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Yeah.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.560
I just, you know, there, there are some trends in the IT industry that they got me worried

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.560
sometimes.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.560
Yeah.

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.560
Yeah.

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.560
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:11.920
I'm looking forward to it.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:12.920
Now what else?

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:13.920
Come on.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:14.920
What else?

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:15.920
Get us excited here.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:16.920
This is your space.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:17.920
Give us a tease.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.440
Oh, well, here's the thing.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:24.920
I can only go so far with, but before, oh, you don't want to reveal live.tv and tune

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:25.920
in.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.560
I'll give you a little bit of a tease.

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:30.000
So have you, have you played with C file yet?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.920
Is that, is that maybe that, that has to be a thing.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.920
You got me close.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.240
You've, you've got me close.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.240
Yeah.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.000
We should do a little demo during Linux Fest.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.360
I think the best way to sell you on C, I think the way to do it, knowing what I know about

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:46.480
you, I feel like I, so first I think I should make the disclaimer, like I'm going to manipulate

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.480
you.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.240
I think that's how I excuse myself from the manipulations I talked about.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.600
If I tell you, then you can't be like, oh, he's no, I'm just being upfront.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.600
All right.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.680
So that'll be our, that'll be our, that'll be our system.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:03.480
I think the way to do it is to just offer it to you as, as if it is a hosted thing that

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:10.720
you could just go sign up for, you know, because you think that's what it takes a service to

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.720
get them.

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:12.720
Yeah.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:13.720
Go ahead.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:14.720
Now, now say like the thing that's going to trigger me.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:19.080
So no, I think I will really, what I thought, I think it is, is if I were to put words to

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.400
it, I think the words are Chris wants all the benefits of self hosted stuff, but he

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:28.080
doesn't necessarily have the time or the, or the, or the luxury of being able to have

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:31.920
to figure that out unless it's something that he relies on.

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.020
So I feel like if you were going to, if you're going to go all in and like base your business

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.120
off of it, no doubt you'd host it yourself.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.560
But I feel like for just like, I'm going to try this, not really sure.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.000
I feel like the way you do that is to say, here's a given instance, go play with it,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
see what you think.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.040
And then if it works, then you say, okay, now how do I move this onto for myself?

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.040
I'm looking forward to that.

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:54.920
And I'm definitely willing to try it because honestly I, you've really kind of sold me

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:55.920
on it.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.920
That, what was it?

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:57.920
Two weeks ago you did an episode on there.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.240
I can't remember, three weeks now.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.240
And you were talking about it.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.240
Oh yeah.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.720
And you were talking about it when we were in person too.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.320
And so that really kind of got me, that really kind of got me sold.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.960
All right, I'll give it a go.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.960
I'll give it a go.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:09.960
You know, I'm not married to Dropbox.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:15.240
I just, I think it's done pretty well, but it's expensive and you know, I would imagine

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:18.080
things are going to be changing there now that they filed for an IPO.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:23.120
Yeah, and the other thing is too, is when I look at the, when I look at the cost and

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:27.360
I start saying, man, the amount of flexibility that you would have with this software thing

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:31.320
over here and the amount of flexibility that you have that I know exists with Dropbox.

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.600
And I'm like, I'm looking at some of this stuff and I'm like, man, from a production

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:39.960
standpoint for what you have to do with file syncing and it's just, I don't know, it's

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:40.960
pretty amazing.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:47.040
Well, isn't, isn't the limitation of self-hosting servers, don't get me wrong.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:52.560
I love the idea as sort of a hacker, hacker mindset, but isn't the limitation if you need

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:58.360
to access that from outside the, your network, you're limited by your upload speed connection.

01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.520
Yeah, of course.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:06.040
But we have ways we've partnered up with some, with some managed hosted providers that I

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:12.440
can, we can get servers now for 25 bucks, two terabyte, four terabyte storage arrays,

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:17.920
you know, eight gigs of RAM and dedicated Xeons for 25 bucks a month.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.040
Like when you start getting to there and you can start putting those servers all over the

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.840
US and then you start hooking them together so that one talks to the other and so that

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:29.200
your data starts to basically set up your own little mini CDN, you start getting to

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:33.440
that point and all of a sudden it's like, man, how is Dropbox going to compete with

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:52.060
us?
