00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
Let's see, Dan, just before you go, will you say welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,440
Linux talk show?

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,900
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show, dude.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:28,200
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 236 for February 13th, 2018.

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,400
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's reporting back from the front

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,260
lines of the desktop.

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,260
My name is Chris.

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,260
My name is Wes.

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,260
Hello, Wes.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,720
I'm very excited about today's show.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,840
We've got a ton of great stuff.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,840
We do.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,840
We do.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,400
We have some follow-up items that are quite choice if you had an opportunity to listen

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,880
to 235, but there's a big embarrassing story for Apple this week, and us open source enthusiasts

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,000
can't help but laugh a little bit.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,160
Turns out Razer, not so interested in supporting Linux after all, maybe put off those plans

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,560
for a laptop, but KDE's got you covered with a new slim book, too.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,360
We'll take a look at that, and then Mr. Foray is here, Mr. Foray from the esteemed elementary

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:18,640
OS project to tell us about why the hell they're jumping from 0.4 to 5.0.

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
What kind of gumption?

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
A whole new world.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,980
We're going to figure that out, plus last Friday, since we gathered here together, I

24
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,680
went down to Microsoft.

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,520
I visited the third floor of one of the swankiest offices I've ever been in, and I asked them

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,280
all of the questions, everything from literally, are you trying to kill Ubuntu, to why the

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,720
hell are you open sourcing.NET Core and PowerShell?

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
Wow.

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Yeah.

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,160
And they just let me ask whatever question I want.

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,800
I'm going to play some of that for you here on the show, talk about Azure and Linux and

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,640
about where that's going, and the super awkward position that it seems Microsoft has found

33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,920
themselves in with Windows, plus we will talk about our plasma challenge.

34
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,960
We'll do a little check-in on the plasma challenge and see where everybody's at, see who's moving

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,120
on, see who's sticking around.

36
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,040
There's tons coming up, so let's not go a moment further without saying holler at our

37
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:26,560
mumble room, time-appropriate greetings, virtual lug, hip-hip.

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,280
All right, guys, well, we have so much to get into this week, and I have it all opened

39
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,360
up in a tab on Firefox.

40
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,720
This is like, by the way, just totally random, but I don't know, I'm like week four into

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,760
Firefox now, version 58 right now.

42
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,440
I never thought I'd hear you say it.

43
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,680
I mean, this is like the third or fourth unplugged with no Chrome.

44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
No Chrome.

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
How's it going?

46
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
I mean, you're still here.

47
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
You don't seem to be pulling your hair out.

48
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,000
I think my favorite feature is how Firefox restores tabs.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,520
Instead of opening a new window and then populating that window with all of these random-ass tabs,

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,560
it just resumes all of the tabs in the window that I have open.

51
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,640
The reason why I like that is because I can do it while my browser is on camera, and you

52
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,800
have no idea I just did that, just all silently in the background without lagging out my browser,

53
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
without lagging out my OS.

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
Poor broadcaster's tip for you.

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
I know.

56
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
And my battery life's way better too.

57
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,040
Anyways, totally random.

58
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,480
And also random this week, I thought we'd start with kind of an embarrassing story for

59
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
Apple.

60
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,440
They had some forced open source disclosure this week.

61
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,480
Did you see this?

62
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,280
The iBoot firmware, yeah, they call it iBoot.

63
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,080
Of course.

64
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
What else would you call it?

65
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,720
I don't know, anything but iBoot, to be honest with you, anything, actually, but iBoot would

66
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
be what I'd call it.

67
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,360
Well, uBoot was taken, so.

68
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,960
But it sounds like an intern or somebody at the level of an intern posted Apple's super

69
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,080
secret firmware source code onto GitHub for whatever reason.

70
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,760
They like the jail cell.

71
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:03,080
And within hours, within about a day or so, Apple got a DMCA complaint filed with the

72
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,880
GitHub company.

73
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,120
But it's sort of like no going back on this kind of thing.

74
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,040
Once this thing is out there, there's really no taking it back.

75
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,240
And you've got to wonder if maybe jailbreakers and hackers can use this stuff.

76
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,680
And what's weird is Apple's statement, Apple responded with a comment, something about,

77
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,000
we do not rely on the obscurity of our source code to enforce its security.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, like one of those, boom.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,240
We were just happy to have it as a layer there for a while.

81
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Yeah.

82
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
For as long as we could.

83
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,560
Yeah, it sounded like the person involved was pressured from some of the community that

84
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,080
wanted the information about how to develop jailbreakers and other such applications.

85
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Yeah.

86
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
I-Boot.

87
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
And then it's leaked further than that.

88
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,960
It's a second stage bootloader, Wes.

89
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,560
It's just so, I don't know.

90
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,920
There's something about all of Apple's stuff.

91
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,760
You got the Secure Enclave.

92
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
You got the I-Boot.

93
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,320
You got the T2 chip in the iMac Pro.

94
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:04,000
It really feels like Apple is circling in on jailbreakers and the Hackintosh community

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,240
just to give them the old traditional Apple butt wiener in about another year.

96
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,840
All of the things are lining up right now.

97
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,040
The T2 chip is going to be something that will undoubtedly ship in new MacBook Pros

98
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,880
and the new Mac Pro, and that is literally a iPhone system on a chip that verifies the

99
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,440
cryptographic integrity of the Mac operating system.

100
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,920
I mean, that's where their heart's been for a long time now.

101
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,640
There's no way the Hackintosh community is going to have a quick remedy to that.

102
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,960
That's going to be easy for anybody.

103
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,080
And that's just going to populate across all of the Mac platform.

104
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,560
And then you combine it with all of the other techniques that they're doing, like with signing

105
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,480
of applications and the Mac App Store.

106
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,080
It's just the Hackintosh community can't have more than two years.

107
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,720
I don't think you're wrong, and a lot of this is in the name of security, and a lot of it

108
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
can really be understood.

109
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Yeah.

110
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Yeah.

111
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
Honestly, it-

112
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,200
I don't think that some of this actually does solve, but from our perspective as the 1%

113
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,040
techie crowd, it's not.

114
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
But okay.

115
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,480
But put yourself in the position of maybe you're one of these companies that's really

116
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,120
buddy-buddy with IBM, and IBM now preaches the gospel of Apple, and they come in and

117
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,480
they say, replace all of your Windows 7 and Windows XP machines with iPads and MacBooks.

118
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,160
I already did that.

119
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
It's fine.

120
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
It's easy.

121
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Okay, sorry.

122
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,000
That's just so funny.

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,640
What are you going to do?

124
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,160
Anyways, so you go in there, you replace all your machines with Macs, because that's cheap,

125
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,840
and then you really want to get to the point where you can verify that the operating system

126
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,060
is secure, and the applications are secure, and so it's kind of within the corporation's

127
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,600
best interest that Apple does lock this shit down.

128
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Yeah.

129
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,740
I mean, absolutely, right?

130
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,920
You could even say the Hackintosh community isn't even a factor in their decision-making

131
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
process.

132
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,640
They're not, yeah, they're not large.

133
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
Why would it be?

134
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,740
I think it's really just been a, perhaps Apple being nice or not overly, you know, not really

135
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,240
caring about it up to this point.

136
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,560
But if it gets in the way of some of their security and marketing objectives, then they

137
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,720
really have no reason to let them benefit.

138
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,120
I wonder if we could figure out, like wouldn't it be amazing if somebody could figure out

139
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,320
like, well, it's going to be one in 15 Hackintosh users become desktop Linux users or something

140
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
like that?

141
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
That would be.

142
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,160
Anyways, here's kind of a fun thing about Apple using the DMCA to take down the code

143
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,540
off of GitHub.

144
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:34,040
Under penalty of perjury, that on the case of Apple, that means that the source code

145
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,160
has to be legit.

146
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Because if Apple is using the DMCA to take down that source code, and then they go to

147
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,560
court over it, and it turns out it's not legitimately their source code, they're screwed.

148
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,680
In other words, that means the source code that now tons and tons and tons and tons of

149
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,800
people have copies of is legitimate source code, because they use the DMCA, which confirms

150
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,000
it's legitimate, which is...

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,120
It's funny how that kind of works, right?

152
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,680
You're really enjoying yourself on this one.

153
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,680
I am.

154
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
It's nice to see you happy.

155
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
Thank you.

156
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Thank you.

157
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,560
Because, you know, then I reflect on another laptop company like Razer, who was offered

158
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,920
the source code to update firmwares on Razer laptops, and they said, no, thanks.

159
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,160
This is, of course, by one of the folks involved with the Linux vendor firmware project where

160
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,200
they are shipping firmware updates via GNOME software and other mechanisms.

161
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,440
We've talked about it a lot on this show, one of my favorite things.

162
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
Absolutely.

163
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,000
And also, one of the developers emailed Razer and said, what could I do to help you start

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,600
shipping your firmware updates?

165
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,560
How about I will write you code from scratch, example code that you could actually just

166
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,680
take and use that would be ready to go.

167
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,080
In fact, how about I do all of the work, I hook everything up for you, you just got to

168
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,160
give me some of the details and it's good to go.

169
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,080
And nothing happens.

170
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,560
And nothing happens.

171
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,840
And then eventually, an email comes back and the email says, we've discussed your offer

172
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,960
with a dedicated team and we're thankful for your enthusiasm and for the good idea.

173
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,160
But I'm afraid I also have to let you know that at this moment in time, our support for

174
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,600
software is only focused on Windows and Mac, i.e. you've done all the hard work, you've

175
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,680
gotten everything ready for us, you're actually even solving a problem for us and some of

176
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,800
our customers, but we can't be bothered to give you the time of day.

177
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,320
I've got an alternative point of view on this.

178
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,120
I'd love to hear it.

179
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:44,160
So OEMs such as Razer who go to OEMs may have to enter into contracts, which prevents the

180
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,800
redistribution of firmware and BIOS images.

181
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:56,320
And this may be a well-crafted polite reply to rebuttal the fact that they don't have

182
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,800
an arrangement with their ODM that enables them to redistribute the firmware images.

183
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,520
So you're saying it's a way of answering the question without kind of crapping on their

184
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,000
partner saying, well, our partner's agreement doesn't allow us to do that.

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Exactly.

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah.

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,080
So I don't know, I don't have any insight into who Razer's ODMs are, but some of the

188
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:29,520
other Linux-focused OEMs certainly do fall into this category where they are not permitted

189
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:36,720
to redistribute these images and consequently doing this work is not open to them.

190
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Right.

191
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,560
So to be clear, to sort of clarify what you're saying is based on your experience and my

192
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:50,640
experience in communicating with certain Linux-first hardware vendors that are reshipping upstream

193
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,080
original equipment manufacturers' hardware like perhaps say a Clevo, there is an agreement

194
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,880
in place in which as part of that – because it's been around – these have been around

195
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,520
for years now, that part of that agreement is you cannot directly redistribute our firmwares

196
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,800
to your – or any kind of like updates to the firmware too to your customers.

197
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,740
They have to be distributed directly from us.

198
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,760
And then there's different iterations of this agreement that might say, well, under

199
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,340
these conditions you can distribute firmware or under these other conditions you can distribute

200
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,280
the firmware once we've signed off on it.

201
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,480
There's a bunch of changes to it, but that's essentially what you're saying.

202
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,880
Exactly that because if you enter into an agreement with say Clevo and as the equipment

203
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:45,240
manufacturer you are requesting some customizations to buy us some firmware, those are not something

204
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:51,440
that Clevo want to be reshared and redistributed because it's specific to your contractual

205
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,440
obligations.

206
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Right.

207
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,940
And the customization of that firmware is sort of the product that they are – part

208
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,680
of the product that they are selling back to the reseller.

209
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:09,160
So Clevo is going into some sort of business arrangement with these resellers and saying,

210
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,520
all right, we will make these changes.

211
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,660
You go validate this on your hardware and then come back to us with the changes you

212
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,680
want and then Clevo makes the changes at the firmware level and then the seller tests that

213
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,320
again and validates it and sends back more suggestions and it's a back and forth process.

214
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,040
And then eventually they have a custom firmware that Clevo has created for that particular

215
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
vendor.

216
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,800
And that's part of the value that Clevo offers.

217
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Exactly.

218
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:40,440
And this is also why you sometimes see that the Linux device manufacturers are a little

219
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,600
bit behind on offering certain chipsets of products because they have to go through this

220
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,840
validation and tweaking and customization exercise for their products in order to deliver

221
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,160
them in an out-of-the-box Linux compatible way.

222
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Yeah.

223
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Okay.

224
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
Yeah.

225
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
Unfortunate but reasonable.

226
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:08,080
So one of the devices that is probably kind of along the same line that I at first was

227
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,460
sort of skeptical of but now we're seeing a second iteration of and I'm kind of starting

228
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:19,200
to get it now is the KDE Slimbook and now we have the KDE Slimbook 2.

229
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,600
And it's not like it's going to like blow you away with the hardware specs.

230
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,120
It's a 13.3-inch screen.

231
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,560
It does have an SSD.

232
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,880
You can get it with a pretty fast 2.7 gigahertz i7 CPU which will turbo boost up to 3.5 gigahertz.

233
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,640
And you can get up to 16 gigs of RAM.

234
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,880
But again, it's not going to blow you away in terms of performance.

235
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,280
But it is one of these situations where it's...

236
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,760
How do you describe something like this, Wes, where a project can focus in on a singular

237
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
target?

238
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,560
It's not like they're designing the hardware but it gives them sort of like a...

239
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,920
They have like a reference platform they can really focus on.

240
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,120
Yeah, like a narrow set of variables, right?

241
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Yes.

242
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,880
And that's what's interesting about the Slimbook is because I feel like this could be a harbinger

243
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,600
for what we could see down the road as it becomes more available for people to ship

244
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,440
upstream OEM hardware, make slight modifications at the hardware and firmware level and then

245
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,600
have open source projects hyper-target that for a few months in development and then release

246
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
it.

247
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
And that's what we're seeing here.

248
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,280
We're seeing this with some other hardware.

249
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,960
And I think this is an interesting idea because when I first started getting into Linux, you

250
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,760
would buy like a six CD set for $65.

251
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,360
You'd go home with a box and a book and like a whole bunch of CDs where you can install

252
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,360
your Linux.

253
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,120
And that was the thing you bought.

254
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,280
But that's obviously gone away with ISO downloads and whatnot.

255
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,980
But this is almost like a new version of it today.

256
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:54,360
If I was a student and I was really passionate about Linux and open source and the Plasma

257
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,000
desktop, I'm pretty sure I would aspire to a piece of hardware like this.

258
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,560
This would be sort of that thing that I would want to get.

259
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,560
I would go mow those lawns, I would do what it would take, I would go get that side job

260
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,760
so that way I could get the perfect Plasma desktop laptop.

261
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,240
It's been tweaked for it, designed for it, thought about, cared for.

262
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
So it's nice to see.

263
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
Go ahead.

264
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,240
You told us with the previous conversation about working with ODMs in order to make the

265
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:28,680
necessary customizations that the device that ships out of the box works with the distribution

266
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,640
or operating system that isn't pre-installed.

267
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,960
So I'm a big fan of this because this is the step change that Linux on the desktop needs.

268
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,240
Downloading ISOs and sticking them on USB sticks and installing them on whatever you

269
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,200
happen to buy is all very well and good.

270
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:54,520
But actually being able to buy devices pre-installed, pre-configured, with the operating system

271
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:00,160
that you want to use, that's how you really step up adoption.

272
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,720
It also interests me the tighter coupling between the desktop maker and the actual hardware

273
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,260
details and not having one layer of distributor or system in the middle there.

274
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,720
Maybe there's some real-world concerns that will get addressed more quickly.

275
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,160
It's funny and this could just be Softpedia, but in the screenshots on Softpedia, I'm seeing

276
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,080
screenshots of elementary OS and home desktop.

277
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,920
Oh, and there's Mate right there.

278
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,400
There's even Unity below.

279
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,360
The Slimbook guys are very good.

280
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,640
While they have a specific model that's available with KDE, they support all of the things.

281
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Of course.

282
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
Of course.

283
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,480
And that's what's kind of nice when you're buying a Slimbook to run Plasma, but you know

284
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
you can run everything else.

285
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
It's all just Linux.

286
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
It is, right?

287
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,240
You can also buy a Slimbook without Plasma if you want to.

288
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,680
Before we move on, producer Michael, do you have anything else you want to mention about

289
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
the Slimbook thing?

290
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,720
Because I've just sort of covered on a high level, but I don't know if you've ever seen

291
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,560
someone in person, but with the version 2, it kind of feels like it's essentially like

292
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
a Galago.

293
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Am I right about that?

294
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,640
It's not the same ODM, but it is very similar.

295
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
Oh, it's not?

296
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
It's not?

297
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
I don't think they have Cleveland now.

298
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,120
Oh, it looks pretty nice though.

299
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:20,360
We were fortunate enough that they were at, sorry, sorry, Slimbook were at UbuCon Europe

300
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:26,960
in Paris in September last year and they had all of their devices out and there was lots

301
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:33,600
of drooling and pouring at the quality of their devices.

302
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,160
I think this version 2 looks particularly interesting.

303
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:45,680
Just to plug another podcast, if curry happens, which it might, I would desperately love to

304
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,680
see one of these in for review on the Ubuntu podcast with KD Neon.

305
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
Me too.

306
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
Me too.

307
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
I would like to see that.

308
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,840
It's a sick looking laptop.

309
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,840
It reminds me of Macs, but you know, Macs have decent looking hardware and this one

310
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,400
looks like you can get a better powerful machine roughly about the same price and still looks

311
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
like a Mac.

312
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
So hey, there you go.

313
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:15,480
Now, do you have any idea, Rodden, about how much might go up towards the Plasma desktop

314
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,660
or the KDE project?

315
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,680
Is there any kind of like, is it just, is there any, do you know if there's any financial

316
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,200
like contribution, am I giving anything towards the project?

317
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
There is a partnership.

318
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,080
I don't know what the percentages are, but I do know that they do something with it.

319
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,360
I could find out, but I don't know if they'll pan.

320
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Yeah.

321
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
All right.

322
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,880
I just think this would probably be just be great for anybody that just wants a machine

323
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,360
dedicated to run KD Neon, just go for it.

324
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,560
And it looks like great hardware.

325
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,000
I do hope to one day see my hands on it, maybe at a conference or something like that or

326
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,280
if they ever have enough units to send out for review, I think that'd be pretty sweet.

327
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,040
I'm still shopping for you, Wes.

328
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
I'm still shopping.

329
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
That's right.

330
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
You are.

331
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
You have like a first gen XPS 13.

332
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,040
Is that a first gen?

333
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,040
No, it's a second gen.

334
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Second gen.

335
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Second gen.

336
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
All right.

337
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Well, that's understandable.

338
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Is that an i5 or an i7?

339
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
i5.

340
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
An i5, huh?

341
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Man.

342
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,800
I mean, it's really just a terminal and a web browser.

343
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,880
Yeah, but you get a shit ton of work done with that.

344
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
That's not your daily driver.

345
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,880
No, it is not.

346
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Okay.

347
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
So your daily driver is a desktop?

348
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
Yeah.

349
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,000
I have a desktop replacement at home and a real desktop.

350
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,960
So like a big laptop at home and then a desktop at work.

351
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
Yeah.

352
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
Okay.

353
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
All right.

354
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
And then this is the portable version.

355
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Good man.

356
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
But you're right.

357
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
It does need replacing.

358
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
A little bit.

359
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
So I'm shopping for you all the time.

360
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
I'm just always looking for you.

361
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
I just got to make sure you get the right thing, Wes.

362
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
I got to make sure.

363
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
It's got to be right.

364
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,440
The only reason is because I got to sit here and stare at it every single week.

365
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
Exactly.

366
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
You have incentive.

367
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Yeah.

368
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
You know what else?

369
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,720
I'm going to mention Ting right now, linux.ting.com.

370
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
It's our mobile service provider.

371
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,500
It's the whole network's mobile service provider.

372
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,360
It's just a smarter way to do mobile because your average Ting bill is just $23 per phone

373
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
per month.

374
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,800
It's pay for what you use wireless.

375
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,840
However much you talk, however much you text, and however much data you use.

376
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,560
You're like a ninja with this stuff too, Wes.

377
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
You know that?

378
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
Oh yeah.

379
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
As much as you want.

380
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
I've noticed that too.

381
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,240
Like when Wes gets here, he's like, hey, what's the Wi-Fi?

382
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,280
I got to get on the Wi-Fi here.

383
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
I'm like, what's going on over there?

384
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,920
I look over at Wes and then boom, he like syncs up all his stuff once he gets on the

385
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Wi-Fi.

386
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
I'm not an animal.

387
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
I mean, come on.

388
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm a gentleman Wi-Fi caller.

389
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,680
They got nationwide coverage, CDMA and GSM networks, no contracts nor the termination

390
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,480
fee, and you can try Ting totally risk free.

391
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,820
With CDMA and GSM too, that means there's lots you can bring over in terms of hardware

392
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,820
to the Ting network.

393
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,820
It's incredible.

394
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:34,160
You know, I went from paying over $140 a month to paying around $40 a month.

395
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,400
That means I can buy like a new laptop every couple of years.

396
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,600
It's super great.

397
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Start by going to linux.ting.com.

398
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,840
Support this show.

399
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,080
Make $25 off a Ting device or get $25 in service credit if you bring a device.

400
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,340
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting.

401
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:56,800
Big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the unplugged program, linux.ting.com.

402
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,900
I just think Dan just can't stay out of the news.

403
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:05,840
Elementary OS every single damn week is doing something that's causing some bit of discussion.

404
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,300
And maybe this is just what happens when a project gets to a certain size.

405
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,240
Like every single thing they do generates discussion.

406
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:20,800
But Dan joins us this week to discuss the crazy, outlandish idea that they dare go from

407
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:26,840
version 0.4 to version 5.0 with the next release, Version Journal.

408
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
That's a big jump.

409
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,760
So Dan, you've just gone off the deep end and you just jump in numbers like OpenSUSE

410
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
now.

411
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
Yeah.

412
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,400
So, I mean, when we're just thinking about, you know, what if we took that zero and then

413
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,800
took it off, then didn't do that.

414
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
What if we didn't do that?

415
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Oh, well.

416
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
All right.

417
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
That sounds good.

418
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Moving on then.

419
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Bold thinking, Dan.

420
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,720
Now, honestly, there's kind of two reasons, right?

421
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:59,400
One is a marketing reason and one is kind of an organizational reason.

422
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,840
And we kept getting a lot of people saying, oh, you know, when is Elementary OS going

423
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
to get out of beta?

424
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Like, you guys are still in beta.

425
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,240
You know, we keep hearing like people saying, oh, Elementary OS is in beta.

426
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,520
And so it was really confusing for people to have that leading zero in there.

427
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,100
So we thought, okay, well, you know, we got to version bump that, right?

428
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,000
We got to move that up into at least 1.0 territory so people stop thinking this is a beta product.

429
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,280
Honestly, I feel like you got there with Freya, really.

430
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,140
Yeah, you know.

431
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,140
Which was 0.3.

432
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,140
Right.

433
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,480
And it's been quite an evolution, to be honest.

434
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,120
And we're, we are kind of holding off on the 1.0 because we wanted to make sure that we

435
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:46,000
had, I don't know if control is the right word, but at least influence in everything

436
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,760
that the user sees and touches, that we're able to fix the issues that our users report

437
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,320
to us.

438
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,080
And so we're kind of, we're way more there than we were before.

439
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:05,440
And this Juno release has the most elementary stuff in it out of any release before, as

440
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,780
far as our desktop environment and all the apps we ship.

441
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,240
And now we have an application ecosystem that people are developing apps for Elementary

442
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
OS.

443
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,200
So it's like a huge shift from where we were when we started out.

444
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,320
It's the stuff that actually makes the platform, to be frank about it.

445
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,480
And I like this post, I don't know if you guys intended it for this, but if I had never

446
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,640
heard of Elementary OS and all of a sudden I saw, why do these cocky sons of bitches

447
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,680
want money from me?

448
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,080
If I read this post, I would be compelled to donate lots of money.

449
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,080
Because within the screen, if you just look at the damn screenshots, it is so clear.

450
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,680
Like here, Wes, I'm going to do, are you ready for this, Wes?

451
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,600
I'm going to do a little, so here is, we start here at the beginning.

452
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,320
There's an Elementary OS Jupiter 0.1 and it looks like a GTK Gnome 2 respawn.

453
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,680
No problems here, but yeah.

454
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,600
Then you get to version 0.2 and you're like, oh, okay, it's GTK 3.

455
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,480
It's got a nice theme going for it.

456
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:09,280
But by the time you get to Freya 0.3, you have a whole lot of Elementary OS features,

457
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:15,400
including a whole bunch of nice styling, animations, a real clear visual communication.

458
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Definitely.

459
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,320
You have their own application launcher, their own settings panels, a do not disturb system

460
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
with notifications.

461
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,200
Like it's clearly its own product by 0.3.

462
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,400
Then when you look at Loki 0.4, one of the things that strikes me about Loki is it's

463
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:38,480
all of the stuff I just said, plus kind of building on top of that a more refined look,

464
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,480
clear path for third party developers, style sheets, APIs.

465
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,040
It honestly starts to become a platform by Loki version 0.4, the current version.

466
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,280
But the other thing that you guys have done with Loki that struck me, and maybe this was

467
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:59,040
the case with Freya and I just didn't notice it, but it feels like Loki just keeps constantly

468
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,440
getting better.

469
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,400
There's new stuff that just keeps coming to Loki.

470
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,480
There hasn't been this big gap while I'm just waiting for the next version of Elementary,

471
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,920
the next big drop.

472
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,000
Because in this meantime, I am kind of waiting for that, but in the meantime, stuff has just

473
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,520
kept coming down to Loki, like updates, like the App Center, for example, the updates,

474
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
all of that stuff.

475
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,580
It just is new in Loki, which has been the current release now for a while.

476
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,680
And so you guys have legitimately built a platform.

477
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,880
And I think when people say that, some people get triggered because it sounds like cloud,

478
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,840
it sounds like vlog, it sounds like blog.

479
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,360
It's one of these, it's a term, it's this nebulous term, but it's an App Center, it's

480
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,000
a design language, it's a clear path for developers.

481
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,920
It's a lack of nebulousness, right?

482
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Yeah, exactly.

483
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,560
It is something concrete now.

484
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Yeah.

485
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,840
So, but I mean, not to belabor this point, but just because this is the thing that everybody's

486
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,160
been talking about, why not just say 1.0?

487
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,640
Right.

488
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,480
And the reason why not to go 1.0 is less marketing and more organizational.

489
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,280
So that's kind of the other component of it.

490
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:12,740
And what we're looking at is we want to try to bring everything into alignment with semantic

491
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:19,000
versioning so that we have that major, minor, that whole thing going on.

492
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,220
But what we have right now is a lot of version numbers throughout all of our different products

493
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,900
that are misaligned and some of them are more than 1.0.

494
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,780
And so by just kind of removing that leading zero, then we can eventually get to a place

495
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:40,600
where across the board, like all the APIs for our 5x series are 5x and all the applications

496
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,240
are 5x, you know, get everything all kind of aligned.

497
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
Very nice.

498
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,520
So it's a Windows 10 effort then?

499
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,760
Oh, I have no idea.

500
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
Sure.

501
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,040
No, but I get what you're saying.

502
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:57,740
You're saying developers can say, okay, so you have the 5.x version of this API support

503
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,200
or this application, so I know what I can target there.

504
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,320
And then eventually down the road, it'll be 6x and 7x, yeah?

505
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
Yeah, exactly.

506
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,880
So the version number for all of our products aligns with that release.

507
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Damn.

508
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
Very nice.

509
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
Forward thinking.

510
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,560
Yeah, you're taking what I always compliment you guys.

511
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,680
Here's the clear developer story.

512
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,520
Here's how you target the platform.

513
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,840
Here's the design language you use.

514
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,960
In fact, here's a widget you can use to make it look like everything else.

515
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,920
And now you're going to the next level and saying, here's the APIs that you can guarantee

516
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
work.

517
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Yeah.

518
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:35,760
So we're really trying to get to a point where that level of clarity permeates throughout

519
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,920
the entirety of the stack and not just with, oh, it's clear for users to use applications,

520
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,080
but it's clear for developers to write them as well.

521
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:50,980
Right, because 5.0 is going to mean GTK 3.22.

522
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,520
It's going to mean high DPI.

523
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,640
It's going to mean kernel Linux version something x.

524
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Yeah.

525
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:04,440
So elementary 5.0 actually means GTK x, kernel version x, system DX, Xorg or Wayland x, doesn't

526
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
it?

527
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
Yeah, right.

528
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,480
Because the new 5.0 release is going to be based, or we're currently building it, on

529
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

530
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,520
So it does bring a hardware enablement stack and a ton of new APIs from all our upstreams

531
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
as well.

532
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Yeah.

533
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,160
I mean, that's the practical version of it is it's 5.0 is going to be 18.04 LTS.

534
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,000
But developers won't even need to understand that esoteric differentiator.

535
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,120
It'll just be 5.0 of the elementary OS platform has these capabilities.

536
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,360
6.0 has these capabilities.

537
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,160
But what's with the need of the dot dot o anyway?

538
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,200
Is there any need for like a 0.5 release just for beta possibly or anything like that?

539
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:58,640
Yeah, so what it is is basically the same like we did with Loki where we had a 0.4 release

540
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,280
and then we had 0.4.1.

541
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,520
And what that was is it's a bump to a new hardware enablement stack or adding new major

542
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,320
features or things like that.

543
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:14,280
So we do have those minor revisions that we'll push out if we make a new ISO release.

544
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,320
So it's something significant enough to trigger a new build, but not significant enough to

545
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,400
break API.

546
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:29,080
Also real quick, why did you name it after a very infamous film about a pregnant teenager?

547
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,080
Juno?

548
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,760
It could be or a city in Alaska, I mean, let's be honest.

549
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,680
So for our code names, we use the names of deities and it turns out that the majority

550
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,560
of the really nice sounding deity names are like Greek and Roman usually.

551
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,920
And so we did a couple of Norse ones.

552
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:57,560
The problem is I took a bunch of the solar system names with Jupiter broadcasting, right?

553
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:02,200
Well actually, not only does that make sense, Dan, but it goes deeper than I first understood.

554
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,000
So I really appreciate you coming on and explaining it to me.

555
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,960
Wow, that's great.

556
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,280
I mean, that is so great because it clearly contributes to the developer story.

557
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:22,600
Just as a super quick follow up, if you could, how much has the one week reaction reeked

558
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:27,880
for the announcement about charging for upgrades or attempting to charge for upgrades?

559
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,800
Like now that you've had a week to marinate with it, how's that gone?

560
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
I think it's been really good.

561
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,200
We've got a lot of really positive feedback and interesting comments from people.

562
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,320
Is interesting a way of saying controversial?

563
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,320
Like really?

564
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,840
Is it like, are you guys like pulling back at all or does it feel like full steam ahead?

565
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,480
No, I mean, interesting in terms of bringing up things that we were looking for people

566
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,440
to bring up like, hey, what happens in this case kind of thing?

567
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,080
And by discussing it with other people and bringing it up where we've had more plans

568
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,520
to push into, okay, well now how does multi-machine work or how does a fresh install work as opposed

569
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,200
to an upgrade or things like that or like how that was one of the major concerns that

570
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,820
people brought up that we're currently working through is what happens if I want to transfer

571
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,160
my purchases to another computer?

572
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,880
That seems like a huge problem to solve.

573
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,880
I mean, that's the number one issue that I raised and I have even gone on the record

574
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,960
and said I'd be willing to pay a bit more if I knew that it would persist across all

575
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,960
machines.

576
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,440
But that just, that seems like...

577
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,920
It doesn't kind of be expected to be persistent.

578
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
It almost is, right?

579
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,920
In this day and age.

580
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,920
Because of other app stores.

581
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Yeah.

582
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
I think that's a great point.

583
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:44,440
But the technical limitation means you have to somehow track me across all my machines.

584
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,440
Yeah.

585
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,200
So that's the major balance point, right, is how do we set things up in a way that is

586
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,320
convenient and adds these features that people want, but also in a way that is secure and

587
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,120
respects your privacy?

588
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
Yeah.

589
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,720
I do not envy that task, my friend.

590
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Not in the least.

591
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,880
No, Wes and I cover that kind of stuff all the time on TechSnap and it is a massive technical

592
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
challenge.

593
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,560
And if you ever want to talk about it, you know where to come because we'd love to hear

594
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
more about it.

595
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,400
But I'm sure that's all down the road stuff.

596
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,640
In the meantime, anything else to note about the Junos release or about the announcement

597
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,600
about the bump?

598
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
Anything like that?

599
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:30,720
Well, you know, that wallpaper that I just made for the 5.0 beta is pretty fire and you

600
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,240
can go check it out on our blog and you should download that.

601
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,200
Even if you're not running the beta, which you aren't because it doesn't exist in the

602
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,520
public, you should just stick that wallpaper out there because it's pretty sick.

603
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
That does look nice.

604
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,640
I think I will.

605
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,600
Good call on that.

606
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,840
I've been following with more and more interest, Dan, so I appreciate you stopping by.

607
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
All right.

608
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,640
Well, we'll have a link to all of that shenanigans in the show notes.

609
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,640
Go check that out.

610
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,520
I think it's going to be a big release, you know, for a couple of years, two maybe.

611
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,520
No, no.

612
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,760
I don't know if it's two years.

613
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
I don't know.

614
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,120
I guess we stopped doing last in 2017.

615
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,240
And I think we, I don't know if you look at last, I think we kind of pulled back on reviews

616
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,320
a year before that.

617
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,320
That's a good point.

618
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,800
Yeah, you kind of did.

619
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,840
And right now I've got the itch.

620
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,120
I mean, so not only do we have a new version of...

621
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,120
Spring is coming up.

622
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,120
I know, right?

623
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,120
There's distros to try.

624
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,120
Oh, I thought you were going to say it's allergies.

625
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,120
Oh, well, that too.

626
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
It's a nasty itch.

627
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,120
I'm so sorry for you.

628
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,920
Yeah, I call it Mint 19 right here.

629
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
It's got a rash.

630
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:37,360
No, I just, I have a good feeling about some of the distro releases that are coming because

631
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,080
a lot of them are based on Ubuntu, which is going to be a major update soon.

632
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,400
But a lot of them are also trying to differentiate.

633
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:50,440
I've recently started following the Solus project again with a lot of close intensity.

634
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,320
I don't know if Aiki is just trying to lure me with his Sweet Siren song, but they're

635
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,240
talking more and more about their Plasma version.

636
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,680
And there's just a lot of good releases.

637
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,380
We just recently talked with the Fedora group about Fedora Atomic and all of that.

638
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,620
So there's just so much good stuff coming down the pipe.

639
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,520
And it just means that you and I have a bunch of good stuff to talk about.

640
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,680
And a ton of great things to try.

641
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,520
Anyways, let's keep going.

642
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,480
I got a chance to go down to Microsoft last Friday and...

643
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,480
Have they turned you?

644
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
I mean, should I be suspicious?

645
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,880
Am I safe right here in the studio next to you?

646
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,240
Do you like my Windows 10 system here?

647
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,760
It's nice, isn't it?

648
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,880
No, actually, in all fairness to them, they did not try to convert me to Windows 10 at

649
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
all.

650
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,440
So I got to give them credit for that.

651
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,500
We will talk about that in just a moment.

652
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,800
But first, I want to talk about DigitalOcean.

653
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,400
It's infrastructure on demand.

654
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,040
Super fast, really reliable infrastructure with eight data centers all over the world.

655
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,880
In fact, by the time you're listening to this, it could be more.

656
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,760
That's why companies like Docker and Slack and GitLab and Tesla use DigitalOcean and

657
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,160
Jupyter Broadcasting as well.

658
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,240
DigitalOcean.com.

659
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,040
Go over there, create your account, and then use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

660
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,880
It's one word, and you'll get a $10 credit.

661
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,720
You can spin up infrastructure on demand.

662
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,020
It's one of the things that Wes and I do all the time for TechSnap is when we're trying

663
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,960
something out, I'm like, how do we talk about this in a way that makes sense?

664
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Wes knows exactly.

665
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,200
There's something we did recently.

666
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,400
I don't want to say it.

667
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
You know what I'm talking about.

668
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
I do know what you're talking about.

669
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
You know what I'm talking about.

670
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,880
And it's like, well, we want to talk about this in a way where we have actual knowledge,

671
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,120
like hands-on experience with it.

672
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,800
So you just spin it up on a DigitalOcean droplet.

673
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,800
You try it out.

674
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,800
Done.

675
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,120
I mean, we had that whole thing done within 10 minutes.

676
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,600
And then we just played around for the next 20 minutes just to see what we could do.

677
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,520
It's so great because you go from, I have this idea, to full production in minutes.

678
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,600
You can get started in less than 55 seconds.

679
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,720
And they have 99.99% uptime.

680
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,420
If you want to deploy just the base system or an entire infrastructure, you can do it

681
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,120
over at digitalocean.com.

682
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,280
And they've just revamped their pricing.

683
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,900
So it's just even more competitive.

684
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,440
It's just ridiculous now.

685
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,280
And they have mix and match droplets.

686
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,360
So in the past, it was like, you buy this droplet for this price.

687
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,120
And now you can just mix and match disk and CPU and RAM.

688
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,480
It's going crazy.

689
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,520
And then you combine that with block storage, which just shows up as a Dev SDA device on

690
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,560
your Linux rig.

691
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,840
Or you can go next level and go with object storage, which is 100% compatible with all

692
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,200
of the S3 CMD type API command stuff.

693
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,260
But it's on DigitalOcean infrastructure.

694
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,880
So really great backup programs on Linux.

695
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,640
And all of that stuff just works with DigitalOcean spaces.

696
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,000
It is so worth your time.

697
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,640
And if you can go over there and use our promo code with a $10 credit, that'll help.

698
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,980
You can play around with your own custom spun backup system that just specifically hones

699
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
in on your needs.

708
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,360

717
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,400
That was, I tell you what.

718
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,680
Going down to Microsoft stressed me out.

719
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:41,080
Because I, this is why one of the main reasons I got out of IT contracting is I have this

720
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:50,960
really super weird anxiety about going to a certain place at a certain time when I have

721
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,800
to navigate like a comp, I'm actually having a slight panic attack just telling you about

722
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,800
this.

723
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
I'm really.

724
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
Take it slow.

725
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:06,080
I have this anxiety where if I need to be someplace that's like way south of Arlington

726
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,240
at a certain time and I have to like park somewhere and then navigate like a series

727
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
of buildings.

728
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,840
Especially somewhere you haven't been to.

729
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,600
Specifically it comes up when I go to Amazon or Microsoft or T-Mobile.

730
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,160
Like whenever I go to a, we're like a multi-building campus and I have to be in a certain conference

731
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,360
room at a certain time and just like I've never been to that campus.

732
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
So navigating it.

733
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
Do you know what I'm talking about?

734
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,200
I'm legitimately having a panic attack just telling you about this.

735
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,560
And so that is how I spent my entire Friday last week was that I spent the first half

736
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,200
of the day having a panic attack.

737
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,900
And then I spent the second half of the day going to Microsoft.

738
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:45,680
And then once I'm on site I am as cool as a cucumber.

739
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,200
Legitimately no anxiety.

740
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,200
I am 100% comfortable.

741
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,840
We just have to get you there.

742
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,040
Yeah I just have to get there and like get to where I need to be.

743
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,040
And once I'm where I need to be and I have plenty of time I'm completely comfortable.

744
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,280
So I showed up an hour early.

745
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,840
With traffic and anything else?

746
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,200
How else can you plan for that?

747
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,600
And I had my lady Hadia come with me for emotional support because she's really good at navigating

748
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,600
when I'm totally just like totally anxious out.

749
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,800
She'll do the driving, the navigating, the parking in the parking garage and like all

750
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,040
of that that totally takes care of my anxiety and lets me just focus on the task at hand.

751
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,600
And so she came with me to essentially be my emotional support partner.

752
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,040
I know that sounds ridiculous but I don't know what it is about these companies.

753
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,380
But they give me this sense of anxiety because like when I go to meet other business owners

754
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:45,640
or community members like we go to a bar or I go to their house or something like that.

755
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,920
But they're standing behind the counter and you're like oh hi yeah you own the business.

756
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,320
It's a totally different thing and so when you go to to Microsoft's Bellevue campus which

757
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,440
I had never been I've only I've only been to the Redmond campus at Microsoft.

758
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,740
It's like a totally different experience.

759
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:09,440
So you park in the parking garage and you work your way up the elevator and you go across

760
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,960
what they call the breezeway.

761
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,920
And I have a picture of it on the video version if you're watching right now of the breezeway.

762
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:24,560
And it feels like you're walking through an old Roman palace with marble everywhere fountains

763
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,520
Gucci stores with gold walls and LED lights.

764
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,440
So that's why you look so nice today.

765
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,880
Yeah it's it is it is full of stores that I think get one or two customers a day.

766
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:44,660
I mean this is a very ritzy place in Washington and Microsoft has a temporary they have two

767
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,640
buildings and the building I was going to is a temporary building.

768
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,880
They call it the Braven building.

769
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,920
And when I finally when I finally got there and I got past the Gucci stores and the in

770
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,240
the Prava stores and the water fountains and the statues and I got through the elevator

771
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:09,280
and got to the third floor I arrived at the reception desk.

772
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,120
And of course I had to get the parking validated because that's what you do in Bellevue.

773
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,120
Right absolutely.

774
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,880
You know what was a little disorienting is the first thing that you see isn't the reception

775
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,160
desk.

776
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,080
It's actually it's funny it's it's one of those things that's really it just drove home

777
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,080
to me.

778
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,940
I'm obviously in a business filled with geeks.

779
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:33,060
When you walk in through the main door the first desk you see isn't reception.

780
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,560
The first desk you see is tech support seems sort of appropriate.

781
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,340
So you get there and you open up the glass doors and you see this huge desk and you walk

782
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,160
up to it and you're like I'm here to see.

783
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,080
And before you get those words completely out of your mouth you see I.T. you see support

784
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,280
and you see guys that look just like you.

785
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,960
And you go this is tech support isn't it.

786
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,120
They're like they're like yeah receptions over there.

787
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,600
We get this all the time.

788
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,800
So obviously for geeks.

789
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,680
And so we get there we check in I get the parking validated.

790
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,240
I'm sitting around in like these future space chairs look like they're off the set of Star

791
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,920
Trek Discovery.

792
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Are you wearing any Linux swag.

793
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,920
I did dude.

794
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,600
I wore the thank you for asking.

795
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:23,440
I wore the last finale head hoodie with the with the final last logo with the year.

796
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,880
It's the shirt I'm actually wearing now only with our full run year on it.

797
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,520
And I so I wore the hoodie but underneath it I wore my nicest blue business dress shirt

798
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,960
button down business shirt.

799
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,960
You're a professional.

800
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,000
And I wear nice slacks.

801
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,440
So I was going for the corporate lifestyle reject look so that way they could acknowledge

802
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,080
and accept me but and wouldn't feel off put but yet would understand I'm not one of them.

803
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,080
Right.

804
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
You speak their language but you're not.

805
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,240
Yeah that's exactly.

806
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,560
And so we're sitting around in the Star Trek Discovery future chairs and they all and you're

807
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,560
looking over this marble promenade that has fountains and glass fixtures and the Gucci

808
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,160
stores and then behind us are these future lights look like they might be the transporter

809
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,120
room on the USS Discovery.

810
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,780
And as I'm sitting there just sort of taking all of this in a Jeffrey's assistant walks

811
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,780
up to us.

812
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,440
I mean after all Jeffrey is a fellow at Microsoft.

813
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,440
Yeah.

814
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,440
Hi Susan.

815
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:26,480
Oh no problem.

816
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,060
So I hand off the microphone to Hadia and we go through several different layers of

817
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:35,800
glass doors that she seems to authenticate with her badge and then the glass doors open

818
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,560
and then she says something to us that sort of stuck out.

819
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,920
And I had to I had to like think about it for a moment before we sat down and before

820
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,320
we did all of our conversation she says to me and to Hadia would you like to buy something

821
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:57,200
to drink before we go into the conference room not would you like something to drink

822
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,540
would you like to buy something to drink.

823
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:05,060
Now my experience at the Redmond campus was on every floor they just have like a store

824
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,680
area where you can just go in and get anything you want for free.

825
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,840
But this is a temporary building that they're only in for a couple of years so they don't

826
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:18,200
have the traditional Microsoft infrastructure and it gives it like this small company feeling

827
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,680
because they're not like regular Microsoft.

828
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,080
Yeah we've got the soda machine out back if you need something.

829
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,480
So I turn around the corner and we meet Hadia and I we meet Jeffrey and Joey.

830
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,480
Thank you.

831
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,480
Hi I'm Chris.

832
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,480
Hi Jeffrey.

833
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,480
Nice to meet you.

834
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,480
Joey.

835
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
Nice to meet you.

836
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,480
Nice to meet you.

837
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,480
Nice to meet you.

838
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,480
Nice to meet you.

839
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,480
Nice to meet you.

840
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Nice to meet you.

841
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,480
Nice to meet you.

842
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,480
Nice to meet you Hadia.

843
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,480
Hadia.

844
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,480
Hadia.

845
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,480
Nice to meet you.

846
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,480
Hadia.

847
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,480
Like quesadilla nice to meet you.

848
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,480
Yeah excellent.

849
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,480
Where should we sit.

850
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,480
You own the room.

851
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,480
Oh well OK then.

852
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,480
And Jeffrey might have been the most perfect person for us to talk to.

853
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,480
Yeah I'm Jeffrey Snover.

854
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,480
I'm a technical fellow at Microsoft.

855
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,040
He's been there for 18 years and Joey also joined us.

856
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,980
He's the PM for PowerShell.

857
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,920
And what's great about both these guys is they're Linux guys.

858
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,160
I'm Joey Aiello, and I'm the program manager for PowerShell Core.

859
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,340
But while I was setting up for the interview, and so I apologize for the audio and some

860
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,760
of the noise in the background, but we just had the recorder going.

861
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,280
While we're setting up to start talking to them, Jeffrey tells me that 18 years ago,

862
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,200
he never thought he'd work for Microsoft.

863
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,080
You know, I was reading your, or listening to your podcast about, oh, they're doing this

864
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,080
and this.

865
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,080
And it's like, no, that's not it.

866
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,080
No, that's not it.

867
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,080
Okay, good.

868
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,080
Well, that's a good place to start.

869
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,080
Exactly.

870
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,080
Way too much credit.

871
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,080
Oh, really?

872
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,080
Oh, I see.

873
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,080
See, I had some sort of master plan.

874
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,080
Yeah.

875
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,080
Well, I do tend to.

876
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,080
Yeah, that was the thing.

877
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:45,280
When I started the company, like, the last thing I wanted to do was to come work for

878
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,280
Microsoft.

879
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,840
You know, I thought them the evil corporate, evil empire, I knew all this.

880
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:57,400
And then when I came and visited, you know, I actually, my joke was I never joined Microsoft,

881
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,400
I joined this one executive.

882
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,880
He was just an awesome exec.

883
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,480
And then I got in here and it's like, oh, yeah, no, it's not malice.

884
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,480
It's not evil.

885
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,480
It's just people whose hair is on fire.

886
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,400
People whose hair is on fire, which totally echoes some of my other industry experience.

887
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,400
And so I'm like, oh, that's, that's super interesting.

888
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,960
Joey, the PowerShell project manager says, Oh, yeah, me too.

889
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,960
I was a Gentoo guy.

890
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,680
I never thought I'd work at Microsoft.

891
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,680
It was the same for me.

892
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,680
Yeah.

893
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,680
Really?

894
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,400
Yeah, I mean, come in from college, and I've been here almost four years and it's, it's,

895
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,640
you weren't thinking you'd be at Microsoft either?

896
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,640
No.

897
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,640
But you do.

898
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,680
Yeah, you come in and meet a bunch of smart people and everybody's solving problems and

899
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,680
it's like, oh, okay.

900
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,680
Yeah.

901
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,520
It's just, you realize very quickly, you know, everything was always official, right?

902
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,720
It's like you see something come out, like an update or something and it's like, oh,

903
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,720
it's Microsoft, right?

904
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:52,000
That like put this thing out and you're like, like, oh, it's just like, there's three guys

905
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,320
over there that just like did that, you know, yeah.

906
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,320
Especially when it's a big company.

907
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:01,320
You tend to think it's like, oh, it's a team of a thousand, a team of two thousand.

908
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,320
Right.

909
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,320
Right.

910
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,320
Exactly.

911
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,320
No, it's like general.

912
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,320
Wow.

913
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,320
Yeah.

914
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,960
It was really kind of interesting because they, they, they felt, I felt from them, like

915
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,820
they wanted to advocate their position.

916
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,240
And I got a sense that's kind of why I was there.

917
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,840
And the PowerShell team specifically, you know, now Microsoft has open sourced a lot

918
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:24,560
of things, including.NET Core, Visual Studio Code, and then PowerShell came along.

919
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:30,000
And I think they knew that there would be a lot of skepticism in the Linux community.

920
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,600
And they also knew that they had a long road ahead of them.

921
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,720
But I got the sense that they were completely committed to it.

922
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,720
And that's why I was there.

923
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,040
You know, we just knew we were not going to be greeted as like liberators to the Linux

924
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,040
community.

925
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,040
Right?

926
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,040
So it's like, okay, how do we deal with that?

927
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,040
How do we get the tone right?

928
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,040
Yeah.

929
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,040
How do we get the culture right?

930
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,200
Both in the product and how we engage them.

931
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,200
We're still trying to figure that out.

932
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,200
Yeah.

933
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,200
That's what the conversation was in CoderRadius.

934
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,440
So what is going on?

935
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,780
So I kept having the conversation.

936
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,080
I got them on mic.

937
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,520
This is all just on the preset up while we're getting ready to go.

938
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:03,960
I got them on mic and I started to get a sense of why Microsoft is trying so hard.

939
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,680
You know, you can judge how successful they are with engaging open source community with

940
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,840
being a quote unquote good Linux community citizen.

941
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,440
But I got a real sense that there is something that's driving them.

942
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,900
It's not just marketing.

943
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:27,740
I got a sense that perhaps the situation is becoming such that one of their biggest money

944
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:33,980
makers, Azure, is simply becoming a predominant Linux platform.

945
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,640
And that's just the reality that they're in.

946
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:40,920
And no matter how Microsoft spins the numbers, there's more and more Linux systems than Windows

947
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,920
systems on Azure.

948
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,280
Yeah, no, I don't know if you've seen, but on Azure, you know, look, here's the reality.

949
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,300
I mean, you just look at the world and do the math, right?

950
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:58,100
If we say Azure is the Windows cloud, okay, well then you're taking off a very large portion

951
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,100
of the world.

952
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,240
You're just saying, I'm not going to go get that market.

953
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,720
That doesn't make any sense.

954
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,520
And then you can't be a trusted supplier to those companies that said, I want a heterogeneous

955
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,520
world.

956
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,460
So we have been investing for years in great Linux support.

957
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:19,560
And now that number of Linux VMs is almost equal to the number of Windows VMs.

958
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,560
That's impressive.

959
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:26,760
Because I think the last number I heard from Azure was 30% or something like that, which

960
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,760
is getting higher and higher.

961
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,320
Yeah, it's going higher fast.

962
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:34,120
And he does one of these like way higher, like gestures, like it's maybe more closer

963
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,920
to 50-50.

964
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,020
And Microsoft can't spin that any other way.

965
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,600
They have to acknowledge that reality.

966
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,720
So he said something in there that sounded like spin, but I got a better understanding

967
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,720
of it.

968
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,040
He said, you know, we've invested for years in Linux.

969
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,840
Well, what the does that mean, right?

970
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,760
Yeah, that's a very vague statement.

971
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,480
I went deeper on that in Coderadio this week.

972
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,480
And I kind of encourage you guys to go check that out.

973
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,600
I know that's a super punt.

974
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,200
And I apologize.

975
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,200
But we just talk about the tools that people use for developing software deeper in Coderadio.

976
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,640
So in episode 296, Chris goes to Microsoft.

977
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:16,640
Specifically Joey, who we haven't heard from yet, talks more about retooling their Windows

978
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,200
only team around Linux and all of that stuff, which was really interesting.

979
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,780
So we do deep dive into how they made that transition.

980
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:29,640
But I wanted to talk with you guys about the really super awkward spot that I was sensing

981
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,360
that Microsoft is in.

982
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:39,520
And I really appreciated what they couldn't say in this clip.

983
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,040
I want you to listen with certain kinds of ears on.

984
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:50,080
Microsoft, I think, this is Chris here speculating, but I think Microsoft has realized that the

985
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,240
future is not on Windows.

986
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,440
The hot action for the future is not Windows.

987
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,500
Perhaps maybe they even have some insights into what a shit show Windows is that we don't

988
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,120
have on the outside.

989
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,280
And so they fundamentally understand at a level that we can't even appreciate on the

990
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,720
outside of why Windows is not our future.

991
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,300
I'm just going to speculate here for a moment.

992
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,080
Maybe I'm wrong.

993
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,080
But they seem to be in a very awkward position.

994
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,560
They can't just come right out and crap on Windows and say, Microsoft is no longer about

995
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,280
Windows anymore.

996
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,440
Microsoft is all about open source and Linux because they have a billion users on Windows

997
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,880
who will go, well, what the hell, guys?

998
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,520
What about us?

999
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,960
At the same time, they can't come out and say, Windows is the best thing ever because

1000
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,560
they'll piss off all of the Linux and open source community, which is where they're trying

1001
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,560
to get to.

1002
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,200
However, we've had some experience here, and basically what we want to do is to not try

1003
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,360
and give a signal on any platform.

1004
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,200
As much as possible, what we want to do is we want to support all the platforms that

1005
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,920
somebody wants at the same time.

1006
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:59,200
So we had an exec that had come from Sun, and they said, yeah, so we're so committed

1007
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,760
to Solaris, and people thought, well, we're not committed to Linux.

1008
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,960
And so we said, you know what we're going to do?

1009
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,960
We're going to prove that we're committed to Linux.

1010
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,440
So we're going to do Linux a week before we release the Sun thing.

1011
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,200
And then their entire customer base said, oh, so you're not committed to Solaris anymore.

1012
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,600
It's like, oh, they just got it wrong.

1013
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,400
So we don't always get that right.

1014
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,800
But wherever we can, we're going to say, these are the platforms we want to support, and

1015
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,680
support them all at the same time.

1016
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,920
And then I suppose right now, from a lot of our perspectives on the outside, it's a bit

1017
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,400
of spinning up to Visual Studio Code's out now,.NET's out, PowerShell is out.

1018
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,320
It seems like a bunch of ketchup, but what this really is is going to just become the

1019
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,320
new normal.

1020
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,320
Yes, that's right.

1021
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,320
The new normal.

1022
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,320
Wow.

1023
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,320
So what is that?

1024
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:50,320
The new normal is they slowly bring a lot of things up to cross-platform over time.

1025
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:59,080
So PowerShell and OpenSSH come to Windows, and PowerShell comes to Linux and Mac, not

1026
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:03,240
because they just all of a sudden decided to flip a switch, but because they open-sourced

1027
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,240
.NET Core.

1028
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,240
And then they rebase PowerShell Core on.NET Core.

1029
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,720
You see where we're going here?

1030
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,440
I do.

1031
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,360
And with that, after they've laid the groundwork for.NET, and they've gotten developers on

1032
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,360
Git, and then once they've gotten developers understanding Git and taking pull requests

1033
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,200
and all of that, then they get them on Visual Studio Code.

1034
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,520
And once they have everybody on Visual Studio Code debugging the software, then they can

1035
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,680
launch PowerShell Core.

1036
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,240
And we go into more details in Coderadio.

1037
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,320
But the thing that they said, which I thought was pretty remarkable, is PowerShell Core,

1038
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:41,440
the version that's on Windows, and the version that's on Linux, and the version that's on

1039
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,920
Mac, is replacing standard PowerShell on Windows.

1040
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,640
So no more PowerShell on Windows.

1041
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,640
I mean, it's going to be there.

1042
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,840
They're going to maintain it.

1043
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,840
Right.

1044
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,840
Well, of course.

1045
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,320
But the version that's shipping on Linux is the future of PowerShell Core.

1046
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,680
Do you see what I'm saying?

1047
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,760
The version that's on Windows, the original version of PowerShell?

1048
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,880
I'm Joey Aiello, and I'm the program manager for PowerShell Core.

1049
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,440
And Joey here for PowerShell Core is the guy that's heading all of this up and helping

1050
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,880
them get ready to make this open source version to replace this version that's been shipping

1051
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,080
on only Windows for years.

1052
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,080
It's been phenomenal.

1053
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,080
Yeah.

1054
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:26,880
So we actually were proud to state that in the release of PowerShell 6 that roughly half

1055
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,960
of the pull requests that came in for PowerShell 6 were from the community.

1056
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,920
So they've open sourced PowerShell.

1057
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:38,280
They went with PowerShell Core 6, and they've had a pretty good engagement from the community.

1058
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,060
But I thought, you know, this was, I don't know, it's almost too perfect.

1059
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,200
So I wanted to ask them a few other questions about it.

1060
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,880
And I wanted to get specifically into bugs.

1061
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,680
So I'm going to replay this clip from the beginning and taking a perspective of what

1062
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,680
about bugs?

1063
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,840
What about people contributing issues back to PowerShell?

1064
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,840
It's been phenomenal.

1065
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Yeah.

1066
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:02,680
So we actually were proud to state that in the release of PowerShell 6 that roughly half

1067
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,560
of the pull requests that came in for PowerShell 6 were from the community.

1068
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:11,200
In particular, we had a ton of work done in the web commandlets, the invoke web request

1069
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:17,520
and rest method layer by one contributor in particular, Mark E. Krause.

1070
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:23,240
There's also been a number of guys just sort of cleaning up the long tail.

1071
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,120
This is one of the great things about open source, right?

1072
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,520
You have people who know they need these really big features and are highly experienced and

1073
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:38,840
are able to code up all these custom rest method and authentication headers and proxy

1074
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,880
bypass and multi-part support and all these things in the web request layer.

1075
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:48,440
But then you have folks who say, hey, all your error messages still say Windows PowerShell,

1076
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,440
right?

1077
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:54,480
And someone who has a lot less coding experience is able to sort of jump into GitHub, make

1078
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,600
a contribution for the first time, scrub all these error messages and improve the product

1079
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,600
for everybody.

1080
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:05,000
And it's one of those things that we know is important but that we'd probably not get

1081
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,380
around to or if we did, something else would have to get sacrificed, right?

1082
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:13,880
And by having people who, the sort of Wikipedia approach, right, of like you have a thousand

1083
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:19,840
people fixing your typos, then you really end up with a much higher quality product.

1084
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:24,080
And we've seen a lot of that in PowerShell.

1085
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,360
And I think that 50% community PR number is a testament to that.

1086
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,360
Yeah, okay.

1087
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,360
So that is pretty good.

1088
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,360
Yeah.

1089
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,360
But I pushed Joey a little bit further.

1090
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:37,720
I'm like, okay, yeah, but there must have been some sort of esoteric typical open source

1091
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,960
community moment.

1092
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:44,280
And Jeffrey and Joey kind of both smile and they look at each other and go, well, there

1093
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:51,840
was the very first issue that came in that happened to be a bit memorable and it happened

1094
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,940
to be from the curl developer.

1095
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:58,160
So we're all sort of very happy and patting each other on the back.

1096
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:04,260
And about five or six hours later, a pull request came in from none other than the creator

1097
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,260
of curl.

1098
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:11,600
I'm going to get his name wrong, but his first name is Daniel.

1099
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,600
Really awesome guy.

1100
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:17,280
We had an email exchange afterwards and just a super nice guy.

1101
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:24,640
But the gist of the pull request was simply to remove two aliases from PowerShell.

1102
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:31,280
So some years ago, PowerShell had used a bunch of aliases for some of the core commandlets

1103
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,500
in order to entice or make things more comfortable for Linux users with no expectation at the

1104
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,580
time that PowerShell was going to ship on Linux.

1105
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:44,560
So for instance, ls was an alias as was dir for get child item to get the directory listing

1106
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,840
or even CD.

1107
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,760
So some of the aliases that were added were curl and wget.

1108
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,960
And those were there to draw users to invoke web request and invoke REST method.

1109
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,240
Well, the creator of curl, rightfully so, said, that's the name of my project.

1110
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,280
You're not invoking curl.

1111
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,560
Curl for Windows has been out for a very long time and you're making things really hard

1112
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:11,680
for my users who have to tack on.exe in order to run curl for Windows.

1113
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:17,240
So now that you're open source, you're trying to be good guys, add this back or remove this

1114
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,400
alias.

1115
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,680
And we responded in kind saying, hey, this is totally agree with you.

1116
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,960
This is a breaking change.

1117
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,600
We got to follow our governance process here that we had fortunately codified very explicitly

1118
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,080
and said this is our process for breaking changes.

1119
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,600
And he was very amenable and understanding of that.

1120
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,740
But within a few minutes of having posted that pull request, it was now number one on

1121
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,120
Hacker News.

1122
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:49,320
And we had GIFs and trolls, Michael Jackson eating popcorn, hundreds, like it took minutes

1123
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,120
to load in my browser kind of thing.

1124
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:57,160
So we got a very good lesson very early on on the importance of optics and how these

1125
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:02,740
things – it was these two aliases that really drove hundreds of people to our project.

1126
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:07,920
But ultimately I think we took care of it in a memorable way and we removed the aliases

1127
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,120
among a number of other aliases in PowerShell Core.

1128
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:15,000
We decided to leave them in Windows PowerShell for some period of time because users were

1129
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
depending on them.

1130
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,400
It's now best practice not to use aliases in scripts so that you're not depending

1131
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,240
on them.

1132
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,860
But the nice epilogue as we were saying to the story was that Curl is actually now available

1133
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:27,960
in Windows.

1134
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:33,280
So we need to go revisit that and yeah, in the next version of Windows we're shipping

1135
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,340
Tar and Curl.

1136
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:39,240
So yeah, we live in a brave new world for sure.

1137
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,840
A brave new world that ships Tar and Curl in Windows.

1138
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,600
Heck yeah.

1139
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,600
You know, I bonded with Joey.

1140
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,600
So Jeffrey –

1141
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:51,640
So that's where you get that pro license from, I see.

1142
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:57,440
What impressed me about Jeffrey is that he has been at Microsoft for 18 years.

1143
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,720
And we cover this in Coda Radio, again, sorry, obnoxious plug, but he talks about how he

1144
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,980
went into Microsoft and created PowerShell with the intention of essentially trying to

1145
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,080
rip off some of the stuff you can do in Bash.

1146
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,040
He's like, I even wrote a blog post about it.

1147
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,360
I've always acknowledged this.

1148
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,120
And it turned out it failed horribly.

1149
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:19,320
And then he totally talks about why it didn't work on Windows and it's super interesting

1150
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:25,580
because it's much more about where Linux is now with JournalCTL and it's a great talk.

1151
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,580
Obnoxious plug one more time.

1152
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:30,280
Go check out the whole interview because I really went down there for Coda Radio and

1153
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,880
I grabbed that stuff for this show.

1154
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,040
I went down there.

1155
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,760
So go check out Coda Radio 296 where we have more.

1156
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:41,680
But I love talking to those guys because neither one of them thought they'd be Microsoft employees.

1157
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,680
And then they ended up there.

1158
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,040
Jeffrey's been there for about – Jeffrey's been there for 18 years.

1159
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,280
Joey's been there for four years.

1160
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,800
And he and I were Gentoo users at the same time.

1161
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,760
So we – after we were done –

1162
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,760
Kindred spirits.

1163
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,520
Yeah, we chatted about all of that and had a good chat.

1164
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:00,160
But JJ, I know you had some things you wanted to mention and I wanted to open it up to the

1165
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,160
VLog for anybody else.

1166
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,960
But JJ, did you have something – I saw something go by that you wanted to start with.

1167
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,480
So I open it up to you, sir.

1168
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:15,280
So me personally, I am a dual booter still at this moment at this time in this conversation.

1169
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,720
And I also still pay attention to a lot of Windows news and it's not really a surprise

1170
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,560
that Microsoft is embracing open source.

1171
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:32,720
Satya Nadella's – during the early days of Satya Nadella's tenure, he sort of emphasized

1172
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:37,280
the future is with devices but not specifically Windows devices.

1173
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:43,880
And I do remember that presentation he had with that iPhone with Microsoft services on

1174
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,880
it.

1175
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,720
And that was like a shock to a lot of – probably a lot of Windows geeks.

1176
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:55,520
And also with the fact that Windows Mobile is not really a viable option at this point

1177
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,920
and other stuff like that.

1178
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:05,720
And there's also talks about also with the future of Windows 10 S and also with the rumor

1179
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,040
Polaris devices.

1180
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:15,800
It seems that Windows seems to be less of a power user OS and more of a normal OS.

1181
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:22,680
But I'm not sure if like Linux will take – I mean Linux will probably take over the

1182
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,200
power users to those who actually really want it.

1183
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:30,840
There are still those enterprises who sort of are not looking at Linux at the moment

1184
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,040
and I'm sort of – it's sort of a mix.

1185
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:38,160
So I couldn't like put this in recording and play it as a clip.

1186
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:42,960
But the thing that I walked away with, the understanding that I managed to achieve, like

1187
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:49,980
the meta understanding was – how do I put this in a way that's not insulting to myself?

1188
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:56,100
So a lot of the stuff that I have sort of been calculating as a master stroke by Microsoft

1189
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:03,520
to sort of embrace and extend Linux isn't so much that as it is the result of about

1190
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:10,080
three and a half years of people that used to be suppressed that now have a little more

1191
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:15,520
leverage and certain people were laid off and made room for folks like Joey about four

1192
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:21,000
years ago and guys straight out of college that were running Gentoo four years ago were

1193
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,000
allowed to come into Microsoft and run things like the PowerShell group.

1194
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,920
And they did a bit of a changing of a guard.

1195
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,520
And there were people like Jeffrey who's been there for 18 years who are always kind

1196
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:39,040
of hip to – I'm coming here as a former Unix user and I want to bring Bash to Windows

1197
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,400
– which is where PowerShell came from.

1198
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,240
So he was already kind of hip to the future direction.

1199
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:50,000
So folks like him now have assistants and their own corner office and their own people

1200
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:56,120
working beneath them and they can summon podcasters like me to their office because they hold

1201
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:00,120
way more authority than they did under Balmer or Gates.

1202
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:06,040
And folks like Joey who's four years out of college are running the PowerShell core

1203
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:12,640
group now and he's got people on his team where they run Max, that's all they do is

1204
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,640
they use Max.

1205
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:17,880
He's got a guy on his team who runs Arch, he's got plenty of users, we talk about people

1206
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:24,120
that are running Ubuntu because they're working on PowerShell which is a shell so they have

1207
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:30,000
to be using it every single day to work out the things that shells do differently on different

1208
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
operating systems.

1209
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:37,600
Absolutely and also I would like to say that I do have a connection to I think the head

1210
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:43,520
of the Microsoft graph and he's an open source proponent and Linux user as well.

1211
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:49,040
Well I'm not sure if he's an open source proponent but he does use Linux.

1212
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:59,720
Yeah I kind of wonder if the big secret about Microsoft isn't anything that we've speculated

1213
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:05,560
about like the thing that we've missed is the dirty secret, the elephant in the room

1214
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:11,400
about Microsoft is they've moved beyond Windows before their customer base has.

1215
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,400
Oh yeah definitely.

1216
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,400
Right?

1217
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,400
Very much.

1218
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,400
Yeah of course.

1219
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:21,520
But they're still making money from it so they can't say anything and it's super awkward

1220
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:25,440
for them and so like you go down there and these guys are pretty enthusiastic about what

1221
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:31,000
they're doing but they can't come right out and say Windows is the past because they'd

1222
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,640
be happy for people to continue using Windows for the next 25 years.

1223
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,120
Go ahead they'll sell it to you.

1224
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:40,240
Yeah go ahead we'll ship it on Windows, we'll ship it on the web, we'll ship it on the Mac,

1225
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,760
we'll ship it on Linux, we're happy to do it.

1226
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:52,200
They used a term that we go into more detail on QuotaRadio but they use a term called Ambient

1227
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,680
Microsoft.

1228
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,020
Ambient Microsoft.

1229
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:03,520
They just want to be anywhere and everywhere that you might need them and he said Jeffrey,

1230
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:13,520
the mission that was communicated to him by Saatchi directly, make it possible for our

1231
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:19,240
customers to do more with their computers and our sales guys will figure out a way to

1232
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,960
make money from it.

1233
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:27,360
So that was the directive, not make it work on Windows, not make it a platform lock-in,

1234
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:32,440
figure out how to make them more money and get them to do more work with their computers

1235
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,960
and our smart sales guys who we pay way too much money to will go out there and figure

1236
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,360
out a way to nickel and dime them for it.

1237
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:43,200
So he's detached now from that and if you think about that, that's an interesting thing

1238
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:48,680
because that's where PowerShell comes from on Linux because now Linux administrators

1239
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:55,160
from their Linux, from their Ubuntu desktop can manage with one script an Ubuntu box and

1240
01:06:55,160 --> 01:07:04,600
15 Linux servers and 15 Windows servers and 15 CentOS servers and 15 SUSE servers, right?

1241
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,360
And a handful of Macs.

1242
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:12,320
All of these now can be managed from one script and they take care of all of the communications

1243
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:21,400
between RPM and Debian or all the different implementation layer things.

1244
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,760
If you're a Windows shop and you've got a bunch of SUSE systems and Ubuntu systems and

1245
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,880
CentOS systems, that's pretty valuable all of a sudden.

1246
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,480
Or you buy someone else and they have those systems.

1247
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,840
Which is actually something that happens more often than we talk about.

1248
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,840
Totally.

1249
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:39,840
Then you start to understand, oh, that's why it's ambient Microsoft, that's why they're

1250
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:45,520
open sourcing.NET Core and PowerShell.

1251
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:50,800
Because then all of a sudden, when you're coming from a huge Microsoft infrastructure

1252
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:56,280
and on-premises setup that's really deep in Windows, you can use some of your investments

1253
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:00,760
in scripts to administer your systems, to set up users, to create databases, to set

1254
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,440
up patches.

1255
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,860
You can start to leverage that time across Linux systems.

1256
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:11,400
And it can be on an Ubuntu, a SUSE, Fedora, CentOS machine.

1257
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,520
And the name attached to it, the brand attached to it, is Microsoft.

1258
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,560
Which is about as damn good as Google, Apple, and Microsoft.

1259
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,200
And then whether you need new infrastructure, be it Linux or Windows, you'll reach for their

1260
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,200
cloud.

1261
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,580
I'm not sure where I sit with all of this, but I do recognize from a position of somebody

1262
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:32,100
who was in the trenches trying to implement this stuff and when somebody would come at

1263
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:36,040
you with, well, this is IBM Tivoli backup.

1264
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,680
It's made by IBM.

1265
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,780
So we should implement this.

1266
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,780
And then we did it.

1267
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:44,260
And it was the worst freaking backup system we'd ever used.

1268
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:49,080
And then later on down the road, well, Microsoft recommends that you should upgrade an NT4

1269
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,400
network to Windows 2000 and definitely don't use this Linux thing.

1270
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,840
And then that all of a sudden became a benchmark in which we were judged by.

1271
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:00,600
And it was this, you couldn't avoid the brand.

1272
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,880
Well now that brand can be used to manage Linux systems.

1273
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,040
And they can be on-premises.

1274
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,440
They can be in Azure cloud.

1275
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,920
They can be on digital ocean.

1276
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,400
It doesn't matter.

1277
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,400
And they don't care.

1278
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,400
They don't care.

1279
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,700
They legitimately don't seem to care.

1280
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:18,280
If you want to run it on an Ubuntu box and you don't have any Windows systems on-premises,

1281
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,920
but you want to use PowerShell, they're happy.

1282
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,920
Go for it.

1283
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:21,920
Yeah.

1284
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,920
They're good with it.

1285
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:23,920
Like, okay, we'll be there.

1286
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,160
We're Ambi at Microsoft now.

1287
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,160
It's really something.

1288
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,160
Just like the rain, man.

1289
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,160
Just like the rain.

1290
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,160
I don't know what to make of it.

1291
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,160
Yeah.

1292
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:35,000
They're basically taking the Pacific Northwest weather patterns and applying it to...

1293
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,840
It's an interesting structure, too, for the business.

1294
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:44,760
Instead of building what the salesmen sell, the salesmen are selling what you create.

1295
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:49,120
It also leads to better products and all that from Microsoft.

1296
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:56,960
With regards to the Microsoft Garage experimenting on Android and iOS with many of their apps,

1297
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:03,960
this idea sort of stemmed from their mobile give-up of Windows Mobile, I would say.

1298
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,160
Yeah.

1299
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:10,480
I think after Windows Mobile kind of failed and Windows RT and all that stuff, and then

1300
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:16,040
Satya Nadella takes over, there's just sort of this, all right, we'll figure out how to

1301
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,560
make money at doing this.

1302
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,880
That's just sort of been the drive.

1303
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,000
So I have a question.

1304
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,620
I'm actually seeing Microsoft moving away from providing an ecosystem with their operating

1305
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:35,160
system to more something like providing infrastructure and projects regarding software that runs

1306
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,160
maybe everywhere.

1307
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,160
Yeah.

1308
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,160
Right.

1309
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,160
I would agree with that sort of summarization.

1310
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,160
Yes.

1311
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,160
Okay.

1312
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:47,040
But what about all the legacy software that is out there that relies on the Microsoft

1313
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,040
Windows 10 code base?

1314
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,040
Yeah.

1315
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,520
Then they're happy to keep making money from that, too.

1316
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,520
Yeah, sure.

1317
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,240
But that's definitely not something that will change in a few years.

1318
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,240
No, I think that's...

1319
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:56,240
That's not going away that quickly.

1320
01:10:56,240 --> 01:11:00,240
I think that's why they're more than happy for the situation.

1321
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,240
That exact reason.

1322
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,240
Right.

1323
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,240
Yeah.

1324
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,240
And there's also the bridges such as...

1325
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,240
Wait.

1326
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,240
Hold on.

1327
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,240
Let Producer Michael go.

1328
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,240
Sorry.

1329
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,040
I was just going to say that Microsoft is compartmentalized.

1330
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,600
So yeah, this one group might be...

1331
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,120
We want PowerShell to be everywhere.

1332
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:19,960
We want Azure to have Linux and.NET is open source and all that stuff.

1333
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:20,960
Yeah.

1334
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,440
But the other side is making Windows 10 and they're locking everything down.

1335
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,440
Yeah.

1336
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,440
There's different...

1337
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,440
There's different priorities, there's different fiefdoms.

1338
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:37,880
However, I did genuinely get the sense that what they're cooking, everybody else is smelling.

1339
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:42,000
It starts with one or two projects and then it's something else in the company, then something

1340
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,360
else and it does seem to be a bit of a snowball effect.

1341
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:47,920
But I'm not going to say you're going to tell you that they're going to open source Microsoft

1342
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:48,920
Office.

1343
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:49,920
Right.

1344
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,920
But the autonomy is interesting, too, right?

1345
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:51,920
It's more about...

1346
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:52,920
In some ways, it's about they weren't told no.

1347
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:57,160
It's like, oh, you want to make VS Code an Electron multi-platform and you're not using

1348
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,340
Windows technology?

1349
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,340
Not a problem.

1350
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:02,840
And so that just gets fed back into the company.

1351
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,840
Yeah.

1352
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:10,040
And now when they write the debugger for.NET Core, instead of it being a Visual Studio

1353
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:15,020
only thing, it's something that they just sort of like open sourced and there's like

1354
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,680
an Emacs plug-in.

1355
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,680
You can do it in Vim, you can do it in Visual Studio Code, you can do it in Atom.

1356
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:21,680
It's just this...

1357
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,680
All right.

1358
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:26,120
So they're going to see this approach and I think it's going to make them just a crap

1359
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,120
ton of money.

1360
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,120
Yeah.

1361
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,120
Yeah.

1362
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,120
Yeah, it is.

1363
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,120
It is.

1364
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,120
And they're going to get rich.

1365
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,120
They're going to make...

1366
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,120
They're going to be...

1367
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:38,260
They're going to be one of the biggest money makers off of open source.

1368
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:40,640
Isn't that something?

1369
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,280
They've gone from cancer to this.

1370
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,760
I mean, it was deep and, I mean, think about this.

1371
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,760
We need to move on.

1372
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,760
But think about this.

1373
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,640
It was in the DNA of this company.

1374
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,840
Like Bill Gates goes to one of the computer clubs and says, you're devaluing software

1375
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:56,840
by giving it away.

1376
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,840
He writes him...

1377
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,680
He writes this letter, a manifesto and says, we've got to stop giving away software.

1378
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:02,680
We've got to charge for it.

1379
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,440
I mean, it's in the DNA of the company.

1380
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:09,800
And then Bill Gates moves on, he goes and becomes whatever he is now.

1381
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:15,280
And Balmer takes over and it's all about Windows everywhere.

1382
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,560
It's all about Windows everywhere, Windows first.

1383
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:22,040
And now here we are, and Linux is a cancer when Balmer's running.

1384
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,920
And now here we are with Saatchi and the people that have sort of been reshuffled underneath

1385
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,480
Saatchi three or four years later, definitely feels like a different message.

1386
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,480
What were you going to say?

1387
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,480
Yeah.

1388
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,320
So it seems like Microsoft has got the Linux chemo in now.

1389
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,760
Yeah, right.

1390
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,760
They did, right?

1391
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,760
Yeah.

1392
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:40,760
Nice.

1393
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:45,940
I mean, wherever we're at, I think one of the bigger commentaries is the Linux Foundation

1394
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:56,800
now will sell you a $300 course, a $300 course on administering Linux on Azure, LFS 205.

1395
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,060
It is a course from the Linux Foundation on using Linux on Azure.

1396
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:07,160
That's where we're at in 2018, is the Linux Foundation is selling you a $300 course on

1397
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,160
that.

1398
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,160
I'm signing up right now.

1399
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:13,960
I mean, if that doesn't tell you where things have gotten in the last few years.

1400
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,080
So everybody's waiting around for it.

1401
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,720
I appreciate all you guys waiting.

1402
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,800
We're going to do our plasma check-in.

1403
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:20,800
You're running it.

1404
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:21,800
Yeah.

1405
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:22,800
I'm running it.

1406
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,800
I've been updating like crazy.

1407
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,800
Like crazy.

1408
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,800
Yeah.

1409
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,800
You even did too.

1410
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,800
I thought you weren't going to update this.

1411
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,800
I don't know.

1412
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,360
For some reason, I thought you were on a different version or something.

1413
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,680
I thought I was too, but no, I've been keeping up better than I realized.

1414
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:36,200
Look at me.

1415
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,720
You know what, Wes?

1416
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:38,720
This is what happens.

1417
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:43,520
Wes either manages all his systems with this centralized management platform that can handle

1418
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:49,320
millions of systems or he's just app get updating like a maniac and then a little upgrade here

1419
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,360
and there and who cares, right?

1420
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,360
You know it.

1421
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,360
I like how you roll, Wes.

1422
01:14:53,360 --> 01:15:00,120
Well, so I've been trying out KDE Neon User Edition and other folks like, I think, Popey

1423
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:05,840
and I know Noah have been trying out KDE Neon LTS Edition.

1424
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:15,440
Well, those evil planning sneaky jerks over at the Neon Project who have been setting

1425
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:23,680
all of you LTS users up for ages, preparing you for a big, big trick, have pulled out

1426
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:31,020
the rug from underneath you and devastated your lives by hiding the Neon LTS Edition.

1427
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:36,160
So I gotta tell you, so every week, there's a couple of stories that I get a bunch of

1428
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:39,440
feedback on or like links.

1429
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,720
And I actually am not saying this to stop any of it because sometimes it's actually

1430
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,260
a very valuable data signal.

1431
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:48,940
So I'm not disparaging those of you who did this, but I got a lot of telegrams and tweets

1432
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:54,720
and emails this week about, hey, Chris, did you see what they're doing?

1433
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:57,340
Hey, did you see what they're doing, Chris?

1434
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,240
And they would send me the link to this blog post.

1435
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:04,880
It's short, it's one paragraph, it's one dense paragraph by Jonathan Riddle over at the Neon

1436
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:05,880
blog.

1437
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:12,160
And it says this, with the new Plasma LTS came an update to KDE Neon LTS Edition and

1438
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:15,960
lots of people asking which edition to use and what the difference is.

1439
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:23,160
I'll say this too, by the way, once we announced the KDE Neon Plasma Challenge, the number

1440
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:29,200
one question without any kind of like close competitor, the number one question that we

1441
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:34,120
got was, are you doing the user edition or the LTS edition?

1442
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,120
And what's the difference?

1443
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:38,600
In fact, I would be willing to bet, producer Michael, is that not one of the number one

1444
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:42,360
questions that's in the telegram group and then the community is, what's the difference

1445
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:46,360
between the LTS edition and the user edition, yes?

1446
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:52,280
That's the number one question I get every time someone ever mentions Neon at all.

1447
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:56,920
And so I'm not surprised when I read that that was the number one question that came

1448
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,320
into the project.

1449
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:02,640
And so they say this caused us to review the purpose of the LTS and as a result, we've

1450
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,880
just hidden it from the download page.

1451
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:09,880
So I wanna dig a little bit into this for a second because it has caused some people

1452
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:12,160
to say, what's going on?

1453
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,200
Why is the project abandoning their LTS?

1454
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,200
What's going on with?

1455
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,200
I don't know.

1456
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,200
Figure it out.

1457
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,720
Well, you know what we have figured it out.

1458
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,860
We have, and we'll tell you more about it here in just a moment.

1459
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:27,440
But first, as we do here on the show, we gotta pay the bills, we gotta thank Linux Academy

1460
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:32,000
and I gotta thank everybody for signing up at Linux Academy.

1461
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,400
You might notice that we have the same sponsors here on the show from time to time.

1462
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,920
I don't know if you've noticed that or not.

1463
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:37,920
Have you noticed that?

1464
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:38,920
Not at all.

1465
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,560
Yeah, I appreciate that a lot, Wes.

1466
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,560
No problem.

1467
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:42,560
I got your back.

1468
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,560
Yeah.

1469
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,560
Just like Linux Academy.

1470
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,720
Yeah, they do, don't they?

1471
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,480
And here's why.

1472
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:55,240
We could spend our time researching show topics, contacting guests, building community, trying

1473
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,640
out different infrastructure items.

1474
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:01,860
Or I could spend my time selling the show to different advertisers.

1475
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:03,840
And I could have mattresses on here.

1476
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,840
I could have food.

1477
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:05,840
All the mattresses.

1478
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,840
Hey, what about HelloFresh?

1479
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,200
Would you like to have some sleep?

1480
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,200
That does sound fresh.

1481
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,200
Yeah.

1482
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,200
Well, there you go.

1483
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:15,040
And what I've decided to do instead is I've decided to invest in certain sponsors that

1484
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,280
are genuine fits for our audience.

1485
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,640
Like Linux Academy.

1486
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,320
I honestly know that all of us can use this service.

1487
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:27,420
I'm a subscriber, so I can say that with confidence.

1488
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:32,200
They give you advanced training tools to increase your skills and encourage critical thinking

1489
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,640
around everything about Linux.

1490
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,000
So think about that for a moment.

1491
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,020
That's where they start, right?

1492
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:40,020
That's where they start.

1493
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:42,640
So that's going to make you super competitive in the industry.

1494
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,720
And then they give you the tools to accomplish this, like hands-on labs, scenario-based labs.

1495
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:50,640
They'll spin up virtual machines if it's AWS or if it's a local Linux box.

1496
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,120
You can SSH into that and get a hands-on experience.

1497
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,840
They have human beings, actual instructors that can help you whenever you get stuck.

1498
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:01,000
They have self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux, cloud, and DevOps topic.

1499
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:07,200
And my favorite freaking feature about Linux Academy is their course scheduler.

1500
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:13,200
Because I've got three kids, I run my own business, and I fancy myself a road tripper.

1501
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:16,200
So when the hell am I going to get any kind of studying done?

1502
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,000
When am I ever going to learn about new things?

1503
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,680
Well, my friends, Linux Academy has a course scheduler.

1504
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,840
You pick what she wants to do.

1505
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,160
You set your time frames, and they'll help you stick to it.

1506
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:30,920
If you want reminders or goals, you want to download the study guides, they'll help you

1507
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:32,640
do all of that.

1508
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:36,280
And then when you're ready to take the exam, they've got testing for that too.

1509
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:38,360
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1510
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:42,000
Go there, sign up for a free seven-day trial and support the show.

1511
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,600
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1512
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:47,600
And a big thank you to Linux...

1513
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,600
I know, right?

1514
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,400
A big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1515
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,400
Okay.

1516
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,560
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1517
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:58,040
So guys, let's do our plasma updates.

1518
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,740
Let's do our plasma check-in.

1519
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:04,960
Because I thought this would be like a big production, because we made a big deal about

1520
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,560
it last week.

1521
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:11,120
And now that we're here, I just have a big...

1522
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,200
This is what I'm doing now.

1523
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,120
This is how I'm doing it from now on.

1524
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,080
It's just sort of now my life.

1525
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,960
I don't have like a, oh man, plasma totally failed me story.

1526
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,680
I don't have anything like that.

1527
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:24,260
It's just a big, this has been great.

1528
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:29,320
And I would say I like it better today than I did the week before and the week before

1529
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,320
that.

1530
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,320
Is that right?

1531
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:32,320
Yeah.

1532
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,320
Why?

1533
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:37,060
Well, the 5.12 upgrade was solid for me.

1534
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:39,600
And I think you experienced this today too.

1535
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:45,440
When I move between machines, and then I open up console, and it's been like a week since

1536
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:50,200
I've opened up console, and that son of a bitch opens up in the same exact place that

1537
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:51,200
I opened...

1538
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,200
You know what I'm talking about.

1539
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,200
I sure do, yes.

1540
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,200
It opens up in West.

1541
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,200
It's just right there.

1542
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,200
Right where I left it.

1543
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:59,080
Right where my memory goes, where my muscle memory goes.

1544
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:01,440
It's like super small stuff like that.

1545
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,120
I mean, it's that times a thousand.

1546
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:08,360
I know that seems stupid and small, but if you added up to all of the stuff, like the

1547
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:13,600
quadrant tiling, when I'm moving my windows around, and the way it snaps, then I can resize,

1548
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,440
it just works so damn fast and efficient.

1549
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,560
I can't even help myself.

1550
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,680
You feel like you're coming home a little bit more?

1551
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,680
Yeah.

1552
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,680
It's like mom's cooking.

1553
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:26,280
It was nice, but it was more like I was using a public terminal and I kind of spun up a

1554
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,280
new shelf.

1555
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,280
You know what?

1556
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:29,280
Here's what it is, West.

1557
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,760
Gnome is like me living out in the city.

1558
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,320
I'm out living in the city.

1559
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:34,480
It's clean.

1560
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,840
There's a lot of different delivery services.

1561
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,480
It's kind of got like a coldness to it.

1562
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,700
That's gnome.

1563
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,700
That's gnome.

1564
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:47,480
But like plasma, plasma is like coming home to mom's cooking.

1565
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:48,680
Get it out of here.

1566
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,600
And it just is delicious.

1567
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,540
It just works the way I want it every time I come back to it.

1568
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:57,200
You know, it's just the same thing mom's been making me for the last three weeks.

1569
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,200
And if it's-

1570
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,400
Cheesy goodness right there on top.

1571
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:04,960
And if I haven't gotten, I'm going to underball this.

1572
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,460
Everybody likes to exaggerate on the internet.

1573
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,920
I'm going to under exaggerate here for a second.

1574
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:16,480
I've gotten a hundred different tweets and telegrams and emails and I'm under exaggerating.

1575
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:21,080
And I would say eight out of 10 are switching.

1576
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,080
Wow.

1577
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,080
Yeah.

1578
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:26,080
I would say there's a couple that are like not working for me.

1579
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:31,480
In fact, the number one thing I think I've heard because it's about five of them is they're

1580
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,480
going back to cinnamon.

1581
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,480
Cinnamon.

1582
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,480
Interesting.

1583
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,480
Cinnamon.

1584
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,480
Cinnamon.

1585
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,480
I know.

1586
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,480
Right?

1587
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,480
Okay.

1588
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,480
I know.

1589
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:42,480
I mean, I've enjoyed cinnamon a lot.

1590
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,480
Me too.

1591
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:44,480
Me too.

1592
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,480
Me too.

1593
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:46,480
Me too.

1594
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,480
Me too.

1595
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:48,480
It's just funny though.

1596
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,480
It is funny, right?

1597
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:50,480
Okay.

1598
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,480
I'm not trying to laugh at them.

1599
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:52,480
No, no, no, no, no.

1600
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,480
I'm not.

1601
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:54,480
I'm not.

1602
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,480
I'm not.

1603
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,480
Because I've been there.

1604
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,480
But it is like a weird one.

1605
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,480
Cinnamon.

1606
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,480
Anyways.

1607
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:11,080
You said them like a mate link at the end.

1608
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:15,480
So I want to go around the horn here and I want to start with Mr. Neonpoby because I've

1609
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,280
gotten a lot of different people interested in this.

1610
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:21,120
But the one I'm most curious in is, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, Poby.

1611
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:26,480
But I think you and I were both like Unity 7 for life before this experiment.

1612
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:27,480
Correct?

1613
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:31,760
Yeah, I'm not a distro hopper by any stretch.

1614
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,960
Like I've used Unity for years and years and before that I used Nome 2.

1615
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:40,640
I've used Ubuntu forever since it's existed and before that Debian and before that Red

1616
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,640
Hat.

1617
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:42,640
So we're talking a very, very long time ago.

1618
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,320
So I just don't switch distro at all.

1619
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:50,160
And that's not because I'm employed by Canonical, but I didn't switch before I started working

1620
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,160
at Canonical.

1621
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,840
That's a big waste of work and time.

1622
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:53,840
Like that stuff.

1623
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:54,840
Right.

1624
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:55,840
It's getting used to new stuff.

1625
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,840
You got kids.

1626
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:01,360
It's like, you know, that whole question about why do you use what you use, it's because

1627
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,360
I like it.

1628
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:07,400
It's not because the competition is terrible or because other things, you know, have awful

1629
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,400
workflows.

1630
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,400
It's just I like the workflow that I have.

1631
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:13,520
So everyone else who hates it, fair enough, use something else.

1632
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,520
I like this.

1633
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,520
Yeah.

1634
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,520
Well said.

1635
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:17,520
I like Unity 7.

1636
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:22,680
So yes, I have been, you know, Unity 7 for life, Unity 7 Master Race and all that stuff.

1637
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:29,280
But you suggested KDE Neon, so I thought I'd give it a go.

1638
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,600
Now here we are.

1639
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,000
You and I are over two weeks, really, in how long we've been using this, but it's a solid

1640
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,400
two weeks.

1641
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,400
What is your thoughts?

1642
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:45,960
If you don't count the faffing around on the plane, yeah, I'm still using it.

1643
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:50,160
I'm talking to you now from a mumble snap on KDE Neon like I was last week.

1644
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,160
Still works.

1645
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:55,600
I don't even think I've rebooted since last week, I don't know.

1646
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:56,880
But yeah, it just works.

1647
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:03,640
It wakes up super fast when I open the lid and all my windows refresh and like you said,

1648
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:10,020
you open console and it opens in exactly the same place, the same size, same font size.

1649
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:12,560
Everything just remembered where it was.

1650
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,000
Yeah, everything seems to be working.

1651
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,480
I didn't have quite as smooth experience as you did with the upgrade to 5.12.

1652
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:22,480
Really?

1653
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,980
You went from 5.8 to 5.12.

1654
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:26,840
You got it the day before I did.

1655
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,840
I went from 5.11.

1656
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,640
No, that's not why.

1657
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:36,120
So you did it the day before I did and I got it pretty soon after the next day.

1658
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:41,680
The problem I had was their server went down while I was midway through an upgrade or they

1659
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:47,600
rebooted it or it had an outage or it was just, let's be favorable and say it was super

1660
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:54,160
popular because there were lots of people joining us on this journey and lots of people

1661
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,600
are upgrading at the same time.

1662
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:56,600
Could be.

1663
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:01,720
That's entirely plausible and so I got network disconnections connecting to their server.

1664
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,200
We unplugged them.

1665
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,200
Oh.

1666
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,200
Yeah.

1667
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:09,040
But all I did was wait a little while and restart the upgrade and it carried on fine.

1668
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,080
So no problem.

1669
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:14,040
I've upgraded to 5.12 and everything seems ticky-dee-boo.

1670
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,040
Yeah.

1671
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:20,720
So they're hiding the LTS version and my sense of it, and producer Michael, I'd like to hear

1672
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:26,120
your take on it because I know you've been watching the situation, is my sense of, well,

1673
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:31,600
there was some bugs in the LTS version specifically around Discover software that we just didn't

1674
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:36,560
catch because nobody on the team is using it so we don't really want to put it forward.

1675
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,680
The LTS version is still going to exist, the repositories are still getting updated.

1676
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:46,280
The main difference between the LTS version and the user edition is that the LTS version

1677
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:49,560
ships plasma LTS.

1678
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:55,280
User edition ships current plasma with the current Ubuntu LTS.

1679
01:26:55,280 --> 01:27:00,360
But wasn't there some sort of issue with Discover that sort of brought all of this to a front?

1680
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,480
It's an issue with Discover every time they make a new version.

1681
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:04,480
Is there really?

1682
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:05,480
See, I didn't know that.

1683
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,160
Is this like a common thing?

1684
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,160
Discover is a...

1685
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:11,040
I mean, someone who's a plasma fan, Discover is annoying.

1686
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,040
Yeah.

1687
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:15,600
I mean, it's one of those features that's really kind of nebulous because it's built

1688
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,800
for this supposed new user, right?

1689
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:18,800
I mean...

1690
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:24,480
Discover has amazing ideas and concepts, it's just they're not fully flushed out yet.

1691
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:29,040
So there's a lot of annoyances in that case.

1692
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:34,560
But as far as this goes, it's really a Discover problem.

1693
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,520
The main thing is that there's people not using it.

1694
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:42,160
The developers don't use it, so they put so little attention into it, it doesn't really

1695
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,160
make sense for them to do it.

1696
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,160
Bugs slip in there.

1697
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:47,120
Honestly, I never thought they should have done it in the first place because it defeats

1698
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,120
the point of neon.

1699
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,120
Right.

1700
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,120
Yeah.

1701
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:54,600
Because if you're going to roll your entire stack on top of a LTS base, why make part

1702
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:57,120
of that stack stop rolling for some reason?

1703
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:05,680
I'd say I haven't had any issues with Discover and I almost never open it.

1704
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:10,120
As I mentioned last week, I installed half a dozen snaps and I'm done.

1705
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:14,460
I've got every application I need on this system and anything, any additional libraries

1706
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:17,700
or command line tools, I'll use AppGet to install.

1707
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:23,940
The only time I've opened Discover is when I saw a notification that told me I had some

1708
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:24,940
updates to do.

1709
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:29,520
So I clicked it and Discover opened and I pressed apply and they ran and then I closed

1710
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:32,760
the window and it went away and I was perfectly fine.

1711
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,960
Discover 5.12 is 10 times better than 5.11.

1712
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:36,960
Oh, nice.

1713
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:37,960
Oh, really?

1714
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:38,960
Yeah.

1715
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:43,640
It's just that some people who are using the older versions, if you did a full upgrade

1716
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:47,980
from Discover 5.11 or 5.8, it might not go as smoothly.

1717
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:51,480
But if you use 5.12 to do any updates, it's perfectly fine.

1718
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:56,200
I've done updates with Discover just to test it to see if it would do the full thing and

1719
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,820
it most of the time works.

1720
01:28:57,820 --> 01:29:01,040
But when it fails, it fails badly.

1721
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:04,000
That's why it's not reliable.

1722
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I would just say it's like, well, 5.12 is so far.

1723
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,980
I just don't think people should use the super old stuff anyway.

1724
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:16,560
That's why I never really liked the plasma LTS anyway.

1725
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,560
And they're not getting rid of it, right?

1726
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:20,200
Yeah, because they're still testing against it.

1727
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,200
Yeah.

1728
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:22,320
They still use it for development.

1729
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:28,720
When I did the plasma video, I had to do some benchmarking so that was perfect that they

1730
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,960
had it so I could use 5.8.

1731
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:37,340
But other than that, I mean, I wouldn't bother with it because the fact that you get the

1732
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:41,840
stable upgrades from all the different plasma versions is great.

1733
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,660
I've done multiple tests, multiple machines.

1734
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:50,000
Plasma never crashes on any updates from any version, so there's no reason not to just

1735
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,480
use the regular Neon.

1736
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:56,320
Yeah, I actually agree, especially from an end user standpoint.

1737
01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:01,280
I'll tell you where I can see the purpose of an LTS version of plasma, and that's when

1738
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,040
it comes to enterprise distros.

1739
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:08,840
Now, take that for a second and then let's sort of zoom out.

1740
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:12,840
A lot of the people that are talking here have been using desktop Linux for longer than

1741
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,520
15 years.

1742
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,600
So we all kind of have some standing in this area.

1743
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,760
Popi, were you going to say something?

1744
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:21,760
No.

1745
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:30,880
No, and we're all saying this is working for us, and we're all saying this seems to use

1746
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:36,440
less resources despite the plasma is bloated myth.

1747
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:38,920
It seems to be waking from sleep faster.

1748
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,440
It seems to be more stable.

1749
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,080
It remembers my settings and it crashes less.

1750
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:47,920
And like in Popi's case, he doesn't even think he's had to reboot in the last week.

1751
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,040
I don't think any of us are saying it's perfect.

1752
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:53,320
I don't think any of us are saying it doesn't have about a thousand defaults you might have

1753
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:54,320
to change.

1754
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:57,320
Yeah, I just checked.

1755
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:01,840
I've got an uptime of six days and 13 hours.

1756
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:05,160
So no, I haven't updated since last week's show.

1757
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:06,160
Yeah.

1758
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,160
And you know, let me see.

1759
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:10,600
So this machine here that I do every single show for Jupiter broadcasting on currently

1760
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:16,400
has, yeah, this has an uptime of five days with three users.

1761
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:20,040
And I think that's only because I updated, I rebooted after I updated at 512 five days

1762
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,040
ago.

1763
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,880
And this is like a common thing I do.

1764
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:26,200
I tend to leave my, I like leaving all my windows open.

1765
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:30,320
I just slam the lid shut, open it up when I want to carry on.

1766
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:36,280
And I like, I quite like having quite long uptimes and I like systems that are robust

1767
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:37,720
that can cope with that.

1768
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:40,960
This is the fricking elephant in the room and we have to go cause ask Noah's coming

1769
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:41,960
up.

1770
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:49,440
And I'm like, you guys, like, so why is Gnome the desktop, the shipping on all of the enterprise

1771
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:54,400
distros that are going to be supported until the middle of the 2025s or whatever?

1772
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,400
What is it?

1773
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:58,680
Why is it on plasma?

1774
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,380
Legacy and branding.

1775
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:04,960
People have known about Gnome for so long that just it has the market share, it has

1776
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:11,680
the recognition, the whole KDE's bloated thing that's been going around for years, which

1777
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:15,400
has never been true at all at any point.

1778
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:25,400
And like people just kept saying it, there was one bug in 4.3 no 4.2 of plasma that made

1779
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:31,400
it sluggish for about four weeks until they replaced it, replaced it with 4.3 and at that

1780
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,320
point forward it was fine.

1781
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:38,840
But that one thing just created this weird onslaught of just bad reputation for KDE,

1782
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:46,040
bad reputation and it doesn't make any sense other than weird legacy, weird reputation

1783
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:52,560
and kind of bad branding because KDE isn't the name of the desktop and that's it's still

1784
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:56,360
the most common phrase describing the desktop.

1785
01:32:56,360 --> 01:32:59,200
So they need to fix their branding.

1786
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:08,260
I'd say probably the reason why people choose or projects have chosen Gnome is probably

1787
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:13,040
because there's a billion dollar company behind it.

1788
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:19,880
Like most of the, if you ask any person in the street who's behind Gnome, they'd say

1789
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:20,880
Red Hat.

1790
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:26,720
They wouldn't say a community of developers, which they might say for KDE or plasma, they'd

1791
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:34,400
say there's a community, nobody knows who Blue Systems are or how much money they have

1792
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:39,880
in the bank, but Red Hat are a well-known company, long established, well-respected

1793
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:43,600
company who are behind the Gnome project.

1794
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,880
So I think that's a reasonable reason why people choose Gnome.

1795
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,680
Yeah, I think that's it and that seems pretty reasonable to me.

1796
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:56,280
The only problem is that we are heading full head, full steam ahead into Gnome.

1797
01:33:56,280 --> 01:34:00,600
Even though a lot of us in this room who've had a lot of years doing this are saying maybe

1798
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:04,320
and I think that's why we see a lot of projects like Solus and elementary OS that are trying

1799
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:08,520
something a little different to try to strike that difference and Ubuntu MATE and the MATE

1800
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:09,520
project itself.

1801
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:14,360
Also, I bet you something to do as far as like the technical aspects, there's been a

1802
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:16,680
longer thing about of Qt.

1803
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:19,720
People had a problem with Qt licensing and stuff and they didn't want to deal with that

1804
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:20,720
maybe.

1805
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:21,720
True.

1806
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:22,720
Yeah, that's a good point.

1807
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,720
Yeah, that didn't help.

1808
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:24,720
I don't know.

1809
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,320
It's not a zero sum game.

1810
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,480
For KDE to be good, Gnome doesn't have to be bad.

1811
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:29,480
Yeah, exactly.

1812
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,600
For Gnome to be good, KDE doesn't have to be bad.

1813
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,280
They can both be good in their own right.

1814
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,280
Absolutely, 100%.

1815
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:36,600
It just happens to be that Plasma is good and Gnome is bad.

1816
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:37,600
Oh, no, no.

1817
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:38,600
Come on.

1818
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,600
It was so good there.

1819
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,680
It could have been the perfect ending and then you took it from us.

1820
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,960
But I actually, I want to echo that point.

1821
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,440
I think Popeye is completely right.

1822
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:50,560
And it may be that they excel at different things and that the mass market perhaps Gnome

1823
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,440
works well and KDE works better when you have a foot in the game a little bit more.

1824
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:55,440
Yeah.

1825
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:59,100
Either way, I think a lot of us are sticking around on the Plasma desktop, which is pretty

1826
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,200
awesome if you think about it.

1827
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,640
That's going to be, I don't know.

1828
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:04,840
It's a big switch for a lot of us.

1829
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:05,840
A new era.

1830
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:32,840
It is a new era.
