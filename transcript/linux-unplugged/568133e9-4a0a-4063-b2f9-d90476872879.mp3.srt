1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay, Mr. Colonel Linux. This is a quiz for you, sir. Can you place this tune?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay, that's all you get so far. Then I'll give you more of a hint.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's a clip from a sound board in the Jupiter Broadcasting Studio.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay, all right. Well, technically correct, but not the actual accurate answer. Don't look at my screen. I will continue on.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now, Wes, you recognize what this is, right?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I do.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, I thought so.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Must be Star Trek, then.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Uh-uh. Nope, nope.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Come on, nobody in the chat room knows what this is? Really?

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Nope.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Really? Hmm. All right, I'm going to give you one more hint, one more hint, one more hint.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:14,000
All right, Wes. What is it, Wes? What is it? What is it? Let us know, Wes. Give us the big reveal. What are we listening to?

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Are you ready? Are you ready?

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't know.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It is, ladies and gentlemen, the original Star Fox intro.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ah.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, North Ranger got it.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, I got it.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, yeah.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Star Fox. Okay, so I love Star Fox.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I love Star Fox, too.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I actually saw a Star Fox thing at Linux Fest Northwest, surprisingly enough, but anyways, that's not what we're here to talk about.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I love this. You know, this is a different kind of open source. This is an intellectual kind of open source.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
A fan-made Star Fox cartoon recalls the best of 70s sci-fi animation, and you should watch it really before it gets taken down.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It is a Star Fox cartoon, a fox in space, and if you liked the old Star Fox show, they have a big disclaimer that we're not doing this for profit.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We swear we're not doing this for profit. We swear.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You guys should just turn around and leave because you do not want to piss off my uncle.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, just who I needed to see. Star Wolf.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Star Wolf.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This gives me happening.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All your friends are out of the game, Wolf. Don't make me shoot you down.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is so great.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It really is great.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If you ever watched or played Star Wars, I should say, or Star Fox, this is for you.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is really cool. I have a link in the show notes, and one of those things that's probably going to get pulled down really soon.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Right away.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, so if you want to enjoy it, you got to kind of be a fast mover.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Just YouTube DL that right now.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 142 for April 26, 2016.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's had such mush.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's been swapping drives while the computers are still powered. That's legit.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
My name is Chris.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
My name is Wes.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Wes, welcome to the post-Linux Fest Northwest hangover.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Ooh, it's a doozy.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh, man. I don't know how, but somehow we're going to have a great show for you today.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Somehow. We will persevere. We're going to talk about it.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, don't leave. Stay here.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Stay here. Don't worry.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's worth it.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah, we got some interesting Firefox updates coming towards you.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Some good reports of the new Ubuntu tablet.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Of course, the clips you never got to see in Linux Action Show from Linux Fest Northwest.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The good stuff.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
As well as a few stories, a few build projects gone awry. Perhaps some beer will be spilt.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And, as always, we'll update you on some of our favorite open source projects.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
A lot of really fun things to cover, so you know what we've got to do, Wes.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We've got to focus. We've got to harness the power of the internet and bring in our virtual lug.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hello, everyone.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hey, guys.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Hello, guys.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So, Wes and I might be a little punchy. My mouth may not work very well today.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
None of those things should be held against us.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We need your help.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, because we're going to be leaning on you guys because I've got to tell you,

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
things have gotten so bad around the JV1 studios because of total exhaustion from Linux Fest Northwest

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
that just mere moments ago, we decided we've had too many things frustrate us.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And both Noah and I were just totally done with Ubuntu 16.04.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And I have it on this Apollo that I've been keeping. I was going to keep it in Linux Action Show.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I said I'm going to stick with this.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That was a pretty big step for you.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah. And we're going to give you our full take towards the end of the show.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So those of you who don't really care, don't worry. We won't bore with you at the top here.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But to give you an indication of how mush our heads are, but yet we're still trying to push through,

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm about to play something for you that is not the first time this happened this weekend.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Not the second time this happened this weekend.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But perhaps the third time this weekend that we had to rebuild a machine, swap drives out,

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and load a new OS, and all three times.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This is agonizing.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We had to do it more than three times.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But all the three times I'm thinking of, we were in such a rush,

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
we actually forgot to turn the computers off first.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So I'm going to play a little bit of this clip that Mr. Kernel Linux grabbed this morning.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You think you can log in?

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We'll see.

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So right here you are seeing this is my Apollo after I've closed the lid like 20 minutes ago,

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
walked out, came back into the studio, and didn't realize that I hadn't turned it off.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This is a common problem we had.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So it's just sitting there suspended.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I flipped the laptop over, started taking the screws out of the bottom, pulled the plate off,

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
pulled out both hard drives, swapped out the Ubuntu drives with two blank drives, powered it back on,

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and it actually woke up, Wes.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And here is the login manager working.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's kind of impressive.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh, you just got the wrong password.

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Maybe you should drop down to a terminal.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
There we go.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Now let's see if we can log in.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh, we're starting to get errors.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We're starting to get I.O. errors.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Uh-oh.

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Extended four error.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I know there's coming in across the board, sir.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I block zero, can't find I block zero.

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I know there, sir.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So much for being able to run completely out of RAM.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Unable to read.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I block zero.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Why are you running your OS on a RAM disk, Chris?

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, man.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Massive turbulence.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Initiating emergency reboot sequence.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Uh-oh.

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Connection refused.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Unable to activate service.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh, no.

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We're going down.

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So that was me this morning.

122
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Now I just want to give you a taste of what my nights are like.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
See, I usually go to bed a little bit later than I like to.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Naturally.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Because they're hard days.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And every single day since NOAA got in town, every single day there has been major decisions

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
to make that have serious long-term ramifications about production and the network, and it's

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
just been like...

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There are no off days.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It is exhausting.

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It is exhausting.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,200
But it's been even worse for NOAA and, say, Rekai, because they're the ones staying up

133
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,800
to all hours of the night actually implementing some of these changes.

134
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,640
And so this was about a 2 a.m. call that I got.

135
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,000
And I should point out, too, that this was stuff that we did not intend to be on the

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
air, per se.

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, yeah.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Right.

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But we're going to let it on the air anyway.

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This is the unplugged show.

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah.

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,360
There will be some F-bombs about a minute into this.

143
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Don't worry.

144
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
They're not too bad.

145
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
But hold on.

146
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,280
It's a late-night call that I got that NOAA sent me that I thought I'd share with you

147
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,000
guys because, yeah, this was never supposed to be aired, but this gives you a little idea

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,640
of the state of mind that everybody was in after working until about 4 a.m., 5 a.m. for

149
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,160
about six, seven days straight.

150
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Oh, wait.

151
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Not this one.

152
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
That's the last one.

153
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Hold on a second.

154
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Hold on.

155
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,920
And wait for it.

156
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,160
I don't even see it in here.

157
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,920
Oh, I don't even see it in here.

158
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Maybe I'm totally...

159
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,280
My head is too tired.

160
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
But I bet I'll come up to it.

161
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,480
I bet I'll find it in a little bit.

162
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,740
I bet I'll find it in a little bit.

163
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,740
Here we go.

164
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,740
I just found it.

165
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,160
Oh, wait a minute.

166
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
That's what I did.

167
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
See, I am tired.

168
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,920
I mislabeled the eclipse.

169
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Oh, well.

170
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Woe is me.

171
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
I think I had...

172
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
You know what, Mr. NOAA?

173
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
I think I'm getting a little bit of feedback.

174
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,600
I think I'm hearing a little bit of goodness come through on your speakers there or something.

175
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
So, yeah.

176
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
There we go.

177
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Hey, I found it.

178
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Here.

179
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
I'm going to play it for you.

180
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Are you ready?

181
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Okay.

182
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
This is...

183
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Now, just be warned.

184
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
But, yeah.

185
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,720
1.57 a.m. precise is when this came into me here.

186
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,880
And now I'm going to play it for you.

187
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,880
Yeah.

188
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,840
Hop on the other side.

189
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Hi Topher.

190
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Chris Topher.

191
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Hi.

192
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Hi.

193
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
So, it's really late.

194
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,840
Like, super.

195
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
That's beard.

196
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Hi, beard.

197
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,120
I like how laying on your shoulder just makes me go forget.

198
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,200
So we're all exceedingly tired.

199
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Crazy tired.

200
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Crazy tired.

201
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,080
I had to go get some water because I drank the Coke.

202
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
That rhymes with tired.

203
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
But we fixed.

204
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,360
We fixed your fucking RDMP stream.

205
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
So now...

206
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Kinda.

207
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
What do you mean, kind of?

208
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
I thought you said it was...

209
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
YouTube doesn't completely work.

210
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Because I'll start as a bitch.

211
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Right.

212
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,960
You have to restart it manually.

213
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,480
But you're a smart guy.

214
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
So you can do that.

215
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,800
But we'll fix it so you don't have to do that.

216
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Beard will fix it.

217
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
I will not fix it.

218
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Because I don't...

219
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,800
I'll fix it by not using Ubuntu.

220
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,200
Beard, that does not seem smart.

221
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
So anyway...

222
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,600
And I transcoded all your files.

223
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Yeah.

224
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
He did good.

225
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
That boy...

226
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
In other words, he's useless.

227
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
No.

228
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Useless out of the...

229
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
No, but...

230
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
So listen to me now.

231
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,880
SatCom 1 is a go.

232
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
And it is working.

233
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,680
SatCom 2 is kind of half a go.

234
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
It's half a go.

235
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Your personal rig?

236
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
Fucked.

237
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Totally.

238
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
Oh yeah.

239
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Oh yeah.

240
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
So this...

241
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,360
This thing.

242
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
You get to play with that.

243
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
When you...

244
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Fucked out of 10.

245
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Fucked out of 10.

246
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,720
I'm actually fucked out of like 150.

247
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
We try.

248
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
I don't know.

249
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,640
It's that hardware works, but I can't install your stupid AnderGhost.

250
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
So...

251
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Turns out...

252
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
MVME drives.

253
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
MVME drives out of 10.

254
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,640
They fucking suck.

255
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,360
If we put it on the SSD, it'll work just fine.

256
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,160
But I don't know what the fuck is going on.

257
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,720
Might have to buy a plane ticket or something.

258
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Maybe that's what we'll do.

259
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Okay.

260
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,360
So I just wanted to tell you how hard we worked and how fucking tired we are.

261
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,840
Which I'm here to know at 2 o'clock.

262
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Yes, but I...

263
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,320
How much sleep did you get last night?

264
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Not much.

265
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,680
And I got like two out of three hours.

266
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
How...

267
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
You're...

268
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,680
You're in a fucking good sleep schedule.

269
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,680
Yeah.

270
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
Yeah.

271
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
But...

272
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
He's very cold, though.

273
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,840
I've hit my limit of how late I can stay up.

274
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,040
So I'm going to bed.

275
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,640
And just to let you know, we stayed up.

276
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
And fixed your shirt.

277
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
Hopefully it works.

278
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Turn the heat off so you don't keep them up all night.

279
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
Oh yeah.

280
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Turn the heat up or off.

281
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
We're going to freeze.

282
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
And then, after he gets this working, he decides to kiss the phone.

283
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
Good night.

284
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
Oh, that's adorable.

285
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
Oh, it didn't shut off.

286
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
That was really awkward.

287
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
Okay, you try it.

288
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,640
Okay.

289
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Nighty night.

290
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Here, hold on.

291
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,640
All right, Brown Bear.

292
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
How much had you drank before you went to bed?

293
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:30,000
Zero.

294
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,080
I have had no drugs.

295
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,280
I have had no alcohol.

296
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,180
It is literally just five consecutive nights, six consecutive nights of no, like, one to

297
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,180
two hours of sleep.

298
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,180
And you just, you hit a limit.

299
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,320
And then, all of a sudden, like, you get so tired.

300
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,720
And it's just, like, simple things.

301
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,640
Like, somebody would say something to me, and I would just completely forget about it,

302
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
like, 30 seconds later.

303
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
I had no recollection of it.

304
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,920
I just switched the whole hard drive and the computer, and I have zero recollection of

305
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
doing it.

306
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,880
It's amazing that everything still works.

307
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
Yeah, really.

308
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,400
Yeah, literally, he swapped out a hard drive and a machine, totally forgot about it.

309
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,420
So you kind of teased it there real quick.

310
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,920
Why don't you tell the people what the heck SatCom 1 and SatCom 2 is, how the heck they

311
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,440
run Linux, and why it's so damn awesome now?

312
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,200
So basically, we are trying to expedite the flow of streams and also create a way that

313
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,360
not one system is so heavily reliant with problematic internet.

314
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,280
And so basically, we are sending a single stream up to DigitalOcean to JBSatCom 1.

315
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,480
And SatCom 1 then distributes those streams to all of the various places like Ustream

316
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,780
and ScaleEngine and whatnot.

317
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,560
And then, the other thing we've done is we, SatCom 1 also sends a stream to SatCom 2.

318
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,140
And SatCom 2 then connects in with YouTube.

319
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,640
So we have a YouTube live page now.

320
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,460
And you will have the ability, I'm doing it right now, but you'll eventually have the

321
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,920
ability to, from the chat room, start and stop SatCom 2 to bring that live stream up

322
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
and down.

323
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,880
Yeah, using JBot, which is very cool.

324
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,160
So one of the things about this trip is, and I think we should probably talk about this

325
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,120
almost in its own dedicated thing, but these are all Linux rigs being powered by Linux

326
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,160
machines running OBS here in the studio.

327
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,920
We're now able to, this is probably doesn't seem like a big deal to most people, but it's

328
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,660
a big personal thing for me because it was always a polished thing.

329
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,160
We're now able to switch from reruns on the live stream to live shows without any interruption

330
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
in the stream.

331
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
That is really nice.

332
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,040
We can take equipment offline behind the scenes and all that kind of stuff.

333
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,400
And we'll also soon be able to have stream recordings and whatnot.

334
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,440
It's really like a true 24-7 live stream, which would be a big goodness.

335
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,440
Yeah.

336
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,400
So what we did to work around some Comcast issues, and really, if you think about it,

337
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,000
this is so perfect, is we set up a droplet on DigitalOcean, which is, of course, a sponsor

338
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,440
here on Linux Unplugged.

339
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Two droplets.

340
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Oh.

341
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
One that's like a big rig.

342
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,320
Like if you go over to digitalocean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, you'll get

343
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,480
a $10 credit and you can try out some of these rigs for free.

344
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,040
They even have hourly pricing, so you get like the $5 you can try it out.

345
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
I love that hourly pricing.

346
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Yeah.

347
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Yeah, I do.

348
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,880
I decided, I went for one of my biggest droplets yet.

349
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
Ooh, how big?

350
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,280
Yeah, I got a $40 a month droplet.

351
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,000
I get four gigabytes of RAM, a two-core processor, 60-gigabyte SSD, and four terabytes of transfer.

352
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Nice.

353
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,560
Now, this thing's going out to Ustream.tv, Scale Engine, YouTube Live, right?

354
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,680
You got all these, and the audio stream, and we want to add more.

355
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,400
So I wanted something with a lot of processor power.

356
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Ooh.

357
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,440
What was really cool, though, is we started at the $5 droplet as we just tested the theory.

358
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Right.

359
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,920
And then we just incremented it up as we needed it.

360
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,480
It is so nice.

361
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,720
And we're going to take advantage, so Noah mentioned that we'd be starting and stopping

362
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,520
the live stream by using a bot in our IRC chat room.

363
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,600
It's a really sweet API they have to do this.

364
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,080
So we'd be using an IRC bot.

365
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,640
We turn droplets on and off.

366
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
Oh, that's slick.

367
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
Right?

368
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,320
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code D01PLUG.

369
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
They start at $5 a month.

370
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,920
You get 512 megabytes of RAM, one blazing fast CPU, 20 gigabytes of SSD, and a terabyte

371
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,060
of transfer, because they all SSDs, y'all, and they have super fast rigs, all the different

372
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,200
Linux size you'd want, Core OS, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, of course.

373
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,520
They also have free BSD.

374
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,520
They have data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto, and

375
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Germany.

376
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,520
Just pick whatever makes the most sense.

377
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,080
They have a brilliant interface, really good stuff, really great dashboard.

378
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,760
It's made like, for example, so Noah could just manage these as droplets with no effort.

379
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,760
As I'm setting all these things up, I can just check his SSH keys, and they get added

380
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,160
as the droplet gets created, and he has login.

381
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
He's good to go.

382
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
So easy.

383
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
I love DigitalOcean.

384
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
You will love it, too.

385
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,680
Use the promo code DEOUNPLUGGED, one word lowercase, and support this show, and get

386
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,720
yourself a $10 credit, and go try them out.

387
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,800
They have the great interface.

388
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,140
They have great guides and tutorials, super, super, super good documentation, and now they're

389
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,040
just running even more of our infrastructure.

390
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,280
When we want a Linux server on demand, this is where we go.

391
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:49,720
With great bandwidth, great connectivity, DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DEOUNPLUGGED.

392
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,600
Before we get into the Firefox news, I should mention that Wes did bring us some bruskies,

393
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,520
as has been tradition for quite a while now, and one that I love.

394
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,040
I'm not going to complain.

395
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,520
And did you know that this is Alasian's flagship beer?

396
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
Alasian.

397
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
Alasian.

398
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
This is Alasian, or whatever you call them.

399
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
Aslan?

400
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
I don't know.

401
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Aslan, I believe.

402
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
Not Aslan, huh?

403
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,040
This is their flagship beers, one of them, the Batch 15 IPA.

404
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,400
So let's go ahead and... A medium body, citrusy, and unfiltered.

405
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
What are you thinking?

406
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,900
Have you been drinking this?

407
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,900
Another Northwest brew.

408
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,480
This is actually, speaking of Linux Fest Northwest from Bellingham, this beer is from

409
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
Bellingham.

410
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
It sure is.

411
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Brewed in Bellingham, Washington.

412
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
With 7% ABV.

413
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
That's not bad.

414
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Yeah.

415
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
It's pretty good.

416
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
Are you enjoying it?

417
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Yeah.

418
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,320
It's hoppy, but it's not too hoppy.

419
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,680
As it finishes there, you want more, but it's not...

420
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,960
That's exactly how I would put it.

421
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,520
It's not cloying in your mouth at all.

422
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,620
You nailed that.

423
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,240
Just as it was finishing, I was like... As I was swallowing it, I'm like, this is... As

424
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,320
I'm swallowing it, and you're saying, it's not that hoppy, I'm like, dude, what?

425
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
This is super hoppy.

426
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,040
And this, just as it finished, I'm like, I could have more, and you're like, but then

427
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
you could have more.

428
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,280
You nailed it, that's exactly what it tastes like.

429
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,440
And you know, it's right from our own backyard.

430
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Kind of appropriate.

431
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,800
So, that's what we will be enjoying during the show today.

432
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,360
All right, let's talk about Firefox 46, finally released, and it's really, truly, genuinely,

433
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,960
actually, honest to goodness here.

434
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Ladies and gentlemen, I present Firefox with, you guessed it, GTK 3 integration.

435
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
No way.

436
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,800
Yeah, it's true.

437
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,680
And I know Mr. Colonel Linux is a Firefox fan.

438
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,400
I'm going to get to him in a moment, but I wanted to open up to the mumble room first.

439
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,720
Anybody out there actually cray-cray enough to try out Firefox 46 and play with the GTK

440
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,560
3 integration on the Linux desktop builds?

441
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,880
Yes, I plan on doing it.

442
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Okay.

443
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,640
I've been using GTK 3 Firefox on Arch for like three releases now.

444
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Yeah, right.

445
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
It's been doable.

446
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,880
And anything stand out to you?

447
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,240
I did run into one bug with the dark theme where you get white text on white background

448
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,400
sometimes, which is kind of annoying.

449
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,200
But otherwise, it's actually been very, very smooth.

450
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Okay.

451
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Okay.

452
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,600
That bug exists forever.

453
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,760
Yeah.

454
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,840
We also have improved H.264 and AAC media support, better web RTC performance support,

455
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
which-

456
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,840
Those seem like good wins.

457
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
Those do seem like really good wins.

458
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,480
I think no one's going to be all about that using like Firefox Hello and whatnot.

459
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,200
Now here is the, and great for the Firefox team, no snap yet.

460
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Right.

461
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
I thought that was interesting.

462
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
They even bothered pointing that out.

463
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
But you caught that too, huh?

464
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
There was a snap.

465
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
I would install it right now.

466
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Yeah, I would too, actually.

467
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
I wonder if that's going to start happening.

468
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
I hope so.

469
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,120
You can actually just go ahead and use it anyway, because you don't have to install

470
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
it.

471
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
You can download the tarball.

472
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Oh, yeah, sure.

473
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
Yeah, totally.

474
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

475
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Let's talk about Firefox and Thunderbird.

476
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,800
Mark Sermon, he wrote up a post at his site about Firefox and Thunderbird, a fork in the

477
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
road.

478
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,080
Firefox and Thunderbird have reached a fork in the road, he writes.

479
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,720
It's now time, it's now the right time for them to part ways on both a technical and

480
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,800
organizational level.

481
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,320
So Thunderbird and Firefox, time to part ways, he says.

482
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,280
A little bit of background, much of Mozilla, including the leadership team, believes that

483
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,280
focusing on the web through Firefox offers a vastly better choice, or I'm sorry, chance

484
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,120
of moving the internet industry to a more open place than investing in further Thunderbird

485
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,680
development or in continuing to attend to both products.

486
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,680
Many of us remain committed to Thunderbird users and want to see Thunderbird remain a

487
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,880
healthy community and product.

488
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,120
But both Firefox and Thunderbird face different challenges, have different goals and different

489
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,240
measures of success.

490
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,840
Our actions regarding Thunderbird should be viewed in this light.

491
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,680
Success for Firefox means continued relevance in the mass consumer market as a way for people

492
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,140
to access, share, and feel safe across many devices.

493
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,620
With hundreds of millions of users on both desktop and mobile, we have the raw material

494
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,120
for this success.

495
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:46,480
If we want Firefox to continue and have an impact on how developers and consumers interact

496
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,280
with the internet, we need to move to much more quickly and we need to innovate on mobile

497
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
and in the cloud.

498
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,080
Mozilla is putting the majority of its human and financial resources into Firefox product

499
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,720
innovation.

500
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,560
Now here comes the swinging blow, Noah, for Thunderbird.

501
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:10,160
In contrast, success for Thunderbird means remaining a reliable and stable open source

502
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,560
desktop email client.

503
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,520
While many people still value the security and independence that come with desktop mail,

504
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,400
the overall number of such people in the world is shrinking.

505
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Given these different paths, it should be no surprise that tensions have arisen as we

506
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,160
have tried to maintain Firefox and Thunderbird on top of a common underlying code base and

507
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,120
a common release engineering team.

508
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,440
Here's what they're going to do, on the organizational front, they've hired an open source leader

509
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
like Simon Phelps.

510
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,400
He's going to look at different long term options for a home for Thunderbird, including

511
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,860
perhaps the Document Foundation, perhaps Gnome, or the Mozilla Foundation and the Software

512
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,200
Freedom Conservancy are also on the list.

513
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,880
With the right technical and organizational path set forward, both Firefox and Thunderbird

514
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,160
will have a better chance of success and dramatic reading.

515
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:04,640
In other words, while Mozilla, over the last years, has had time to try everything from

516
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:13,480
phones to sticks and everything in between, even a browser, what we don't have time for

517
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,200
is an email client.

518
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,600
An open web is important, but an open email ecosystem, have you guys heard of Gmail?

519
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,160
What do you think, Noah?

520
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,200
I think that Thunderbird is single-handedly the most popular client I see used on Linux

521
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,560
desktops and it's kind of a huge disappointment that the Mozilla Corporation is either unaware

522
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:40,520
or chooses to willfully ignore that user base and it seems like, I've tried Kmail, I've

523
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,600
tried a lot of different ones, but like you, I have a large inbox and I don't like going

524
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
to the web for my mail.

525
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,400
I like having a mail client running, especially on my workstation at home, so that I'm quickly

526
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,720
alerted to incoming emails and stuff like that and if they pass it off to somebody else

527
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,360
or if they decide to abandon the project completely, I really hope that whoever picks it up steps

528
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
it up a little bit.

529
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,980
It doesn't need to be updated a whole lot, it just needs to work and continue to function

530
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,980
the way it is.

531
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,980
It's good enough.

532
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:12,160
You know, ironically, that's their main complaint, is they don't want – see, this is what actually

533
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:18,360
strikes me, is they talk about success for Firefox means continued relevance in a mass

534
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,720
consumer market, chasing mobile, focusing on the cloud and they say, in contrast, Thunderbird

535
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,240
means remaining a reliable and stable open source desktop email client.

536
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,760
Almost like saying, in opposite of our goals of Firefox, Thunderbird needs to be stable.

537
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
What?

538
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
What?

539
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,880
What kind of logic is that?

540
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:44,720
In contrast, they are literally saying, in opposite, that's another – in contrast,

541
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,640
Thunderbird, for it to be successful, needs to be stable and an open source desktop client.

542
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,440
They're saying, what does that mean for the goals of Firefox?

543
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,600
Go cray-cray?

544
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Go crazy with mobile?

545
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,520
Go crazy with the cloud and stability goes out the window?

546
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,400
It seems like it is absolutely a core focus of Firefox to have stability and that in no

547
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
way, in no way detracts from Thunderbird.

548
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,320
I don't make – this logic makes no sense to me.

549
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,880
Yeah, it's pretty iffy.

550
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,880
Now, should they be doing it if they don't want to do it?

551
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,880
Of course not.

552
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
Right.

553
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,880
Of course not.

554
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
I don't know.

555
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
I don't know.

556
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,880
Anybody in the mumbling room have an idea of where maybe it should go?

557
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,880
The conservancy has already said that they would take in the hosting and they would also

558
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,440
be open to like a Thunderbird Foundation split.

559
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,720
The other ones haven't really said anything like that.

560
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,400
In fact, I think – I think maybe Simon's report might actually be out as we record

561
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
this.

562
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,320
Yeah, it's been out for about an hour now.

563
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Yeah, okay.

564
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,240
The interesting thing is that the change between Mozilla and Thunderbird has already happened

565
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,740
and it happened in like 2012.

566
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,280
So this change is actually a good thing because Mozilla has already washed their hands of

567
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
Thunderbird.

568
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:02,360
They are just kind of a little bit still putting their feet in the water but Thunderbird doesn't

569
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,920
want to be associated to Mozilla anyway because it limits them in what they can do for their

570
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,260
base for like the runtime engine and everything.

571
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,920
So they can actually improve Thunderbird overall.

572
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,600
So this is actually a good thing even though it sounds weird.

573
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,160
No, I actually am in complete agreement with you.

574
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,360
I guess I wish that the priorities lined up differently.

575
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,400
Mini MC, what do you think?

576
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:31,360
Yeah, I think it's the release often philosophy for Firefox.

577
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,720
If you have new technologies, implement them and do changes afterwards.

578
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,520
Unless with Thunderbird, you need still a stable client.

579
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
All right.

580
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,920
So here is the – the register has the report that Simon put out a bit ago.

581
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,160
He says software conservancy and document foundation seen as ideal new homes, they need

582
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,620
technical hosting, they need finance and staffing and government dispute management leadership

583
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,800
and trademark management.

584
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,320
Now the software conservancy has already agreed to take over Thunderbird if asked, FIPS says,

585
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
which is pretty great.

586
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Wow.

587
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,360
Yeah, remember that's also where Inkscape lives, Git and QMU.

588
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,160
On the other hand, the document foundation over in Germany is close to the largest national

589
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,600
community of Thunderbird users.

590
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,640
So I guess there's another – we'll see where this – we'll follow this.

591
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,200
I guess Gnome Foundation wasn't super probably up on the top of this because they already

592
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,520
kind of tapped out these days but –

593
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,400
Yeah, they already – they said that they wouldn't be able to handle such a change

594
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,400
at this moment.

595
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
Yeah.

596
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Well, it's good to see Google stepping up.

597
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
It's an important project.

598
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,120
I like the fact that Mozilla is opening to let them use the trademark even though they're

599
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,200
probably going to keep the trademark but they're going to let the Thunderbird project keep

600
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
it.

601
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Yeah, good point.

602
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Good point.

603
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,960
Mr. WW, do you have any final thoughts on the Thunderbird situation?

604
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,880
I think Thunderbird is an insanely reliable client.

605
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,320
It's been rock solid for me.

606
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:57,560
I have literally thousands of emails in it and it doesn't take over 300 megs of RAM.

607
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,960
On one end, this is going to put a lot more pressure on Firefox.

608
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,080
People are going to be looking closer at them and saying, OK, you're done with Thunderbird.

609
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,280
You moved on.

610
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,960
What are you going to do for us now?

611
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,200
What are you going to do to compete with Chrome, with Microsoft Edge, with Devalti?

612
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,280
Are you going to be able to fix issues that you've had?

613
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,240
People I'm sure are going to be looking at them more closely now.

614
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,520
Yes, I think I will be.

615
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
Yeah, definitely.

616
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
Yeah.

617
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
All right.

618
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,900
One last update before we get into some of the meatier topics.

619
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,640
Last week, I think it was, we mentioned that one of the first reviews of the Ubuntu BQ

620
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,760
tablet was pretty sour on it and not very positive.

621
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:47,720
Now Jack Wallen has his review out at TechRepublic.com and he's got a little bit of a different take

622
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
on it.

623
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,760
I think I like this one better because this feels more like a more longer term, bigger

624
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,400
picture Linux user who's trying this.

625
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,200
Someone who's open to it as well.

626
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Yeah.

627
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,160
Someone who might be coming at it more from my perspective of I'm okay with rough edges

628
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,520
if I can accomplish X and then just stick with it as it develops.

629
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,280
Here's what he said that grabbed my attention.

630
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,480
Now he's also got screenshots of what LibreOffice looks like on the thing and whatnot, but he

631
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,240
says this, the only real issue with running full-blown version of LibreOffice on the Ubuntu

632
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,440
tablet is the toolbars and menus, et cetera, are really on the small side because the resolution

633
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,400
is super high, so you better have good vision.

634
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,560
But he said, for example, he ran the GIMP, it's ready to go on the Ubuntu tablet, and

635
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,340
here's what I really loved.

636
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,080
The second the Ubuntu tablet connects to the wireless mouse, it switches over to desktop

637
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
mode.

638
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,640
That's when the real magic happens.

639
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,760
All of a sudden, I'm working on a tablet that is in full multitasking mode.

640
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,240
Windows act like Windows in the traditional sense.

641
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,320
They can be resized, minimized, everything you've grown up to with on the desktop.

642
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,720
Oh, that does sound really nice.

643
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Yeah, it does.

644
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
Yeah, it does.

645
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,440
He says, the only issue with the Ubuntu tablet is when you switch to desktop mode, you do

646
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,120
lose some horsepower.

647
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,880
There's some significant lag in the cursor movement, and apps don't seem to open nearly

648
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
as quickly.

649
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,760
That might be one of those things you've got to wait until the next tablet, but it could

650
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
be.

651
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
He ends in a conclusion.

652
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,240
I don't want to spoil it for you guys, so he has a great write-up, but I haven't leaked

653
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:17,760
it in the show notes, too, but he says, canonical, I am seriously impressed.

654
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,960
He says, in desktop mode, I can actually get my work done in a similar efficient manner

655
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,320
as I would if I were standing right at my desk.

656
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,280
That is powerful.

657
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,800
That's sounding a lot better than the last review we read.

658
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,720
Do you think so, too, Mr. Kernalynx?

659
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
I do.

660
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,640
I've actually, for a number of years, been looking for a solution, a small portable solution

661
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,920
that I can take with me everywhere.

662
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,880
And when you say a number of years, you mean like 10.

663
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Yeah, yeah.

664
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,880
It's basically kind of been what I've always wanted, but it seems like there's no place,

665
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,840
it seems like either my laptop is inconvenient to take places or bad things happen to it

666
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
sometimes.

667
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,520
Which we'll get into.

668
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,680
But if I could have a tablet, but the problem with the tablet is, every time I try to use

669
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:03,940
a tablet operating system, I get stuck and bogged down in, it's good at tablet-y things,

670
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,240
but I can't actually do desktop things, so the ability to switch back and forth is absolutely

671
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,240
essential.

672
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,520
Joe, you had a chance to play with it on Sunday.

673
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,640
Yes, thanks to Wimpy at the Egham Raspberry Jam.

674
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,080
And the thing is, okay, if you look at it from our point of view, it's a great tablet

675
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,780
in that you can get Exmere running, you can get LibreOffice, but then if you actually

676
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,280
step back out of our little bubble, our kind of free software bubble, and think of it as

677
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,640
a consumer product, the thing is absolutely terrible.

678
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,080
I mean, you know that gesture where you swipe in from the right and you get all of the recent

679
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,080
applications?

680
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,080
Uh-huh.

681
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,760
That was all juddery and whatnot.

682
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,080
And just the whole experience was not slick at all.

683
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:54,000
Compared to my Nexus 9 running stock Android, it's just a joke, really, as a consumer product.

684
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,160
And I don't know, maybe we're here to discuss the benefits of it.

685
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,160
You can run proper terminal applications on it.

686
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,700
You can do everything you can with a Linux box, basically.

687
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,160
But for the general public, and that's how this was sold to me, at least.

688
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,640
If you look at the websites where you can buy this thing, it looks like a consumer product.

689
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
I'll grant you that, yeah.

690
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,240
And the fact is, it is not a consumer product.

691
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,880
It's not ready for market yet.

692
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,880
Mr. Pobie, I'm sure you must have some response to this.

693
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Hello.

694
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,080
Sorry if my audio is terrible.

695
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
I'm in a hotel room in Prague.

696
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,080
Yeah, thank you for joining us, even in the hotel room.

697
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
That's awesome.

698
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,680
So interestingly, I got to play with a BQ M10 for the first time today, other than the

699
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,000
one I looked at Joe playing with over his shoulder at the weekend.

700
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:50,240
And I understand that the performance is pretty bad with the OTA.

701
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,000
So the device is shipped with, I think, OTA 9, and then the first update you get is OTA

702
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
10.

703
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,680
And as I understand it, there's a bug in OTA 10, which makes the mirror performance pretty

704
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,240
terrible, which is now fixed, which should land in OTA 11.

705
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,320
So the performance should be improved quite dramatically.

706
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,880
I haven't tried all of the gestures that Joe was.

707
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,800
But I will certainly have a play with it tomorrow and see if it's as bad as Joe makes it out

708
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
to be.

709
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,080
But as I understand it, it should be better in OTA 11.

710
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:26,000
You know, Pobie, one of the things that I kind of got on Librem's, or Purism's case

711
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,840
for, was it felt like they were marketing towards super, super, super freedom aware

712
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,040
users that would require things like core boot and no binary blobs, yet were shipping

713
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:44,000
a device that had a proprietary blob and is not totally free, doesn't use core boot.

714
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,400
And it's like, well, why didn't they just market to a different crowd?

715
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,960
Why not market this to the tech enthusiast crowd?

716
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,840
Is it just not simply a big enough market?

717
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,520
Because it seems like that's all who's really going to end up buying it in the first few

718
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,560
generations anyway.

719
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,920
So it could end up saving a little face by just saying, well, this is really sort of

720
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,440
for the technical people.

721
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,520
I know you don't have an answer in terms of what the company's take is.

722
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,320
But personally, do you think it's maybe would be better to target more geeky people to set

723
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
expectations?

724
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,000
Well, it kind of is.

725
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,920
We like repeatedly have said, well, you know, it may be we're giving out a mixed message,

726
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:24,200
maybe, you know, the marketing looks like it's consumer grade, and it's aimed at normals.

727
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:30,480
Despite what we internally feel about, you know, we're not expecting this to be everyone

728
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,720
who's got an iPad is going to go and buy one of these and replace their iPad with one of

729
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
these.

730
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,440
Like, we're not stupid enough to think that.

731
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:45,480
And similarly, you know, I know Joe has a Nexus 9, which he covets greatly.

732
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,720
And I don't expect him to replace his Nexus 9 with an M10 either.

733
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,760
I think bear in mind, this is our very first tablet.

734
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Yeah, we've had two major phones so far.

735
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,960
The BQs and the MX4.

736
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,320
And now this one, I think we're still iterating on things.

737
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,440
And yeah, it's not it's not ready for my mom yet, certainly.

738
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,120
And we've had this conversation before on Unplugged.

739
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:20,960
Unlike unlike any other Ubuntu experience, though, this is so closely tied to how good

740
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,320
the hardware is.

741
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,720
Because you know, you get it all as one package.

742
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,720
And so it's going to take a couple of iterations of BQs hardware to to get better and better.

743
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,720
For the higher end stuff to reach the right price point.

744
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:39,840
And the OS experience, like switching apps stuttering, is going to suffer for a while,

745
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
right?

746
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:47,160
And the flip side is, like, for the first time last night in a bar, I held a Meizu Pro

747
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,560
5 that I've not seen before.

748
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,320
And oh my god, that is years ahead of every other device that we've had before.

749
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,560
It's super fast, super smooth, the UI is much slicker than than all of the devices we've

750
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
had before.

751
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:07,320
And I picked up my EQ 4.5 this morning was like, oh my god.

752
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,920
So Wimpy, you disagree with me on the hardware front, you think the BQ tablets in pretty

753
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,240
good shape right now as far as horsepower goes?

754
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,240
I do.

755
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:20,280
And just generally, the build quality of the hardware is very, very good.

756
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:26,400
I've got a Nexus 9 and most of my family have Nexus 10.

757
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:33,800
So comparing it to the Nexus 10, it's a lot more trim and lighter and so the hardware

758
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,000
I've got no complaints at all.

759
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,200
I think hardware wise, nobody's going to be disappointed.

760
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,160
I've got the full HD model as well and that the screen is very, very good.

761
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,800
So no, no complaints there.

762
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:53,280
You can definitely feel the performance I've used up until for devices on some of the Nexus

763
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,920
devices, Nexus 4, Nexus 7, and the BQ5.

764
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,880
And this is, you know, significantly better in terms of performance despite, you know,

765
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,800
some of the bugs that exist in some of the transitions when you've got the desktop mode

766
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,960
enabled.

767
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,200
That's what I really where I really want the horsepower to is if I'm in desktop mode, I'm

768
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
working.

769
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,240
If I'm in tablet mode, I'm probably consuming content.

770
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,240
That seems likely.

771
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
Browsing the web, whatever.

772
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,240
Yeah.

773
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,240
Oh, boy.

774
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,240
Wes.

775
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,240
So what do you think?

776
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,240
What's your gut tell you on it?

777
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,240
I'm excited to play with it.

778
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Yeah.

779
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
You know, I don't know.

780
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,840
Maybe it's not ready for a mass number of people, but we're on the track, right?

781
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,000
Like it's out there and it's real and when does it get to the point where next time Wes

782
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,340
is shopping for a tablet, this is a serious contender?

783
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,000
Are we there yet?

784
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,680
First I have to actually shop for a tablet.

785
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
Yeah.

786
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,280
This is kind of like making me consider tablets again as a piece of technology I might want

787
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
to buy.

788
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,560
So kind of like me, you've sort of lost interest in them.

789
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,800
You have one that lasts forever because all you do is look at Reddit on it.

790
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
Or watch Netflix.

791
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Or watch Netflix.

792
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
Or maybe, right?

793
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
Yeah.

794
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
Yeah.

795
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,320
So if there's something suddenly I can just throw in my backpack and then if at work and

796
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,720
then there's a spare monitor, I plug it in and there's my desktop, I could use that

797
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,720
even if there's some rough edges.

798
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,980
I could tell you for sure, not to put words in Noah's mouth, but I could see on a trip

799
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:13,000
like this, a tablet that could also double as a desktop would have been super handy.

800
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Right?

801
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Right?

802
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,640
Well, I can tell you this, the tablet wouldn't have gotten relegated to throwing it on the

803
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,800
kitchen counter and saying, here, see if you can find a use for this to control some other

804
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,040
hardware because I don't really use it, so it's just been sitting in my backpack the

805
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
whole time.

806
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
Yeah.

807
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,200
He donated a Nexus tablet too for us to use for some production stuff.

808
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,840
Joe, I would be curious to hear your thoughts on the Maru.

809
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:41,160
Yeah, so Maru is a ROM for the Nexus 5, which is basically AOSP.

810
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,920
It just is really boring Android until you plug it into a screen and your Bluetooth keyboard

811
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
and mouse and then suddenly-

812
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Right.

813
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
And this is based on Debian, right?

814
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,920
Yeah.

815
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,960
Then you've got a full Debian desktop and I put it on a Nexus 5 and I took a little

816
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,680
selfie video, then another video of it working.

817
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,120
I downloaded and installed GIMP and OpenShot.

818
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:06,880
I made the title cards in GIMP, edited it in OpenShot, exported it, uploaded it to YouTube,

819
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,080
all on the Nexus 5.

820
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,440
The thing about that is that it's taken two existing things that are solid, Android we

821
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,280
know is a great platform, Debian, that's a no-brainer.

822
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,440
Instead of trying to reinvent things and they're not invented here syndrome, you've got a situation

823
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,360
where the developer of Maru has taken these two solid platforms, put them together, and

824
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:33,280
that's exactly what we've been talking about, this idea of I can carry around a phone and

825
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,240
do or there's no reason you couldn't do it on a tablet as well and then get to work,

826
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,620
plug it in and have a full desktop.

827
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,880
Instead of trying to reinvent things, sometimes it's better to just stand on the shoulders

828
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,920
of giants and combine things that are good already.

829
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,920
I think that's a pretty sound and pretty often heard argument and I would say that this is

830
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,800
sort of it playing out on a major grand scale that we're all going to sit back and watch.

831
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,960
It's not just this particular stuff too, right?

832
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,960
It's also other things.

833
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,600
I mean Windows has been big on the whole there version of convergence.

834
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
Yeah.

835
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Yeah.

836
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,200
So we're well and I think particularly with Canonical and some of the decisions we're

837
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,800
just going to see where this goes and I don't know yet.

838
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,080
I think it's too early to call.

839
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,960
I think we'll have to see where they and we'll have to see how the other part of the picture

840
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,880
is how the updates are delivered to the device, how regularly and how much of a difference

841
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
that makes.

842
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
I think all that kind of plays a big piece too.

843
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:31,560
You know, Noah, it strikes me that we should totally load Maru on that Nexus 5 that I bricked

844
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,560
earlier this week.

845
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
Sure.

846
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
Yeah.

847
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,560
We should totally do that.

848
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,560
I can install it on mine.

849
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
Oh, you crazy.

850
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
You should do it.

851
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,560
I'll have it for next week if you want.

852
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Yeah, let's do it.

853
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,560
Let's do it.

854
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,560
We'll do a little take on it.

855
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,560
We could do it together.

856
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,560
Oh my gosh.

857
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,480
You know, I should mention that throughout this episode I've been installing Etagros

858
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
on the Apollo.

859
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
That sounds great.

860
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:55,200
And I decided to step away from Ubuntu 16.04 for a bit.

861
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,120
And safe havens of arch.

862
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
But I didn't format.

863
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,640
I drive swapped, hence the story about drive swapping.

864
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,840
So I can go right back to 16.04 because we had some spare parts.

865
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,220
I kind of downgraded in terms of total storage.

866
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,780
So I'll probably eventually go back to the Ubuntu drives, but I didn't want to wreck

867
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,840
that install because it was actually a pretty solid install of 16.04.

868
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,040
So I'm going to tell you guys more about that.

869
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:21,080
But before we get into all that stuff, I also want to cover some Linux Fest Northwest clips.

870
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,080
There was some good stuff, including one time where Wes stopped by the booth.

871
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,080
Oh, that's right.

872
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
Yeah, so people are watching the video version.

873
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,440
They're going to get to see what Wes looks like here in just a little bit.

874
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,400
Hey, a little surprise there.

875
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,280
But first I'm going to mention our friends at Ting.

876
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
This is luck of the draw.

877
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,880
You know, it's different everywhere you go.

878
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,340
But sometimes you just really score with your mobile service provider.

879
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,700
That for me was Ting.

880
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,440
You go to linux.ting.com to save.

881
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,560
They have a CDMA and GSM network.

882
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,560
That's going to be key here.

883
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,560
I'll tell you in just a moment.

884
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
Yeah.

885
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Oh, man.

886
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
But here's what's great.

887
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,720
No contracts, no determination fee, and it's only $6 for the line.

888
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,360
And then you just pay for your usage on top of that.

889
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,360
That's all you pay.

890
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,800
You don't have to like pre-buy minutes and messages and megabytes and all that stuff

891
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
that you might use.

892
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,500
Like I might use 800 minutes and I might use 10 gigabytes.

893
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,160
That's just not a game you play.

894
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,160
It's super simple to activate your devices, especially like the Nexus devices.

895
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,520
You just put the SIM card in and activate the SIM card and you're good to go.

896
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,220
They have radically good customer service, radically better than the rest of the industry.

897
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,680
Their dashboard also is just fantastic.

898
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,960
But you know, we just are super lucky.

899
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,480
Bellingham just has crazy good Ting coverage.

900
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:33,700
In the expo hall, sitting at the booth, Noah and I have LTE coverage, which to be at a

901
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,280
conference and have LTE coverage is so nice.

902
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,020
And because a lot, just about almost all the JB crew there was on Ting, we all had connectivity.

903
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:48,240
So we could message each other and it was crucial to making it a smooth Linux fest.

904
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,240
And a huge part of that is being able to choose your network, CDMA or GSM means that you can

905
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,240
pick whichever is stronger in your area and be able to do that just if you know what those

906
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,440
things are, if you know there's something called GSM and CDMA and you vaguely know what

907
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,400
they are and you can vaguely look up coverage maps, you're good to go.

908
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,040
And Ting is super easy when you understand that difference and they make control all

909
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,820
yours with their excellent control panel.

910
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,820
We're doing all this stuff.

911
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,800
We never have to talk to customer service, nothing like that.

912
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,000
It's a really good service and they have really great staff.

913
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,840
In fact, they just recently did a blog post kind of about how they make their margins

914
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,640
between different towns and how they're making money on fiber internet rollout.

915
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,880
They're just really open about that kind of stuff and transparent.

916
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,880
So you can check out their blog.

917
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,080
But first, go to linux.ting.com so we get the credit.

918
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,900
Noah showed up with a $9 SIM card, which was awesome, I ended up using that.

919
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:38,560
They have the Motorola E second gen, which I don't think I would want for myself when

920
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,680
I could get the LG Volt, but the Motorola E second gen, $74 unlocked, you own it.

921
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,400
I would go for the LG Volt 2, though, because Marshmallow's coming out for that, 66 bucks,

922
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
no contract.

923
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,760
It can do most everything you really need in a phone.

924
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,020
That's ridiculous, right?

925
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,200
And it ships tomorrow.

926
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,120
It's got a decent camera on the thing, it's got tri-band LTE connectivity, it's got that

927
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,360
faux metal back with the little thingy there.

928
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
Oh, the thingy.

929
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
The thingy.

930
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,960
What's that little, it's got that little shutter button right there.

931
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:10,000
This is seriously, and a quad core Snapdragon processor for 66 bucks, and it's going to

932
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
get Marshmallow.

933
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,280
Yeah, I don't know if it has it yet, because they just released the press release a little

934
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,280
bit ago.

935
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,680
They also have internet phones, they have the blue dash, which is cool, for 103 bucks,

936
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,840
unlocked, all of these are no contract.

937
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
Netgear Zing is my MiFi that I use.

938
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,480
Oh, I've been thinking about getting one of those.

939
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,960
Yeah, that's what I use, I love it.

940
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,520
You can check them out, they have the OnePlus on there, or you can just go get the Nexus,

941
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,000
I don't know if they're still on sale at Google Play, but they were recently, and then you

942
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,520
just grab it and put it on the Ting network.

943
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,540
Just start by going to linux.ting.com, that supports the show, lets them know you heard

944
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,240
about it here, that keeps us on the air, and it gives you that discount.

945
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:47,000
Or, if you already have a device you can bring, it'll give you a service credit, linux.ting.com.

946
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,720
Linux Fest Northwest, you guys couldn't all be there, turns out, so we wanted to give

947
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,920
you a little flavor.

948
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,160
In the unplugged program, I cut things a little loose.

949
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,200
So I didn't cut it, like in last, you know, we'll put some transitions in there, I cut

950
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,840
it right to when we do the introduction, like it really stands out, like in the clip where

951
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:10,920
I introduce you, like, you'll actually see me reset and then introduce you, but I just

952
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,680
left it all in there, because this is the unplugged program, so I'm gonna show you guys

953
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,180
everything.

954
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:21,520
So let's start with, well let's actually start with something that happened before we got

955
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
to Linux Fest Northwest.

956
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:28,000
Now you might have noticed in last week's episode, 141, the energy was really high.

957
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,620
We were having a good, rambunctious time in last week's episode, and this is how it goes.

958
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:36,620
We got all these projects, you know, we're finally reunited in person, we get to work

959
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:42,660
on all these things, we get to do all this stuff, and so last week, we all kind of huddled

960
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,960
in the studio, because it was a full house, and Noah and I were sharing a microphone.

961
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:53,320
Well, that was a really dumb idea, you might notice we're not doing that this week.

962
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:59,620
And Noah had to pay a very high cost, and the question came up, if you listen to last

963
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:04,000
week's episode, you might hear something that kind of sounds, kind of like something falling

964
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,120
over, you know, something like, something that maybe tipped over, and you might hear

965
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,800
your host get really stressed out for a few moments, well I'm not gonna say exactly what

966
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,760
happened because, well, we covered it on the livestream, somebody noticed and asked us

967
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,760
about it.

968
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,320
And by the way, I am not drunk in this clip.

969
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,320
I am not drunk.

970
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,320
Was I drunk at Linux Fest?

971
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,320
Did I have anything to drink?

972
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,320
No.

973
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,320
You didn't have time to get anything to drink.

974
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:34,120
No, no, yeah, I was dehydrated, if anything, but just exhausted, because we'd worked so

975
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:39,880
hard up to this point, it was a bumpy day tech-wise, and I was so happy when Wes showed

976
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,880
up.

977
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,320
It was good to see a friendly face.

978
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:51,240
Of course, Wes, you know how sometimes you're doing a show, and things happen, and you just

979
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,360
gotta keep doing the show, like, maybe you gotta go get a beer, so one of us gets up

980
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,360
and grabs a beer, and the other guy keeps doing the show, right?

981
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,360
Yeah.

982
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,760
Well, also, same thing happens when you spill a beer.

983
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,760
That does happen.

984
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:08,720
So we were doing, Noah and I were sharing a mic in Linux Unplugged, as you recall, what,

985
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,720
what, you want this?

986
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,720
Yeah.

987
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:18,520
And Wes was sitting there with us, doing a show, very fun, and I was going to switch

988
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:24,200
a camera shot, and I knock over my beer, right on top of Noah's ThinkPad.

989
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:29,280
And it was great, because it wasn't like beer splashed, it was like a, glug glug glug glug

990
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,280
glug glug glug.

991
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,280
Yeah, that sound happened.

992
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,680
And I think all of us in the studio were like, oh crap, we can't say anything, what do we

993
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,680
do?

994
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,680
Let's be very quiet.

995
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,860
So all three of us just start silently communicating, like, while we're still doing the show.

996
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,860
That was amazing.

997
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,860
It was an intense moment.

998
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,860
Yeah, it was an intense moment.

999
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,920
What's funny was, I went back and listened.

1000
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,560
There's, I mean, if you know what you're listening.

1001
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,940
You can hear the beer fall.

1002
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:54,800
You can tell, but if you didn't know what was happening, I don't know that anyone would

1003
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,800
know anything was up.

1004
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,800
You have no idea.

1005
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,880
It's great, we just gave that away.

1006
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,200
You can hear a beer fall over in the episode, but you can't hear it pouring on the laptop.

1007
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,680
No, you don't hear the glug, glug, glug, glug.

1008
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,680
But you hear the funk, glug, glug.

1009
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,560
Well, yeah, and you also can hear the stress in the voice.

1010
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,560
Oh, really?

1011
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,560
Oh, yeah.

1012
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,560
Oh, you can?

1013
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,560
A little bit.

1014
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,560
That's funny.

1015
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,560
So what was the outcome of that?

1016
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:19,080
Well, it became a project to take it apart and try to drain it.

1017
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,600
Now it's in this UPS box on its way back to Lenovo to get fixed.

1018
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,120
Actually, it's not Lenovo.

1019
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,600
It's actually a guy that runs a YouTube channel that teaches people how to fix their computers

1020
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,520
at the component level, like the soldering and stuff like that.

1021
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:39,280
So if you have a MacBook or ThinkPad or anything, and the controller goes out in it, Apple will

1022
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,940
tell you that you need to buy a new computer, that it's not repairable.

1023
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:49,440
And he will show you how to buy a $0.39 component and solder it back into your computer.

1024
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,880
Now you know he has a good YouTube channel because he led me to believe that I was so

1025
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,040
confident in what I could do that I could fix my own computer, which did not work out

1026
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,100
well at all.

1027
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,100
So now I'm going to send it to him and he can fix it.

1028
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,000
But someone more confident than you probably could have.

1029
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yes, that is true.

1030
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
That is true.

1031
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,720
Yeah, we were sad because it looked like it might just be a simple keyboard issue.

1032
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:14,800
And then, of course, in the disassembly and to try to resolve the keyboard issue, it doesn't

1033
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,080
really go back together.

1034
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:22,640
By the way, whoever came up with the ribbon cables, screw all y'all, screw all y'all.

1035
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,080
I want a little white connector with individual pins that I can plug in and unplug.

1036
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,080
Dude, I got it.

1037
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,080
Yeah.

1038
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,080
Lasers.

1039
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,080
Lasers.

1040
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:36,520
So as Popey would probably point out, the ThinkPad should have been fine, right, Popey?

1041
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,320
The ThinkPad, it has the drain holes.

1042
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,840
It should have been okay.

1043
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,840
Yeah.

1044
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,840
It's his enterprise hardware.

1045
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,840
Yeah.

1046
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,200
I mean, Popey is, he's like a fanatic.

1047
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,200
So he's, he's efficient.

1048
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,200
He knows about these things.

1049
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,460
And of course, well, you would think so.

1050
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:53,080
But first, before we get to that, this, just because you couldn't see what happened, Noah

1051
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,720
wanted to recreate how things likely went down in the studio if we could have said something

1052
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,040
to each other.

1053
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,360
This is, this is that moment.

1054
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,360
Oh, my God.

1055
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,360
I am so sorry.

1056
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,080
I did not mean to do that.

1057
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,440
It was totally accidental.

1058
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,440
But here's the thing.

1059
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,780
I'm on air doing Linux unplugged.

1060
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:11,280
So if we stop right now to address this, we have to start the entire episode over because

1061
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,040
we recorded all in one cut.

1062
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:18,000
And my feet are really nasty because this is sticky and there's stuff all over.

1063
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,240
So paper towels could get in here.

1064
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,240
That'd be great.

1065
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
That was pretty much it.

1066
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,240
Yeah.

1067
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,900
I like that you put on my shirt to do that, Noah.

1068
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,400
Although you know, you didn't get the collar quite right.

1069
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,400
I'm just saying.

1070
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,400
That's right.

1071
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,400
Yeah, it's okay.

1072
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,400
I aim for the hair to be right, too.

1073
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,400
But I think I failed on that, too.

1074
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,400
Yeah.

1075
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,400
Yeah.

1076
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,400
Yeah.

1077
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,400
The ribbon cables.

1078
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,840
So he disassembles it and makes sure there was no beer in there.

1079
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,400
And the keyboard did get kind of wrecked.

1080
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,720
Even though it has the drain holes, it got kind of wrecked.

1081
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,760
So he disassembles it to see if anything else gets wrecked.

1082
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,760
Good news.

1083
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,760
It's just the keyboard.

1084
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,760
Nice.

1085
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,760
So he orders himself a keyboard.

1086
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,760
Keyboard arrives.

1087
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,400
Turns out the thing doesn't go quite back together quite right.

1088
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,000
I was following a YouTube guide and the guy literally is like, well, this cable here,

1089
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,160
I never quite figured out how to disconnect it properly.

1090
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,720
So if you just yank on it really hard, it comes disconnected.

1091
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:10,400
And that was about the point where I realized my ThinkPad was screwed and I should probably

1092
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,160
send it into Lewis to get him to fix it.

1093
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,160
Oh, Noah.

1094
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,160
Wow.

1095
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,160
Oh, yeah.

1096
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,160
Yeah.

1097
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,000
So this, you guys got to remember, this was Saturday.

1098
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Things were a little crazy.

1099
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Oh, Saturday.

1100
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,260
And there was a competition, Nye.

1101
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,040
The Switch competition was that evening.

1102
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,960
And so that's really where a lot of our thoughts were.

1103
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,540
And Noah, just the thing about Noah is you could try to set things up so that he'll go

1104
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,540
to bed early.

1105
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:39,560
And no matter what you do, he's still going to be up till 2 a.m. in the morning in the

1106
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,640
lobby of the hotel talking about, you guessed it.

1107
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,200
He goes down there to talk about Linux and ends up with a bunch of people sitting around

1108
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,160
him and they're all talking about Linux instead of sleeping.

1109
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,560
We get a little bit of peek of that and then watch as Noah pivots from that and starts

1110
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,200
recruiting him to try to help with the Switch competition.

1111
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:01,520
The man is unstoppable.

1112
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,760
So here's by the way, I just included a little bit of this.

1113
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,560
This here is the shot of our booth, if you guys didn't get to see so much of the live

1114
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,560
coverage.

1115
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,560
Sweet booth.

1116
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,560
Yeah, it was really great.

1117
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,320
It's Chase in the bottom corner and I'm over there in the other corner.

1118
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:16,440
There's Albert Westra and there's Jed's butt over there, so you guys can catch that, which

1119
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,440
is nice.

1120
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,720
So it was a really cool, it was actually a great booth.

1121
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,880
And so we were sitting there just kind of getting things fixed up and Noah's buddy stops

1122
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,880
by.

1123
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,880
Did you watch that episode?

1124
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,880
I didn't, no chance.

1125
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,480
Okay, no, that's fine.

1126
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,040
So I host the show with Chris, if that isn't evident to you yet.

1127
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,040
We should recap the story a little bit.

1128
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,480
I was walking, you were walking in the hotel and you look over my shoulder and you're like,

1129
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,480
hey, is that Linux?

1130
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,480
Hey, is that Linux?

1131
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,480
Yeah, I've heard the story.

1132
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,600
And then you mistakenly thought you were just going to walk off and go back upstairs and

1133
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,600
what, go to bed or something?

1134
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,400
Like, no, that's not going to happen.

1135
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,120
So I was like, no, come on over here.

1136
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,440
So then you decided you had to go, you were going to go get your significant other and

1137
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,440
your brother was with you, right?

1138
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,440
Yeah.

1139
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,440
Oh, there's your brother.

1140
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,440
There he is.

1141
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,440
Hello, Hussein.

1142
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,440
That's Hussein and that's Devon.

1143
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,440
Hussein.

1144
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,440
Hussein.

1145
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,440
And that's Devon.

1146
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,440
And you're new.

1147
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,440
Oh, okay.

1148
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,440
Check out his tattoo.

1149
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,440
Yeah, I like that.

1150
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,440
Nice.

1151
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,440
Nice.

1152
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,000
So I'm guessing you use Linux then if you bothered to ink it on your body.

1153
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
He's a Linux user.

1154
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
You're a Linux user?

1155
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Yeah.

1156
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Yeah.

1157
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
You can stay.

1158
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Draft it on your skin.

1159
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You better be.

1160
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Yeah, right.

1161
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So we sat down.

1162
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
What do you think it was?

1163
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Like an hour conversation?

1164
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Oh my God.

1165
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Hour and a half at least.

1166
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Yeah.

1167
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Oh my gosh, dude.

1168
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
What time?

1169
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
What time of night is this?

1170
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Two in the morning.

1171
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Yeah.

1172
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I didn't get to bed before two.

1173
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Dude, do you ever sleep?

1174
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
You got to sleep tonight.

1175
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
There was Linux to talk about.

1176
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah.

1177
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
He tells me he has to be here at 830.

1178
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I'm like, oh my God.

1179
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
You know what?

1180
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I just sleep in.

1181
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
It's not a big deal.

1182
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I'm in the dark.

1183
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I know.

1184
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And he's got to be live all day.

1185
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,400
But there was Linux to be had.

1186
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,400
Yeah.

1187
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,400
Okay.

1188
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,400
So we sat.

1189
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,400
We talked about Linux.

1190
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,400
We talked about Arch.

1191
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,400
We talked about Ubuntu.

1192
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,400
Anyway, super, super cool people.

1193
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,400
Aw, thank you.

1194
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,400
And you guys are...

1195
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,440
So you actually travel here every year for the last six years?

1196
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,480
Yeah, something like five years, four years, four to six years.

1197
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,480
Something like that.

1198
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,480
So tell me about that.

1199
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,840
How did you get from Vancouver to come to Linux Fest?

1200
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,640
There's nothing like this.

1201
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,640
Linux Fest is unique.

1202
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,640
Every conference is unique.

1203
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:13,640
But Linux Fest being free and open to everybody is very like the community in and of itself.

1204
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,600
And it's just so much difference than a paid conference.

1205
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,600
The talks are more inclusive.

1206
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,600
People are more friendly.

1207
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,600
We had a crazy conversation at 2 a.m.

1208
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,440
Now you've attended Linux Con.

1209
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,000
So you've gone to both sides...

1210
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,320
I call it both sides of the...

1211
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,320
Corporate Linux.

1212
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,320
Yeah.

1213
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,320
Can you compare and contrast the two events for me?

1214
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,680
Corporate Linux, the talks are very more in-depth.

1215
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,280
Like the speakers clearly work in the field.

1216
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,320
And like there's no question that they know what they're talking about.

1217
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:47,560
But at the same time, it's kind of intimidating because like these are these are hardcore

1218
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,560
heavy professionals.

1219
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,600
And it's not that you don't get that here.

1220
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,920
There's definitely those kinds of talks here.

1221
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:57,640
But it's more like reading a forum where people just kind of talk and you get more of a community

1222
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,640
feel with even the talks.

1223
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,640
Yeah.

1224
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:06,120
And so have you ever been to Linux Con or Roscon or any of the like the big like corporate

1225
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,120
events?

1226
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:12,960
Have you ever been to that and had any sort of like spontaneous, completely unplanned,

1227
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,960
totally unwarranted community events like we had?

1228
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,960
Because it wasn't just him.

1229
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,800
It was him and it was Devin and it was and it was just right.

1230
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,320
And then your buddy Sean was there, you know, so it's like we had like this little group

1231
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,680
that just assembled at the hotel.

1232
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,760
I mean, like right now we have this group that is forming here.

1233
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:36,560
So how can you have you ever had something like that happen at one of those larger events?

1234
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,560
It's different.

1235
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,880
I chatted with John Mad Dog Hall on the bus to the after party.

1236
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,680
So I mean, you know, that's a perk.

1237
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,680
Yeah, exactly.

1238
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,680
But it's not the same where people just talk.

1239
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,080
And I think because you see Mad Dog Hall, it's hard to just interject in the conversation.

1240
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,840
And I was talking with that guy at the Software Freedom Law Center.

1241
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,840
Forget his name.

1242
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,160
He does some really awesome stuff.

1243
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,160
Even?

1244
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,160
No, no.

1245
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,160
Shit.

1246
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,160
Maybe it was.

1247
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,160
Yes.

1248
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,160
It was even more one.

1249
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,160
Yes.

1250
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,160
And again, awesome conversation.

1251
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,160
We're talking on the floor.

1252
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,160
Crowd forms around us.

1253
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,160
But nobody wants to talk.

1254
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,160
Yeah.

1255
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,160
Because it's even freaking mobile.

1256
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1257
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,160
Talk to the guy.

1258
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,160
Yeah.

1259
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,160
I'm weird.

1260
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,160
I just like to talk to people.

1261
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,160
Yeah.

1262
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,920
So I want to I do want to talk.

1263
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,920
I do want to talk to your brother.

1264
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,000
I do want to talk to your girlfriend.

1265
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,240
But can you tell me if you were?

1266
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:27,000
Can you tell me what you would say to somebody that has that maybe is thinking about coming

1267
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,800
to Linux Fest, but hasn't really been here, isn't really sure they're kind of on the fence?

1268
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:36,400
What would you say if somebody asked you what you what they should do or you having so much

1269
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,480
experience coming to Linux Fest, what you would say to them?

1270
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,200
I wouldn't waste their time.

1271
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,000
I just say come and check it out.

1272
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,360
You can't know until you're here.

1273
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,360
All right.

1274
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,360
Last thing.

1275
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,360
Last thing.

1276
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,360
One last thing.

1277
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,360
This is kind of like icing on the cake.

1278
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,360
You have like the cake and then you have the icing.

1279
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,360
Sure.

1280
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,400
Tell me about text messages and being concise.

1281
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,400
Oh, man.

1282
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,400
Oh, man.

1283
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,400
You.

1284
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,400
Yeah.

1285
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,400
Yeah.

1286
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,400
Yeah.

1287
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,400
Everyone needs here.

1288
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,400
This is a PSA.

1289
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,400
Kind of like how I.

1290
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,400
I just got three text messages while you asked that.

1291
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,400
Oh, my God.

1292
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,400
One thread.

1293
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,400
Yeah.

1294
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,400
Yeah.

1295
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,960
Kind of like I did just there where I took 10 seconds to organize my thoughts and the

1296
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,960
host didn't mind.

1297
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,440
They, you know, interjected and said something while I organized my thoughts.

1298
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,440
I didn't do that here.

1299
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:23,280
I'm kind of spamming it out, but you organize your thoughts and you get it out in one message.

1300
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,280
One message.

1301
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,840
Otherwise, and you know, I have this watch and this watch vibrates every time I get a

1302
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,840
message.

1303
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,840
Oh, my God.

1304
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,400
How does it help you to answer if you get like three spams rather than.

1305
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,400
One concise message.

1306
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,400
It doesn't.

1307
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,400
It drives me.

1308
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,400
I start to think, oh, there must be an emergency.

1309
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,400
I better check right.

1310
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,400
Oh, no.

1311
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,400
It just spread out.

1312
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,400
It spread out over four messages.

1313
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,800
And when it comes to an actual emergency, you'll just be ignored.

1314
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,840
So you're lost, but.

1315
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,840
One message.

1316
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,840
Keep it concise.

1317
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,840
All right.

1318
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,840
Can we talk to your girlfriend or your brother?

1319
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,840
Who was ever up?

1320
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,840
Or both?

1321
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,840
Anybody?

1322
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,840
Next up.

1323
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:57,480
That was, that was particularly for me because he knows that that was kind of funny about

1324
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,480
this guy, too.

1325
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,880
So he sits down, right?

1326
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,700
And he sees a Jupiter broadcasting sticker on our laptop and he goes, oh, do you guys

1327
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,840
listen to Jupiter broadcasting?

1328
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,560
And so I, you know, I stopped for a second to see if he's trolling me, if he's serious

1329
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,560
and he's serious.

1330
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,560
I'm like, yeah, no, we do.

1331
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,560
And he's like, are they any good?

1332
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,560
The shows any good?

1333
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,000
I'm like, yeah, hosts are all right.

1334
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,200
There's one guy in the Linux action show kind of darker skin.

1335
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,400
He's kind of a kind of a jerk, but everything else is fine.

1336
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,520
So then we start talking about the, you know, the, the episodes and stuff.

1337
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,520
And that's when I told him, I said, you know, go watch the Ubuntu versus arch episode.

1338
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,880
I think that would clarify some of the things that, you know, we were talking about or whatever,

1339
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,880
but I thought it would be funny if he had seen it before he actually came over to the

1340
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,880
booth.

1341
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,520
And then he shows up at the booth and turns out, oh, that's the guy.

1342
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:41,600
So there, so what happens a few moments after that, and this is super funny is his girlfriend

1343
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,360
says, no, I don't really feel like sitting down.

1344
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,760
And I just decided not to, I just, that was long enough clip.

1345
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,760
I wanted to cut it.

1346
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,360
The next thing that Noah does when the, when the, when his girlfriend declines to sit down

1347
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,400
and he says, okay, okay, will you guys do me a favor?

1348
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,960
Will you go out and find anybody running windows and tell them to come see me?

1349
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,920
And then, and maybe this is actually probably a good thing I cut it out is then he gives

1350
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,920
out his telegram handle.

1351
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,320
He's like, or just have them telegram me.

1352
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,320
Let's organize this thing.

1353
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,880
Cause he's getting super competitive.

1354
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,800
And just as we start getting competitive, guess who stops by for a chat?

1355
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,800
Guess who stops by?

1356
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,800
Why?

1357
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,800
Yes, it's Emma.

1358
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,320
And I was stepping, I had stepped away from the booth for a couple of seconds.

1359
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,000
And so Noah and Angela were sitting on the live stream cause I was out taking a walk

1360
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
around the floor.

1361
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,060
I wanted to get a feel for it.

1362
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:25,700
And Emma stops by to talk, well, talk about actually switching people to Linux, which

1363
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,680
is really interesting if you're trying to switch people to Linux.

1364
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,800
And she also talks a little bit about the switch competition.

1365
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,800
Yeah, yeah.

1366
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,800
Come over here.

1367
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,800
Did you hear that we did a hashtag team Noah?

1368
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,800
I did.

1369
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,800
Okay.

1370
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,800
Isn't there a hashtag team Emma?

1371
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,800
There needs to be.

1372
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,800
There is.

1373
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,800
There is now.

1374
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,400
Hashtag, hashtag team.

1375
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,400
You pointed that way.

1376
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,080
Oh, I was pointing to the sign.

1377
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,080
No, you were fine.

1378
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,080
It's right in the center.

1379
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,080
Learn how to frame man.

1380
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,080
I was just pointing.

1381
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,080
I can't see it.

1382
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,080
The camera got moved.

1383
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,080
So we're not centered anymore.

1384
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,080
I can't see it.

1385
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,400
And when somebody does this, I think that means, I'm sorry, that's good.

1386
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,400
Team Emma.

1387
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,400
Hashtag team Emma.

1388
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,800
Which is the, this is, so what we're doing here, this is the team that you don't want

1389
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,800
to go for.

1390
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,800
Oh.

1391
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,800
No, I'm just kidding.

1392
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,800
I'm kidding.

1393
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,440
If you want a awesome, I'm going to get in trouble now.

1394
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,440
You're going to get me in trouble.

1395
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,960
Now my boss is going to see me hanging a sign on our camera that says team Emma.

1396
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,520
What are you guys doing to me?

1397
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,320
This was a setup.

1398
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,320
Who did this?

1399
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:21,120
So if you're looking for an awesome experience on hardware, if you didn't, let's say you

1400
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,420
didn't want to be switched to Linux on your computer.

1401
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:27,040
Let's say you just wanted Linux to work on your computer.

1402
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,440
Then you might consider system 76, right?

1403
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,280
So tell me how long have you been at system 76, Emma?

1404
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,560
Almost four and a half years.

1405
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,880
And what do you do for them?

1406
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,320
I am the consumer sales manager.

1407
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,680
And what does that mean exactly?

1408
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:48,000
I manage individual sales, so if it's not a business or a university, I'll handle all

1409
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:55,000
aspects of the sale, including sales questions over the phone or on our social networks.

1410
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,160
And that's about it.

1411
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,560
So do you get a lot of Windows users that call in and want to, that are looking to switch

1412
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,560
to Linux?

1413
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,560
Yes.

1414
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:09,400
Everyone starts the conversation with, you know, I'm just so sick of Windows and I Googled

1415
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,960
and I found you guys.

1416
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,960
Oh, it's not.

1417
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,520
I listen to Jupiter Broadcasting.

1418
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:19,240
That is actually very common, too, but you guys don't have, you guys have more Linux

1419
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,920
users listening to your show.

1420
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,920
Sure.

1421
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,920
Thank you.

1422
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:27,800
Because I think you guys switch them by having the show.

1423
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,560
When people call in, do you guys sell Windows hardware?

1424
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,760
Like if I wanted to buy a computer with Windows, do you guys ship that?

1425
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:39,240
So when somebody calls in and they say, I'm interested in a computer, is there a conversation

1426
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,280
that takes place where you have to convince them that they're going to buy this computer

1427
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,040
and have Linux installed and use it?

1428
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,920
Or have they already made that decision when they call in?

1429
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,280
A lot of times they've made the decision that they're fed up with it, but then they have

1430
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,720
some questions about why they're hesitant.

1431
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:02,600
So I'll answer maybe five or six questions and then they'll get happier as the conversation

1432
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,600
goes.

1433
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,200
I can hear them smile every time I give them an answer and they're like, oh, this is sounding

1434
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,200
great already.

1435
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,720
This is so much better than Windows.

1436
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,720
I'm so excited.

1437
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,480
So I get them excited.

1438
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,920
And when you're talking to these people, you're having these conversations, what kind of questions

1439
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,920
are they asking?

1440
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,960
Do I need virus protection?

1441
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,720
What kind of apps are installed?

1442
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,200
What kind of software will work with it?

1443
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,720
Can I open Windows documents?

1444
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,920
What are some alternatives for certain types of software?

1445
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,120
So those are pretty much the most common questions.

1446
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,600
And what kind of support is there available?

1447
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:47,000
And we offer lifetime software support, so that's a winner too.

1448
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,840
So you have a one year warranty on the hardware?

1449
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,840
So after that one year, they can continue to call in and ask questions, even if it's

1450
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:56,040
not the version of Ubuntu that shipped on their laptop and you will continue to help

1451
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,040
them?

1452
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,200
For hardware, yes.

1453
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,320
So we don't ever turn away anyone for support.

1454
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,960
So we do offer a one year, two year, or three year warranty.

1455
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,700
So that would cover the cost of the parts and repair.

1456
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:15,520
But if you do need a part and you're out of warranty, we'll still get you the part.

1457
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:22,200
How many people have called in and said, I am a perfectly happy Windows user and I don't

1458
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,020
really have any interest?

1459
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:28,140
They haven't started the conversation with switching to Linux and have you dealt with

1460
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,140
that?

1461
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,720
You know why he's asking, right?

1462
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,240
I know why he's asking.

1463
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:36,880
He's asking because he's trying to determine how big of a challenge he faces.

1464
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,320
What he's trying to set here is the narrative that they're already on the way to switching

1465
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,320
when they call.

1466
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,320
And that's what he said.

1467
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,800
He's sitting over there laughing and shaking his head because he knows that's true.

1468
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,840
And so this is how competitive Noah is.

1469
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:52,480
Even in the interview questions, he's setting it up that way.

1470
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,480
It's so great.

1471
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:58,240
You have talked them from, I think I'm maybe not a perfectly happy Windows user, but it's

1472
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:03,920
tolerable and it works for me, into you need to start running Linux.

1473
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,800
They're always just so close to the edge.

1474
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,080
So I'm just that hand to hold.

1475
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,080
Okay.

1476
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,500
Now I have to ask, if somebody wanted to get in contact with you here at the Fest, is there

1477
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,000
a way for them to do that?

1478
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Yes.

1479
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,960
They can either tweet to System76 or contact us through our Facebook page or come by our

1480
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,960
booth.

1481
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,560
And your booth is...

1482
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,000
How do you identify booths?

1483
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,840
I don't know.

1484
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:29,840
Second to the last...

1485
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,840
We have a blue curtain.

1486
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,840
I don't...

1487
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,680
Second to the last row from the door.

1488
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,680
If you come in the main door...

1489
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,680
I would just call it the middle.

1490
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:37,680
They are B2.

1491
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,680
B2.

1492
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,680
Oh, there.

1493
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,680
Oh, look at you pulling out a mask.

1494
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,680
Oh, look at you being smart.

1495
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,680
So here's us.

1496
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:43,680
There we are.

1497
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,680
See, and that's...

1498
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,680
So...

1499
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,680
Hey.

1500
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,680
How you doing?

1501
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,680
Good.

1502
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,680
They're the next row, right behind you.

1503
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,680
Thanks.

1504
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,680
Thanks.

1505
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,680
Pretty clever.

1506
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,680
That's System76.

1507
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,680
Two presentations.

1508
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,680
Well, thank you very much for stopping by the booth.

1509
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,680
Yeah.

1510
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,680
That's not trolling.

1511
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,680
Well, yeah.

1512
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,680
That's not trolling.

1513
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,680
Are you, in fact, Team Emma?

1514
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,680
Huh?

1515
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,680
Are you, in fact, Team Emma?

1516
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,680
I am.

1517
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,680
Then it's not trolling.

1518
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,680
I am Team Emma.

1519
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,680
The only thing trolling is making me hold that up when my boss is walking in.

1520
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,680
Well, if you were interviewing someone, I was gonna come by and be like...

1521
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,680
Oh.

1522
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,680
That would be trolling.

1523
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,680
Yeah.

1524
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,680
That would be my original plan.

1525
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,680
That would be trolling out of ten, as we're saying.

1526
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,680
Oh, geez, Noah.

1527
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,680
Oh, geez.

1528
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,680
Trolling out of ten.

1529
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,680
So, yeah.

1530
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:23,000
So that was what's funny is I was, like, watching this back on the replay, I'm like, Noah is

1531
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,560
totally pumping, and he's thinking to himself, okay, so when they come to Emma, they're already

1532
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,440
sort of greased to be switching.

1533
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,440
Switching.

1534
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,440
Switching.

1535
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,440
Oh, whoa.

1536
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,440
So that was pretty funny to see his...

1537
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,440
That was great.

1538
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,440
Wheels turning there.

1539
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,440
Okay.

1540
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:40,840
So, after Emma stopped by, we started realizing we may have ourselves a situation.

1541
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,840
We had...

1542
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,840
We started...

1543
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:46,560
A couple of things had gone down on the live stream, and we decided to get up and go for

1544
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,560
a walk.

1545
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:53,440
And we went, and when we started walking around, we started picking up a little scuttlebutt.

1546
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,100
And by the time we made it back to the live stream, we could definitely feel the tension

1547
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:02,360
building for the night's Switch competition, and, well, I'll let the clip speak for itself

1548
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,360
here.

1549
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,360
Do it live.

1550
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,360
We'll do it live.

1551
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,360
Oh, and Wes stops by, too.

1552
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,360
Hey, there he is.

1553
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,360
Howdy, howdy, sir.

1554
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,360
Sit down in the hot seat.

1555
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,360
Have a seat with us.

1556
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,360
How you doing, Wes?

1557
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,360
Doing wonderfully.

1558
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,360
Yeah.

1559
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:17,800
Hey, it's Wes.

1560
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,520
Wes, grab the mic.

1561
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,520
You gotta eat it a little bit.

1562
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,520
You gotta eat that.

1563
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,520
Oh, hello.

1564
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,520
You gotta do a foul when you're ready there, Mr. Chase.

1565
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,520
All right.

1566
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:31,000
Ladies and gentlemen, joining us here in the hot seat is, of course, one Mr. Wes Payne

1567
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
from Linux Unplugged.

1568
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,040
Wes, good to see you in the flesh, sir.

1569
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,360
Oh, it's wonderful to be here.

1570
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,980
How did the drive up teach you?

1571
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:37,980
Not too bad.

1572
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:38,980
I thought it was gonna rain.

1573
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:39,980
It looks like it's gonna rain.

1574
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:40,980
Yeah.

1575
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:41,980
It's an angry day out there.

1576
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:42,980
It is.

1577
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:43,980
Yeah.

1578
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,560
That is some of the best weather commentary I have ever heard.

1579
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,560
It's an angry day out there.

1580
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:47,560
And then I just play off.

1581
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,560
It's treacherous out there.

1582
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,560
Nothing.

1583
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,560
It's treacherous in the present.

1584
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,560
Yeah.

1585
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,560
A wonderful day for Linux.

1586
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,560
I've actually gotten a chance to go out and do a little watering thing.

1587
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:54,560
You can tell we're doing an amazing job.

1588
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,560
It's like we're going to be in the rain.

1589
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,560
Yeah.

1590
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,560
It's gonna be great.

1591
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,560
We're not.

1592
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,560
We're not going to.

1593
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,560
We're not going to.

1594
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,560
It's a perfect day for Linux.

1595
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,560
It is.

1596
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,560
It is.

1597
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:04,560
It's a perfect day for Linux.

1598
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:05,560
It's a perfect day for Linux.

1599
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,560
It's a perfect day for Linux.

1600
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:07,560
It's a perfect day for Linux.

1601
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:12,600
Yeah, a wonderful day for Linux. I've actually gotten a chance to go out and do it like a little

1602
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:21,200
Him it is and tonight should be a pretty fun night. We have the big switch competition. Oh

1603
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:26,320
Yeah, and and we're going out. How's our main man here feeling? I

1604
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:31,680
You know, here's ready. No, I'll tell you what. Here's when you were born ready. We know that yeah, I was I eat you pay

1605
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,800
Attention. That's what I like about you. No, so I think that I think that I

1606
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,120
Really? I got it. I got to watch my back because yeah

1607
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,600
Here's what I've here's what I know

1608
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:48,520
I know that there is there is no one more dangerous than somebody who is truly motivated and I was over at the at the

1609
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,800
System 76 yeah, and hashtag team Emma

1610
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:57,520
Yeah, they are they're taking it seriously and the thing is she has a lot of stuff going for her that I don't have going

1611
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,360
For me. So for example, she can off if you switch with em, like if you switch with me

1612
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:05,320
Yeah, first of all, just supportive. Well, there's that yeah doesn't hurt you to work

1613
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,840
But that's not gonna help you run Linux and you you're like some weird Indian I am

1614
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:13,600
They haven't deported me yet, but no not normally around many people, you know

1615
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:18,660
But now think about this if you switch with me the support ends when when I leave right because let's face it

1616
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,120
I'm going back to Grand Forks and good luck with your in his rights install

1617
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,840
But now the system 76 they've got a phone number

1618
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:29,440
They have a whole team full of people on standby to switch and when you go to upgrade

1619
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,720
By a different computer or you decide that you need a little bit more horsepower

1620
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:38,800
She can easily just it's literally just a dovetail into a brand new machine loaded with the same operating system

1621
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:43,360
You've already so there so she does have some major major. I'll tell you what. Here's why I'm worried and

1622
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:46,700
You know we

1623
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:50,280
The the fact that we are in our own backyard. Yep

1624
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:56,080
Could actually be just a disadvantage to us. Yeah a little complacent. Yes. We're a little complacent and

1625
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:01,320
Because we're here people, you know people watch the show. They're letting her know that they're back in Noah, right?

1626
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:04,040
I like so that's kind of put her back on her heels a little bit

1627
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,200
And I thinking when you get somebody back on their heels a little bit

1628
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:12,480
They're more aggressive they are and the thing is is there will be a counter pressure to that there will be a counter wave

1629
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,880
It'll swing the other direction

1630
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:19,200
I think by the by the approach of the evening support for team Emma will be building and you actually we can see this in

1631
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,360
The email they're saying there's people are sending it in that is high-resolution screen. I tell you what 4k display. Yeah

1632
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:31,200
a raving raving raving fan writes in and says I'm for hashtag team Emma because she's so happy to help new Windows users get

1633
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,120
Set up with running a bunch

1634
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:37,660
That's what I'm saying is patient a light never makes you feel like you're stupid for not knowing how to add a printer or something

1635
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:44,120
Like that plus she's pink bedazzled workspaces and you can't go wrong with that go hashtag team Emma. That's a

1636
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,920
This is what I'm thinking is I think there will be a groundswell in for Emma because she's nice

1637
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:57,440
She's got the backing of system 76. She's got she's got a pink thing in her hair that matches her shirt that catches the eye

1638
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,520
Yeah, you know it didn't bring his glass

1639
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:04,560
So that was like BSD whore that's a huge conversation starter for a huge conversation starter

1640
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,560
So I'm just a little concerned that

1641
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:12,480
So what and here's the other thing we're not doing this switch here at Linux right because these are mostly Linux

1642
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,640
Yeah, we have to go out into the crowd where we lose our familiar advantage, right?

1643
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,880
So I'm just yeah, and and and I think we may even Jupiter broadcasting. What's that Chris?

1644
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:26,480
I know and to make matters worse. I think we may actually have a defector in our midst. Oh, yeah

1645
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:32,400
I think we have somebody who may be who may have leaked at one of our planned locations to team Emma

1646
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,440
Yeah, so there is no way isn't it?

1647
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,800
There is a lot going on on top of the fact that we're here doing a show, right?

1648
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:43,280
Like I said, I forget about the show at some point because there is just so much

1649
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,280
Dynamics to this to keep track of and and you know

1650
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,280
You got people in the JB crew betting behind the scenes on this thing

1651
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:55,200
You got you got people now defecting to team Emma. I have a groundswell in the community. It is

1652
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,120
down to the wire West so so like

1653
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:03,100
Like every Linux fest Northwest as much as you can handle and more. Yes, exactly

1654
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,040
Yeah, it's an extreme Linux best. Yeah

1655
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:11,240
the so then it was just a couple of hours after that to the switch competition kicked off and

1656
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:16,420
It was nuts and we will have the final results in Sunday's Linux action show

1657
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,040
and it was

1658
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:25,240
Really a kind of intense for us as the host because we kept it all a secret from each other and all of that

1659
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:30,000
So I'm really looking forward to it. Yeah, it has been crazy and I have a couple of photos

1660
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,300
I wanted to share with you guys too. This is a great picture here of Noah

1661
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:38,840
This is what he spent a lot of his time here doing is rebuilding computers swapping parts around you can see

1662
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:44,300
There's just screws and pieces everywhere paper plates pizza rolls

1663
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,080
It's basic fuel tablets

1664
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,920
motherboard boxes, this is this is a picture from the

1665
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,800
After party where I could only get so many people in one shot

1666
01:09:54,800 --> 01:10:00,040
It was just there's people everywhere hanging out around the studio. This is a shot here of some of the pizza here

1667
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,920
Let me take off the lower third there so you can see all of the pizza

1668
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:09,720
Hey, yeah, we fed a lot of people it was healthy eating while we were all here and then of course, there's Emma

1669
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:15,480
She stopped by yeah that Emma. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. She got she got in the studio and we had some fun

1670
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,600
Yeah, so it was all good time. In fact, I got a little clip

1671
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,160
If you're watching the video version here just a little clip of us. We went up to dinner after the switch competition

1672
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,340
Well, that's way louder than I wanted to I apologize for that here

1673
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:29,040
Let me pull it down a little bit here. Oh, so just you can see the venue a little bit

1674
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:35,000
For those of you that are watching Oh, I'm on Goose

1675
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,440
You know what video is hard for Goose. It's you know what Goose. I understand. It's been hard for us this week, too

1676
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,440
There we go

1677
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:51,520
That's the table we we took up and and the crew that helped us out there's Ian from system 76 playing on his

1678
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:56,320
His game boy. It was it was a lot of fun at the day. We went to a really nice place

1679
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:02,280
What was it called the Boundary Bay? Yeah, they may bay. Oh, man, and no if you said it was one of your favorite places

1680
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,280
We'd been yet

1681
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:08,440
All Hall song. Sorry. No, I don't I don't hear you. Sorry. No, hold on Noah get it get your audience

1684

unplugged so I as the show has been going have been loading and hair girls on my Apollo switching it from always a

1708
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,580
pleasant experience

1709
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:31,560
Mm-hmm. It really was switching it from Ubuntu

1710
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:38,600
1604 unity to enter gross and I you know, you could watch episode

1711
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:43,140
413 of the Linux action show where we reviewed Ubuntu 1604

1712
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:50,020
To hear my thoughts on how Ubuntu is difficult to install software. You will also hear Noah's thoughts on why it is not difficult

1713
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,180
however

1714
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:54,420
Noah himself has admitted and

1715
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:58,600
This is I actually think this is kind of a big deal that Ubuntu 1604

1716
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:03,220
Has kind of disenfranchised him from Ubuntu for a bit. No, I do you want to explain what's going on

1717
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:08,500
Literally gotten to a point where a 1604 is no longer even usable for me

1718
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,500
I mean I have it unloaded on this laptop

1719
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:15,540
After everything I was preaching on Sunday was based off the idea that it with the LTS

1720
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:20,500
I know that I'm getting limited software, but the software that is on there will work just fine. Well as it turns out

1721
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:24,540
1604 has screwed even that up because I can't install the software

1722
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:29,500
like I go goes in the software center and I launched into an inadvertent game of ping-pong and

1723
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:34,060
Then I installed you to buy to install it and the software might install but then half of these apps don't

1724
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:38,940
Actually load properly and if they do load properly the menus don't work properly and if those work properly

1725
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:42,860
I realize I'm not on the internet half the time because my network manager crashes and if that works properly I

1726
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:49,140
Just it seems like every time I turn around there's another problem and how this qualifies as an LTS. I

1727
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:55,020
I can't I can I can't as a Linux enthusiast and you know, you see me all the time, right?

1728
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,660
I'm somewhat of an optimist

1729
01:14:56,660 --> 01:15:02,260
I tend the Rekha always calls me the lowest denominator Linux like I'm like well boots and I can see something I call it good

1730
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:07,460
But this is beyond unusable. It's beyond unusable and I'm sure they'll get it fixed

1731
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:11,660
But they have stained the mark of the LTS at this point because they have released

1732
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,500
quote

1733
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:18,020
Reliable solid long-term support software and it's totally useless out of the box

1734
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:22,900
Yeah, and when we were at Linux fest, everybody was kind of nodding their heads when we were complaining about stuff Joe

1735
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:24,900
What's your experience been?

1736
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:28,340
Well, I downloaded it today 1604 I'd been busy

1737
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:30,100
So I've only just got a chance to check it out

1738
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:34,340
And one of the first things I wanted to do is install Chrome because that's what a lot of people do

1739
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:36,340
So I downloaded the the deb

1740
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:40,620
Opened it opens up the software center or software install

1741
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:45,660
It's called now and you press install and just nothing happens and then

1742
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:51,300
Nothing happened. Yep, and then so I thought okay, right? Well d package dash I

1743
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:59,300
And then the path to it and then it gave me the the issue about the char one problem because they've tightened up the security

1744
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:05,260
Right now for me, I know how to get around that but for your average user who Ubuntu is aimed at

1745
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:07,420
That's not a very good situation. Is it?

1746
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:11,060
Just installed Chrome as during the show on Ubuntu

1747
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:15,700
And I mean I paste I did it with via PPA pasting from in from a website into the terminal

1748
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:19,900
But it was the same kind of experience where I was like I could do it, but that's not great

1749
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:26,260
So the things that I've I've personally ran into are sort of are sort of disappointing for myself, too

1750
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:31,620
I have had some serious issues with network manager and I've had some issues with Intel graphics when I'm hooked up to a second monitor

1751
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:35,500
Ironically other people have had the issue when they're not hooked up to a second monitor

1752
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,900
My issues have been when I am hooked up to a second monitor

1753
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:42,900
And if you go back and watch the review, I said this was the most exciting Ubuntu release in a long time

1754
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:49,260
And I still kind of feel that way in some sense. Like I'm not really hesitant to use it on the server

1755
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:55,100
Yeah, right exactly. Yeah, I'm excited still there. Yeah, like I okay Alex the e2o is out, you know

1756
01:16:55,620 --> 01:17:03,140
They've got a support. Yeah, exactly. They've got snap packages will eventually be shipped. I'm sure I'm I hope

1757
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:07,740
But on the desktop, this has been bad. This has been a and you know

1758
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:12,140
The unity version seems to be the worst because I primarily spent my time on Matei and on

1759
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:18,660
Kubuntu and they didn't suffer from a lot of infrastructure on those that kind of mask these problems. Mm-hmm. I

1760
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:26,260
So I am I am I watched it back our review today actually on the on last and I ended it by saying I was extremely

1761
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:30,540
Excited I got to say I'm I'm pretty disappointed as far as a desktop experience goes

1762
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:35,940
I just every single day every single day. There has been an application that I've needed that is not available

1763
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:40,900
Literally every single day it is this whole weekend, you know is a little bit of a rare exception

1764
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:47,060
We're doing a lot of things but has been a so today. I wanted to I wanted to cut those videos of

1765
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:51,180
Linux fest from our live stream, right?

1766
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:56,700
And this is the the video editor we never talk about on the show is the best video editor out there

1767
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:03,420
It is dude. It's called avid mucks and it's yeah, you can you could mark an endpoint and I took videos that were wrapped in

1768
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:05,420
the FLV flash container

1769
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:10,700
drop, I know that one dropped it in avid mucks marked my in and outs and save them out as

1770
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,820
And I and I didn't have to re-encode it just extracts

1771
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:16,340
H264 in the audio and saves them out as MKVs

1772
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:19,120
So not only did I cut my in and outs in the stream files

1773
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:23,460
But I also converted it from a dot FLV to MKV without re-encoding the video

1774
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:28,900
It's a really good tool. I use it for all my clips on them filter all the time. It's my number one editor

1775
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:33,140
it's like a nice like gooey equivalent of ffmpegs power and yes flexibility and

1776
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:39,020
Go ahead and try to install that on Ubuntu 1604 one of the best one of the best quick little apps

1777
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:43,100
You could you'll find PPAs you can get those PPAs and then dependencies won't work

1778
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:46,180
You can try to download devs from get Deb, but it won't work

1779
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:52,060
You cannot actually go download a 1604 Deb directly no installation candidate. No, there's nothing

1780
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:58,100
It's it's it's and it's every single week. I'm sorry every single day. It's an actual useful application

1781
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,700
It's not an esoteric strange app that just got posted up on github

1782
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:07,820
It's real desktop applications on Linux are a pain in the ass to install and that is an egregious one

1783
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:14,540
And 1604 has been just really extremely spotty and I had intended as of last week's episode

1784
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:19,260
To keep Ubuntu on this Apollo for as long as I possibly could and now

1785
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:24,420
Using it here. I I had to take it off. It was just it was just with I

1786
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:31,860
Can't even use it for my workflow. It is it has got to be the one of the worst LTS releases for the desktop ever

1787
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:34,380
and

1788
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:37,140
Then I I don't think it's impossible to fix

1789
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:42,780
I think 1604 dot one or two so in like six months you could be I would have you could be completely I would say

1790
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:44,580
Maybe even three months. Yeah

1791
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:48,260
But what the hell happened and they've been so good at releases in the past

1792
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:52,640
Well, I just don't understand what happened. I don't I mean it's not like anyways, so

1793
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:55,260
We were a little disappointed to I mean

1794
01:19:55,260 --> 01:20:01,580
I think probably know the most but all of us were sort of disappointed in it. And so and it was also like

1795
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:08,740
So it just as another example if you want the latest version of OBS on Ubuntu you need to install Ubuntu 1404

1796
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,940
Really even that is two point releases behind

1797
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:16,160
Now guess what? We needed to use this weekend. Oh, yeah. Oh, yes

1798
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:18,520
you know the only way to get the so

1799
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,480
this week turns out

1800
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:28,560
They revved OBS with Intel quicksync support and Nvidia. I forget what Nvidia is GPU accelerated the same thing

1801
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:33,200
Yeah, they're GPU accelerated encoding which we have an Intel i7 processor and an Nvidia

1802
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:38,820
GPU in our OBS rig and we would love to take advantage of accelerated encoding

1803
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,280
The only way to do that cleanly in a package managed environment

1804
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,560
It was for us. We load an arch

1805
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:49,200
Well, we tried to do Ubuntu right now up on SATCOM one and SATCOM two

1806
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,920
We're still using Ubuntu, but we need to yeah, we actually have to use Ubuntu 1404

1807
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:59,160
So we just had to deploy to Ubuntu 1404 and that's not totally totally outrageous in enterprise production

1808
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,160
But it is kind of outrageous for us, right?

1809
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,400
so I

1810
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:09,000
Even on the server. We actually have deployed a few 1604 servers over the last few days as well

1811
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,360
But I probably will soon. Yeah, I've deployed a couple

1812
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,880
But I don't think anything no nothing in the yes

1813
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,920
You can see me a thumbs up or thumbs down but nothing in the video production chain now is using the 1604, right?

1814
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,120
Everything's 1404 or arch. Yeah, huh?

1815
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:31,080
Yeah, the stuff that needs to be more current and you know need to have the latest support is arch and then the stuff that's

1816
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:36,800
On the back end more stable that handles like all of the back end communications SATCOM one and two are for our Ubuntu 1404, right?

1817
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:42,880
And then that way and it's kind of an indictment in some sense on the release mobile room. Anybody have thoughts or an opposite opinion

1818
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,560
Well, I was just going to say that at least the online search is off by default now

1819
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:54,640
So they've kind of taken that privacy. Yeah stuff into consideration at last. Yeah, I do

1820
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:55,440
I do like that a lot

1821
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:00,000
It's you know, like I think like I've been saying I think it's gonna be a release in a few months

1822
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,960
You could recommend to average people to install but I don't know like the software not installing when you click install

1823
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:11,520
What the swap issue they didn't get fixed until a couple of days before release it just it gives it like a slam-together feeling

1824
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,200
which is not the impression you want to give for an LTS and it

1825
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,200
See if you're if you're a cynic like me like if you're kind of a jerk you start thinking

1826
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,560
Well, you know

1827
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:26,640
maybe it's because they had that BQ tablet that ended up needing to ship right around the LTS release and they needed to work on

1828
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:31,360
Getting that ready and maybe they got distracted and they also had that bash on Windows

1829
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:38,400
And they also had that bash on Windows project like maybe they were spread a little thin during the build up to a question

1830
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:42,560
Their allocation of resources it does and that's and I could be completely wrong

1831
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,680
But that when you when you deliver something like this people start going. What are they?

1832
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:49,520
Is this a safe bet questions are asked? Yeah. Yeah

1833
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,040
So, uh

1834
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:55,040
I don't I don't want this to be a total downer because I still save those drives and I plan to plug them back in

1835
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:59,680
In a couple of months. I'm still gonna do an update some deploys here. Yeah, and I still plan to run it on servers

1836
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:02,960
Uh, but I I just I I think i'm gonna hold the breaks

1837
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:08,000
I'm gonna and you know, I watched watching that review back. I was all in I was actually and i've been saying on this show

1838
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:11,760
For for months and this is the the release i'm the most excited about

1839
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,960
True and I ran it for a month up to the review

1840
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:20,800
But you know the big mistake I made there is because I just wasn't all that excited about unity is I ran plasma desktop and matte

1841
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:26,000
And and and truly, you know wimpy has has really smoothed over some of these rough edges

1842
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,160
And it's not nearly as bad of an experience on ubuntu mattei and to that end the machines

1843
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:33,440
We have put in production running ubuntu are on ubuntu mattei

1844
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:36,240
Right. Yeah, so

1845
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:41,040
Yeah, it's just sort of the way it's shaking out wimpy. Are you still here? Do you have any thoughts on the 1604 release?

1846
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:44,720
I wonder if he i'm not sure if he's still here or not

1847
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:50,400
I can't see the screen. No, I don't think so. I think both him and poppy were from hotel connections and had to disconnect

1848
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,880
Uh, i'm curious. Maybe we'll pick his brain. I don't want to over overdo the ubuntu coverage

1849
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:02,080
But uh, I you know, I will say installing that ubuntu mattei welcome package on any 1604 release really does go a long way

1850
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:09,120
I totally agree. I really do. All right mumble any mumble any closing thoughts on the ubuntu, uh follow up before we uh, wrap it up

1851
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,480
Going once going twice

1852
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,900
I take that as sort of a tacit agreement unless you disagree otherwise

1853
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,040
That's legit right streamer streamer says yeah

1854
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,840
Okay stream says no disagreement

1855
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:28,480
Uh, yeah. Yeah poppy had to disconnect. I know I really think that uh, it's a

1856
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:33,760
Okay closing thoughts really quick just just to wrap it up because I did share these on the live stream on saturday

1857
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:38,240
Part of me. Here's what I think happened. I think maybe they legitimately got distracted

1858
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,120
They had too many things

1859
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:43,920
They were working on before 1604 came out and they have this release date so much is built around

1860
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:49,600
Ubuntu hitting this release date all the flavors, uh, you know, uh vps is the whole big rolling

1861
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:54,000
It's an industry now based around these lts releases and so they have to hit that release date

1862
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
There's a lot of pressure to hit that release date

1863
01:24:56,240 --> 01:25:02,320
Whereas a distribution like anagros or any a lot of other ones i'm just picking on anagros because that's what we've been messing around with

1864
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,560
between the two

1865
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:10,240
They release when they feel like they have an iso that has enough new fixes or updates to release it

1866
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,600
Otherwise, it's just kind of developed all the time. Yeah, just update it

1867
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:18,800
They just release iteratively when they feel like it and arch just sort of updates iteratively when they feel like it

1868
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:24,560
And sometimes I think you get in a sweet spot where that's a good combination and things are working pretty great

1869
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:29,680
And sometimes that sync slips a little bit and the ltss are a better combination and right now I think

1870
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:33,840
the arbitrary release dates and uh, just slamming out the features

1871
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:36,320
Yeah

1872
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:42,000
I mean really even even the even like a we made a big deal about the zfs support and it's it's there

1873
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:46,080
But you gotta install all if you install the desktop version, you gotta install all of the userland packages

1874
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:50,560
There's no there's no user exposed way to actually set it up. You're going down the terminal

1875
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:55,200
You're going down the terminal and using zpool and zcreate and whatever else whatever else at that point

1876
01:25:55,680 --> 01:26:00,640
You know the dkms stuff before it wasn't that much extra. Yeah, exactly like the dkms wasn't that hard?

1877
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,400
It's like the least amount of work exactly

1878
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:06,480
That's my point and like you're going to have to go buy alan jude's book to be able to set up a zfs

1879
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:12,800
On your pointer box. I linked that to so many people. Yeah zfsbook.com. Uh, he just released a new edition go check it out

1880
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,560
like seriously

1881
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:20,080
Uh, and and and again, I am not trying to compare to other distros, but other distros and when you're installing

1882
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:25,040
Zfs is just in the drop down. I'm not using I don't i'm not using it to set up zfs

1883
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,760
But it's just like how much extra work if you have all the userland utilities available?

1884
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,680
You have the kernel module available

1885
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:35,280
How much extra work is it to expose that as an option in your installer?

1886
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,680
How much if all of the underlying linux software is there how much work can that be?

1887
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:43,440
and if you're like taking this big step by offering it like you think you'd want to like

1888
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:49,360
Package that up as a whole big cohesive thing. And of course, they have the excellent excuse of well, we don't uh, think it's uh,

1889
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,440
targeted for uh, end users

1890
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,080
so uh, it wasn't really a

1891
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,600
Priority to make it available in the gooey

1892
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:03,520
Which is a very solid argument except for the very reason that ubuntu has any relevance is because they made a great desktop

1893
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:08,560
Distribution to begin with and people adopted on this is their thing. That's how ubuntu got traction

1894
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:12,320
They didn't start out as the server as the vps cloud distribution

1895
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,360
They started out as a as linux for human beings. Yep

1896
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,600
Where's that gone?

1897
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,280
Where is that?

1898
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,280
on the phone

1899
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,000
Hey, oh

1900
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,480
All right. Hello everybody end of rant. I'm just um, I uh, I just uh

1901
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:32,720
I just I don't know. I guess I probably I probably should get off my soapbox because in reality

1902
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,520
I think it's wasted effort. It's not gonna get me anywhere

1903
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:40,000
Uh, and that's okay because I think over time things will get comments. Yeah

1904
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,200
Well, that's for that. I think noah's gonna get more comments about his lack of sleep

1905
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,160
Then I will get comments about my ubuntu hate so I think we're doing okay

1906
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:50,420

1914
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,400
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of linux unplugged

1915
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:37,520
I'm gonna go get some sleep and see you right back here next week

1916
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,800
So

1917
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:09,920
Yeah, we really should say thanks to chase for running the board at linux fest rocking that board

1918
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,300
Yeah, thanks to the crew that came out to help us with everything

1919
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,880
Thank you. Everybody including you wes. It was a it was a great linux fest

1920
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:24,640
It really was amazing and uh, it was a big big big production. All right, jb titles.com. Now we go name this beast

1921
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,960
or jb titles

1922
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:28,240
Oh

1923
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:31,200
Good amount of titles over here. I'm gonna so I actually I have one

1924
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,800
I have one more show which is a lot of work, which is on filter before I can sleep

1925
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:40,080
So my my marathon doesn't technically end until wednesday night, but then I think we have a pre-recorded tech stamp

1926
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:44,240
That would be sweet. I think he might still be out of town. And so then i'm just gonna sleep thursday

1927
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:50,000
Sleep kind of wake up sometime on saturday. No, no, I wish I wish

1928
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:56,800
Uh, but yeah, all right, jb titles.com. Let's go boat. Thank you. Thanks suggest.com. That's way more fun

1929
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:13,760
