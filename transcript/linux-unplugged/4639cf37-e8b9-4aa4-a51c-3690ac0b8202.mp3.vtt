WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
I have, I have, I have a, I have to come clean.

00:04.520 --> 00:08.520
I know what this is.

00:08.520 --> 00:13.480
So I went through Steam Left and that's that site that you plug in your Steam account and

00:13.480 --> 00:18.360
it tells you how many hours of your life it would take to complete your gameplay.

00:18.360 --> 00:23.960
And this is for the games in my library that are uncompleted, 3,405 continuous hours or

00:23.960 --> 00:29.280
in other words I would have to play for 141 days, 21 hours and 15 minutes straight to

00:29.280 --> 00:32.520
complete my Steam library at this point.

00:32.520 --> 00:39.600
I could sail to Hawaii from LA 20 times, every time you load it gives you a different stat

00:39.600 --> 00:40.600
too.

00:40.600 --> 00:45.440
I could watch the entire Star Trek the original series 51 times, which that's probably pretty

00:45.440 --> 00:46.920
close to what I would actually do.

00:46.920 --> 00:53.920
I could work 85 full weeks, watch every Simpsons episode 15 times.

00:53.920 --> 00:59.120
I could film the Blair Witch Project 17 times, well I think that's exactly what I would do.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.240
There you go.

01:00.240 --> 01:01.240
That's my shame right there.

01:01.240 --> 01:05.460
Steam Left, you can go to steamleft.com and then plug your Steam profile in there and

01:05.460 --> 01:08.400
see how many hours it would take you to complete.

01:08.400 --> 01:12.600
That's a sign that I've been buying too many Steam games for Linux.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.880
And mine's under 500.

01:14.880 --> 01:18.160
I could drive across Russia 44 times.

01:18.160 --> 01:22.360
4,219 continuous hours for me.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.040
141 for me.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.040
Wow.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.840
572 hours for Keller, okay.

01:28.840 --> 01:33.560
Yeah, so Poppy, I got you beat a little bit.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.560
Just a bit.

01:34.560 --> 01:35.560
Do you guys see the mix?

01:35.560 --> 01:39.360
So what proportion of your game are Linux games and what proportion are Windows games?

01:39.360 --> 01:40.360
Oh, good question.

01:40.360 --> 01:44.120
You know, because I've been a Steam user for a long time, but I have quite a bit of Steam,

01:44.120 --> 01:49.120
I mean it's, should I, let's see, I could open it up, let's find out.

01:49.120 --> 01:54.280
Quite a bit of my games are Linux games because once they came out for Linux I just kind of

01:54.280 --> 01:56.280
only started buying.

01:56.280 --> 02:03.600
So I've got in total 206 games and of those, 104 are Linux.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.600
Damn.

02:04.600 --> 02:08.680
All right, let's see, I'm pulling up Steam right now, standby.

02:08.680 --> 02:11.880
Updating user configuration, says Steam, whatever the...

02:11.880 --> 02:17.080
It's in your home directory, isn't that what it's doing?

02:17.080 --> 02:18.080
Yeah.

02:18.080 --> 02:24.160
Okay, so I have 238 games of 169 of which are Linux.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.400
That's a good proportion.

02:25.400 --> 02:31.120
That's good.

02:31.120 --> 02:35.600
Welcome to Linux Unplugs, your weekly Linux talk show that's writing down the information

02:35.600 --> 02:37.720
of things superhighway.

02:37.720 --> 02:38.720
My name is Chris.

02:38.720 --> 02:39.920
And my name is Matt.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.360
Hey, Matt, you know it's all about the Internet of Things today.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.360
Oh, it is.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.120
Do you have all your things interneted at your place, Matt?

02:46.120 --> 02:49.800
I actually do have a hub, although I only have two sensors active.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.200
Oh, you got more Internet of Things than I do, although I do have Hughes lights and I

02:53.200 --> 02:55.480
think those are considered Internet of Things, yeah.

02:55.480 --> 02:56.480
They are, they are.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.920
I know, I need to up my game, I need to get like a nest, I need to get everything connected,

02:59.920 --> 03:03.480
get it reporting and talking to dashboards, I need more dashboards.

03:03.480 --> 03:04.480
Smart things, dude.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.440
It's got open source stuff going on there.

03:06.440 --> 03:07.840
Hmm, hmm, interesting.

03:07.840 --> 03:11.800
Well, coming up on today's episode of Linux Unplugged, Ubuntu is prepped to take over

03:11.800 --> 03:16.160
the Internet of Things devices and we're gonna see if it's actually a real initiative or

03:16.160 --> 03:19.160
something they just slapped together once they saw CoreOS.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.160
We'll talk about that.

03:20.160 --> 03:27.720
But again, later on in the show, there's been a big hoo-roo-ha-ha between Google and Microsoft

03:27.720 --> 03:32.360
about the disclosure of patches in Windows and Google just recently released some information

03:32.360 --> 03:35.880
about a security flaw in Windows just a couple of days before Patch Tuesday and Microsoft

03:35.880 --> 03:39.800
got all upset about it and it created this big debate again online.

03:39.800 --> 03:44.720
Well, Linus Torvalds was speaking at a keynote and he was asked about public disclosures

03:44.720 --> 03:45.720
of bugs.

03:45.720 --> 03:49.240
He stated his stance on it, it's a little controversial and we'll play a clip of that

03:49.240 --> 03:50.560
later on in the show.

03:50.560 --> 03:54.880
And then also, somebody tried to pin Linus down and get him to say, hey, how come the

03:54.880 --> 03:58.560
documentation isn't very good and what are you gonna do about improving the documentation

03:58.560 --> 04:00.600
of a Linux kernel?

04:00.600 --> 04:04.000
And you probably, you won't believe Linus' response.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.240
I have not seen this covered anywhere else and when I heard it, I'm like, how is this

04:07.240 --> 04:08.240
not news?

04:08.240 --> 04:09.400
So we'll play a clip of that, too.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.280
So I think it should be a good show today, Matt.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.280
Nice.

04:12.280 --> 04:13.280
Yeah.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.680
And we got some great feedback, too, from the audience, so I just picked out a few good

04:15.680 --> 04:16.680
ones.

04:16.680 --> 04:19.720
Some emails we're gonna try to get to, but just a couple this week, so before we get

04:19.720 --> 04:21.960
into all of that, let's bring in the Mamba Room.

04:21.960 --> 04:23.960
Time appropriate greetings, Mamba Room.

04:23.960 --> 04:24.960
Hello.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.960
Hello.

04:25.960 --> 04:26.960
Hello.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.860
Boy, aren't you just a handsome bunch.

04:28.860 --> 04:29.860
Look at you guys.

04:29.860 --> 04:31.200
Looking really good today.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.120
You know what it might be is I noticed this Ubuntu Mate desktop seems to have really great

04:35.120 --> 04:36.520
fonts out of the box.

04:36.520 --> 04:37.520
Maybe that's what it is.

04:37.520 --> 04:38.800
Everybody's looking real good.

04:38.800 --> 04:45.000
So Earl writes in, really to Matt, Earl writes in and he says, Matt, I listened to your enthusiasm

04:45.000 --> 04:47.320
for the Ubuntu Mate a few times now.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.560
I'd like to try it.

04:48.560 --> 04:53.240
I started using Linux with Ubuntu 14.10 and I've been a user ever since.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.920
I went to Linux Mint when Ubuntu had to abandon GNOME 2.

04:55.920 --> 05:01.200
My problem is I generally use Wi-Fi from the public library when I can't use torrents.

05:01.200 --> 05:05.520
I tried HTTP sites listed in Europe, but I keep getting a timeout after an hour or so

05:05.520 --> 05:06.920
when downloading Ubuntu Mate.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.480
Do you know if there's an HTTP site in the US?

05:09.480 --> 05:12.680
I maintain several computers running Mint Mate for friends and the only thing I don't

05:12.680 --> 05:15.920
like about having it is having to reinstall after every upgrade.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.960
And no, Chris, I'm not going to GNOME 3.

05:18.960 --> 05:22.440
I'm 70 years old and I don't need that frustration.

05:22.440 --> 05:26.720
GNOME 3 should be put out to pasture with a bullet between its eyes, Earl.

05:26.720 --> 05:27.720
And I know Wimpy's here too.

05:27.720 --> 05:31.800
Wimpy, do you have any advice if he's having problems downloading Mate edition in Europe?

05:31.800 --> 05:37.920
Well, no, unfortunately all of the mirrors are in Europe.

05:37.920 --> 05:43.400
The only thing I could suggest is grabbing the torrents, but he seems to imply that he

05:43.400 --> 05:45.480
hasn't got access to the torrents.

05:45.480 --> 05:48.560
So if you're going to do an HTTP download, it's coming from a European server.

05:48.560 --> 05:53.760
It's kind of just the way it is right now.

05:53.760 --> 06:00.040
The Ubuntu Mate community have been very generous in donating to host a new community site and

06:00.040 --> 06:02.120
there's some surplus funds.

06:02.120 --> 06:07.760
So what I'll do is I'll put up a mirror in North America and I'll send you the details

06:07.760 --> 06:12.360
and maybe you can put me in touch with this guy and we'll put an American mirror up.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.360
How's that?

06:13.360 --> 06:14.360
Oh, wow.

06:14.360 --> 06:15.360
How about that, Earl?

06:15.360 --> 06:16.360
That's awesome.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.360
There's a custom solution right there for you.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.360
Very good.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.360
All right.

06:19.360 --> 06:24.200
Well, and you know, I was going to say, otherwise my go-to would be definitely go with torrents.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.280
It's a shame that the public libraries block that, but I guess I understand why they do

06:27.280 --> 06:28.280
it.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.280
It's got to be for piracy.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.280
I would imagine so.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.080
It's kind of a blanket solution, but yeah.

06:32.080 --> 06:35.280
Yeah, block all of the things just in case it gets used for something bad.

06:35.280 --> 06:39.560
Armani writes in and he wanted to comment on the Mac Exodus topic we've been touching

06:39.560 --> 06:40.560
on.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.780
Hey guys, I came to contribute to all the Mac Exodus talk when I realized something

06:42.780 --> 06:43.780
kind of funny.

06:43.780 --> 06:47.720
All of my experience with Linux has been on Apple hardware.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.560
Well except for my Nexus 5, which I have Ubuntu on.

06:50.560 --> 06:54.000
Back in high school, before I even had a Mac, I was running Linux on my iPod.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.040
This made me pretty popular among the nerd crowd and I ended up loading up with a bunch

06:57.040 --> 06:59.360
of my friends iPods as well.

06:59.360 --> 07:03.600
Needless to say, the rest of the Apple plebs on campus were pretty jealous when not only

07:03.600 --> 07:07.160
did I have video before the iPod video was out, but I also got to play Doom.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.080
Anyway, now I have a Macbook Pro running Ubuntu 14.10.

07:10.080 --> 07:13.880
I made the switch to 12.04 a couple of years back and that's when I discovered Jupiter

07:13.880 --> 07:14.880
Broadcasting.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.000
After a couple of months, it became my daily driver.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.880
Then somewhere around 13.10, I switched to Ubuntu Gnome and fell in love.

07:20.880 --> 07:22.840
Now I'm hooked on Linux and an avid listener of your shows.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.720
One thing is for sure though, I'll probably never buy anything from Apple again.

07:26.720 --> 07:30.400
Maybe I'll go for the new Dell XPS 13.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.520
So yeah, he sent a picture along to me.

07:31.520 --> 07:32.520
It looks nice.

07:32.520 --> 07:36.360
It's an older Macbook, so maybe that gives him a little less problems and he's got Gnome

07:36.360 --> 07:38.640
on there.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.640
Have you seen this Dell XPS 13?

07:40.640 --> 07:41.640
Have you seen this?

07:41.640 --> 07:43.160
I have not actually seen it.

07:43.160 --> 07:48.800
I've been hearing a lot about it and because of my completely ridiculous bigotry toward

07:48.800 --> 07:54.180
Dell, I purposely haven't looked, but it does sound like that they are onto something and

07:54.180 --> 07:57.720
it would definitely signal to others that they need to catch up to that perhaps.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.800
I'm doing Popeye a favor.

07:59.800 --> 08:05.800
See I know that Popeye is eventually, he's like he's riding this ThinkPad, this old busted

08:05.800 --> 08:09.360
ThinkPad of his for a really long time and he's trying to ride that and eventually he's

08:09.360 --> 08:14.600
going to have to pull the trigger and get something and so I want to be there for him.

08:14.600 --> 08:19.520
So I went ahead and I picked up a XPS 13 Ultrabook and I'm going to tell you a little bit about

08:19.520 --> 08:24.580
it here in just a second why I got it, all of the horrible experiences I've had with

08:24.580 --> 08:29.080
Dell which confirm all of the problems that I have with Dell and why I think this might

08:29.080 --> 08:30.120
make a great machine.

08:30.120 --> 08:35.980
So I will comment on this in just a second and kind of tell you where my head's at with

08:35.980 --> 08:40.040
grabbing this Dell laptop, but first why don't I tell you about Linux Academy.

08:40.040 --> 08:43.520
Let's start right there because Linux Academy is pretty great and I think it's something

08:43.520 --> 08:44.520
that's worth checking out.

08:44.520 --> 08:47.240
If you've heard some of these technologies out there that sure seem pretty fancy, you

08:47.240 --> 08:52.000
know things like Puppet, NGINX, OpenStack, Virtualization, Docker, all that kind of stuff.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.560
You know the things that are fundamental to being successful in this space now?

08:55.560 --> 08:59.120
Well Linux Academy has incredible courseware on all of it.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.400
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

09:01.400 --> 09:05.200
That's a special Linux unplugged discount, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.760
You're going to get the 33% discount.

09:06.760 --> 09:11.160
They have step-by-step video courses for all of their courseware, downloadable comprehensive

09:11.160 --> 09:15.720
study guides, live streams where you can ask the educators questions directly.

09:15.720 --> 09:19.960
Stuff comes with its own servers so if you have a course on AWS or maybe you're learning

09:19.960 --> 09:23.800
something with NGINX, you know whatever something's in that range, you actually get to play with

09:23.800 --> 09:27.560
the technology, set up the system, look at the config file, they give you a public address

09:27.560 --> 09:29.180
and you get to bang on it like a real box.

09:29.180 --> 09:33.120
That way you've had true legitimate experience with it and as you go, each section is broken

09:33.120 --> 09:36.600
out, tells you how long you've got to complete, it gives you reminders if you need to and

09:36.600 --> 09:39.440
if you're tight on time, they have custom learning plans.

09:39.440 --> 09:43.160
You go in there and just set your availability and it automatically generates a custom plan

09:43.160 --> 09:45.800
just for you with reminders and all that kind of good stuff.

09:45.800 --> 09:50.520
You just got to note too that they've been refreshing the NGINX and Docker courses specifically

09:50.520 --> 09:51.520
to make sure they stay current.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.840
This is one of the other things that's really great about Linux Academy is they're keeping

09:54.840 --> 09:59.520
all of that stuff fresh, always making sure that it's got the most relevant, latest information

09:59.520 --> 10:02.840
so that way when you go take that courseware, it's totally up to date.

10:02.840 --> 10:05.780
The other thing that's super slick about it is they have seven plus Linux distributions

10:05.780 --> 10:09.440
you can choose from, whichever distribution you pick, then the courseware automatically

10:09.440 --> 10:13.560
adjusts to that distribution including like the virtual machine and all of that.

10:13.560 --> 10:17.560
So you know you say CentOS, well the courseware is all CentOS, the virtual machine image is

10:17.560 --> 10:22.600
CentOS, all of the environment, all the commands and all of the courseware, everything's CentOS.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.620
Next time you go through, you choose an Ubuntu rig, same thing.

10:25.620 --> 10:26.620
Super slick.

10:26.620 --> 10:29.480
The reason is because these are people that are crazy passionate about Linux and open

10:29.480 --> 10:30.480
source, right?

10:30.480 --> 10:32.160
These are people that really care about this.

10:32.160 --> 10:36.000
It's not a generic education facility where they've got everything from fixing your sync

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
to working in Adobe After Effects.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.640
That's not what Linux Academy does.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.360
They're hyper focused on this stuff.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.520
It's a bunch of Linux enthusiasts, educators, and developers that came together to create

10:44.520 --> 10:45.820
Linux Academy.

10:45.820 --> 10:50.120
And you can get in on the action over at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, special discount just for

10:50.120 --> 10:52.760
the show, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

10:52.760 --> 10:56.760
Go check out Linux Academy and see all of the cool courseware they have available, linuxacademy.com

10:56.760 --> 10:57.760
slash unplugged.

10:57.760 --> 11:01.560
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged show.

11:01.560 --> 11:06.920
Okay, so yeah, you know, I was really not so sure.

11:06.920 --> 11:11.900
I watched CES, I watched all the hardware that came out of CES, and I think out of everything

11:11.900 --> 11:16.560
that was shown, I was the most impressed by the XPS 13 Ultrabook by Dell, which surprised

11:16.560 --> 11:19.600
me because I'm not generally a Dell fan.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.520
And I've been kind of stuck in this like, what am I going to do?

11:21.520 --> 11:24.240
I need to move my hardware situation around for a little while.

11:24.240 --> 11:28.600
And the thing that kind of pushed me over the edge is that you can buy from Dell directly

11:28.600 --> 11:31.440
with Bitcoin, which really surprised me.

11:31.440 --> 11:36.040
Like the whole thing from end to end, like all the accessories, the laptop itself, it's

11:36.040 --> 11:39.640
one click Bitcoin, it's tied in with Coinbase and you're done.

11:39.640 --> 11:42.960
That is super, a super, super neat system.

11:42.960 --> 11:47.840
And so that was sort of like the final deciding factor for me to go pull the trigger on the

11:47.840 --> 11:48.840
XPS 13.

11:48.840 --> 11:49.840
So here's what I got.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.040
Is it the new edge to edge screen watch?

11:53.040 --> 11:54.040
Yes.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.040
Yep.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.040
With the 3200 by 1800 display.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.040
Yeah.

11:57.040 --> 12:01.160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, did you buy the windows

12:01.160 --> 12:02.160
one?

12:02.160 --> 12:03.160
I did.

12:03.160 --> 12:04.160
I did.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.160
Yes.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.160
And here's why.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.160
Well, here's why.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.160
I'm not, I'm not a big Dell fan.

12:08.160 --> 12:12.240
And I have, I really have very little faith that getting their next Sputnik version versus

12:12.240 --> 12:14.100
this is going to make a huge difference.

12:14.100 --> 12:18.820
But I figure either way, if they ship that eventually, it'll probably benefit this one.

12:18.820 --> 12:20.040
And essentially I need something now.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.920
It's going to make a big difference to your freedom, my friend.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.000
Well, I don't mind having the windows license.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.680
I don't have any license copies of windows right now.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.440
And that about twice a year becomes about a real pain in my ass where I consider buying

12:31.440 --> 12:33.640
windows and then I never can actually make myself do it.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.800
So now I'm like, well now I have the license.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.800
So that's good for some stuff.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.120
I wanted to kind of, the reason why I wanted to go buy it now is I wanted to get out ahead

12:41.120 --> 12:44.400
of it just basically for the purposes of having it for a little while.

12:44.400 --> 12:48.000
So by the time they do ship something, I'll have a really sound opinion on the hardware

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
itself.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.880
So I can talk about it to the audience from a pretty educated standpoint, because if this

12:51.880 --> 12:56.640
is a nice laptop, as nice as I think it's going to be, this could be the Linux Mac book

12:56.640 --> 12:59.000
potentially, I think.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.400
And so I wanted to grab it now and I wanted to have an educated opinion about it.

13:02.400 --> 13:06.160
So that way when the Linux version does ship, I can talk to the audience from a pretty educated

13:06.160 --> 13:07.160
standpoint on it.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.480
So it'll be maybe a one to one, but hopefully it'll be really close.

13:09.480 --> 13:12.600
So that's another reason why I've kind of pulled the trigger early on it.

13:12.600 --> 13:16.400
So what I got with it was eight gigabytes of RAM, a 512 gigabyte SSD.

13:16.400 --> 13:21.520
It's got the i7 550 processor, 13 inch display, but because it's edge to edge, it actually

13:21.520 --> 13:25.600
fits like in an 11 point something housing, which is kind of interesting.

13:25.600 --> 13:29.080
And good news, it comes with McAfee LiveSafe image trial version.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.080
Oh, that's great.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.080
Yeah.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.080
Yeah.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.080
So I can get that installed.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.080
I'm pretty happy about that.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.080
Garbage.

13:35.080 --> 13:39.240
So this ships with the fifth gen new Broadwell chip.

13:39.240 --> 13:42.440
And I was looking at a review and I don't, you know, I take it for what it is because

13:42.440 --> 13:43.440
it comes from Forbes.

13:43.440 --> 13:49.000
No, no, if it's Forbes, but they were saying that they were seeing a 20 percent GPU speed

13:49.000 --> 13:53.680
improvement over the previous Iris graphics.

13:53.680 --> 13:56.500
So 20 percent is, I mean, that was already getting pretty close.

13:56.500 --> 14:00.640
There was some serious casual gaming you could serious casual gaming you could do.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.860
So that's pretty healthy.

14:01.860 --> 14:02.860
That's pretty healthy.

14:02.860 --> 14:03.860
I'll get the machine.

14:03.860 --> 14:06.080
I will probably not even boot it into Windows.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.080
Do you need to?

14:07.080 --> 14:11.360
Do you need to boot it into Windows or can you just immediately format it?

14:11.360 --> 14:12.360
I have not bought a laptop with Windows.

14:12.360 --> 14:18.440
I would probably, yeah, I'm trying to remember now because it's been a bit, I don't think

14:18.440 --> 14:19.920
it, no, I don't think it matters.

14:19.920 --> 14:20.920
If you live.

14:20.920 --> 14:21.920
Yeah.

14:21.920 --> 14:22.920
If you live disk it.

14:22.920 --> 14:23.920
Actually, I don't know.

14:23.920 --> 14:24.920
Because, yeah, it's been a while.

14:24.920 --> 14:25.920
I'm not sure.

14:25.920 --> 14:26.920
I suppose.

14:26.920 --> 14:30.120
I don't know.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.120
I'm hoping this is going to be the, I don't know.

14:33.120 --> 14:36.040
I'm hoping this is going to be like sort of like the laptop that a lot of people want

14:36.040 --> 14:37.040
to get to run Linux.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.040
We'll see.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.160
I'll give you my review.

14:39.160 --> 14:42.520
My gut feeling is I would probably boot into Windows first.

14:42.520 --> 14:46.080
If you're going to keep it and you're not going to do one of these, try and get a Windows

14:46.080 --> 14:47.080
refund.

14:47.080 --> 14:51.600
If you're going to keep the Windows license, then I would boot into it at least and clone

14:51.600 --> 14:55.600
Ziller it onto a USB so you've got a copy of it.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.600
Yeah.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.600
But also.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.600
Makes me feel dirty.

14:58.600 --> 15:02.860
Well, yeah, but I would also check the Dell website for any BIOS updates and do those

15:02.860 --> 15:03.860
while you're in Windows.

15:03.860 --> 15:04.860
Oh, sure.

15:04.860 --> 15:05.860
Just in case.

15:05.860 --> 15:06.860
Right.

15:06.860 --> 15:07.860
Right.

15:07.860 --> 15:08.860
Yeah.

15:08.860 --> 15:09.860
That's a good point, actually.

15:09.860 --> 15:10.860
Because they got the utilities for all that garbage.

15:10.860 --> 15:13.360
This is stuff you got to consider when you buy a Windows machine to run Linux.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.360
Yeah.

15:14.360 --> 15:15.360
Yeah.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.360
It really is.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.400
Some of the reviews are saying that 15-hour battery life is a bit of an exaggeration.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.880
It's more like seven hours of battery life if you get the hybrid screen.

15:21.880 --> 15:22.880
Yeah.

15:22.880 --> 15:23.880
What a shock.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.000
It's probably 15 hours when you like turn the brightness down to nothing.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
You don't touch any part of it.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Turn off the Wi-Fi.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Turn off the Bluetooth.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Turn off everything.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, any of that.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Run it at 1080p.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
You know.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
All that kind of stuff.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Right.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Yeah.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Exactly.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
So, anyways, I'll give my updates soon and we'll see how it goes.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
I don't know.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.640
I mean, so at the end of the day, you really kind of come out winning in that you bought

15:46.640 --> 15:47.640
it with Bitcoin.

15:47.640 --> 15:48.640
That's kind of cool.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.640
Yeah.

15:49.640 --> 15:50.640
Yeah.

15:50.640 --> 15:51.640
I mean, economically cool.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.640
Not only that, but I bought it like back on the 7th or the 8th, which Bitcoin was still

15:54.640 --> 15:56.840
about worth almost $300 when I did it.

15:56.840 --> 15:57.840
Oh, well, yeah.

15:57.840 --> 15:58.840
Then there you go.

15:58.840 --> 15:59.840
So, yeah.

15:59.840 --> 16:00.840
You got a little hedge to your edge there.

16:00.840 --> 16:01.840
Yeah.

16:01.840 --> 16:05.080
But I feel like maybe this is a bad time to use Bitcoin because usually what happens when

16:05.080 --> 16:07.960
the price goes down like this is a bunch of people start buying and then it starts steadily

16:07.960 --> 16:09.520
going up for a while.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.360
So I might come out on the bad end of that possibility.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.360
Yeah.

16:13.360 --> 16:14.360
It is a possibility.

16:14.360 --> 16:17.080
Matt, I'm going to try giving a guest a call.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.080
Let's see if...

16:18.080 --> 16:19.080
All right.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.080
Hey, Christian.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.080
Can you hear us?

16:21.080 --> 16:22.080
Yeah, I can hear you.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.080
Can you hear me?

16:23.080 --> 16:24.080
Yeah.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.080
We hear you great.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.080
Thanks for coming on the show.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.080
So, Matt, this is Christian.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.080
He's working on Gnome Builder.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.080
Awesome.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.080
And you're probably familiar.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.080
We've talked about the Indiegogo project that's going on.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.080
I'm sure you're all plugged.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.080
Thanks.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.080
Thanks for having me.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.080
Oh, no, no problem.

16:35.080 --> 16:38.200
So congratulations, by the way, on the success of the Gnome Builder project.

16:38.200 --> 16:42.480
That seems like that Indiegogo has probably gone better than you expected, I would imagine.

16:42.480 --> 16:43.480
Yeah.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.240
I mean, significantly better than I expected.

16:46.240 --> 16:53.320
I tried to set some pretty ambitious goals, but at a very, very reasonable price point.

16:53.320 --> 16:58.920
And I'm hoping that people saw that and really came out to help.

16:58.920 --> 17:03.600
Well, what struck me about it is you seem like maybe you're a crazy person because you

17:03.600 --> 17:06.440
quit your full-time job to do this.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.440
Why take that risk?

17:07.440 --> 17:10.040
And you did that even before you launched the fundraiser.

17:10.040 --> 17:16.200
Yeah, you know, I've been a part of the free software community for a long time.

17:16.200 --> 17:23.440
And at some point, I decided that fixing the tools that we're all using is far more important

17:23.440 --> 17:26.760
than individual career growth to me.

17:26.760 --> 17:28.920
So I had a pretty kickass job, too.

17:28.920 --> 17:32.960
I was working at MongoDB, working on their C driver, and there's a great group of people

17:32.960 --> 17:33.960
there.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.460
They really care about free software.

17:35.460 --> 17:38.200
There's a reason why the products say GPL-licensed.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.280
But ultimately, this was the most important thing I could be doing.

17:41.280 --> 17:44.120
So I really had to make the switch.

17:44.120 --> 17:47.740
That's very impressive and very admirable.

17:47.740 --> 17:53.320
So when you launched the fundraiser, has the scope of what Gnome Builder is going to include

17:53.320 --> 17:56.960
expanded quite a bit since the funding kicked in?

17:56.960 --> 18:02.960
Well, it really determines how much and for how long people are willing to support me.

18:02.960 --> 18:06.600
Yes, I want all of these features in there.

18:06.600 --> 18:11.720
I knew that for me to be able to be successful with this, the most important thing I can

18:11.720 --> 18:14.720
do is build Builder with Builder.

18:14.720 --> 18:21.960
So that meant the first priority is C. Builder has to be written in C for technical reasons.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.020
We want to reuse as much of the software as we can.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.020
We want to reuse Glade.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.020
We want to reuse Dev Help.

18:26.020 --> 18:31.320
We want to reuse Git G, GTK Source View, and all these things are best integrated from

18:31.320 --> 18:35.680
C. So that doesn't mean that we don't want to support Vala.

18:35.680 --> 18:39.080
It doesn't mean we don't want to support Python or JavaScript or any of these other languages

18:39.080 --> 18:40.760
in a first-class way.

18:40.760 --> 18:44.120
It just means that our priority had to be this first.

18:44.120 --> 18:47.900
So I knew that a lot of people would really care about those languages, and I really want

18:47.900 --> 18:50.280
to support them.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.640
It can't be the first thing to be done.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.640
We can't put the cart before the horse.

18:53.640 --> 18:54.640
Right.

18:54.640 --> 18:55.640
That makes sense.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.840
I mean, focusing like that means that you get that right, and then once you get that

18:58.840 --> 19:00.880
right, you move on from there.

19:00.880 --> 19:05.760
But this looks like maybe, is it going to become a general IDE for GNOME eventually,

19:05.760 --> 19:08.600
like all kinds of languages in there, all kinds of support?

19:08.600 --> 19:10.760
I mean, that is certainly my goal.

19:10.760 --> 19:15.560
I don't care what language you write GNOME software in, and most of us don't.

19:15.560 --> 19:19.280
So anything I can do to bring more people in and more people contributing, I'm perfectly

19:19.280 --> 19:20.720
happy to do that.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.960
You already have basic support for some of these languages.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.840
You already get like Air Reporting for Vala.

19:24.840 --> 19:29.000
You already get Air Reporting for Go if you have a working Go set up.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.680
So even beyond GNOME, someday that's quite possible.

19:32.680 --> 19:37.760
But I definitely want to stay focused myself on how do we build GNOME software better.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.080
Yeah.

19:39.080 --> 19:43.300
And it seems like this would be a great tool for when somebody asks the question, where

19:43.300 --> 19:44.560
do I get started?

19:44.560 --> 19:50.080
People can say, okay, get started with Builder and go from there, which seems like such a

19:50.080 --> 19:54.280
simple thing to be able to say, but we have lacked that one coherent answer for so long

19:54.280 --> 19:56.840
that I've talked to a lot of developers who've been put off by that.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.000
It just seems like there's so many choices.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.080
And this represents, well, if you're going to go GNOME, if you're going to do GTK, start

20:03.080 --> 20:04.080
here.

20:04.080 --> 20:07.040
Now, that itself is a huge goal.

20:07.040 --> 20:12.040
And so I'm pretty impressed that you've raised $42,000, but what happens six, seven, eight

20:12.040 --> 20:16.880
months from now, this is your full-time job, that funding sort of begins to wane.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.340
How do you make it ongoing?

20:19.340 --> 20:20.340
What's the trick there?

20:20.340 --> 20:21.340
Yeah.

20:21.340 --> 20:26.160
I mean, I think a really important thing is to, number one, build a really strong community.

20:26.160 --> 20:29.560
So we can all share the burden.

20:29.560 --> 20:34.360
But on the point that you mentioned there of having a single answer to tell people,

20:34.360 --> 20:35.720
that is really, really important.

20:35.720 --> 20:39.880
For my time spending helping people get started in free software, almost always the first

20:39.880 --> 20:42.160
question is, how do I get started?

20:42.160 --> 20:45.180
And it's a really monumental thing to get over.

20:45.180 --> 20:48.800
And you look at something like Android or whatever, they have an IDE that you install

20:48.800 --> 20:52.980
and there's other choices, but there's a blessed sort of way.

20:52.980 --> 20:55.200
And you enable developer mode on your phone.

20:55.200 --> 20:59.760
I'd really like to see that in terms of GNOME, where you're just able to enable developer

20:59.760 --> 21:03.440
mode in the control settings and all of a sudden you have a complete development environment

21:03.440 --> 21:08.400
and everything else is done underneath the hood and you don't have to worry about it.

21:08.400 --> 21:13.280
So would a goal of yours be maybe to have Builder almost kind of considered a part of

21:13.280 --> 21:18.200
a GNOME desktop, maybe like in developer mode where it's almost under the branch of GNOME?

21:18.200 --> 21:19.200
Absolutely.

21:19.200 --> 21:23.080
I mean, this is, I think, I contributed.

21:23.080 --> 21:26.640
I think it's just a great project initiative and we'll have a link in the show notes.

21:26.640 --> 21:31.520
So Christian, I guess you're already working now, so does anything change for you now this

21:31.520 --> 21:33.600
is successful or are you just plowing on forward?

21:33.600 --> 21:39.480
Well, you know, the last couple of weeks I've been so busy with fundraising and communicating

21:39.480 --> 21:40.560
with people.

21:40.560 --> 21:44.840
And so the amount of code I've gotten written in January is significantly less than all

21:44.840 --> 21:46.200
of the other months.

21:46.200 --> 21:50.360
So I'm really looking forward to just, you know, putting the blinders on and writing

21:50.360 --> 21:51.360
code again.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.360
Yeah, absolutely.

21:52.360 --> 21:53.360
I bet.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.360
Well, we'll have a link to the Indiegogo.

21:54.360 --> 21:55.360
I recommend anybody who wants to go back.

21:55.360 --> 22:00.640
It's six days left and I think this is a great initiative and you're solving a huge problem

22:00.640 --> 22:02.360
just from the development people that I've talked to.

22:02.360 --> 22:05.240
So keep up the great work and thanks for coming on the show.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.240
It's been my pleasure.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.240
Thanks for having me.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.240
Yeah.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.240
Have a great rest of your day.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.240
Awesome.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.240
Yeah.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.240
Well, so check it out, everybody.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.240
We'll have a link in the show notes.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.240
That's GNOME Builder.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.360
I think it's a great initiative.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.800
Oh, it sounds like it.

22:18.800 --> 22:19.800
Okay guys.

22:19.800 --> 22:24.000
So why don't we take a quick moment right here and talk about something pretty neat.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.720
DigitalOcean has just recently rolled out free BSD support.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.800
DigitalOcean is a sponsor of the Linux Unplugged show.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.480
And I want you to head over there and try it out.

22:31.480 --> 22:36.840
There's a lot of great things you can do including CoreOS, Ubuntu, Fedora, now free BSD and we've

22:36.840 --> 22:41.560
got a brand new promo code for the year, which is kind of like, it makes me feel all official.

22:41.560 --> 22:42.560
It's D.O.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.560
Unplugged.

22:43.560 --> 22:44.560
D.O.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.560
Unplugged.

22:45.560 --> 22:46.560
That's so cool.

22:46.560 --> 22:47.560
Yeah.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.280
One word, lowercase, real easy and it's going to give you a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.280
What?

22:50.280 --> 22:51.280
Digital what?

22:51.280 --> 22:52.280
Yeah.

22:52.280 --> 22:53.280
DigitalOcean.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.080
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

22:55.080 --> 22:57.080
easy way to spin up a cloud server.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.920
You can get started in less than 55 seconds.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.200
Some pricing plans start only $5 a month.

23:01.200 --> 23:08.640
For 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte, a terabyte of transfer.

23:08.640 --> 23:13.160
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam

23:13.160 --> 23:14.160
and London.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.520
And yeah, their London one's super fancy.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.600
Go figure.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.720
But that, they're all, just check out their Instagram feed.

23:18.720 --> 23:19.720
They're all fancy.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.680
I'll tell you what's super fancy though.

23:21.680 --> 23:23.360
That interface of DigitalOcean's.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.180
The dashboard they've got, it's like amazing.

23:25.180 --> 23:26.180
It's a bar setter.

23:26.180 --> 23:30.160
It truly is simple and intuitive, but yet extremely powerful and you can replicate the

23:30.160 --> 23:34.320
functionality on a larger scale with DigitalOcean's straightforward API, which is so sweet because

23:34.320 --> 23:38.320
if you're lazy like I am, there's already a whole bunch of people making great apps

23:38.320 --> 23:41.080
out there for you and you can just like snap it right in the puppet.

23:41.080 --> 23:45.120
You can take advantage of like from your Android app, you can be taking snapshots of your droplets.

23:45.120 --> 23:49.320
I mean it's full fledged nuts how awesome it already is for you.

23:49.320 --> 23:54.480
But all that said, like if you're like a go-getter and like you can do things fancy, like use

23:54.480 --> 23:56.160
APIs, then have at it.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.440
Like more power to you.

23:57.440 --> 24:02.920
Go over to DigitalOcean.com, spin up a droplet, create a GitLab, a WordPress, a Ghost, OwnCloud,

24:02.920 --> 24:04.600
BitTorrent Sync, you name it.

24:04.600 --> 24:09.200
So many things, a Minecraft server, a Mumble server, a Jitsi server, the backend server

24:09.200 --> 24:13.000
for your crazy Ruby J-bot script.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.920
Not that I would know any of that kind of stuff.

24:14.920 --> 24:18.740
It's your own server up in the cloud that you get root access to, DigitalOcean.com and

24:18.740 --> 24:23.480
use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, all one word, DOUNPLUGGED, lowercase, you get a $10 credit.

24:23.480 --> 24:28.960
Try out the $5 rig two months for free, the $5 rig two months for free with DOUNPLUGGED.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.720
DigitalOcean.com and a big thanks to DigitalOcean.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.160
You guys freaking rock.

24:33.160 --> 24:36.080
You guys freaking rock and I think it's so cool you just keep on expanding and adding

24:36.080 --> 24:39.040
all this cool stuff even if it is a BSD.

24:39.040 --> 24:42.720
I'm just really glad they're adding free BSD support because it makes my 2015 predictions

24:42.720 --> 24:44.240
a little bit closer to reality.

24:44.240 --> 24:45.960
So I'm all jacked up about that.

24:45.960 --> 24:46.960
I think that's great.

24:46.960 --> 24:51.720
So go over to DigitalOcean.com, DOUNPLUGGED when you check out, and a huge thanks to DigitalOcean

24:51.720 --> 24:53.400
for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.400
You guys are cray cool.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.400
Cray cool.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.000
It's actually, I don't know if you caught this on Google+, I was talking about spinning

24:58.000 --> 24:59.800
up a couple instances of Ghost.

24:59.800 --> 25:00.800
Oh yeah.

25:00.800 --> 25:01.800
It's overdue.

25:01.800 --> 25:07.280
I have some sites that would just benefit more from going that way and it's so minimalist

25:07.280 --> 25:08.280
and it just, boom.

25:08.280 --> 25:09.280
You know what I mean?

25:09.280 --> 25:10.280
All that content.

25:10.280 --> 25:11.280
I totally agree.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.280
I totally agree.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.280
I'm all in on that.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.280
Okay.

25:14.280 --> 25:18.400
So let's talk about the big announcement from Canonical and Mark Shuttleworth today.

25:18.400 --> 25:22.120
Smart things and the internet of things or whatever you want to call it.

25:22.120 --> 25:28.400
Little boards with ARM chips and network connectivity powered by Ubuntu Snappy Core.

25:28.400 --> 25:33.220
That brand new fancy version of Ubuntu that we've heard a lot about recently.

25:33.220 --> 25:38.080
And I thought to get us started, instead of me blabbing on about it, let's join Mark

25:38.080 --> 25:41.000
Shuttleworth in his home.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.960
I love this.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.420
I can't help it because I do video production.

25:45.420 --> 25:50.040
So I notice things that make it not quite like a web home cam video.

25:50.040 --> 25:53.600
Like the fact that he's miked with a wireless mic pack and that this.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.600
Oh yeah.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.080
But anyways, it's still a great video for Mark.

25:56.080 --> 26:00.480
So Mark's going to give us a big introduction to Snappy Ubuntu Core for smart devices.

26:00.480 --> 26:01.480
For ARM and X86.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.580
I actually think this is kind of a smart move.

26:03.580 --> 26:09.520
So let's hear it in his words.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.480
Hello and welcome to my home.

26:11.480 --> 26:16.360
I'm absolutely inspired at the moment by the entrepreneurs and the inventors who are creating

26:16.360 --> 26:19.920
this next generation of extraordinary devices.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.520
And I don't mean PCs and phones.

26:21.520 --> 26:28.400
I mean all of the automation that is quietly transforming our homes and our lives.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.400
This is my house.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.400
I could give you a tour.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.400
It wouldn't be a very long one.

26:31.400 --> 26:32.400
It's a small house.

26:32.400 --> 26:35.960
There are two of us who live here and two dogs.

26:35.960 --> 26:42.600
And yet this morning walking around I counted 16 little boxes that I think are running Linux

26:42.600 --> 26:48.900
and which are doing all sorts of things from home automation to entertainment and security.

26:48.900 --> 26:54.520
And I think over the next year or two that number is going to continue to grow with devices

26:54.520 --> 27:00.120
that make our lives more interesting, safer, more secure, more efficient, more environmentally

27:00.120 --> 27:05.360
friendly and richer in many, many different ways.

27:05.360 --> 27:09.200
So I want to celebrate that extraordinary progress and I also, as somebody who really

27:09.200 --> 27:15.520
believes in the power of open source to unleash creativity, I want to celebrate that the vast

27:15.520 --> 27:19.240
majority of these devices today do run Linux.

27:19.240 --> 27:24.360
That's an enormous success for all of us in the Linux community.

27:24.360 --> 27:26.960
But they don't necessarily run Ubuntu, do they?

27:26.960 --> 27:29.000
And so let's start here.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.400
So Ubuntu's snappy, those of you who remember, is the transactionally ready version of Ubuntu.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.560
So if an update goes back, you just roll back and you're good to go.

27:35.560 --> 27:41.760
It makes a lot of sense to have this on devices, sort of embedded appliance like devices that

27:41.760 --> 27:43.920
need to be super reliable.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.360
And I think that's all well and good.

27:46.360 --> 27:51.640
I'm reading this interview though with Mark Shuttleworth over at GigaOM and something

27:51.640 --> 27:54.640
starts to smell a little off to me.

27:54.640 --> 27:58.960
And I don't mean to be a naysayer, but what I'm reading is, and of course GigaOM takes

27:58.960 --> 28:00.440
it to the extreme, right?

28:00.440 --> 28:03.000
Robots embrace Ubuntu as it invades the internet of things.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.320
Oh God, I love the tech press.

28:04.320 --> 28:05.320
Really?

28:05.320 --> 28:07.120
And they show a picture of a drone, right?

28:07.120 --> 28:08.920
So no subtleties there.

28:08.920 --> 28:09.920
Oh boy.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.920
But here's what it reads to me as.

28:12.920 --> 28:19.240
It reads to me as a company that is extremely good at turning on a dime and then putting

28:19.240 --> 28:22.980
an outward presentation as if it's been part of the grand scheme.

28:22.980 --> 28:24.820
It's all part of a master stroke.

28:24.820 --> 28:25.820
It's all under control.

28:25.820 --> 28:26.820
And here's what I mean.

28:26.820 --> 28:31.480
If you read through this, what you get is, well all that time we spent on mobile is all

28:31.480 --> 28:35.960
totally worth it because we invented this super cool way to do transactional updates

28:35.960 --> 28:38.120
and now we're going to move that over to Snappy Core.

28:38.120 --> 28:44.800
In fact, it sounds like I'm being mean, but in here Mark Shuttleworth is actually quoted

28:44.800 --> 28:48.920
as, here I'll read a quote and then you can see where I'm coming from.

28:48.920 --> 28:52.200
Two years ago we started seeing a lot of what I call alpha developers starting to tinker

28:52.200 --> 28:55.880
with what at the time people called embedded development.

28:55.880 --> 29:00.600
We realized there was a very interesting commonality between the work we were doing for mobile,

29:00.600 --> 29:04.400
specifically this update mechanism work, and things you'd want to do if you were to build

29:04.400 --> 29:07.200
a product around one of these boards.

29:07.200 --> 29:11.480
Canonical had invested in the container capabilities of the Linux kernel as it happened for the

29:11.480 --> 29:13.120
mobile story.

29:13.120 --> 29:17.440
Shuttleworth said, as it needed to fix security issues on the phones such as isolating untrusted

29:17.440 --> 29:19.780
apps from the address book, etc.

29:19.780 --> 29:25.440
He went on to say, Docker is based on those primitives that we built.

29:25.440 --> 29:29.060
So kind of what he's saying is, you know, everybody that's working on Project Atomic

29:29.060 --> 29:32.960
or Core OS and Docker, well we were kind of onto this a long time ago when we started

29:32.960 --> 29:33.960
working on the phones.

29:33.960 --> 29:38.040
In fact, they're even kind of relying on some of the fundamentals that we built.

29:38.040 --> 29:42.080
We haven't had our eye off the game, off the ball this entire time.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.760
We've actually been working on this and moving it over.

29:43.760 --> 29:45.100
Now that's partially very true, right?

29:45.100 --> 29:49.200
That is exactly what's happened, but at the same time I don't necessarily believe it was

29:49.200 --> 29:53.900
this grand master plan so much as an ability to recognize a need in the market and sort

29:53.900 --> 29:59.480
of pivot really quick and then paint it very broadly in these sort of grandiose terms.

29:59.480 --> 30:04.760
Could you take a step back and explain to a layman like me what's proven to Snappy Core

30:04.760 --> 30:05.760
actually is?

30:05.760 --> 30:10.520
Okay, so, and feel free, anybody, Popey, anybody wimpy that wants to correct me, I'm going

30:10.520 --> 30:12.520
to probably just give a real quick summary.

30:12.520 --> 30:17.360
So the Snappy Core, we covered it before more in depth, but think of your base operating

30:17.360 --> 30:21.400
system as super minimal, read-only file system.

30:21.400 --> 30:24.680
Applications and stuff are done in containers or something like that, and then when there's

30:24.680 --> 30:30.960
a system update, you just replace that read-only image with the new image of a new file system

30:30.960 --> 30:32.200
that's been fully updated.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.760
The container applications are untouched because their updates are handled independently inside

30:35.760 --> 30:36.920
the container.

30:36.920 --> 30:37.920
You reboot.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.120
If the system doesn't boot successfully, you just simply switch back to the other read-only

30:41.120 --> 30:44.960
image and now you're right back to where you were before any updates were applied.

30:44.960 --> 30:50.960
Doesn't sound too dissimilar from something like Core OS maybe in terms of concept?

30:50.960 --> 30:51.960
Right?

30:51.960 --> 30:52.960
Exactly.

30:52.960 --> 30:53.960
Yes, exactly.

30:53.960 --> 30:57.080
That's what I'm saying is they see the market, and I think this is, I think Ubuntu for these

30:57.080 --> 31:00.840
types of devices is a great maneuver.

31:00.840 --> 31:04.160
I don't know though, I just feel like we're being sold a little bit of a sales pitch,

31:04.160 --> 31:10.000
a little bit of a story to use Mark's words, and it just stinks a little bit.

31:10.000 --> 31:18.400
So from my perspective, I can see why, you know, we do this big marketing push and you

31:18.400 --> 31:22.880
guys have not heard of this at all until today.

31:22.880 --> 31:29.520
And prior to that, there was the Snappy Ubuntu Core announcement a few weeks back that talked

31:29.520 --> 31:31.800
about the cloud.

31:31.800 --> 31:37.320
And I know that this stuff has been bubbling under for a while, and I know how it can seem

31:37.320 --> 31:47.160
like it's taking advantage of a bit of marketing to make it look like we've been working on

31:47.160 --> 31:48.160
this for a while.

31:48.160 --> 31:54.960
But I look back and think about conversations that I've had with Mark and other people at

31:54.960 --> 32:00.480
Canonical over the years, and I've only worked for Canonical for three and a bit years, and

32:00.480 --> 32:08.040
I remember my first week talking about how we're going to do these transactional updates,

32:08.040 --> 32:11.400
how we're going to do this read-only image, how we're going to do these kind of things

32:11.400 --> 32:13.400
that we're going to need in this future.

32:13.400 --> 32:19.240
And I see Mark as a very clever guy, he's very astute, and he knows what the future

32:19.240 --> 32:23.920
holds, or he has some idea of what the future holds.

32:23.920 --> 32:31.360
And he puts in place these little markers and gets things ready for some distant way

32:31.360 --> 32:32.360
in the future.

32:32.360 --> 32:37.800
And it might look like it makes no sense right now, it doesn't look like anything you might

32:37.800 --> 32:43.720
need right now, but then when the pieces start to land, it all kind of comes together.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.840
And I think that's what this is.

32:45.840 --> 32:46.840
And that makes sense.

32:46.840 --> 32:52.360
But I think part of the reason why it feels a little salesy is, for example, quote from

32:52.360 --> 32:55.680
Mark, let us deliver those updates to your device with the same efficiency as with the

32:55.680 --> 32:56.680
phone.

32:56.680 --> 33:02.760
Well, that is based on a preposition that there has been reliable updates shipped to

33:02.760 --> 33:03.760
the phone.

33:03.760 --> 33:07.400
I mean, yes, in beta testing, you just aren't using it.

33:07.400 --> 33:11.360
Well, actually, my Nexus 5 got screwed up by an update, but I realized it wasn't enough

33:11.360 --> 33:12.360
things.

33:12.360 --> 33:13.360
Which is not a supported device.

33:13.360 --> 33:18.280
But you see, it's sort of based on, it's not a sound claim to make.

33:18.280 --> 33:21.800
You can't truly, because it hasn't been done at scale, right?

33:21.800 --> 33:25.760
It's not actually genuinely done at scale the way that that quote sort of implies.

33:25.760 --> 33:30.360
Like if you did not follow this very closely, and you read that quote on GigaOM where it's

33:30.360 --> 33:35.540
posted, you would assume that Canonical right now has a history of shipping software updates

33:35.540 --> 33:38.920
to thousands, maybe even millions of devices by reading that quote, right?

33:38.920 --> 33:39.920
It's not-

33:39.920 --> 33:43.920
Well, there's certainly thousands of devices, and it's certainly over the past two years

33:43.920 --> 33:50.440
that thousands of devices have been receiving updates over the air every day reliably, including

33:50.440 --> 33:54.840
machines in our data center that we do QA on, and machines that are held by developers

33:54.840 --> 33:55.840
and machines that are held by enthusiastic users.

33:55.840 --> 33:56.840
I agree, and it's a sound system.

33:56.840 --> 34:03.320
I agree with you that there aren't millions, we're not at the scale of iOS or Android yet,

34:03.320 --> 34:08.760
but there is still a reliable and proven mechanism because thousands of devices use it.

34:08.760 --> 34:11.760
Okay, let me ask you what you think about this, because I agree, I mean, I'm not saying

34:11.760 --> 34:12.760
it's wrong either.

34:12.760 --> 34:16.860
I'm just saying it's stated in a way where if you didn't have the full context, you might

34:16.860 --> 34:19.360
get a misrepresentation of the scale.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.360
But I mean, that's fair.

34:20.360 --> 34:22.320
I mean, that's within his right to do.

34:22.320 --> 34:26.680
Okay, here's a question that I thought was kind of astute of GigaOM to ask.

34:26.680 --> 34:32.680
So they asked, is Ubuntu Core the win CE of Ubuntu or the future of the venerable Linux

34:32.680 --> 34:33.680
distro?

34:33.680 --> 34:37.560
Shuttleworth was adamant to say that the Debian package version of Ubuntu will never go away

34:37.560 --> 34:42.560
because it is the mechanism with which we collaborate amongst ourselves and with Debian,

34:42.560 --> 34:46.440
and should be a continued relevance to developers.

34:46.440 --> 34:51.560
I don't know, Popey, like, honestly, seems like if this Ubuntu snappy core works good

34:51.560 --> 34:54.860
for the phone, it works good for a Raspberry Pi, it works good for my SCADA system that

34:54.860 --> 34:58.320
manages the dam, and it works good for my Hughes lights, maybe it'd work okay for my

34:58.320 --> 34:59.320
laptop too.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.520
Right, yeah, and that's great.

35:01.520 --> 35:06.880
But what you're not picking up on is that the read-only image that we ship out to you

35:06.880 --> 35:09.040
is built from Debian packages.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.560
So we can't throw that away.

35:10.560 --> 35:13.680
We can't get rid of that whole Debian legacy.

35:13.680 --> 35:17.600
We keep that because it works, it's reliable, it's great for us to build that read-only

35:17.600 --> 35:18.600
image.

35:18.600 --> 35:21.640
But does that mean it has to be a shipping product?

35:21.640 --> 35:22.640
What has to be a shipping product?

35:22.640 --> 35:23.640
The Debian version.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.440
Like, maybe it's just something internally that the...

35:25.440 --> 35:26.440
It is.

35:26.440 --> 35:30.800
I mean, you can flip a switch on an Ubuntu phone or on this future laptop that you're

35:30.800 --> 35:36.320
talking about, you can flip a switch and go from read-write and then just go app-get-update,

35:36.320 --> 35:37.320
app-get-upgrade, app-get-install-full.

35:37.320 --> 35:39.960
Oh, that's cool.

35:39.960 --> 35:45.680
I already have my tablet here that's running Ubuntu phone, and I've app-get-installed various

35:45.680 --> 35:50.400
libraries because I wanted to build some STL-based games on my tablet.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.400
So I, you know...

35:51.400 --> 35:55.520
You know where I'm going with this, is I like the idea of, yeah, here is...

35:55.520 --> 35:58.760
Let's just use today's terms, like if it's something that existed today.

35:58.760 --> 36:06.200
Here's your Ubuntu 14.04-based, nice stable desktop, all your applications are in containers.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.480
That would really be a pretty incredibly bulletproof Linux desktop.

36:09.480 --> 36:10.480
I like that.

36:10.480 --> 36:12.760
I didn't realize you could switch it over to a non-read...

36:12.760 --> 36:15.040
Of course, that makes sense, but I just wouldn't think all the components would be there.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.040
You can switch it both ways.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.040
Yeah.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.040
You can flip it back the other way as well.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.080
But yeah, I agree with you.

36:19.080 --> 36:24.240
That's an interesting idea, to use these kind of components in the desktop later on, having

36:24.240 --> 36:31.720
your, I don't know, LibreOffice 4.5 in a container, and having LibreOffice, oh, I want to try

36:31.720 --> 36:35.560
out LibreOffice 5, but I don't want to screw up my LibreOffice 4 install.

36:35.560 --> 36:39.320
So I have that in a container, and I just click a button, and it installs it.

36:39.320 --> 36:42.080
You could even potentially run both side by side.

36:42.080 --> 36:47.480
Those are kind of panacea that a lot of people have wanted for a long time on any OS, not

36:47.480 --> 36:48.480
just on Linux.

36:48.480 --> 36:52.320
You know, you've been wanting to be able to run two different versions of the same application,

36:52.320 --> 36:55.840
or have two different multiple users of the same machine running two different versions

36:55.840 --> 36:58.640
of the same application, and that's just one tiny use case.

36:58.640 --> 37:04.160
There's lots of other ways in which this is cool, but the underlying components is still

37:04.160 --> 37:05.160
Debian.

37:05.160 --> 37:06.460
It's still Debian packages that built this thing.

37:06.460 --> 37:13.700
So what I go back to then, what I wonder, is if this all rolls out, it truly, if this

37:13.700 --> 37:19.120
becomes adopted by OEMs and manufacturers, is really kind of what this space is competing

37:19.120 --> 37:20.120
with is probably Android.

37:20.120 --> 37:23.080
Because that's got to be, like when you look at a lot of these embedded devices, a lot

37:23.080 --> 37:27.840
of them are being built for Android, so now Canonical is going to try to compete with

37:27.840 --> 37:32.040
Android in the mobile phone space and in these low-end devices.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.840
Maybe they're going to try to go lower than the Android devices are, but it still seems

37:34.840 --> 37:37.920
like there's going to be some cross-competition with Google.

37:37.920 --> 37:41.000
A lot of these things have Android images.

37:41.000 --> 37:48.760
I like the idea of having a single OS across my embedded device, my BeagleBone or whatever

37:48.760 --> 37:53.080
other device, my Odroid or whatever, and my laptop, and my server in the cloud.

37:53.080 --> 37:56.000
And I know that there's consistency between them, and I know that they're all running

37:56.000 --> 38:01.320
the same version of LibFu or whatever it is, and I can build my own personal libraries

38:01.320 --> 38:04.480
on all of those, and it will work on all of those.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.120
That is personally appealing to me.

38:06.120 --> 38:10.160
If only it was Arch.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.520
You had to go and do it, didn't you?

38:12.520 --> 38:13.520
I can't.

38:13.520 --> 38:14.520
But yeah, I agree.

38:14.520 --> 38:18.340
Like it is a pretty cool, like it could be a pretty cool picture once it's all completed.

38:18.340 --> 38:21.680
If it gets there, a lot of uncompleted bits as of yet.

38:21.680 --> 38:24.120
But it'll get there eventually, I think.

38:24.120 --> 38:25.120
I don't know.

38:25.120 --> 38:30.200
And so I'll have a link in the show notes to Mark's big post up about it, and including

38:30.200 --> 38:32.560
also his video, which he talks more about.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.320
I just played a couple of minutes of it, but you can find the whole video linked in our

38:35.320 --> 38:36.320
show notes.

38:36.320 --> 38:37.320
Sounds cool.

38:37.320 --> 38:41.600
Anybody else have any closing thoughts in the moment before we move on to our next topic?

38:41.600 --> 38:45.320
Going once, going twice, no, no, okay, very good.

38:45.320 --> 38:48.100
Well then, let's take a moment right here, and I'll tell you about something I like quite

38:48.100 --> 38:49.100
a bit.

38:49.100 --> 38:50.100
And that's my cell phone provider.

38:50.100 --> 38:51.100
That's Ting.

38:51.100 --> 38:54.640
Go to linux.ting.com to get started, linux.ting.com.

38:54.640 --> 38:59.400
Ting is mobile that makes sense, no BS, no tricks, no hidden fees.

38:59.400 --> 39:04.760
It's just $6 for your line, and then your minutes, your messages, your megabytes.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.680
They just take that, they add that up, and that's what you pay.

39:07.680 --> 39:10.520
And you get a hotspot teller, and you just turn it on, voicemail, a picture message,

39:10.520 --> 39:11.520
all the stuff you'd expect.

39:11.520 --> 39:15.760
And they've got a full range of phones from really low end value, like cheap phones that'll

39:15.760 --> 39:18.200
just get your phones and text, and that's it.

39:18.200 --> 39:21.320
It lasts probably like three days, or four days, or a week, because those phones did

39:21.320 --> 39:22.320
that.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.320
And it feels like an entire different time.

39:23.320 --> 39:26.920
All the way up to the super high end, like go just get a GSM and put it in a Nexus 6,

39:26.920 --> 39:28.720
and it's ready to go on the Ting network.

39:28.720 --> 39:33.600
GSM Nexus 6, and also CDMA Nexus 6, in February, you'll be able to use both, just like in my

39:33.600 --> 39:34.600
Nexus 5.

39:34.600 --> 39:38.380
That's a pretty great deal, and you combine that with Ting's no-hold customer service.

39:38.380 --> 39:42.360
Now you're starting to really talk, because what I have found is the dashboard totally

39:42.360 --> 39:43.720
works for me.

39:43.720 --> 39:46.400
Everything I need to do with Ting, I can take care of it in the dashboard.

39:46.400 --> 39:47.880
I mean everything.

39:47.880 --> 39:51.600
Every phone I've gotten from Ting, activating them, transferring them, any of that stuff

39:51.600 --> 39:54.360
I can do in the dashboard, I've never needed to call.

39:54.360 --> 39:58.800
But just in case mom ever needs to call, or just in case Rekai ever needs to call, I don't

39:58.800 --> 39:59.920
need to play tech support.

39:59.920 --> 40:04.540
Ting has no-hold customer service, so I know they can just call 1-855-TING-FTW, and a real

40:04.540 --> 40:05.960
human being answers the phone.

40:05.960 --> 40:10.880
I've got three phones on my Ting account, and I'm paying somewhere in the ballpark between

40:10.880 --> 40:18.200
$30 to $40, $45, depends if I'm traveling a month, for three smartphones, HTC One, Nexus

40:18.200 --> 40:20.160
5, and the iPhone 5.

40:20.160 --> 40:25.720
And in fact, if you are of the iPhone variety, I believe Ting has the 4S right now for like

40:25.720 --> 40:31.200
$130, no contract, nor the termination fee, you only pay for what you use.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.200
That's a pretty good deal.

40:32.200 --> 40:36.760
You can go get a whole range of devices, check them out, go over to linux.ting.com to get

40:36.760 --> 40:37.760
started.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.000
They'll give you a $25 discount off your first Ting device.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.560
If you already have a Ting compatible device, they'll give you a $25 service credit.

40:43.560 --> 40:44.920
Also try out the savings calculator.

40:44.920 --> 40:47.920
I'm saving like $2,200 a year, for every two years now.

40:47.920 --> 40:48.920
I'm like, that's crazy.

40:48.920 --> 40:49.920
That's crazy.

40:49.920 --> 40:50.920
That's like laptop money.

40:50.920 --> 40:51.920
That's nuts.

40:51.920 --> 40:55.120
I should take that money, and I should buy Bitcoin while it's cheap.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.600
I'm telling you, that's exactly what I'd do.

40:56.600 --> 41:00.560
I mean, like, yeah, my last bill was like $20, $26, I think something like that.

41:00.560 --> 41:01.560
It's amazing.

41:01.560 --> 41:02.560
Isn't it?

41:02.560 --> 41:07.840
Well, and what I like is that they kind of hedged me into learning to use my resources.

41:07.840 --> 41:11.120
As far as like my home internet, for example, I can make calls and texts over internet,

41:11.120 --> 41:12.120
which of course saves me money.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.120
Yeah, no kidding.

41:13.120 --> 41:16.600
Yeah, you just have to be a little savvy and you can save a ton of money, and I think most

41:16.600 --> 41:17.600
of the audience is.

41:17.600 --> 41:18.600
Absolutely.

41:18.600 --> 41:19.600
And also check out the Ting blog.

41:19.600 --> 41:23.000
They have some recent posts on how you can set up your podcast catcher, so that way it

41:23.000 --> 41:24.320
doesn't cost you a bunch of data either.

41:24.320 --> 41:26.960
And you know, that's good for your podcast listeners.

41:26.960 --> 41:27.960
Linux.ting.com.

41:27.960 --> 41:31.960
Go check them out and help support the Unplugged show, linux.ting.com.

41:31.960 --> 41:36.960
And a big, big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

41:36.960 --> 41:41.480
So we talked about it a little bit on the Linux Action Show live stream.

41:41.480 --> 41:47.480
Linus and friends were at the LinuxConf AU keynote and they were talking.

41:47.480 --> 41:49.640
They're doing just, Linus likes to do just Q&As mostly.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.480
He doesn't like to go up there and do big presentations.

41:52.480 --> 41:55.760
And that's understandable because he's done them for a long time now and he feels like

41:55.760 --> 41:59.680
everybody has a bunch of questions and it keeps it sort of so fresh and so clean.

41:59.680 --> 42:01.440
So he was happy with that.

42:01.440 --> 42:03.640
And so an interesting couple of things came up.

42:03.640 --> 42:06.880
Over the weekend, we heard that Linus made the comment that he doesn't care if he upsets

42:06.880 --> 42:08.820
people and that's what we talked about in the pre-show.

42:08.820 --> 42:11.040
And that's what kind of grabbed all of the headlines.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.320
And everybody was kind of focused on that.

42:12.320 --> 42:17.080
But it turns out there's other couple of bits in that speech that didn't get quite the attention

42:17.080 --> 42:18.080
they deserve.

42:18.080 --> 42:21.160
I want to start with the first one because it's a popular one in the security community

42:21.160 --> 42:23.040
right now around disclosures.

42:23.040 --> 42:27.200
And ZDNet did a pretty good write up about what Linus had to say.

42:27.200 --> 42:31.400
And Linus essentially said that he thinks public issues like this should be disclosed

42:31.400 --> 42:34.040
openly, especially for open source software.

42:34.040 --> 42:37.440
But instead of me telling you about it, I'll play it in the man's own words.

42:37.440 --> 42:41.840
There's another thing that's been going on which I find personally very satisfying which

42:41.840 --> 42:47.840
is that people are less willing sometimes to kind of brush the problem under the mat

42:47.840 --> 42:54.120
and leave it up to vendors and have disclosure, like infinitely long disclosure times.

42:54.120 --> 43:02.660
I'm a huge believer in just disclosing still somewhat responsibly but security problems

43:02.660 --> 43:06.080
need to be made public.

43:06.080 --> 43:12.000
And there are people who argue and have argued for decades that you never want to talk about

43:12.000 --> 43:17.360
security problems because that only helps the black hats.

43:17.360 --> 43:23.080
And the fact is that I think you absolutely need to report them and you need to report

43:23.080 --> 43:25.920
them in a reasonable time frame.

43:25.920 --> 43:30.800
Reasonable for the kernel security list is admittedly five working days which some people

43:30.800 --> 43:37.580
think is a bit extreme and in other projects it might be a month or a couple of months

43:37.580 --> 43:43.520
but that's still much better than the years and years of silence which we used to have.

43:43.520 --> 43:45.520
Thank you very much.

43:45.520 --> 43:50.800
And I think right now Google's disclosure is like 90 days to give you, so the kernel

43:50.800 --> 43:52.960
mailing list is five days.

43:52.960 --> 43:54.720
That's pretty tight.

43:54.720 --> 43:58.640
And so if you didn't catch it, if you don't watch TechSnap, what happened kind of recently

43:58.640 --> 44:06.520
is Google engineers found some significant bugs in Windows, notified Microsoft, Microsoft

44:06.520 --> 44:10.880
took longer than Google's 90 days and Google publicly disclosed the vulnerability that

44:10.880 --> 44:13.840
was in Windows before the patch was available to the public.

44:13.840 --> 44:18.440
That happened at the beginning of like last year too, like it's happened twice now.

44:18.440 --> 44:22.560
And it's kind of created this public feud about how we should disclose vulnerabilities

44:22.560 --> 44:26.640
and how we do that when the code itself is open.

44:26.640 --> 44:29.080
And it's a discussion that's really been going on for quite a while.

44:29.080 --> 44:33.200
And yes, we'll have a link to the full video in the show notes.

44:33.200 --> 44:36.400
Anybody have any comments in the Mumble Room about patch disclosures before we move on

44:36.400 --> 44:37.400
to his next comment?

44:37.400 --> 44:45.580
Yes, I actually just like to add that regardless, it always gives the people also the option

44:45.580 --> 44:51.560
to not run the software until they actually are sure that the release was made, which

44:51.560 --> 44:56.880
is often not considered, they are often just considering the developer side or the manufacturer

44:56.880 --> 45:03.440
side and don't think that, okay, users should have an option on what he wants to do.

45:03.440 --> 45:04.440
Make an informed choice.

45:04.440 --> 45:05.440
Yes, exactly.

45:05.440 --> 45:06.440
Yeah.

45:06.440 --> 45:07.440
I completely agree.

45:07.440 --> 45:08.440
Good point.

45:08.440 --> 45:09.440
Okay.

45:09.440 --> 45:10.880
So that was Linus coming down on that issue.

45:10.880 --> 45:14.120
So the security community has sort of been grousing about that obviously because he runs

45:14.120 --> 45:18.280
a pretty important project where security issues are critical.

45:18.280 --> 45:20.200
So the question came up.

45:20.200 --> 45:21.200
This guy got up.

45:21.200 --> 45:24.240
He gets up in front of the audience and he just starts kind of harping on the kernel

45:24.240 --> 45:26.040
developers for a little bit.

45:26.040 --> 45:30.440
Give him a hard time for not knowing how memory allocation works maybe and that the documentation

45:30.440 --> 45:31.440
sucks.

45:31.440 --> 45:34.800
And so he eventually gets around to asking them, Linus, what the hell is your plan to

45:34.800 --> 45:37.880
make kernel documentation better because it sucks right now?

45:37.880 --> 45:43.720
The question today, I would ask which file manual we should have read.

45:43.720 --> 45:48.720
Do you think that documentation of the kernel is appropriate?

45:48.720 --> 45:54.600
Do you have any idea how to improve that?

45:54.600 --> 46:00.080
Well, I clearly have no idea how to improve documentation of the kernel.

46:00.080 --> 46:08.680
This is where others sometimes step up and do a great job of explaining small details.

46:08.680 --> 46:16.760
At the same time, there was a talk yesterday about how programming should be provably correct

46:16.760 --> 46:21.480
and it would be a great thing if we could prove correctness and that we all suck at

46:21.480 --> 46:25.280
it and I don't take that approach.

46:25.280 --> 46:35.480
I'm more of a touchy-feely guy and I actually, I believe in biological processes and I believe

46:35.480 --> 46:42.920
in evolution and I believe in all these making mistakes and trying and we don't have documentation

46:42.920 --> 46:50.040
for how humans work, but humans work really, really well except when they break down.

46:50.040 --> 46:56.360
And I actually think we're at the stage and we have been at the stage in kernel development

46:56.360 --> 47:02.880
and in a lot of technology where nobody really understands everything that's going on.

47:02.880 --> 47:06.460
Nobody really understands everything that's going on, the VM is very complicated.

47:06.460 --> 47:11.120
So his argument to, you know, he says like obviously there's rules and policies that

47:11.120 --> 47:16.640
need to be documented, some of the broader concepts are documented, but it's an ever-changing

47:16.640 --> 47:20.960
beast and just like the human body, it manages to go on without proper documentation.

47:20.960 --> 47:23.000
Matt, what is your reaction to that?

47:23.000 --> 47:26.920
I think he, you know, he kind of danced around it a little bit, which is kind of ironic for

47:26.920 --> 47:30.360
a lot of us, but I think he pretty much nailed it.

47:30.360 --> 47:32.720
You know, I think that's really kind of what it is.

47:32.720 --> 47:35.880
It's trying to kind of find that sweet spot and yeah, it definitely felt like a bit of

47:35.880 --> 47:36.880
a dance though.

47:36.880 --> 47:39.680
It did feel like a bit of a ballroom thing as he went along.

47:39.680 --> 47:43.480
He tried to nail it down and still sound diplomatic and it was kind of fun to watch.

47:43.480 --> 47:44.480
I don't know how else to put that.

47:44.480 --> 47:47.000
Derek Delvin, you've heard him make this comment before?

47:47.000 --> 47:52.960
Yes, they actually, I've seen older talks that Linus made and he actually was talking

47:52.960 --> 47:58.520
about that they're trying to improve and everything, but the result is people weren't reading and

47:58.520 --> 48:00.880
they were just making the questions in the mailing list.

48:00.880 --> 48:05.320
So the mailing list became the biggest documentation of the kernel.

48:05.320 --> 48:10.680
So that makes, you know, the persons that are writing documentation not feel as inspired

48:10.680 --> 48:12.040
to do that.

48:12.040 --> 48:15.920
And of course, that with the speed of the kernel changes, which is like about seven

48:15.920 --> 48:20.440
changes per hour or something like that, it's impossible to document all that.

48:20.440 --> 48:25.520
So I don't feel like, unless you're working with an LTS release and you know it's going

48:25.520 --> 48:31.520
to be frozen, I don't think there is really, you need to get to the cores and the rest

48:31.520 --> 48:34.240
is just, the code needs to be self-documenting.

48:34.240 --> 48:39.080
And if we enforce that and you know your code, you should be able to understand what's going

48:39.080 --> 48:40.080
on.

48:40.080 --> 48:41.080
You just need to know your code.

48:41.080 --> 48:42.080
I like that.

48:42.080 --> 48:45.000
Also, it makes me feel a lot better about my horrible documentation.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
That's what Linus is good at.

48:46.000 --> 48:50.640
He's really good at like coming up with sound rational justifications that make me feel

48:50.640 --> 48:52.040
like less of a bad person.

48:52.040 --> 48:56.000
I think that's why I like Linus Clips because I'm like, yeah, yeah, our studio, it's like

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
a human body.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
It's organic.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
It's always changing.

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
I don't feel so bad about that.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
It does things, right?

49:01.000 --> 49:05.080
Yeah, of course, kernel.org, it does, of course, have some documentation.

49:05.080 --> 49:06.080
So that's true.

49:06.080 --> 49:07.080
All right, Mumble Room.

49:07.080 --> 49:08.080
Closing thoughts go to you.

49:08.080 --> 49:10.460
Before we get out of here, anybody have anything else they want to contribute or add?

49:10.460 --> 49:14.000
Going once, going twice, okay, very good.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
Well then, we'll conclude at that.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.520
Matt, something we're working on for Sunday.

49:16.520 --> 49:22.200
I don't know if it's going to work out for sure, not because, well, we have, we're trying

49:22.200 --> 49:26.520
to get somebody from the Trisco project lined up for Linux Action Show.

49:26.520 --> 49:30.240
But as you would expect from the Trisco project, there's limitations on the technology we can

49:30.240 --> 49:32.600
use to make the connection happen.

49:32.600 --> 49:36.160
So we're working that out right now, probably going to use something like WebRTC or something

49:36.160 --> 49:37.160
like that.

49:37.160 --> 49:40.760
And if all that goes as planned, we'll have an interview with Trisco developer on Sunday's

49:40.760 --> 49:41.760
Linux Action Show.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.920
But even if we don't, we'll always have something great going on.

49:43.920 --> 49:44.920
So I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

49:44.920 --> 49:45.920
All right, see you then.

49:45.920 --> 49:46.920
All right, everybody.

49:46.920 --> 49:49.960
Well, I hope you enjoyed this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

49:49.960 --> 49:54.680
You can head over to jblive.tv Tuesdays, 2 p.m. Pacific, or just go to jupitabroadcasting.com

49:54.680 --> 49:57.080
slash calendar to get it converted to your local time.

49:57.080 --> 49:59.960
Then you join us live, you hang out in the chat room, you can join our virtual lug.

49:59.960 --> 50:01.340
We love that.

50:01.340 --> 50:03.840
And you can argue with me and Popey, that's always fun.

50:03.840 --> 50:07.720
And also don't forget about that subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com, make this a better

50:07.720 --> 50:08.720
show.

50:08.720 --> 50:12.240
And last but not least, that contact page, jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact.

50:12.240 --> 50:14.480
Please send in your feedback, we'd love to read it.

50:14.480 --> 50:17.200
Okay, everybody, thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

50:17.200 --> 50:42.640
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

50:47.200 --> 50:55.920
I feel like this show, this episode was like a freight train, like it was just moving right

50:55.920 --> 50:56.920
along.

50:56.920 --> 50:57.920
Yeah, it really did.

50:57.920 --> 51:02.880
Reading emails, calling guests, playing clips, reading emails, calling, no, it was just moving

51:02.880 --> 51:03.880
right along.

51:03.880 --> 51:04.880
javidtotles.com.

51:04.880 --> 51:05.880
Yeah.

51:05.880 --> 51:10.240
Will Unfilter be like a mumble edition tonight or no?

51:10.240 --> 51:14.680
I don't know if we can because of having to get like a backup stream going.

51:14.680 --> 51:22.520
I might need that computer for backup audio stream, but I'm going to say no now, but it

51:22.520 --> 51:23.520
is going to be, hmm.

51:23.520 --> 51:26.560
It would be a pleasant surprise if it happens and if not, no worries.

51:26.560 --> 51:28.000
I hope people can join us live.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.920
Unfilter is going to be, it's going to be fun doing that live coverage of the State

51:30.920 --> 51:31.920
of the Union.

51:31.920 --> 51:32.920
javidtotles.com.

51:32.920 --> 51:33.920
javidtotles.com.

51:33.920 --> 51:34.920
Oh, that's right.

51:34.920 --> 51:35.920
People are talking tonight.

51:35.920 --> 51:36.920
I forgot about that.

51:36.920 --> 51:37.920
Yeah, yeah.

51:37.920 --> 51:38.920
The people are talking about the cyber.

51:38.920 --> 51:43.040
That whole TV thing, that was good.

51:43.040 --> 51:45.280
I wish we could stop calling it cyber.

51:45.280 --> 51:46.280
Yeah, no kidding.

51:46.280 --> 51:47.280
No kidding.

51:47.280 --> 51:48.280
Yeah.

51:48.280 --> 51:49.280
Cyber.

51:49.280 --> 51:50.280
Cybertron.

51:50.280 --> 51:52.560
So I was going to ask you guys there, did you see this Mint PC?

51:52.560 --> 51:53.800
It's a Mint mini box.

51:53.800 --> 51:54.800
It's tiny.

51:54.800 --> 51:55.800
It's like smaller than a NUC.

51:55.800 --> 51:56.800
It's $89.

51:56.800 --> 51:59.480
It comes with Ubuntu 14.04.

51:59.480 --> 52:00.480
It's the version two.

52:00.480 --> 52:01.480
There's been a Mint box before.

52:01.480 --> 52:02.480
This is version two.

52:02.480 --> 52:03.480
It's kind of AMD.

52:03.480 --> 52:04.480
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

52:04.480 --> 52:05.480
You said it comes with Ubuntu 14.04.

52:05.480 --> 52:07.480
You mean it comes with Mint?

52:07.480 --> 52:08.480
No.

52:08.480 --> 52:11.080
That's what it says, but you're right.

52:11.080 --> 52:12.080
Why would it?

52:12.080 --> 52:13.080
It comes with Ubuntu 14.04.

52:13.080 --> 52:14.080
Yeah.

52:14.080 --> 52:15.080
That doesn't make any sense.

52:15.080 --> 52:16.080
It must come with Mint.

52:16.080 --> 52:17.080
I must be misreading it.

52:17.080 --> 52:19.600
It comes with Mint, which is based on Ubuntu 14.04.

52:19.600 --> 52:20.600
Oh, is that what they're saying?

52:20.600 --> 52:23.040
It comes with Mint, but it's also not $89.

52:23.040 --> 52:25.040
The one I saw- Oh, I am looking at different ones.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.040
It's like $200 and something.

52:26.040 --> 52:27.040
Yeah.

52:27.040 --> 52:28.040
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

52:28.040 --> 52:29.040
Yeah.

52:29.040 --> 52:30.040
Now that, see, yeah, I'm looking, you know what?

52:30.040 --> 52:31.040
I'm looking at an Intel one.

52:31.040 --> 52:32.040
I'm looking at this.

52:32.040 --> 52:33.040
It's 89 bucks.

52:33.040 --> 52:37.440
That's not bad, but boy, when you start looking at the specs, an AMD CPU, I just don't, I

52:37.440 --> 52:38.440
don't know.

52:38.440 --> 52:42.240
At 89 bucks, I mean, they could literally have it running with Hamster, so that's the

52:42.240 --> 52:43.240
Intel version.

52:43.240 --> 52:44.240
No, that's the Intel version.

52:44.240 --> 52:45.240
Oh.

52:45.240 --> 52:46.240
I don't know.

52:46.240 --> 52:47.240
I mean, am I just a-

52:47.240 --> 52:52.280
The Mint box, that's all, but that's that minty green, white, yeah, it's 295.

52:52.280 --> 52:55.240
It's 295 USD and also 295 euros per ounce.

52:55.240 --> 52:56.240
Yeah.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.480
Yeah, 295 though, just doesn't seem like-

52:57.480 --> 52:59.480
At 295, I expect Intel.

52:59.480 --> 53:00.480
Yeah, I want to know.

53:00.480 --> 53:01.480
I would never go into it.

53:01.480 --> 53:02.480
I don't get it.

53:02.480 --> 53:03.480
Who are these for?

53:03.480 --> 53:09.120
Probably the same people that did the Mint, whatever the previous one was, the Mint box

53:09.120 --> 53:10.120
and the Mint thing.

53:10.120 --> 53:11.120
Maybe like, or businesses, right?

53:11.120 --> 53:13.560
Like if you're going to deploy a whole bunch of Mint workstations or something.

53:13.560 --> 53:14.560
I guess.

53:14.560 --> 53:15.560
Yeah.

53:15.560 --> 53:16.560
Yeah, maybe.

53:16.560 --> 53:19.000
No, it can still do all of that and still have technically better hardware.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.640
You could get, you could spend less money and get like twice as much RAM.

53:22.640 --> 53:23.640
Yeah.

53:23.640 --> 53:28.140
Ah, but remember, and multi-billion dollar businesses are built around this philosophy,

53:28.140 --> 53:29.140
make it out of the box.

53:29.140 --> 53:30.220
Don't make someone else have to do it.

53:30.220 --> 53:33.000
And so some people, and that may be what they're targeting, is they're providing it out of

53:33.000 --> 53:36.320
the box experience versus the buy a duck and do it yourself, which is my preference.

53:36.320 --> 53:37.320
Right.

53:37.320 --> 53:38.320
Yeah.

53:38.320 --> 53:39.320
Right.

53:39.320 --> 53:40.320
That's what it is, right?

53:40.320 --> 53:41.320
That's what it is.

53:41.320 --> 53:42.320
Must be.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.320
Must be.

53:43.320 --> 53:44.320
What do you guys think of Unity of Things as our title?

53:44.320 --> 53:45.320
You like Unity of Things?

53:45.320 --> 53:46.320
I like it.

53:46.320 --> 53:47.320
Yeah, I like it.

53:47.320 --> 53:48.320
Interview.

53:48.320 --> 53:49.320
Yeah, we do have the interview in there too.

53:49.320 --> 53:51.640
Should that be the, should that be the lead?

53:51.640 --> 53:52.680
I think it should.

53:52.680 --> 53:53.680
I think so.

53:53.680 --> 53:56.080
I actually suggested Building Builder.

53:56.080 --> 53:57.160
Building Builder is not bad.

53:57.160 --> 53:58.160
Build the Gnome.

53:58.160 --> 53:59.160
Build the Gnome is good.

53:59.160 --> 54:02.320
Building Builder, I see, I don't know though, I feel like it's going to, I think a lot of

54:02.320 --> 54:04.160
people aren't going to know what we're talking about with that title.

54:04.160 --> 54:05.440
Well, it sounds like Bob the Builder or something.

54:05.440 --> 54:06.440
It just seems off.

54:06.440 --> 54:08.440
Oh, now you got that stuck in my head, Matt.

54:08.440 --> 54:11.520
You still have Fraggle Rock going on in your brain, you're all right.

54:11.520 --> 54:13.440
Dude, I'm still running Firefox here.

54:13.440 --> 54:15.000
Yeah, that's your, that's your bad.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
You're just, you're just.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
I'm still bitching about it.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
I'm still running it.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
You're just punishing yourself.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
You're punishing yourself.

54:20.000 --> 54:27.760
So, Popey, what, what is not good about Firefox from your point of view?

54:27.760 --> 54:32.080
So I had to uninstall Flash, which, you know, arguably is, you know, a good thing for some

54:32.080 --> 54:36.400
people, but I had to uninstall it because it caused the browser to crash.

54:36.400 --> 54:42.000
I then had to disable the Cisco H.264 plugin because that caused the browser to crash.

54:42.000 --> 54:47.760
So now I have no H.264 built in video playback in Firefox and no Flash playback.

54:47.760 --> 54:50.440
So what are you doing for that stuff?

54:50.440 --> 54:51.440
I'm not.

54:51.440 --> 54:56.200
I go to my BBC News website and it says embedded Flash, you don't have Flash.

54:56.200 --> 55:01.860
So I then copy and paste that into a command line window where I then get a VLC or whatever

55:01.860 --> 55:04.480
window pop up and I can play my video that way.

55:04.480 --> 55:07.720
So yeah, I feel like I'm 1990s Linux guy.

55:07.720 --> 55:08.720
I don't know.

55:08.720 --> 55:09.960
What the heck?

55:09.960 --> 55:13.240
If you think about it, though, like most of the time, out of all the stuff that plays

55:13.240 --> 55:15.440
on a website, you only want like 1% of it.

55:15.440 --> 55:19.740
So if you have like Guaker or something like that, you drop down the terminal, you drop

55:19.740 --> 55:20.740
in a URL.

55:20.740 --> 55:21.740
It's not that bad, I suppose.

55:21.740 --> 55:22.740
Yeah, yeah.

55:22.740 --> 55:23.740
It's not so bad.

55:23.740 --> 55:24.800
It's just not seamless.

55:24.800 --> 55:34.200
So I'm running Firefox and I'm preparing a blog article about Firefox versus Chrome for

55:34.200 --> 55:37.120
UK streaming services.

55:37.120 --> 55:45.880
And long story short is once I put the HAL stub in, which just does the crypto bits for

55:45.880 --> 55:53.400
Flash, on Firefox I can watch all of the UK streaming services, but on Chrome I can't

55:53.400 --> 55:59.200
watch, I think it's Channel 4 and Amazon Prime.

55:59.200 --> 56:02.280
And of course I can't watch Netflix because there's no EME.

56:02.280 --> 56:11.680
But apart from Netflix, Firefox with Flash and a stub for HAL, I can watch all of the

56:11.680 --> 56:16.040
major UK streaming services and on Chrome I can't.

56:16.040 --> 56:18.040
I can only watch half of them.

56:18.040 --> 56:21.360
To be fair, Firefox, Mozilla have just put out a new version of Firefox.

56:21.360 --> 56:25.440
So what I'll do is I'll go through the same rigmarole and I'll reinstall Flash and see

56:25.440 --> 56:30.920
if that makes any difference and I'll re-enable the Cisco plugin and see if it makes any difference.

56:30.920 --> 56:35.760
I did this on my Boxing Day though, so this was the last version that I was using and

56:35.760 --> 56:43.360
I've never had a problem with the H.264 codec other than the Flash implementation is ancient.

56:43.360 --> 56:49.280
The only reason I had a problem with the H.264 plugin is because I disabled Flash.

56:49.280 --> 56:54.680
I went to Imgur or Imgur or whatever you call it and it detects that I don't have Flash

56:54.680 --> 57:01.320
and serves me up H.264 video adverts and it was an H.264 video advert that crashed the

57:01.320 --> 57:06.880
browser and it sent a bug report to Mozilla and all that and I'm sure someone will look

57:06.880 --> 57:08.800
at that and go, huh, fancy.

57:08.800 --> 57:14.120
But I will try it again with the new version because I'm sticking with it.

57:14.120 --> 57:21.520
There was a total, they pulled in a new revision of the open H.264 codec for the newest version

57:21.520 --> 57:22.520
of Firefox.

57:22.520 --> 57:23.520
I don't know if that will fix things.

57:23.520 --> 57:24.520
Sweet.

57:24.520 --> 57:25.520
I'll get it going.

57:25.520 --> 57:26.520
Yeah.

57:26.520 --> 57:32.320
Honestly, as a Windows user and a Linux user, Flash is always a culprit with Firefox.

57:32.320 --> 57:35.400
If we ever get rid of Flash, we'll be rid of these problems.

57:35.400 --> 57:40.520
Well, see that's the flip side is I've actually, having got rid of it on my system, I haven't

57:40.520 --> 57:45.680
got it on there at all, arguably, I'm actually a better person.

57:45.680 --> 57:50.640
I feel like I'm a net contributor to humanity by not having Flash installed.

57:50.640 --> 57:51.640
Good job.

57:51.640 --> 57:52.640
You're a hero.

57:52.640 --> 57:57.360
Well, if you want Flash, you can go and do Fresh Player Plugin and that allows Pepper

57:57.360 --> 58:03.040
Flash to be used inside of Firefox and that actually solves, I have not had a single problem

58:03.040 --> 58:07.800
with Firefox, specifically Flash problems with Firefox since I did that.

58:07.800 --> 58:11.920
And I run Nightly and that's been incumbent with bugs.

58:11.920 --> 58:19.560
Hey, so Chris, you see how we've successfully derailed your I'm going to try KDE into another

58:19.560 --> 58:20.560
rant about Firefox.

58:20.560 --> 58:21.560
Oh, that was good.

58:21.560 --> 58:22.560
That's good.

58:22.560 --> 58:25.760
That's all I had for the KDE thing anyway, so that's fine.

58:25.760 --> 58:30.840
For now, for now, for now.

58:30.840 --> 58:32.840
I don't know.

58:32.840 --> 58:35.240
To me, it just seems like all this stuff isn't worth it.

58:35.240 --> 58:37.200
There's more stuff to do in the day than fight this stuff.

58:37.200 --> 58:44.560
So I just feel like if I need Flash, I use Chrome and I just have Chrome from Google,

58:44.560 --> 58:45.560
not Chromium.

58:45.560 --> 58:48.600
I'm using Chrome from Google and that's where my Flash happens and then I do other stuff

58:48.600 --> 58:51.840
in my other browsers and that works fine for me.

58:51.840 --> 58:52.840
I disagree.

58:52.840 --> 58:56.720
I don't think there are enough things in the day to cause us pain, which is why right now

58:56.720 --> 59:00.680
I'm attempting to install MS-DOS 6.22 on my laptop.

59:00.680 --> 59:02.400
You are crazy.

59:02.400 --> 59:07.400
You are crazy.
