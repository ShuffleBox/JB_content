1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
I got great news for anybody that's feeling retro right now.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,560
Linux's floppy disk support isn't just going away.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,200
No, no, it's getting better in 2020.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,200
Yeah, that's right.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,080
It doesn't make any sense,

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,400
but the same kernel where Intel stabilized

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,520
Tiger Lake graphics, AMD added support for Zen version three,

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,000
and we got that new ex-fat driver, it's seen floppy work.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,240
I kind of love this.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,680
Yesterday, Wes and I were just talking

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,320
about how I wanted to set up an LTO tape drive

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,960
here in the studio and just start putting stuff

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,800
on the LTO tape.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,640
Retro.

15
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,000
But maybe this is a better way to go.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,660
And it's not just like keeping things kind of fresh.

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,760
It's a full on bunch of code fixes,

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,760
586 lines of new code and 613 deletions.

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,960
Let's say you can tell it's good.

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,960
Hello friends, welcome into Linux Unplugged episode 345,

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,520
your weekly Linux talk show.

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,360
My name is Chris.

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,200
My name is Wes.

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,560
Hello, Wes.

25
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,200
We have a really fun show to get into today.

26
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,320
Wes and I have been running Ubuntu 2004

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,440
and GNOME 3.36, and we have many,

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,240
many things to share with you.

29
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,960
But also, I don't know if you can tell,

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,720
I'm not in Denver this week.

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,040
I'll tell you what happened.

32
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,080
I was surprised to see you in the studio this morning.

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
Crazy series of events.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,320
I'm not in Denver this week.

35
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,160
I'm in the studio.

36
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm in the studio.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,840
I'm in the studio.

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,680
I'm in the studio.

39
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,680
Crazy series of events, which we will get into in a moment.

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,840
We've got a bunch of community news,

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,920
and we're gonna go behind the scenes

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,520
of the just completed WSLConf,

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,120
the first of the tech conferences

44
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,520
to pivot to virtual only in the light

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,440
of all of the recent healthcare stuff.

46
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,120
They were really at the forefront of that,

47
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,560
and so it makes for a fascinating story.

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,440
But before we get into that,

49
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,480
I got a couple of bits of business to get into.

50
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,080
Time appropriate greetings, virtual log.

51
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,200
Hello, hello.

52
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,040
Hello, hello.

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,880
Hello, hello.

54
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,600
Howdy.

55
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,440
Hello.

56
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,800
Happy Linux Tuesday.

57
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,920
Yes, that is a great showing.

58
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,760
Hello, everybody.

59
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,600
There's so many in there.

60
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,440
I'm gonna do it.

61
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,280
Are you ready, Russ?

62
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,120
I'm gonna do it.

63
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,960
Come on.

64
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,360
Hello to Anthr, Byte, Carl, Conan, Emaxer, Frank,

65
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,480
Jill, John, Colonel, Kestras, Minimac, TechMav,

66
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,000
and all of you up in the quiet listening

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,560
who are just hanging out and listening.

68
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,200
We have 20 people in there this week,

69
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,440
and it is awesome, but of course,

70
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,240
in studio with us rocking, as always,

71
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,600
in the corner in the big comfy chair is Mr. Cheese Bacon.

72
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,440
Hello, sir.

73
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,760
Hello, everyone.

74
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,520
It's great to see that we have the continued turnout

75
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,360
each week.

76
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,600
It just seems to be getting bigger and bigger

77
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
and bigger and bigger every week.

78
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,440
It's awesome.

79
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,280
I know.

80
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,280
One of the reasons I came back a little early

81
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,680
was because I was thinking everybody's at home.

82
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,760
Yeah, if you're hunkered down at home,

83
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,160
why not hang out virtually?

84
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,040
They're gonna show up, and it's gonna be a big show,

85
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,880
and it is.

86
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,160
We have a big chat room going right now.

87
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,360
Hello, everybody.

88
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,800
We've got a lot going on in the mumble room.

89
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,560
Before we get into why I'm not in Denver,

90
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,120
how about a couple of fun floppy facts, Westpain?

91
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,880
You want to razzle dazzle us with a few fun floppy facts?

92
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,200
Floppy facts.

93
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,360
Razzle dazzle us, sir.

94
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,360
A blank CD would take roughly 487 floppy disks.

95
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,680
Okay.

96
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,840
That's the size comparison.

97
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,560
It's not as big as I thought, really.

98
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,040
CDs aren't that great.

99
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,600
Yeah, but when you're installing an operating system,

100
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,480
it really makes all the difference.

101
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,600
Yeah, it gets a little better when you go up a level.

102
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,080
A blank DVD would take roughly 3,264 floppies.

103
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,200
Could you imagine watching a movie

104
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,360
and then pausing to swap a disk or something like that?

105
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,760
It might look nice on the shelf, though,

106
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,680
just you have to have so many laying around.

107
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,080
Oh, yeah, especially if the labels

108
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,480
could all complete a picture

109
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,000
when they're all lined up next to each other.

110
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,840
Now you're thinking.

111
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,720
Yeah, that'd look really good.

112
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,160
What about a big disk?

113
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,320
Yeah, okay, well, a single one-derabyte drive,

114
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,320
that's nearly 700,000 floppies.

115
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,280
You know what was interesting about the code cleanup

116
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,240
is that some of it was specifically

117
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,280
for ARM support of floppy disks.

118
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,400
So ARM devices are getting floppy drives?

119
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,560
I'll admit, that's not anything I've ever tried.

120
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,200
No, that's not where I expected that to go.

121
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,760
But, I mean, why not?

122
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,080
If you're using it somewhere mobile

123
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,720
or in the field, IoT-based perhaps,

124
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,320
you don't need that much storage and floppies are around.

125
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,480
There are still some legacy applications

126
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,600
and equipment out there.

127
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,400
I'm looking at you, old-timey oscilloscopes

128
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,960
that only output by floppy.

129
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,760
So I wonder how many people are here for the first time.

130
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,520
I think, Anther, you're here for the first time

131
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,360
working from home.

132
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,600
Welcome to the Virtual Lug.

133
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,440
Thank you.

134
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,760
Glad to have you here.

135
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,600
Who else?

136
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,080
Anybody else in the Virtual Lug this week

137
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,000
joining us for the first time

138
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,040
because they're working from home?

139
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,880
That'd be me.

140
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,800
Welcome.

141
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,120
Awesome, I'm glad you made this on your list.

142
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,960
I'm glad it worked for you.

143
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,800
And shout out to everybody in the chat room, too,

144
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,360
who is joining us for the first time.

145
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,960
And if you didn't know, podcasting

146
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,000
and listening to podcasts, it makes you more productive.

147
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,600
Yeah, and welcome to the low latency feed of the show.

148
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,280
So why am I here?

149
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,920
Why am I one of those low latency contributors?

150
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,880
Because as you may have seen,

151
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,760
elementary OS folks had to cancel their sprint

152
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,080
because of all of the COVID-19 restrictions and concerns.

153
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,480
And of course, just safety precautions.

154
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,480
And they had team members who would have been traveling

155
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,360
from Europe and they just wouldn't have been able

156
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,200
to get back.

157
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,160
So those minor details.

158
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,440
Funny enough, though, and they told me as soon as they knew,

159
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,920
the guys told me immediately,

160
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,920
I found out the evening before I was getting ready to leave,

161
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,520
I was already packed up, ready to go, everything was set.

162
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,800
And so I decided to head out anyways.

163
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,040
Yeah, I mean, you're ready to go.

164
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,400
Yeah, I mean, I coordinated with work and you,

165
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,000
like we were planning for me to be remote.

166
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,640
Angela had decided that she could watch the kids

167
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,480
while we were gone.

168
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,360
And we had arranged some friends

169
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
to also help watch the kids.

170
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,440
And we made time.

171
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,400
Like it had sort of worked out just sort of beautifully.

172
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,880
And I thought, okay, let's go anyways

173
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,400
because this time is available.

174
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,880
Wow, did that turn into an adventure.

175
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,040
There was a winter storm that rolled

176
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,900
into the Pacific Northwest that chased me around.

177
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,680
And so I decided because I figured we'd have a good showing

178
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,000
that I should just try to come back

179
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and try to make it back by Tuesday,

180
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,620
which turned into an incredible adventure itself,

181
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,460
which since we're here to talk about Linux,

182
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,900
I will spare you all from,

183
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,420
but you can find it at worklifeandrv.com.

184
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,860
It's episode four, eager beavers versus the storm.

185
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,500
We'll have a link in the show notes.

186
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,220
I tell you what, I thought I'd go work from the road

187
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,060
for a week or two and then come back all refreshed

188
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,540
and recharged.

189
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,020
And it ended up being essentially a struggle to survive

190
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,440
and also not crash my home.

191
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,380
It was a hell of a journey.

192
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,700
And in the meantime,

193
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,460
the elementary OS guys got together virtually.

194
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,140
They started working on a few different goals.

195
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,620
It's not necessarily the same thing.

196
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,460
I mean, a pandemic is not gonna stop them.

197
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,940
No, and they've already made some improvements

198
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,740
and contributions.

199
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,300
Daniel Foray and Cassidy have been tweeting

200
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,340
about some of their improvements.

201
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,940
So I invited them to come on the show after they're done

202
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,900
and tell us where they got,

203
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,300
but maybe they might reschedule this to an in-person thing.

204
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,940
We just don't know at this time.

205
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,500
It's all up in the air.

206
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,060
Also, since we've gotten together last, Linux Fest Northwest

207
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,180
is officially canceled.

208
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,580
So obviously we won't be making it to Linux Fest Northwest

209
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,420
this year.

210
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,980
We need a sad clip for that.

211
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,940
Oh man, it's a bit of a blow, huh?

212
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,420
It is, it really sucks.

213
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,200
Yeah, yeah, especially after not making it to scale.

214
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,040
I'm not sure.

215
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,300
I'm kind of postulating what I might do,

216
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,080
maybe a mini meetup because there are some folks

217
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,580
that just already have travel plans locked in.

218
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,580
And it really all just depends on where the pandemic is

219
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,740
by that point.

220
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,860
I've been talking about it on the Chris Last cast

221
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,060
and I'll probably just keep people posted that way.

222
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,260
I kind of look at that as,

223
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,380
it's almost like my personal newsletter,

224
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,460
only I would write a horrible newsletter, let's be honest.

225
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,020
Could you imagine how atrocious that would be?

226
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,900
I'd kind of like to see it, but no, no, podcasts are better.

227
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,780
Yeah, I just, I do a lot better verbally.

228
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,900
So I'm just kind of keeping everyone posted on my plans,

229
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,260
what I'm doing off air and that kind of stuff

230
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,100
at the Chris Last cast.

231
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:05,100
So if I end up doing a Linux fest sort of pirate meetup

232
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,380
or something like that.

233
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,980
Escape to Ballynam.

234
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,460
I'll keep everybody posted there, but I may not.

235
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,100
I mean, if this thing, if the health situation continues

236
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,500
to get worse and worse, we'll see.

237
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,340
We'll see, we're just gonna play it by ear.

238
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,980
Why don't we talk about some great news,

239
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,660
assuming that manufacturing isn't too much of-

240
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,500
Impacted.

241
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,960
Yeah, like that could always change things here,

242
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,620
but it looks like we're gonna see a new Pinebook Pro run.

243
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,100
And this time they'll ship with Manjaro KDE edition

244
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,500
as the default operating system and pre-orders

245
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,500
as we record will go live tomorrow, March 18th, 2020

246
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,180
for early shipping in May.

247
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,300
What do you think about the choice of Manjaro

248
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,700
as the distribution of choice on the Pinebook?

249
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,420
It's kind of unexpected to me, but I like it.

250
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,660
Honestly, it seems like one of the few options

251
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,780
I might actually keep around

252
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,580
without immediately reflashing after I got one.

253
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,260
All right, that's a pretty fair point

254
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,740
if you're talking about you and I personally, right?

255
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,860
What about you, Cheezy?

256
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,340
Personally, I'm a huge fan of Manjaro

257
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,820
and I've been using it on the Pinebook

258
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,340
since I think it was, well, I've tested all of the betas.

259
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,320
So the initial build and now I think it was beta three

260
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,740
was the last one that I've installed

261
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,340
and it's still currently running.

262
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,820
And I paired that with, because it is the KDE version,

263
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,580
I paired that with a lot of the tips and tricks

264
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,540
that you had given whenever we did

265
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,940
the basic to brilliant video.

266
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,100
Oh yeah, the plasma livestream.

267
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,420
Yeah, the plasma livestream.

268
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,780
So to me, it's that perfect little machine

269
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,140
that I reach for when I'm just kicking it on the couch,

270
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,740
laying in bed, you know, checking out my OctoPrint server,

271
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,820
just see how my 3D printer's going or something, right?

272
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,340
It's perfect little machine for that.

273
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,580
Yeah, good point.

274
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,300
And it is also kind of a cutting edge device.

275
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,740
So having an operating system that stays very current

276
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,700
and has the latest upstream drivers.

277
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,580
Seems like a nice idea.

278
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,500
Yeah, TechMav, I'm curious, what do you think,

279
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,020
if you look at Manjaro and you look at them

280
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,660
sort of expanding their focus into Pinebooks,

281
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,880
does this make sense?

282
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,880
I personally use the Manjaro KDE plasma on my Pinebook Pro.

283
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,020
I love it.

284
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,140
I mean, it stays up to date.

285
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,500
It's minimal problem.

286
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,220
I run off of a 128 gigabyte micro SD card.

287
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,820
I prefer it much better than the default

288
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,140
Debian mix match it did.

289
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,140
I still think that this product has a wider ability

290
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,260
if we can just put all those tiny little pieces together

291
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,540
between the community and the businesses.

292
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,540
I think an Ubuntu install being optioned for it

293
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,180
would be just a great place for education.

294
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,660
I mean, great price point.

295
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,280
Try to put community together with something like Landscape

296
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,900
or some of the other management systems out there.

297
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,060
Like an Ubuntu 2004 machine that is managed by Landscape

298
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,780
and set up as a package for education.

299
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,240
This can knock out Chromebook.

300
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,080
Yeah, I could see that.

301
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,180
I could see that.

302
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,580
Anthony, what do you think about the price though?

303
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,700
Is this the right device for the money

304
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,980
when you could go on eBay, you could spend two to 300 bucks

305
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,700
and you could get a pretty great x86 ThinkPad?

306
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,820
Yeah, I agree.

307
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,500
I usually use an x270 for the couch machine

308
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,180
and a little remote terminal server,

309
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,540
but opening up a Pinebook with that good power efficiency

310
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,540
and brand new plastic is appealing.

311
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,380
I do like the idea of power efficiency,

312
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,300
especially for my, I'm sitting at the couch surfing machine.

313
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,940
The thing that stays in your bag all day,

314
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,820
you just know it'll be on.

315
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,340
You never know when you might need the machine

316
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,740
and the Pinebook Pro fits that.

317
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,480
Sort of the iPad roll for me right now

318
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,300
where I just need a really quick go-to,

319
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,460
always has battery life machine.

320
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,700
Colonel, you think maybe there's some concerns

321
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,180
about the power behind this thing

322
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,140
and building packages from the AUR?

323
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,980
Yeah, my only concern would be

324
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,580
if there's a lot of packages that may not be available.

325
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,900
So people build them from the AUR

326
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,640
and does the Pinebook have the horsepower

327
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,840
and the RAM and et cetera to be building those packages

328
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,580
every time you run your updates?

329
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,680
Sure, that's a good question.

330
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,820
And then Mini-Mac, you have a question too

331
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,780
that's sort of related

332
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,120
that I think Cheese could probably answer.

333
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,220
Why don't you go ahead Mini-Mac?

334
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,220
Yeah, my crucial thing on the new couch computer laptop

335
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,700
would be the speakers.

336
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,540
So just watching a YouTube video like that,

337
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,660
you need some speakers that have some quite good sounds.

338
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,980
So how are the speakers?

339
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,500
Not good at all.

340
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,220
To be quite honest.

341
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,880
Ah, that's so sad.

342
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,100
The speakers are pretty horrible.

343
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,680
There have been a few people on the forums

344
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,420
that have modded them and replaced the speakers

345
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,080
and they've gotten a few more DB out of them

346
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,860
and stuff like that, but they're still not great

347
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,500
because they are down firing too.

348
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,900
So let's say if you're relaxing with it on your lap,

349
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,900
as people do with laptops,

350
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,060
then the speakers are gonna be down firing.

351
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,900
What I normally do is I pair that

352
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,140
with a set of Bluetooth headphones

353
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,380
and I haven't had any problems in that regard.

354
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,020
But personally, another reason that I choose Manjaro

355
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,820
is simply because the availability of packages,

356
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,220
as Neil had stated, there are so many more packages

357
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,620
available in the Manjaro repos.

358
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,700
So one of the things, for example, was Telegram.

359
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,500
I could snap the Telegram down,

360
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,020
but then it was an outdated version

361
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,500
and would crash any time someone dropped a GIF

362
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,780
into a channel, so.

363
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,340
That makes it like triple annoying.

364
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,180
Yeah, exactly.

365
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,260
So you don't know if it's this new hardware

366
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,100
or what's going on.

367
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,300
So, but as soon as I switched over Manjaro

368
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,500
and then pulled down their build,

369
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,580
which is the latest build of Telegram, I had no problem.

370
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,020
So I think it's a smart decision for them

371
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,020
to use Manjaro to ship these with.

372
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,220
Especially if they're working together,

373
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,500
even any kind of degree on the phone aspect

374
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,700
of the PinePhone as well.

375
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,380
You could see sort of the cross-pollination benefits here.

376
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,260
And to Wes's original point,

377
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,140
this would be a distribution that was shipped on this

378
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,580
that I would probably keep.

379
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,700
I mean, I would absolutely love to be able

380
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,700
to just have an image I could download of Ubuntu 2004

381
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,180
and run that when that's released.

382
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,340
Oh yeah.

383
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,260
But I love Manjaro as a workstation OS,

384
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,100
especially on something like this that,

385
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,660
like Neil made the point,

386
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,220
really benefits from cutting edge upstream drivers.

387
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,580
I think it was just weird at first

388
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,220
to see an arch-based distro coming on a laptop.

389
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,580
And then I think back to those arguments

390
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,140
that we used to have about rolling versus long-term support.

391
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,420
And that version of me is like, yes.

392
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,820
Like that victory kid meme.

393
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,940
And then now the older version of me is like,

394
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,020
I don't know about this.

395
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,140
So we'll just watch where this goes.

396
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,860
But I think the one takeaway from this is it's great.

397
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,940
Actually, there's a couple of takeaways.

398
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,420
It's great for Manjaro, good on them.

399
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,860
I'm really proud might not be the right word,

400
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,740
but I am really pleased to see them continue to work

401
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,620
with different industry players

402
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,340
that seem like they have similar interests

403
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,580
as the Manjaro core audience.

404
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,420
Absolutely.

405
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,980
Very intuitive, very clever of them.

406
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,780
And it seems like a sign of maturity

407
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,300
of the project itself as well.

408
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,660
And I think all of those same things

409
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,100
can be said about the Pine folks for recognizing Manjaro

410
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,420
as a potential partner to work with.

411
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,700
It's good.

412
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,060
It's a good sign that these two,

413
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,380
I guess you could call them companies now,

414
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,540
but really it's projects, are getting their core audience.

415
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,620
And can grow together.

416
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,980
Mm-hmm.

417
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,420
Okay, now I'm actually, now I love it.

418
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,740
The worst part about this is it's going back,

419
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
I have to think about ordering one.

420
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,580
I know, yeah.

421
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,740
Cheesy, you still recommend it?

422
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,580
What do you think?

423
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,820
If you're gonna spend the money,

424
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,500
say you get a little tax return money or something,

425
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,900
would you spend it on that?

426
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,140
Yeah, if you're debating a Chromebook or a Pinebook,

427
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,420
I would say go with a Pinebook.

428
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,380
All right.

429
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,500
If you're debating a decent little ThinkPad

430
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,580
that might be a little bit over 200 bucks or a Pinebook,

431
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,860
I would say go with the ThinkPad.

432
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,700
Yeah.

433
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,540
So I have both.

434
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,660
I have a T440 ThinkPad that I use,

435
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,620
and I mainly use that for the 3D printing stuff

436
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,460
that I've been doing lately,

437
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,380
so modeling and that sort of stuff.

438
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,740
And then whenever I'm done with that,

439
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,020
that goes down and I pick up the Pinebook.

440
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,980
I get it.

441
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,100
I always like to ask Jill sort of the long-term perspective

442
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,300
because she and I have been watching this stuff for so long.

443
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,500
This seems like a pretty clever partnership,

444
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,340
doesn't it, Jill?

445
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,020
Oh, most definitely.

446
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,660
And you know, I think it's also a really good source

447
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,540
of revenue for Manjaro.

448
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,520
So it's a win-win.

449
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,360
Great point.

450
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,860
Nobody's brought up the money aspect of it,

451
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,380
but this makes the project more sustainable

452
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,220
and probably gonna sell a few Pinebooks.

453
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,580
So they're gonna make some money too.

454
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,420
Right.

455
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,860
Well, and then isn't the Manjaro also shipping

456
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,140
with some other hardware vendors

457
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,660
out of Europe right now as well?

458
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,060
Those guys are killing it.

459
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,120
Yeah, and there's more to come.

460
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,580
I just don't know if right now is the right time

461
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,460
for me to talk about it,

462
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,900
but there's more hardware in the works.

463
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,740
Oh.

464
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,220
Yeah, they got more stuff going on.

465
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,040
Yeah.

466
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,620
Let's talk about another sale though.

467
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,660
This one I'm definitely still processing.

468
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,660
And I think even the wording of the announcement

469
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,100
has my conspiracy bacon tentacles tingling.

470
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,300
I'm excited for this.

471
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,960
I got tingling tentacles, Wes.

472
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,920
NPM is joining GitHub.

473
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,420
NPM is joining GitHub.

474
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,260
There's something missing in that title, right?

475
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,220
Yeah, comma also means Microsoft.

476
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,060
Yeah.

477
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:38,060
Which immediately, now I think GitHub

478
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:42,100
has done really well under Microsoft's leadership.

479
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,060
And I think that is really,

480
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,520
I think you attribute a lot of that to Nat.

481
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,100
I think Nat has really had a steady hand with all of this.

482
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,300
And he is in a sense with this announcement

483
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,420
taking a leadership role here,

484
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,940
a very public leadership role.

485
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,500
And so I think that's part of the framing of this message.

486
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,300
Instead of saying Microsoft, they're saying GitHub,

487
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,000
because what they're really saying is Nat.

488
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,340
And that GitHub is still operating as its own

489
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,900
sort of entity within Microsoft.

490
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,240
And from some of the things I've read,

491
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,460
it sounds like if anything,

492
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,860
Microsoft has been adopting some of the GitHubisms

493
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,260
more so than the reverse.

494
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,180
Yeah, I mean, I'm well into this now.

495
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,020
And I can't sit here and think of a single thing

496
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,780
they've screwed up.

497
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,580
But I wonder if the wording of this announcement

498
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,060
isn't still trying to be super sensitive to that concern.

499
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,580
Because the idea of Microsoft owning NPM sits,

500
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,780
let's just practice for a moment.

501
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,460
Do you wanna do like a thought experiment with me

502
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,460
for a second here, Wes?

503
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,300
Yeah, let's do it.

504
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,700
Let's pretend like we could rewrite reality

505
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,700
and that we're reading an entirely different news headline.

506
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,720
You ready?

507
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,780
This is CNN Breaking News.

508
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,820
Breaking News, as we're recording, Wes,

509
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:54,260
NPM has been acquired by Microsoft.

510
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,960
Sounds a little different, doesn't it?

511
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,420
Microsoft now owns and controls NPM.

512
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,500
That sounds a little bit different.

513
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,340
It does.

514
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,820
However, when you say NPM is joining GitHub,

515
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,860
that's not so bad.

516
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,700
And I just think the wording-

517
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,020
Oh, they're teaming up, oh great.

518
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,340
The wording there is choice.

519
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,620
But I think it's pretty intentional

520
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,120
because they're trying to say,

521
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,180
look at what we've done here.

522
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,820
We've had a steady hand, we'll have a steady hand with NPM.

523
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,020
I think that's the message.

524
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,460
And for millions of developers

525
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,200
who use the public NPM registry every day,

526
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,620
there's not a lot that will change.

527
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,060
In fact, I think they'll go out of their way

528
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:30,600
to make sure what you expect to remain free stays free.

529
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,660
In fact, Nat writes on the blog,

530
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,460
our focus after the deal closes will be to,

531
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,880
we've got three items,

532
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,580
invest in registry infrastructure and platform.

533
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,320
Who doesn't like hearing that?

534
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,220
Improve the core experience.

535
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,080
He writes, we will work to improve the everyday experience

536
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,140
of developers and maintainers.

537
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,260
And number three, gotta have this,

538
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,760
gotta have this, engage with the community.

539
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,240
We will actively engage with the JavaScript community

540
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,160
to get your ideas and help us to find the future of NPM.

541
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,400
Looking further ahead, we'll integrate GitHub and NPM

542
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,440
to improve the security

543
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,520
of the open source software supply chain.

544
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,880
Okay, that sounds pretty nebulous, but I like this part.

545
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,920
And enable you to trace a change from a GitHub pull request

546
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,240
to the NPM package version that fixed it.

547
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,080
And to their credit, I mean,

548
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,400
they have been adding a lot of, you know,

549
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,960
vulnerability scanning and tools

550
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,480
to assess open source projects, which is great.

551
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,160
Yeah, I find that to be a uniquely actionable item.

552
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
In an otherwise pretty high level document.

553
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,320
Yes, and not something you generally see

554
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,920
in this type of announcement.

555
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
And that's like, this is a specific thing

556
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,400
we are going to execute on.

557
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,680
And to allow somebody like a developer

558
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,920
who is trying to figure out if this is a safe thing

559
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,400
to incorporate into an overall project,

560
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,960
to trace it all the way back to a GitHub pull request

561
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,640
to make sure that things are fixed, that's a big deal.

562
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,440
That's actually something I would love to see

563
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,280
just from a show research standpoint.

564
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,800
I mean, we know the NPM ecosystem

565
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,160
could do with some improved security.

566
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,200
Linux headlines, not show.

567
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,480
Okay, so what about paying customers of NPM?

568
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,720
Because if you remember, I mean,

569
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,240
this was a business here that got purchased.

570
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,880
They say they're investing heavily

571
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,720
in improving GitHub packages,

572
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,440
which is the package system built into GitHub.

573
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,160
Later this year, we'll enable NPM's paying customers

574
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,000
to move their private NPM packages to GitHub packages.

575
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Although they say, allowing NPM to exclusively focus

576
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,880
on being a great public registry for JavaScript.

577
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,520
So if you're a paying customer,

578
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
sounds like you're getting rolled

579
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,640
into the GitHub version of these things.

580
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,840
NPM public stand put for the time being?

581
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,320
That's how I read it.

582
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,440
So I was curious if that's how you read it.

583
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,360
I think that makes sense.

584
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,760
I think I see that all changing in about 12 months.

585
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,880
That seems like they're gonna redo all of this.

586
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,240
There's something brewing here.

587
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,080
When you look at the whole picture

588
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,240
of checking in your code, publishing somewhere,

589
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
putting it up online via Azure services,

590
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,400
there's something really kind of coalescing here

591
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,120
that I don't fully appreciate yet,

592
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,960
but I can see the edges of it.

593
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,800
I also think about this.

594
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,040
Think about outdated Internet Explorer,

595
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,120
the bad one with not supporting

596
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,760
the latest JavaScript standards

597
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,200
or any of the latest standards.

598
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,760
To now the world where Microsoft

599
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,080
like made TypeScript and owns NPM.

600
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,120
And it's like this major JavaScript player

601
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,960
and VS Code, which is a huge editor in that ecosystem.

602
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,120
Yeah.

603
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,960
Wild.

604
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,880
Yeah, it is.

605
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,760
And of course, you and I are coming off of WSL Conf

606
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,560
where we watch people write Linux applications on Windows

607
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,560
and run XFCE on top of Windows 10.

608
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,400
Crazy.

609
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,240
It really has been-

610
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,080
2020.

611
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,480
Yeah, 2020 has been nuts for us so far,

612
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,840
which we'll get more into here in just a moment.

613
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,240
I think this is one of those stories

614
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,960
I'm gonna just digest and see what happens,

615
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,440
but I would really, really appreciate

616
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,240
some sort of perspective, any perspective.

617
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,280
Really, I just wanna think about this

618
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,160
from all the angles, linuxunplugged.com slash-

619
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,000
Contact.

620
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,040
Yeah, you knew where I was going with that.

621
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,520
I'd really like to get people's input on this one.

622
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,200
Now, there's another story that I feel like in another era,

623
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,760
I would be all over this story.

624
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,080
If Unfilter was still a show,

625
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,040
this would be something that I could sit here

626
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,280
and I could just tell you everything

627
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,880
off the top of my head about this.

628
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,480
But you may have heard, quote, unquote,

629
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,280
the government is trying to ban encryption,

630
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,320
quote, end quote.

631
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,160
Have you heard that?

632
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,000
I have heard that.

633
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,080
Well, the EFF and their Action Center

634
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,800
is trying to raise the alarm

635
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,880
about the Graham Blumenthal bill,

636
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,360
which is called something ridiculous.

637
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,200
It's got a name-

638
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,040
The EARNET Act.

639
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,880
Yes, the EARNET.

640
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,080
EARNET.

641
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,040
And the high level is it, in the United States,

642
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,200
would make it mandatory for companies

643
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,880
to enable backdoors into encryption.

644
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,120
Which is something we've seen being pressed

645
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,080
time and time again.

646
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,840
You know, it comes and it goes.

647
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,200
My main concern, obviously, is the implications

648
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,920
from a security standpoint of this.

649
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,720
But secondarily, the other concern I have

650
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,400
is the conversation is within the context

651
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,720
of commercial platforms.

652
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,880
The conversation talks about iOS.

653
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,720
And Android.

654
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,560
And Google.

655
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,400
And Apple.

656
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,800
And Microsoft.

657
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,880
And them working to provide the federal government

658
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,160
with a legal means to break encryption.

659
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,000
But never in the conversation

660
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,480
is how this impacts free software.

661
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,240
How does this affect developers

662
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,480
who are writing software all over the world

663
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,000
and the majority of their users are in the United States?

664
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,480
I have extremely deep concerns

665
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,120
about how this could affect open source software.

666
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,800
And that is not part of this conversation.

667
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,560
And I think it could be a fundamental game changer

668
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,680
for free software.

669
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,400
So I will have a link in the show notes

670
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,800
for the EFF's Action Center.

671
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,080
They write, members of Congress have mounted

672
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,880
a major threat to your freedoms of speech

673
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,200
and security online.

674
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,480
Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal,

675
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,480
which Graham is a Republican,

676
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,840
Blumenthal is a Democrat, so it's, quote, bipartisan,

677
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,000
recently introduced a bill that would undermine

678
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,560
key protections for internet speech in the US.

679
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,360
It would also expose providers

680
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,240
of private messaging services,

681
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,760
like Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, et cetera,

682
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,240
to extreme legal risk,

683
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
potentially forcing them to undermine

684
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,280
their tools of security.

685
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,720
The so-called EARN-IT Act, Senate 3398,

686
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,080
is anti-speech, anti-security, anti-innovation,

687
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,320
and unnecessary.

688
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,480
Let's tell Congress to reject it.

689
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,560
I couldn't say it better myself.

690
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,480
I honestly have not been as informed on this

691
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,640
because of the crazy amount of corona news going on.

692
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,320
And, you know, that's probably the exact condition

693
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,200
they're relying on for nobody to notice this

694
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,560
and let it just sneak right through.

695
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,400
Well, if you think about it, right,

696
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,720
we'd had this conversation around,

697
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,120
between law enforcement and security experts around,

698
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,720
like, I mean, what's possible?

699
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,160
We all know that no one's gonna all follow the laws,

700
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,000
and when you break encryption,

701
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,080
it creates problems basically for everyone.

702
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,000
I don't think that changed in the last six months.

703
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,160
Right? Yeah.

704
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,720
Yeah, and it's like technology doesn't understand borders.

705
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,960
Source code doesn't necessarily appreciate

706
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,040
your silly nation-state government.

707
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,200
You fundamentally make something flawed here.

708
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,640
It makes it flawed everywhere around the world.

709
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,800
And maybe, listening to this, you think,

710
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,640
well, what's to worry about?

711
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,760
I have nothing to hide.

712
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,080
Perhaps you have full faith

713
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,320
in your United States government.

714
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,320
Congratulations, that must feel great.

715
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,560
But how do you feel about China?

716
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,400
How do you feel about Iran?

717
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,960
How do you feel about the United States, say, in 30 years?

718
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,200
Are you concerned that then it could be abused

719
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,400
in those situations?

720
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,560
If you are, then we have to do something today.

721
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,400
That's it.

722
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,760
I think, too, that, you know,

723
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,920
one of the underlying things that we haven't mentioned here

724
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,200
is the serious flaw are the people, right?

725
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,920
The people that are in control of gathering this data,

726
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,320
what prevents them from gathering data from a company

727
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,280
that's using some sort of encrypted communication?

728
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,560
You know, when they're trying to figure out,

729
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,680
should we go with Azure or should we go with AWS?

730
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,280
Well, let's tap into their private encrypted systems

731
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,440
and see what they're saying about us about the deal, right?

732
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,400
So I think that it really comes down

733
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,200
to you're giving this power now to humans

734
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,040
who are notably flawed and are going to end up using it

735
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,560
for, you know, really anything that they choose, so.

736
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
And the issue with the Earn It Act

737
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,360
is it itself does not necessarily lay out

738
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,840
the banning of encryption or any specific things like that.

739
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,240
What it does is it designates a council of 19 people,

740
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:41,160
half of which, mostly, mostly, most of it, most of it.

741
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,640
I think we should go with that, dude.

742
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,680
It's new, it's accepted, you're using it.

743
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,320
It could be my version of Nodamine, you know what I mean?

744
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,040
This is my version of that.

745
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,880
I like it.

746
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,240
So it's got 19 people on the council,

747
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,520
almost half of which are law enforcement.

748
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,360
Now here's the fun thing.

749
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,960
Two of the people on the council have tech experience.

750
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,480
Now this council will be formed.

751
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,920
It will determine a list of best practices,

752
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,800
things that remind you that you gotta think

753
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,760
about the poor children and terrorism

754
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,080
and any other kind of agenda these people wanna push.

755
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,680
And it's only two of the people on this board

756
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,040
have any technical experience at all.

757
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,840
And they will make the rules that Apple and Google

758
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,720
and anyone distributing software

759
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,240
in the United States of America

760
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
that wants to be lawful has to follow.

761
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,160
That's what's about to happen.

762
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,960
This council of 19 people,

763
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,800
and two of them are tech people,

764
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,960
are gonna decide if you can use encryption or not,

765
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,320
if this passes.

766
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,400
And we don't normally talk about this kind of stuff

767
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,120
on the show, but I can only wonder

768
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,680
what the ramifications would be for free software.

769
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,400
How does a developer in Germany navigate this?

770
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,560
I do not know.

771
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,560
And you know, it's so silly is imagine a developer

772
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,560
who is in Vancouver, Canada, or in Mexico,

773
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,160
just miles from the border.

774
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,960
And it fundamentally changes the legality

775
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
of the free software project they're working on.

776
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,360
It's so silly.

777
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,720
It is legislation of a bygone era,

778
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,920
just like Blumenthal and Graham.

779
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,760
They are of a bygone era.

780
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,920
So let's talk about something of a more modern era,

781
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,640
GNOME 3.36, which Wes and I have been using

782
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,160
for the last week, essentially via Ubuntu 2004.

783
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,440
Well, it was just so easy.

784
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,240
We loaded that up after our week with Windows.

785
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,800
And I'm gonna say as much as I can

786
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
for our review of 2004, which is not yet released,

787
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,560
but it has been wonderful.

788
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,960
Now, I'm curious, I could say a whole bunch,

789
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,200
but I'm curious what your take is

790
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,920
because you've spent a year and a half now in plasma.

791
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,160
It feels very refreshingly minimal.

792
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,320
And I like, I've sort of installed Ubuntu 2004

793
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,240
five or six times now in the past couple of weeks.

794
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,000
It's also really nice how fast I can get going

795
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,960
in that fresh install.

796
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,040
Like I tweak a couple of things,

797
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,480
I've got that down now because I've done it a few times.

798
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,200
And then I have a totally usable system.

799
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,920
So that's been nice.

800
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,000
Yeah, how fast does that feel though?

801
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,040
Super snappy, very appropriate animations

802
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,360
all over the place.

803
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,800
And that new lock screen, oh boy.

804
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,720
Oh man, the lock screen is very pro.

805
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,800
It is very, very pro.

806
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,760
I'm curious though, if you feel like it's quote unquote,

807
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,040
snappier than plasma.

808
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,000
In some areas, yes.

809
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,280
In some areas, no.

810
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,320
I will say running it on Wayland has been very nice.

811
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,160
Pretty much flawless.

812
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,080
Look at you, you're going all in now.

813
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,560
Well, I mean, that's 2004.

814
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,400
That's right.

815
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,880
Gotta find out if it'll work.

816
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,120
It's very nice.

817
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,480
GNOME 3.6 is, and as somebody who talks

818
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,320
about this stuff a lot,

819
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,040
I try to think of something new I can say,

820
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,720
but it is the best, it is the fastest release

821
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,320
of the GNOME Shell that I have ever used.

822
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,400
It is the best, it is the best version of GNOME ever.

823
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,240
It really is.

824
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,400
It simply is the best version of GNOME ever.

825
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,640
And I wish I could stop saying that in a way

826
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,440
because it's almost become cliche for me to say

827
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,080
this new release is better.

828
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,000
I feel like since GNOME 3.11, I've been saying.

829
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,280
Yeah, accurate.

830
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,120
Every release is better.

831
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,720
But they're hitting the stride.

832
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,360
The project's just doing great.

833
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,600
I gotta say, so I spent some time on the Mac

834
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,880
and I was like, oh, this is great

835
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,120
with all these third-party apps

836
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,560
and the windowing environment's very snappy.

837
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,400
Then I went to Windows and I'm like, oh boy,

838
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,520
this is a little rough, but I can understand

839
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,800
if I needed a commercial grade application,

840
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,880
I can see the appeal.

841
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,760
And now with the subsystem, it's actually livable.

842
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,640
And that's a big admission coming from me

843
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,560
because I have issues with Windows.

844
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,400
And then after all of that, on the same hardware,

845
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,640
I came back to Ubuntu 2004

846
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,400
and then latest GNOME Shell, GNOME 3.36.

847
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,720
And what you have here, without spoiling our review,

848
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,720
is the best product Canonical has ever made for the desktop

849
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,320
and the best version of GNOME Shell

850
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,200
that has ever been released.

851
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,920
And those two things came together in one product.

852
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,360
It is the best release of Ubuntu ever.

853
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,000
And I have been using it since the very first release.

854
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,720
I think we were impressed just from the moment

855
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,000
we booted up the flash drive.

856
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,920
Absolutely, and now I have been using it for a week

857
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,400
and I am going to just keep it on there.

858
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,600
I just love it, it looks beautiful.

859
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,760
GNOME has come so far.

860
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,440
You were mentioning the system settings,

861
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,280
how great that is now.

862
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,880
Oh, the system settings are beautiful.

863
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,280
I was so surprised, especially coming from Plasma.

864
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,720
I was like, it's all in one place, it's unified,

865
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,520
it's sleek, and it's just as easy to use.

866
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,040
How long have I wanted just one spot

867
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,720
where I just click the dark mode?

868
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,800
Just click dark and everything.

869
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,240
It doesn't have to be like a special theme

870
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,000
where I go change the GTK theme and the Shell theme

871
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,760
and the cursor theme.

872
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,520
It's just dark mode, boom, and everything switches

873
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,640
and it's elegant and it's refined and it's well done.

874
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,000
And then you combine that with the just incredible

875
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,320
performance of GNOME Shell 3.36

876
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,760
and the new updates they have made to it,

877
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,520
like my favorite is do not disturb mode

878
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,280
in the notifications, hell a frickin' loo-ya.

879
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,440
It is by far the best version I've ever used

880
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,360
and I enjoyed every moment of using it.

881
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,120
And I was legitimately a little worried

882
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,520
after really enjoying the Mac, not really liking Windows,

883
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,600
I was like, what if I switched to GNOME Shell again

884
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,360
and Ubuntu and I hate it?

885
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,760
What if I don't enjoy it?

886
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,440
What does that mean?

887
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,760
I gotta say.

888
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,840
Not a problem for today.

889
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,360
Brilliant, brilliant, and I don't do as Chris does,

890
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,080
but I'm gonna just stick with this release

891
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,040
even though it's not done yet.

892
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,880
I'm gonna leave it on this machine.

893
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,860
The only downside was their cool ZFS automatic

894
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,940
partitioner roofing totally has to re-wipe the drive.

895
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,660
So no more Windows on there, had to give up Windows.

896
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,120
I was gonna try to dual boot that S,

897
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,720
try that out for a little while so I could keep playing

898
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,320
with Windows Terminal and subsystem,

899
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,440
but to have all the fancy automatic snapshots.

900
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,360
Hey, you got snapshots, who cares about Windows?

901
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,760
CFS stuff, I was like, yeah,

902
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,080
it's not worth keeping Windows.

903
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,320
So I had to wipe the whole drive and put Ubuntu on there,

904
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,980
but it is great.

905
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:16,040
And the upgrade is worth it for the lock screen alone.

906
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,760
And think about, when have I ever said that?

907
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,680
My favorite part was that they finally made it

908
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,320
so you could suspend without having to know

909
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,640
the magic key combo to get it to show up in the menu.

910
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,640
I think you just had to hold shift,

911
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,480
but now it has just an option to suspend.

912
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,300
I think it was alt.

913
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,140
I don't know if it was shift.

914
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:29,980
I think it was alt.

915
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,920
See, I don't even know.

916
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,440
And I suspend my laptop all the time.

917
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,800
So I will admit, it took me a really long time

918
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,640
to realize that was there.

919
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,600
Yes, I think that's true.

920
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,960
It was just not accessible.

921
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,400
I just would close the lid.

922
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,000
But then I was on the desktop and I'm like,

923
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,760
well, now, what if I want to suspend?

924
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,320
And I'm Googling it, I'm like, oh, right, okay.

925
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,600
Yeah, now it is right there.

926
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,480
The whole thing's just, it's so great.

927
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,880
It's so great to see it coming along.

928
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,400
So if you haven't yet, go give the live environment a try.

929
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,660
Go give it a try.

930
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,240
Even if you're a longtime Plasma user,

931
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,200
like old Westpain here.

932
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,040
Go give it a go.

933
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,800
I know, I guess I'm back in a gnome for a while.

934
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,720
Maybe, maybe.

935
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,540
You know, at the end of the day,

936
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,680
you just want to get your work done

937
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,020
and your Plasma environment is looking good.

938
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,860
It's all set up.

939
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,960
It works like it hasn't failed you yet.

940
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,080
So I don't know.

941
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,560
But I want to be on 2004.

942
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,320
It's just, I can feel it.

943
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,160
It's a good one.

944
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,400
You think it's worth the whole reload?

945
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,280
Oh yeah, it might be.

946
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,120
I think it is.

947
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,940
That old ZFS too.

948
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,780
Yeah.

949
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,620
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

950
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,800
Well, how about just a little brief housekeeping

951
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,000
before we get into the rest of the show?

952
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,240
That's probably a responsible thing to do.

953
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
We should clean up around here.

954
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,060
I agree.

955
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,220
Well, we just released a behind the scenes

956
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,220
of Linux Unplugged on Jupiter Extras.

957
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,040
If you go to extras.show slash 64,

958
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,480
we looked back at episode one

959
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,160
and then went over the arc of the show

960
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,780
and essentially ended up making fun of me the entire time.

961
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,120
I was so bad.

962
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,300
We played an old sponsor.

963
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,920
I didn't even know we had that sponsor.

964
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,320
That's, it was so embarrassing.

965
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,600
It was a different you really, Chris.

966
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,680
Sure sounds like it.

967
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,920
Yeah, I know.

968
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,200
I sound 10 years younger.

969
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,440
Anyways, if you're curious what goes

970
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,600
into making Linux Unplugged, extras.show slash 64,

971
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,920
we released Linux Unplugged behind the scenes.

972
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,600
Also, if you're, maybe you're at home now.

973
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,280
Maybe you got a little extra time during the day.

974
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,060
You could listen to our show in the background.

975
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,560
Would you like to know when we're live?

976
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,140
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

977
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,680
converts it to your local time.

978
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,240
jblive.tv is where you watch us.

979
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,400
It's more fun live.

980
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,800
Now you heard me mention Linux Headline,

981
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,320
linuxheadlines.show, three minutes or less every weekday,

982
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,960
and we give you just the news you need to know about.

983
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,320
I'm constantly discovering stuff

984
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,080
through headlines that I wanted to know.

985
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:44,080
And then officially, no Linux Fest Northwest this year.

986
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,440
Whew, that hurts, that hurts.

987
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,600
And we'll let you know when we know what they're doing.

988
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,300
There has been some rumblings of maybe working

989
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,280
with some of the speakers to record their talks

990
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,660
and post them online.

991
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,560
If they do that, we'll keep you posted.

992
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,040
We'll let you know what's going on there.

993
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,360
And then last but not least,

994
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,480
that Telegram group, 1,700 users strong.

995
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,320
Can't stop it.

996
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,620
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram

997
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,000
to get in on the conversation,

998
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,380
the persistent conversation that continues

999
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,880
even after the show.

1000
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,760
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram for all of that.

1001
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,800
All right, Mr. Westpain.

1002
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,800
Well, we had the opportunity to attend WSL Conf last week.

1003
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:34,160
When we recorded episode 344, it was in the midway point.

1004
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,920
We were actually breaking from the conference

1005
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,200
to record the show.

1006
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,740
Now it's all done.

1007
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:42,200
And the thing that is particularly unique about WSL Conf

1008
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,040
is A, first WSL Conf ever.

1009
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,880
Ever.

1010
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,640
And that was kind of a unique opportunity

1011
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,720
for a bunch of Linux users to show up at Microsoft.

1012
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,160
And B, it was one of the first tech conferences

1013
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,920
that had to pivot to an online format

1014
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,640
because of the developing COVID-19 situation.

1015
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,440
Right at the start of this wave, yeah.

1016
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,320
Yeah.

1017
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,520
And so not only was having WSL Conf for the first time ever

1018
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,720
an interesting thing worth talking about,

1019
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,120
but being the first tech conference

1020
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,000
to have to go online only,

1021
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,660
also was a very interesting kind of,

1022
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,240
let's talk about this moment.

1023
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,520
So we invited two different individuals on the show.

1024
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,360
Sohini.

1025
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,160
I'm Sohini Bianca Roy.

1026
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,940
I am a product manager at Canonical.

1027
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,640
And returning to the show, Hayden.

1028
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,600
Hi, I'm Hayden Barnes.

1029
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,160
I'm a senior developer advocate at Canonical.

1030
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,400
And they were fundamental to pulling off WSL Conf

1031
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,520
and converting it to an online conference.

1032
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,960
Now you'll note, they're both Canonical employees.

1033
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,200
They were working in partnership with Microsoft to do this,

1034
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,160
but this was a community-driven event.

1035
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,920
And they were the spear of that community.

1036
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,400
And so we wanted to have both of them on the show

1037
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,560
to talk about some of the dynamics of that,

1038
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,800
what that was like to kind of reach the point

1039
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,440
where we're gonna have a conference

1040
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,480
about the Windows subsystem for Linux.

1041
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,320
Really, why?

1042
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,400
Sponsored by Canonical?

1043
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,760
Yeah, like this isn't a Microsoft thing that's happening.

1044
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,680
Like what's going on here?

1045
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,180
And having attended it, feeling like we learned something,

1046
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,800
it was worth having these individuals on

1047
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,360
to really kind of chat about this

1048
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,680
and maybe even get some advice for future conferences

1049
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,560
that are also going virtual.

1050
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,720
So Hayden and Sohini are joining us now

1051
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,840
to talk about WSL Conf.

1052
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,160
And I, as an attendee, thought we should probably start

1053
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,160
at the very beginning and ask, why WSL Conf now?

1054
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,600
Sohini, do you wanna start with that one?

1055
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Sure, I'd love to.

1056
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,840
I think it actually started, well, it started in 2016,

1057
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,200
really, when Microsoft announced at Build

1058
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,080
that they were going to invest in a partnership with us

1059
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,360
for Bash on Ubuntu for Windows.

1060
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,960
And now here we are many years later,

1061
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,920
but the community around it is just growing.

1062
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,800
And we've seen so many people who are thanking us

1063
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,360
right and left for supporting this.

1064
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,640
And we decided to get together a little bit

1065
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,040
to see what they're up to,

1066
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,520
to figure out how we can better support them.

1067
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,600
But it's also, they're really innovating

1068
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,360
really impressively in the space.

1069
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,720
And I think there was so much that we could have learned

1070
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,800
from our open source partners.

1071
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,080
And we wanted to get everyone together

1072
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,160
to figure out what happens next.

1073
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,120
Hayden, it also feels like the impending official release

1074
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,240
of WSL2 played a role in the timing of this.

1075
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,800
Certainly that demonstrated momentum in the platform.

1076
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,800
We announced WSL Conf in the fall after WSL2 was announced

1077
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,080
at Build.

1078
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,440
So that certainly kind of rolled into the momentum

1079
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,480
and had something to do with the timing.

1080
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,200
Yeah, well, and watching a lot of the presentations,

1081
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,560
it really seemed like a lot of it was individuals

1082
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,920
that are heavily using the subsystem,

1083
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,160
digesting how WSL2 will change workflows

1084
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,200
or improve workflows.

1085
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,280
And that was like a big part of the conference.

1086
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,240
Absolutely.

1087
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,880
WSL2 unlocks a lot of new possibilities for developers

1088
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,240
and with that full Linux application support on Windows.

1089
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,560
So I have a question for both of you.

1090
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,520
So Sahini, let's start with you.

1091
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,760
Have you observed much pushback or skepticism

1092
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,960
from the community around Canonical working

1093
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,840
with Microsoft on this?

1094
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,560
Because I get a sense of pressure

1095
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,000
from a portion of our audience

1096
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,480
that it's a little suspicious, the whole subsystem thing.

1097
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,720
And so I imagine if you're heavily involved with this,

1098
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,560
it may have come your way.

1099
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,680
I'm curious about that.

1100
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,040
Yeah, I think we live in a community

1101
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,200
that just loves the authenticity of open source

1102
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,080
and community driven activity.

1103
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,000
So it feels natural to be suspicious

1104
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,200
when companies are working together

1105
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,320
to build something that affects the community in this way.

1106
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,320
But I think all I see is the potential

1107
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,720
for our resources combined together.

1108
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,880
So I'm hoping that when we continue to build

1109
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,120
these community events,

1110
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:04,440
that we are really showing how much the community impacts

1111
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,080
how we build what we're doing together.

1112
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,360
And I don't know if that directly answers the question.

1113
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,640
So feel free to push on me a bit there.

1114
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,480
I get what you're saying because I think I observe that.

1115
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,400
It's sort of what I observe is there's people

1116
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,760
that are getting the work done

1117
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,720
that are seeing this as another tool

1118
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,640
that they're going to use.

1119
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,000
And then there's people that are just expressing

1120
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,240
an observational concern and maybe are not directly involved

1121
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,320
with the actual work getting done.

1122
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,880
Do you know what I mean?

1123
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,440
It's fair.

1124
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,600
So I might let Hayden push back

1125
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,760
on any additional perspective there.

1126
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,280
But I think we're just excited to keep working together

1127
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,800
because we just keep hearing so much great feedback

1128
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,720
from clients who are just excited

1129
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,080
about what we've been put out there.

1130
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,080
So I think I'm holding on to the positivity

1131
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,280
and I'm going to keep doing great work for everybody else.

1132
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,120
Good for you.

1133
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,680
There was a lot of excitement about things

1134
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,520
at the conference.

1135
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,840
So clearly people want to get work done.

1136
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,960
I think that is just the way you get it go forward

1137
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,160
is you just focus on the people

1138
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,000
that are getting the work done.

1139
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,600
And Hayden, I'm curious on your observations

1140
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,960
on concerns or suspicions or your overall thoughts on it.

1141
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,840
We've talked about this in the past

1142
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,280
and there's a certain segment of the Linux community

1143
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,440
that is going to be resistant,

1144
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,760
if not a little upset by what we're doing.

1145
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,760
And I think the vast majority of open source contributors

1146
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,280
understand that there's a role for community,

1147
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,840
there's a role for corporations.

1148
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,240
And we really tried to balance that at WSL Conf.

1149
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,280
What you didn't see is that all the parties working on that

1150
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,480
took a lot of steps to make sure

1151
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,600
that that remained an independent community event.

1152
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,240
And that's what we're focusing on.

1153
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:56,240
So the concern that Microsoft is somehow going to influence

1154
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,120
how we do things here at Ubuntu is just not founded.

1155
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:05,720
Yeah, it's sort of like implying that digital ocean

1156
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,520
is impacting the way that Ubuntu images are created.

1157
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,520
It's another actually I think very clever target for Ubuntu.

1158
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,640
And I think you guys are going at it

1159
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,880
in a really kind of aggressive way,

1160
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,160
which I congratulate you for.

1161
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,600
So let's pivot a little bit to the actual event itself.

1162
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,720
Before we get to the big change to virtual,

1163
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,240
I'm not sure who might have the most experience,

1164
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,520
but I'd love to know what it was like

1165
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,600
interfacing with Microsoft to set up space

1166
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,800
on their own campus for a Linux event.

1167
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,320
A lot of the images where Linux arrives at Microsoft

1168
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,640
and it felt fun and unique and it felt like a real moment.

1169
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,280
Microsoft actually sponsors reactor spaces.

1170
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,880
And I think there's about seven or eight throughout the world

1171
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,800
and open source projects and communities

1172
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,760
can reserve those spaces free of charge.

1173
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,440
And they let us reserve a space for two whole days

1174
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,360
and that's open to meetups, user groups,

1175
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,000
other small conferences.

1176
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,680
So they were very welcoming

1177
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,680
and opened their doors to us and hosted us.

1178
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,840
And we were appreciative of that.

1179
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,040
They did a lot of work for us that we ended up,

1180
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,600
of course, not having to rely on,

1181
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,240
but we still, we made the best of it.

1182
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,480
And we look forward to having an in-person event

1183
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,480
down the line.

1184
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,120
Yeah, I could see it still,

1185
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,200
it seems like the virtual one was pretty successful.

1186
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,560
So I could definitely see that happening.

1187
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,760
Let's talk about the internal decision process

1188
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,520
that must've just been-

1189
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,360
Couldn't have been easy.

1190
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,040
It must've been super hard.

1191
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,800
So, and especially the timing of this whole COVID-19 stuff

1192
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,400
is this was a few weeks ago

1193
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,560
where this discussion must've started.

1194
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,880
Now it seems inevitable from where we sit now,

1195
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,680
but how did this begin?

1196
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,280
And how difficult was that conversation?

1197
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,320
And really kind of at the end of it,

1198
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,240
ultimately what made the decision to go virtual?

1199
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,520
You know, with toilet paper,

1200
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,560
a highly coveted item and quarantine memes

1201
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,640
just all over my social media,

1202
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,720
it seems kind of like you said,

1203
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,960
inevitable and obvious

1204
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,200
that we would have switched to a virtual event.

1205
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,960
But if I take a moment to go back to the mentality

1206
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,960
of March 2nd, which was, you know, eight days

1207
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,240
before our conference was supposed to happen,

1208
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,560
the mentality was a little uncertain.

1209
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,440
I remember even texting Hayden the weekend before

1210
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,480
being like, it's 80% sure we're doing this right in person.

1211
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,760
And that morning Seattle King County Public Health

1212
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,560
and Communications leadership came out

1213
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,880
and they actually said,

1214
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,200
you know, we are not recommending

1215
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,480
widespread cancellations of gatherings or schools.

1216
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,160
KubeCon sent an email saying,

1217
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,160
we're definitely going forward.

1218
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,160
Emerald City Comic Con, which is obviously in Seattle,

1219
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,800
said they were going forward.

1220
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,320
That decision switched March 6th,

1221
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,280
but things changed really quickly.

1222
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,760
And we, I think, just had a conversation together

1223
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,520
and we were like, well, we take the risk

1224
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,360
of having people come over,

1225
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,760
maybe their visas being denied,

1226
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,880
maybe people getting stuck in Seattle or Redmond.

1227
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,760
And then the risk of further infection

1228
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,480
for people becoming hosts of this virus

1229
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,920
was that risk worth the collaboration that we could achieve

1230
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,760
and some of the melding of the minds

1231
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,680
that we could have achieved

1232
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,120
in that personal, intimate environment in Redmond.

1233
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,240
And we decided that we could switch

1234
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,360
the intention of the event, make it virtual,

1235
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,960
expand access to people, get the word out

1236
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,160
about what people are doing with WSL,

1237
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,680
get that energy, and then reschedule

1238
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,920
for that in-person event for later in the fall.

1239
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,360
So that was really tough

1240
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,680
and we had to kind of change our mentalities.

1241
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,160
We had been working towards this event for months

1242
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,760
and it was so exciting to finally be able to meet

1243
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,640
all these people we've been chatting with online forever.

1244
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,200
I feel like one of our presenters

1245
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,520
is one of my best friends now

1246
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,920
because we're just constantly in contact now.

1247
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,880
That it was a hard decision,

1248
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,320
but I'm excited again that we were able to expand that access

1249
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,440
the way that we did.

1250
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,120
Yeah, and having attended the virtual conference,

1251
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,640
I expected it to be much rougher, honestly,

1252
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,000
because of the last minute nature

1253
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,560
of having to make this pivot.

1254
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,120
And it sounded like there was even a change out

1255
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,680
of which technology platform was gonna be used to doing it.

1256
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,120
That must have been a complete scramble.

1257
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:17,960
Oh gosh, yeah.

1258
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,720
There were three really critical pieces

1259
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,400
that we had to be really strategic about.

1260
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,280
One was just the presenters.

1261
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,240
We wanted to make sure they were comfortable

1262
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,600
and confident in presenting to a now different kind

1263
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,840
of audience, a different cadence, different tempo.

1264
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,040
So we had presenters come in.

1265
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,240
We did one-on-ones with a lot of presenters

1266
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,000
and making sure their audio was good.

1267
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,800
They felt comfortable with all of the new technology.

1268
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,840
And in one of those sessions,

1269
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,240
we were trying out Microsoft Teams

1270
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,000
and some folks just, we had kind of unexplainable issues,

1271
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,720
things that we weren't able to pinpoint.

1272
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,720
And I'm sure Microsoft Teams had a little bit of a backlog.

1273
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,480
And we had three business days to make the switch.

1274
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,600
And we realized on the Friday before our event

1275
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,640
that Microsoft Teams, there were just too many glitches

1276
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,600
and the risk was too high.

1277
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,640
We just, we still wanted it to be a really smooth event,

1278
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,880
not filled with mic taps and oh, you know,

1279
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,280
forgot to install something.

1280
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,280
So it was a tough decision going away from Microsoft Teams

1281
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,160
but we already had a relationship with BlueJeans

1282
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,760
and we were already set up to go

1283
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,480
with a pretty large event through BlueJeans.

1284
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,240
And we figured that would be the right step

1285
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,520
for us at that time.

1286
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,640
You both were very active in the community

1287
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,040
during all of this, answering questions from attendees.

1288
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,440
Hayden, I'm curious if you have any lessons learned

1289
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,680
from replicating the hallway track in a virtual conference

1290
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,200
or any other thoughts on lessons learned from both of you

1291
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,080
but we'll start with Hayden here

1292
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,600
because a lot of things are switching virtual.

1293
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,400
It sounds like our beloved Linux Fest Northwest

1294
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,840
is gonna go at some version of this.

1295
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,080
What can we pass on to them?

1296
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,480
We felt like trailblazers here

1297
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,400
because not only are we a WSL conference

1298
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,840
but as far as I know,

1299
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,480
we're one of the first open source conferences

1300
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,160
to pivot this quickly to a virtual event.

1301
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,280
Some of the lessons that I've taken away.

1302
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,960
So for example, we had a round of testing with Teams

1303
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,720
with our presenters and we identified some issues

1304
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,160
and we worked through those issues

1305
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,720
and then we had a second round of testing

1306
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,920
and then we determined that our solutions

1307
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,480
to those issues were not effective.

1308
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,400
And that's when we made our pivot.

1309
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,400
Had I had the advantage of the perspective that I have now,

1310
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:44,600
we would have engaged Teams sooner rather than later.

1311
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,120
And I will say from now on for any in-person event,

1312
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,160
I will always have, how do we pivot this

1313
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,520
to a virtual event in the back of my mind?

1314
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,800
Because you never really plan

1315
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,040
for a worldwide global viral pandemic.

1316
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,800
You sure don't.

1317
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,560
So we plan for a lot of things

1318
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,640
and we had a lot of great things lined up

1319
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,120
but honestly, this one caught us by surprise.

1320
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,680
And I think moving forward,

1321
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,800
there's gonna be a whole proliferation of tools

1322
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,760
and best practices kind of coming out

1323
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,760
of the next few weeks.

1324
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,320
I think if I look at some of the things that I've built

1325
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,400
that I'm most proud of, they've been over a beer

1326
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,400
or over dinner or some weird offhand exchange

1327
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,160
with people that I met at a conference

1328
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,560
or people I met unintentionally or something like that.

1329
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,200
So having that backroom kind of interaction,

1330
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,480
having some kind of way to network

1331
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,760
with folks that you're meeting was so important

1332
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,960
because I wanted to still create that aspect of networking,

1333
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,400
of connection, of jokes,

1334
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,200
of some personal human interaction from a virtual event.

1335
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,680
And so we had a few polls, we had the Telegram channel

1336
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,520
and I think those were good starts.

1337
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,360
If I were to think about any future virtual events,

1338
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:10,200
I'd want to maybe facilitate maybe like topics

1339
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,520
that people can sign up for in small groups

1340
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,560
and just share things that they're working on

1341
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,200
or ask questions in a smaller controlled environment

1342
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,240
so people feel more comfortable engaging

1343
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,880
and sharing what they're up to.

1344
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,080
Because I think presenting or being a presenter

1345
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,120
is much harder than networking

1346
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,080
or having these side conversations, if that follows.

1347
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:31,920
Yeah, it does.

1348
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,760
And maybe facilitating little virtual birds

1349
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,880
of a feather type sessions

1350
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,520
that seem to be popular at events.

1351
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,720
As great as Telegram can be,

1352
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,200
you often have the loudest and most communicative folks

1353
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,160
sort of dominate there.

1354
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,560
So yeah, smaller sessions.

1355
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,720
Sounds like good lessons learned,

1356
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,440
but I mean, really hats off,

1357
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,080
I expected it to be so much rougher

1358
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,600
and the core value of the event was truly there.

1359
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,440
It really was, it was a great conference.

1360
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,280
I feel like it shifted my whole perspective

1361
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,880
on the subsystem for Linux

1362
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,200
and maybe kind of appreciate the fact

1363
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,160
that ultimately it's gonna mean more Linux applications

1364
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,640
and more things written for the Linux platform

1365
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,760
and more people learning Linux commands

1366
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,080
and Linux syntaxes

1367
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,920
and ultimately it's gonna be a good thing for Linux.

1368
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,720
Absolutely, I think Hayden and I when we,

1369
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,960
our first check-in together was what do we want

1370
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,800
out of all of this?

1371
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,560
And it was Linux for everybody.

1372
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,640
And I think WSL has been a great way for us

1373
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,360
to expand that mission, that project.

1374
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,200
Absolutely.

1375
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,520
We just got, Microsoft just announced today

1376
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,960
that they've passed 1 billion Windows 10 devices.

1377
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,360
And we see that as 1 billion potential WSL users

1378
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,040
to get them into the Linux ecosystem

1379
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,800
and trained on those Linux skills.

1380
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,280
And contributing to the code, open source.

1381
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,040
Let's get more, let's get more.

1382
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,880
Boy, I couldn't say it better myself.

1383
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,400
Well, thank you both very much.

1384
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,320
Thank you for the great event

1385
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,240
and thanks for coming on and telling us a little bit

1386
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,560
of the behind the scenes from it.

1387
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,600
Thanks for having us.

1388
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,080
It's been our pleasure, thank you so much.

1389
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,120
I won't lie, it's not quite the same

1390
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,200
not being there in person.

1391
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,280
And as we were wrapping up that conversation,

1392
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,960
my thought was I wish I would have been able

1393
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,800
to have this exact conversation in person with them.

1394
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,880
Oh yeah, I was really looking forward to meeting Hayden.

1395
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,720
Yeah, but at the same time,

1396
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,920
the core thing was actually still very useful.

1397
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,200
I attended this thing and I learned something.

1398
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,640
And if that is something,

1399
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,480
like that's a decent return on my investment of time.

1400
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,680
Well, and I think they both talked about it there,

1401
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,080
recognizing right away that you had to approach this thing

1402
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,960
from a totally different angle and philosophy

1403
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,560
about like what you were building.

1404
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,200
And I think that helped make it a success

1405
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,360
because it wasn't trying to be a physical event.

1406
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,920
It really was a virtual event to teach

1407
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,720
and get the word out about WSL.

1408
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,640
It's also a lot more possible when you can leverage tools

1409
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,120
like BlueJeans and Telegram and Twitter

1410
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,760
to kind of get the word out about a very changing event.

1411
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,360
But if they were to say, hey, you know what,

1412
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,520
we've decided to have a September or October

1413
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,520
WSL Conf in person, I'd go.

1414
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,360
Yeah.

1415
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,840
It was sort of perfect timing

1416
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,360
since we were running Windows 10 as well

1417
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,200
and using the new terminal and using the subsystem.

1418
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,600
So we were kind of hip to everything they were talking about.

1419
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,440
Oh man.

1420
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,200
Ah, all right.

1421
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,000
Well, how about we do a little epics

1422
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,120
before we get out of here?

1423
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,800
We've got two for you this week.

1424
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,600
Number one is something that I think might be useful

1425
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,320
for those of you who are working from home

1426
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,840
and need to manage a VPN

1427
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,080
and wanna do something at the network level,

1428
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,360
or maybe it's just time to try out WireGuard.

1429
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,680
Friends, check out PyVPN,

1430
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:33,360
the simplest VPN installer designed for Raspberry Pis.

1431
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,760
Of course you'd like this.

1432
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,720
WireGuard.

1433
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,160
He just wanted an excuse to get another pie

1434
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,280
stuck in your IV somewhere.

1435
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,120
Exactly.

1436
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,040
And say WireGuard, you know,

1437
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,080
whenever I have an opportunity to say WireGuard.

1438
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,800
WireGuard, WireGuard.

1439
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,720
And it also actually supports OpenVPN as well,

1440
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,240
which turns out people still use.

1441
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,960
But this is kind of nice, right?

1442
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,360
It's OpenVPN or WireGuard on Raspbian.

1443
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,440
And it just walks you through all of it.

1444
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,320
Really simple.

1445
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,200
You can just, if you want,

1446
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,120
you can just curl a command,

1447
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,120
pipe it right into Bash,

1448
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,680
and you're off to the races.

1449
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,960
I only laugh because what could go wrong

1450
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,600
with those kinds of approaches.

1451
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,520
But it's a really neat idea for network level VPN.

1452
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,640
And seeing WireGuard get one step closer to implementation,

1453
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,480
you know, to make it a little bit easier to use WireGuard.

1454
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,760
This is more of that tooling on top to help it easy,

1455
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,600
make it easy.

1456
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,560
That's gonna make WireGuard magic when that happens.

1457
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,200
And this is one step towards that.

1458
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,880
It's when you can just forget that it's there at all.

1459
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,960
Yeah, kind of like, is it, what was the subspace?

1460
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,360
The application to...

1461
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,800
You know, there's a couple other ones now.

1462
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,640
Oh yeah?

1463
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,480
We should give them a try.

1464
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,320
Oh yeah?

1465
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,280
I'd like to because now that I've been like reloading

1466
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,760
all my systems, I don't have like any of my WireGuard

1467
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,600
stuff set up.

1468
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,520
Yeah, we should fix that.

1469
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,360
We should totally fix that.

1470
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,320
But Cheesy, you also have something for the folks

1471
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,360
that might be working at home

1472
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,640
and suffer with RSI like I do.

1473
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,760
It's called Break Timer.

1474
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,760
Yeah, so breaktimer.app is a great open source,

1475
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,920
basically break timer is exactly what it is.

1476
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,040
It's available for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

1477
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,640
So if you're working at home and you're just glued

1478
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,400
to your screen, instead of getting up and taking a break,

1479
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,520
well, this is a super simple app that'll help you,

1480
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,480
that'll give you reminders to go take a break.

1481
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,280
So you can skip the reminders if you'd like.

1482
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,960
One of the things that I thought was really neat

1483
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,840
that I haven't seen some of these other apps do

1484
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,600
is the idle rest.

1485
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,320
So if there's no activity going on,

1486
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,140
you're not moving your mouse, you're not typing anything,

1487
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:34,800
the timer will restart itself

1488
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,320
whenever you get back to your machine.

1489
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,040
So say if you took your break,

1490
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,160
if you set your break for two minutes or whatever,

1491
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,960
and you come back in five minutes,

1492
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,680
your timer won't automatically start,

1493
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,240
your timer will start again

1494
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,040
as soon as you start being active on your machine.

1495
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,880
So really cool, really simple little app,

1496
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,000
you know, great looking little UI.

1497
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,040
You can schedule your work hours

1498
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,740
so it won't bug you when you're gaming on the weekends

1499
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:02,560
or something like that, but nice.

1500
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:05,400
I like that idle timer detection, that's clever.

1501
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,480
And of course it's GPL3, which is nice.

1502
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,360
It seems like just enough of a tool, you know,

1503
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,200
not too much, but just something to help you keep track

1504
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,000
and remind you to go stretch for a while.

1505
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,040
Yeah, I actually find this really useful when I'm editing.

1506
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,600
Yeah, that's an especially repetitive activity.

1507
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,120
Yeah, I get in the zone, I forget to take a break.

1508
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,560
I can imagine it's probably similar for developers.

1509
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,780
You get in the zone, you're really in the flow.

1510
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:26,620
You don't want to stop.

1511
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,080
That's the last thing you want to do is stop, yeah.

1512
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,160
And you can also have the notification be just,

1513
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,200
you know, a normal notification,

1514
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,520
or you can have it actually fill out your entire screen

1515
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,200
to say, start your break now, fool.

1516
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,600
And of course you can set your text as well, so.

1517
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,340
I would just go with the built-in notifications, you know,

1518
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,080
but I do like the full screen is like,

1519
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,680
if you really want to be heavy handed about it,

1520
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,840
be your own boss, you know?

1521
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,400
Good, go tell future self, do this.

1522
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,400
I'm making the rules.

1523
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,800
Yeah.

1524
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,600
I think that is actually a really good idea.

1525
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,800
So it's called Break Timer.

1526
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:02,080
So those are two picks for you, PyVPN and Break Timer.

1527
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,960
And of course, we'll have links to those and everything

1528
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,920
we've talked about at linuxunplug.com slash 345.

1529
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,920
And we'd love to have your feedback and ideas,

1530
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,960
linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1531
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,200
And join us in that ongoing conversation

1532
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:20,000
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash telegram.

1533
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,800
Anything you want to plug there, Mr. Westpain?

1534
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,160
Why don't you check out techsnap.systems?

1535
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,200
Wes and Jim Salter from Ars Technica breaking down things

1536
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,000
twice a month at techsnap.systems.

1537
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,040
I'll plug chrislast.com slash consulting.

1538
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,040
The hardest thing about launching a podcast now

1539
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,560
is actually making a podcast that stands out.

1540
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,800
I'm taking my 10-plus years of experience

1541
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,480
and helping people with their shows

1542
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,680
at chrislast.com slash consulting.

1543
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,840
Check that out.

1544
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,040
Of course, the show is live on Tuesdays.

1545
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,640
Join us live.

1546
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,000
Makes the show.

1547
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,760
Makes the show.

1548
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,440
Great mumble, great chat room, the best.

1549
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,600
People tell me Linux Unplugged has the best.

1550
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,800
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for your local time.

1551
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,900
And jblive.tv is where you can go to get the embedded

1552
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,680
chat and the video.

1553
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:10,680
The audio, of course, released later at linuxunplug.com.

1554
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:15,880
The cleaned up, proper edition that has 99.9%

1555
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,680
of the viewer and listenership is at linuxunplug.com.

1556
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,560
But if you want a little extra fun, that's the live stream.

1557
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:23,800
Either way, we appreciate you.

1558
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,560
Thanks for joining us.

1559
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,280
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1560
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:42,500
So until then, have a great week.

1561
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:05,640
You know, just something that's really cool about that Pi VPN, I don't know if you guys

1562
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:12,600
noticed, but apparently it also works on Amazon's free tier using Ubuntu or Debian.

1563
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,600
So if you're-

1564
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,600
That's adorable.

1565
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,880
Yeah, if you need that AWS free tier, set you up some Ubuntu, some Debian, throw some

1566
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:22,300
Pi VPN on top, man, you got you a good meal.

1567
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:25,960
You could do like a cooking show version of putting services together.

1568
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:35,560
If you take a dash of Ansible, with a little sprinkle of Ansible, maybe a dash of salt.

1569
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,040
No Ansible is the recipe, of course, right?

1570
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,840
Well, you use your Ansible, you make sure your thing has a dash of salt in it just to,

1571
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,800
you know, make sure everything's all gravy.

1572
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:51,640
And I'm curious, can we get like just, can I get a sample consulting tip for free from

1573
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,640
Chris Les?

1574
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,640
Yeah, absolutely.

1575
01:01:53,640 --> 01:02:00,560
What would be your free giveaway, like free trial, click on my link, and this is what

1576
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,560
you get.

1577
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,560
Don't launch a podcast.

1578
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:08,080
I think that's a great idea.

1579
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,080
But how about cheesy?

1580
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:12,920
I mean, if I was going to like consult with you, you know, so you and I are going to have

1581
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,920
a call.

1582
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,960
The way it works is, of course, is first, if you had a podcast, I get links from you

1583
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,320
and I do like a full review.

1584
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,320
I'd listen to your show, I look at your site, I look at how you distribute the podcast,

1585
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,560
I look at your feed, I look at your social presence, I look at your show notes, I look

1586
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,080
at how you get audience feedback.

1587
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,280
I mean, I go all in like, like, you know, I would do for one of our shows.

1588
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,280
And then we have the call.

1589
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,560
And I tell you what you're doing right, I tell you what you're doing wrong.

1590
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:38,800
But for you, what I would tell you is, well, number one, you've got a great design sense.

1591
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,120
So you could really launch something that has a real visual style.

1592
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:47,280
But secondarily, I think you could clearly own that beer slash Linux space, you know,

1593
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,660
the Venn diagram where beer and Linux cross, you could completely own that market.

1594
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:55,120
And if you launched a podcast, I would definitely recommend for you.

1595
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,120
It's beers with Linux.

1596
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,120
Nice.

1597
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,520
I feel reminded of something that you did long ago.

1598
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,800
Yeah, beer is quite tasty.

1599
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:02,800
Beer is quite tasty.

1600
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,680
Well, Chris, I forgot to talk to you about scale.

1601
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,680
Oh, yeah.

1602
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,680
Oh, totally.

1603
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,680
I'd love to hear.

1604
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,680
I'd love to hear.

1605
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,680
Hold on.

1606
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:16,080
Do you want to do the official Jill, our reporter on the scene from scale?

1607
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,720
Well, we'll pretend like you're on the scene, okay?

1608
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,720
Because obviously, you're no longer.

1609
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,720
Okay.

1610
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,720
All right, very good.

1611
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,720
Let's go.

1612
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,720
We'll go first.

1613
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,720
We'll bring in our star reporter.

1614
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:28,720
Oh, my gosh, it's Anderson Cooper, everybody.

1615
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:34,480
Ladies and gentlemen, reporting on the scene in California, it is Jill, the Linux girl

1616
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,720
on our scale live stream.

1617
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,560
Jill, what are you learning at scale 2020?

1618
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:48,840
Oh, what's been awesome is because of unfortunately, because of the virus, we had a very small

1619
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,760
community like feel at scale, which was awesome.

1620
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:57,640
It was kind of like scale six years ago, but one of the highlights was seeing Elle do her

1621
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,520
talk on confessions of assisted men.

1622
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,080
Oh, that's a good time.

1623
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,080
Yeah.

1624
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,080
Yes.

1625
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,080
It was really good.

1626
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,080
It was the first time she had done it alone.

1627
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,080
Oh, yeah.

1628
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,080
Yeah.

1629
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:15,640
It was really, really nice to get to talk to Elle, Elle Moore outside of Twitter and

1630
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:22,040
Jupiter broadcasting, so that was wonderful, but yeah, so even though a lot of the big

1631
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:27,320
companies weren't there, they couldn't send their people out, but they were still sponsoring

1632
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,320
the event.

1633
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,320
Oh, that's good.

1634
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:35,080
But as a result, they sent to the booths, they sent all the local community there.

1635
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:42,360
So it was probably pretty much 50% of Los Angelenos because of that.

1636
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,360
Really?

1637
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,360
Yeah.

1638
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,360
It sounds like it was kind of a special scale then.

1639
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,360
Yeah, it was.

1640
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,360
It was.

1641
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:53,160
It really felt like scale was about, like I was saying, six or seven years ago, but

1642
01:04:53,160 --> 01:05:00,160
we still had, even though normally we have over 5,000 in attendance, we still had 3,500,

1643
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,880
which was really, really good.

1644
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,360
That is not, I mean, so that's about half, right?

1645
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,360
Yeah.

1646
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,360
Yeah.

1647
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,360
Okay.

1648
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,360
Yeah.

1649
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,360
So what are the expo hall?

1650
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,480
You know where all the booths are?

1651
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,600
How different was that?

1652
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:18,800
Set in about 40%, which was a little weird because we're used to seeing that, as you

1653
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,000
know, Chris, that whole hall just completely full.

1654
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Right.

1655
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,600
But we still had a lot of people.

1656
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:29,080
Like I had a lot of people coming to the Linux Chicks LA booth, and I still was able to get

1657
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:34,800
a lot of good interviews for Linux game cast, which, and LWW.

1658
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:45,280
So it was just, it really, everyone was very careful to not touch each other's hands.

1659
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,920
We were trying as much to do fist bumps and shoulder bumps.

1660
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:49,920
Really?

1661
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,920
Getting creative.

1662
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,720
So it must have been like an ongoing conversation the entire conference.

1663
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,400
Yes, it was.

1664
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:01,600
And the fact that we were the only tech conference that hadn't been canceled and was still going

1665
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:06,840
on, and I know if scale had happened the next week, we would have been canceled, you know,

1666
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,840
of course.

1667
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:14,800
So, but it was a very wonderful event despite what's going on in the world.

1668
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:20,840
And what was also really cool is a lot of the speakers who had canceled, people filled

1669
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:28,360
in for them at the last minute, like the Kubernetes track was really awesome because the whole

1670
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,340
track was going to be canceled.

1671
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:34,560
And then everyone, you know, everyone said, well, well, I can come in and do the talk

1672
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,360
literally like, you know, the day before.

1673
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:43,400
So it was, it turned out, I didn't go to that track, but everyone said it was wonderful

1674
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,760
as a result of the spontaneity.

1675
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,960
That's nice.

1676
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,560
It's cool to see people step up like that, you know, I know about that.

1677
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,560
I could talk about that.

1678
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,360
I wasn't planning to, but I'll do it.

1679
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,040
Yeah, that was just really cool.

1680
01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:01,700
And it was, you know, again, it was really great to talk to Elmore and Nuritzi Sanchez

1681
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:02,700
as well.

1682
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:06,600
I got to talk with her and she was wonderful.

1683
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,440
Her brunch with Brent was great too.

1684
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,440
Yes.

1685
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:14,180
In fact, oh man, I meant to mention that in the housekeeping, the last few brunches with

1686
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:15,960
Brent have been so killer.

1687
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,960
Definitely.

1688
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:17,960
Yeah.

1689
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:18,960
Oh gosh.

1690
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,760
Well, you know, has it crossed your mind that might be the last tech event of the year

1691
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,760
you attend?

1692
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,760
Yeah.

1693
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:30,040
Because I wanted to go to Linux Fest Northwest, of course, and was planning to and was just

1694
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,680
about ready to look into the trains.

1695
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,400
Oh, nice way to do it.

1696
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,400
Good for you.

1697
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,400
Yeah.

1698
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,400
Yeah.

1699
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,400
But next year for sure.

1700
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,400
Yeah.

1701
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,920
Or if it's put off to the who knows, it might happen the end of the year.

1702
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:42,920
Yeah.

1703
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,920
You never know.

1704
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,920
Some of them might reschedule.

1705
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,800
I feel like most of them probably won't.

1706
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,800
Yeah.

1707
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,800
Unfortunately.

1708
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,280
The year without a conference.

1709
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,280
What about OSCON?

1710
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,520
Would you would you consider going to OSCON if it continues in July?

1711
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,520
Yeah.

1712
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,040
OSCON actually is one I've never been to.

1713
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:04,080
And the irony of it is scale is bigger than OSCON normally.

1714
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,920
You could take the train to OSCON, though.

1715
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,920
Yes, you can.

1716
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:07,920
Yeah.

1717
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,400
So I've been wanting to go there.

1718
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,280
Well, we'll see what happens.

1719
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:16,000
You know, it seems like every week it is an entirely different world we're living in right

1720
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
now.

1721
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,560
History is being made as we as we live right now.

1722
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,560
Yeah.

1723
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,440
But it's so awesome that our penguins are still marching.

1724
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,860
You know, we still had scale.

1725
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,760
We still have the Linux community.

1726
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,560
And it's been my my respite and all this madness.

1727
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,560
True.

1728
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,120
And we have our virtual look.

1729
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,120
Yes.

1730
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,120
Yes.

1731
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,120
And Jupiter Broadcasting.

1732
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,120
Yay.

1733
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,120
Oh, oh, and it was so cool.

1734
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,640
A couple people came up to me that had heard my brunch with Brent.

1735
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:40,640
Oh, that's wonderful.

1736
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:46,360
And what was really sweet is is one of the Jupiter Broadcasting listeners.

1737
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,680
He wanted a picture with me.

1738
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,680
Who wouldn't?

1739
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,680
Yeah, that's true.

1740
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,840
I wish I could have gotten a picture this year.

1741
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:54,840
Yeah.

1742
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:55,840
Next year, Chris, for sure.

1743
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:56,840
OK.

1744
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,840
You promise?

1745
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,840
Yes, I promise.

1746
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:21,840
Yes, I promise.
