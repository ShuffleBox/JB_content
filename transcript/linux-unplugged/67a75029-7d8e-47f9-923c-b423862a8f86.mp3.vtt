00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
It's a big day. Microsoft has officially launched Microsoft Edge for Linux.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
This changes everything.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
I've just installed it, the dev version on this machine,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
and I'm going to launch it for the first time.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
I'm going to capture my reactions live.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
I'm firing it up on a Neon system, which is a 2004 base.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Ooh, Wes, did you get this?

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
I'm getting like a first time welcome to Edge wizard, a full screen job.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Let's set up your new tab page.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Do you want inspirational, informational, or focused?

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
You know what, I'm going to go ahead and send helpful information back to Microsoft,

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
and I'm going to go for a focused design, whatever that means.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Oh, I'm going inspirational, come on.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Oh yeah? Okay, that probably means you get a pretty background.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
It is a lot like Chrome. It's a really clean Chrome, isn't it?

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
But almost as if you're running Chrome on Windows.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
You know, everything's like a little flatter there.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Yeah, interesting.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
So it's not an Electron app, is it?

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Maybe that's hard to say. What is Electron but a whole bunch of Chromium?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Isn't that what Edge is underneath too?

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
That's true. That's why it feels a lot like Chrome.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
But it does seem to be running pretty snappily.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Maybe I'll make this my default for a while, you know, live on the Edge.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm going to check in. Let's see.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
We'll check the RAM total for Microsoft Edge.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
It is currently the brand new fresh installation of Microsoft Edge is taking.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
Drum roll please.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
63 megabytes of RAM.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
Hello, friends, and welcome to episode 376 of your weekly Linux talk show.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
My name is Chris.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
My name is Wes.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Hello, Wes. You can just move the chips and dip out of the way.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
This episode is brought to you by the all new Cloud Guru.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Cloud Guru now includes Cloud Playgrounds,

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
Azure AWS and Google Cloud sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Just one click for fast, fresh and disposable cloud instances at your fingertips.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Check out a cloud guru dot com.

02:04.000 --> 02:11.000
We have a really fun episode today because nominally we're reviewing Ubuntu 2010,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
which we've been looking forward to the groovy gorilla for quite a while.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
And we'll tell you why here in a little bit.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
But there's also a lot of big news today.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
So there's a ton of stuff for us to break down, including Edge and a bunch of other stuff.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
So, Wes, what do you say we start by welcoming in the virtual lug,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Hello.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Hello.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Hello.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Hello.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Well, hello.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
That is an excellent sounding turnout.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I think we'll need their help today.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah, definitely.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
We also have Philip in there from Manjaro returning

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
to share some good news about the Manjaro pine phone.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Hello, Philip. Good to have you.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Hello. Happy to be here again.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Hello, hello.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
And we have Lindsay joining us from System76.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
She'll be joining us in a little bit to talk about the new Thaleo Mega.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Hello, Lindsay.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Hi, everyone.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Hi. Thanks for joining us.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
So we're going to get to Thaleo here in just a moment.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
But, Wes, let's start with the news that, yes, indeed,

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
Microsoft today, just as we went on air, has released Microsoft Edge for Linux.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
And this is a bigger story than I thought, Wes,

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
because after I kind of brushed it off a little bit and said,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
oh, who's really going to use this,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
we got a lot of feedback of people saying, me, I'm using this.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Well, at this point, you've got to think, all right,

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
some of us are in the Google camp.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
But at least especially, perhaps, in the workplace,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
there's a ton of people whose online lives,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
or at least a section of them, are off in the Microsoft ecosystem.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
So if you've got a browser that just sort of plays ball in that sphere,

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
maybe that makes sense.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
And honestly, at this point,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
you're going to have to trust Google or Microsoft,

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
and now you can have your pick.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Let's do the acid test here.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
We'll do a search for Linux unplugged.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Oh, Wes, surprise, surprise, it's using Bing.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Of course.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
It's also telling me that I can easily collect, organize,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
and share content I find across the web with collections.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
That's interesting.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
But it seems to have nailed the search result right there coming up.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Page render is just fine.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I mean, it's very much a Chromium experience,

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
only if I dare say maybe a slightly leaner feeling one.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
I don't know, Wes.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
You know, we've been running 2010, Ubuntu 2010,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
and it comes with Firefox.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
And it feels like Firefox has gotten really, really good.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
And so this was one of the first times I just chose not to install Chrome.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
You know, actually, I was in the same boat.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
It was sort of like Firefox looked nice.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
It's got a really shiny icon in 2010,

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
and it just, I didn't need to go beyond it.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Now, sometimes there are the random sites, unfortunately,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
that just sort of assume that you have Chrome,

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
but at least it might, you know,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
the testing I've been doing for the past week or so,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I didn't run into that.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I might just, you know, for the show,

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I think what I might do is if I end up needing

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
a Chromium slash Blink browser on these machines,

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
maybe I'll put Edge on there,

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
and I'll give it a test drive for a little bit.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Maybe I'll see if I can get it on Fedora 33, eventually.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Oh, yeah.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
You know, it is kind of interesting that on one hand,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
I have worries about this sort of Blink monoculture

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
that we seem to be inevitably heading towards.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
But on the other side,

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
it's also maybe an open source success story

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
that Microsoft can do this at all

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
and that we're here running Edge on Linux

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
because of all the hard open source work done in the Chromium project.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Yeah, exactly.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
And I'd also be interested if anyone throws Wireshark at this thing

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
just to kind of get an idea of how many connections an hour or a day

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
it's making back to Microsoft headquarters.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
And maybe now it might be not fully a fair test

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
because in beta, especially in early beta,

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
it's collecting certain crash metrics and whatnot

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
that it might not in production.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, you already agreed to give them those metrics, Chris.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
I did.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Well, I feel like in a way, it's sort of,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
it's registering a vote for Linux support.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
I often will say go ahead and collect information

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
even though I don't feel great about it.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
But it serves my broader goal of telling corporations

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
that there's Linux users out here.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Hey, I'm over here.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Support me.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
All right, so let's be real.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Could you see yourself actually use,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I mean, if you're using Chrome day-to-day,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
is it really that different to use Edge?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Well, I think Joe probably put it best.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
I think it was Joe who said that Google's already got them.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Right?

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
So at least that's like already a deal he's made.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Why invite another corporation into that circle of trust

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
and give them all of your activity information?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
So even if it is maybe better in some regards,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
you've already kind of,

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
you've already gotten yourself comfortable,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
at least in my case, with Google.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Interesting.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
You know, I was almost thinking the opposite,

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
like it might be nice to disconnect things.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
I've already got so much in Google.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Maybe I want to better isolate and deal with, you know,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
not having my browser sign me in automatically

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
to any Google accounts that I'm signed in.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
That might be nice.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah, I think that's a very, very, very valid use case.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
And, you know, real, actual, genuine Linux support

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
could mean that you have a viable Blink alternative

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
that is supported by a large-scale vendor

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
with industry support.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
So it's nothing to blink at.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
And I could see it because there's a story that was out today,

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I think, as we record at least,

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
that when you clear your history and browsing history inside Chrome,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
a couple of sites are actually excluded from that clearing.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
And surprise, surprise, they're Google properties.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Who would have thought?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
So, you know, that kind of thing,

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I think gets more and more people looking at them sideways

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
and thinking, gosh, the browser is pretty essential

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
to my day-to-day use in life.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
So maybe.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
And in the meantime, people that are in Linux

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
but in a Microsoft-centric environment have a pretty good option.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
And also, people who are buying GPU-powered workstations

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
have a pretty good solution.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Today, System76 announced the Thaleo Mega,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
the world's smallest quad GPU workstation,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
primarily made for deep learning and scientific computing.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Of course, I'm sure you could probably play video games on this thing.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Carl says it's kind of their hype car of sports cars.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
They put all of their most advanced engineering and technology

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
into the Mega, and he says they got stunning results.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
And it goes way beyond industry standard quad GPU systems

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
in a compact, quiet little box.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
And we have a special guest joining us from System76 today

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
to tell us some of the secrets that went into this.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Lindsay Cross, System76's mechanical engineer, is joining us today.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Congratulations on the release.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
You must have been working towards this for quite a while.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Thank you.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah, we have, even though things move pretty quickly here, we'll say.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
So this is the thing I noticed immediately about this,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
because you have one picture on the website

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
where you get a real good sense of the size,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
and it's shorter than a monitor in terms of height.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
The monitor is taller, a widescreen monitor is taller than this case is.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
And I'm wondering how the heck you managed to pack four GPUs

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
into a smaller version of the Thaleo.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Yeah, it was hard.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
There were times where I was like,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Carl, can we just make this a little bigger?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
No, we got to make this the smallest.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
So it took a lot of thermal coordination,

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
a lot of messing with different manufacturing methods,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
but I think we got there.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
You must have had to build an exceptional cooling system.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Yes, yeah, we did.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
We almost had to treat everything kind of independently.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
So the CPU has its own kind of cooling system.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
The GPUs have their own cooling system.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
And then we added some intake fans here and there

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
to kind of round everything out.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
When you're building something like this,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
you must have situations where you have to generate a lot of heat

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
to get an idea if things are working.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
So you must have had to throw some workloads at this thing

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
to test this stuff out.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Yeah, we tested it with four 2080s all the time.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I don't think we ever tested it without four GPUs.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
And Carl had some crazy workloads where he was taxing each GPU

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
to use at least 250 watts to make sure it actually worked.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Before the show started, I asked you how big the power supply

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
must be in something like this to support four GPUs.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Will you share that?

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
Yeah, we have a 1600 watt power supply in there.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
It's pretty big.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Some people are like, you know, maybe we should put a thousand in there

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
just in case someone wants something smaller.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
And we're like, nope, 1600 it is.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Why so much effort into making a quad GPU system small?

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
Because it seems like the easy route would be to take the largest Thalio

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
and just pack a full of GPUs.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Right. I mean, it makes it a little more accessible,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
especially now that, you know, more people are working from home.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
You don't necessarily have the option to go work on a server farm

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
or on this huge computer.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
You just need something that's a desktop that can sit under your desk

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
or on top of your desk and be able to work in the situations

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
you needed to work in.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
And it really seems like it's targeted right at professionals

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
because I think it's all essentially professional grade GPUs in this thing

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
with insane amounts of RAM.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
Yeah, but, you know, if someone, an individual who has, you know,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
a little bit of money lying around, they want to do some crazy machine learning

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
on their own, they're more than welcome to pick one up.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Right. I mean, this would be quite the git.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
It's sort of, like Carl said, it's like a super sports car that if you can afford it,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
it would be quite the treat.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
The size, I think, would make them perfect for the studio.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
So I could almost talk myself into it.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Yeah, I think you should. I think you really should.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
It makes me think the whole line here is getting more mature, you know,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
that Thalios come far enough now that you can pack all this into such a small thing

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
that you're comfortable with the thermals, with managing,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
with changing up the manufacturing process.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
That's interesting.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Yeah. And, you know, there's more to come.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
We're trying to fill all the gaps in the line, if you will.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
So stay tuned.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
More Thalios to come.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
So I know you're on the factory floor right now as we chat,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
and I'd love to get some insights into what it's like to build something like this,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
how many iterations of the chassis and the kind of details

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
that consumers never really know because what we end up seeing is just the finished product.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Yeah, exactly.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
One of the joys of just being able to build all these desktops right here in Denver

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
is we can move real quickly.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
For example, I'll make a design in CAD and then I'll be building it later that day,

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
which is unheard of if you kind of outsource it.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Really?

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
So, you know, me and my coworker, John, we come up with these crazy designs.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
We go over to the laser punch and cut it out

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
and then take it to the bender and powder it up if we want to make it look cool.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
And it all takes, you know, a day or two just to build something up and test it out.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
That is some fast feedback.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Yeah, exactly.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Yeah, that is really great for building.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Do you get to keep one or do you end up getting a final one

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
or do you have one of the – does like one of the iterations become your machine?

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
Well, this machine is a little too expensive to just have one of my own.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Right.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
I wish, though.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
But, yeah, I definitely – you know, I have a – I work on a Thaleo major right now

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
and it's kind of hobnob together of pieces we found.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
So, it's kind of fun to be able to do that.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Right.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
It's very much how it goes when you're actually on the factory floor

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
and building these things.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
That's kind of – I figured something like that.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
Well, you got a Thaleo so you're not doing too bad then.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
No, I'm not.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
I'll say my CAD renders very quickly.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
I really wish I had a good reason to grab one of these things

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
because they just look so great.

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
And the size I feel like is one of those things that would really strike you in person.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
So, not only is it something that has four GPUs in it,

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
but getting the right size components that support that much GPU capacity must have been tricky.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Like motherboard.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
Yeah, the motherboard we definitely had to hone in on.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
And Carl definitely did a bunch of work to kind of dial that in

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
and figure out what would work best for this four GPU system.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Colonel in our Mumble Room noticed on the System76 site

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
that you know that you're using closed loop phase cooling.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
What is that?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Yeah.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
So, for example, for the CPU, it has an intake and a duct, its own duct.

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
So, basically, we're trying to move air over the CPU specifically.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
And then on the other end, kind of out the back, has its own exhaust.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
So, it's kind of like its own loop for the CPU there.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
I see.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
That's called a closed loop.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Very cool.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
Lindsay, this has been a really interesting release to go over this

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
and just see what a monster this thing is.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
And really, I kind of can't think of another machine that's pre-built to run Linux,

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
pre-installed with Linux, that's this powerful in shipping today.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
I think you guys have nailed it.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
All right, that's what we'd like to hear.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Well, thank you for coming on and telling us about it.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Of course.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
linode.com slash unplugged.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
and go there to support the show.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Linode is our cloud provider.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
And because their price is so great, it makes it possible for a small team

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
to have killer infrastructure.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
And personally, one of the things I think is great about Linode

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
is all of the distributions they support.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
All the Alpines, Arch, the recent Centaurses and Debian releases,

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
same with Fedora and OpenSUSE, and of course, several versions of Ubuntu.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
But what I really get about them is their love for Linux

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
and their support for open source.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
They've been the backer of initiatives that we love,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
like Linux Fest Northwest, or a supporter of All Things Open

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
going on right now, I think.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
And also a sponsor of the Kubuntu project.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
It goes on and on and on.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
They started in 2003 as one of the very first companies in cloud computing.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
That was three years before AWS, and they've got their game together.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
They're independently owned, which I also get that.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
And they started with a love of Linux.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
They got into this business because they saw the features

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
and capabilities coming to Linux, and as Linux users recognized

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
what they could do with them before anybody else pulled the trigger.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
And Linode is dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
If it runs on Linux, well, it runs on Linode.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
And they don't have just machines either.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Let me tell you, they've got node balancers, central logging tools,

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
Kubernetes support, Terraform support, as well as object storage,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
which I love and use all the time.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
And unlike entry-level hosting services that lock you into their platform,

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Linode gives you full backend access to customize

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
and control your server to fit your needs.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
So go to linode.com slash unplugged.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
You go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
and you go there to support the show.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
That's linode.com slash unplugged.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Big thank you to Linode for sponsoring the unplugged program.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Linode.com slash unplugged.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Well, NVIDIA made some news this week.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
It appears that they won't have support for Linux 5.9

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
at least for another month,

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
and it's all about a GPL condom.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
They sent out an advisory to their customers on Friday

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
that they don't expect to have 5.9 kernel support

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
in their proprietary graphics driver until mid-November

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
or about one month until after the stable version of that is released.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
The advisory notes, Linux kernel 5.9 plus,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
in case, you know, they're really slow,

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
is incompatible with current and previous NVIDIA Linux GPU drivers.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
We advise customers to defer updating to Linux kernel 5.9 plus

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
until mid-November when an NVIDIA Linux GPU driver update

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
with support is expected to be available.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
NVIDIA is aware of the impact this will have on customers,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
and we are working diligently to provide the driver update

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
with kernel 5.9 plus support as soon as possible.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Oh man, how aggravating.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
So we're about to talk about Ubuntu 2010 today.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
That release is using Linux 5.8, so it won't have that issue,

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
but it means if you want like the latest and greatest hardware support in 5.9,

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
you're kind of left out until at least mid-November timeframe.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Now, as you mentioned, Chris, NVIDIA didn't publicly spell out

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
why it's taking them much longer than normal

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
to deliver support for this new kernel,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
but it may very well have to do with the change around

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
tainting that module with GPL shims

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
that circumvent GPL symbol exports used by proprietary drivers.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
We talked about this a little bit.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
It all came out of some work from Facebook around net GPU,

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
but it sort of reminded kernel developers that, well,

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
the NVIDIA proprietary module has been playing fast and loose

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
with that old GPL shim requirement anyway.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Maybe they're catching up.

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
Yeah, it is kind of a shame because, you know,

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
Linus and other kernel developers try not to disrupt user land,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
but obviously this is one of those that absolutely will,

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
and the NVIDIA driver won't be the only one that is impacted by this,

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
but they may be the one that's perhaps best capable of responding to it.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
And this is really from a discussion that has been,

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
shall we say, colorful at best,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
which has been hostile to certain vendors,

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
and this is what it has come to.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
And the thing that I find tricky about this is if you aren't on

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
a distribution that's watching for this, you could get bit.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
For example, if you're on Gen 2 or Arch,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
you're going to get the new kernel eventually,

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
and your NVIDIA card just won't be able to use the driver.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Yeah, that is unfortunate, kind of the pains of rolling,

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
and, you know, it's sort of the pains of using and relying

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
on this proprietary driver from NVIDIA.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
It's two separate projects being developed,

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
and, you know, sometimes NVIDIA just has to play catch-up.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Yeah.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Until then, some good advice from gamingonlinux.com

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
that if you're on an Arch-based distribution,

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
well, you might try out the NVIDIA installer from TK Glitch.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
We'll have a link in the show notes,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
and it sounds like it works well enough for the moment.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Hmm, yeah, okay.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Well, that's just sort of a public service announcement to everybody,

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
and if there's anything that develops, we'll let you know.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
I know Manjaro has been watching out for this particular one.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
They've been talking about it for a while.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Philip joins us on the show, really here to talk about

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
the new PinePhone Manjaro Edition,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
but, Philip, do you have any follow-up thoughts to this NVIDIA issue?

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
Well, I did also post and had the famous Linus picture on it,

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
and then I got a tweet about it.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Hey, what is that for, silly?

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
And we should be mature more and so on,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
so I had to change it and apologize,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
and in the end, the tweet was deleted.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
But anyway, the topic is still there,

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
and new users found out about it and talk about it,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
so it's a big thing,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
and from our standpoint as a distribution,

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
we cannot change the kernel stuff,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
so when Linus is adding the scheme

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
so that the kernel doesn't accept the NVIDIA driver,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
then it is like it is.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
The distro has to follow,

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
and we cannot simply reword it as that might be against the law,

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
and so we have to wait about NVIDIA to fix it on their own so it works,

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
but the good thing is on Manjaro, we have all the kernels,

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
so you can choose between the latest is 5.9,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
as of course that doesn't work there,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
but the earliest we have is 4.4,

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
so we have plenty to choose between 4.4 and 5.9,

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
and if you don't want to lose that,

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
then still use one kernel, which still works.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
You know, I just thought of a show segment idea, Wes,

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
where we go back and try the oldest possible supported Linux kernel

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
and see if we can tell any difference in our day-to-day usage.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
It would obviously depend on the hardware,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
but it might be a fun segment.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Oh, I love it. 2.6 anyone?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Yeah.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
So, Phil, when we talked before,

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
I recalled that there was going to be two Manjaro PinePhone community editions,

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
a 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of eMMC edition,

21:13.000 --> 21:19.000
and then a slightly more expensive version that had 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of eMMC.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
It also included a dock with that one.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
I'm curious if you've got any early results on how the reception has been

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
and any update on when things are going to be shipping out.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
Well, we ship out early November, mid-November,

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
as we could manage to get production one week earlier.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
That was done because we had the backup image ready.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
We had planned to ship it with Lumiri,

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
but things happened, and we could not do that,

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
so we go for Phosh now,

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
and the good thing about Phosh is it's already established by Purism

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
and all the other projects,

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
and we patched everything together,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
so we have the torch working,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
the camera is working with autofocus and so on,

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
so it's the best experience what you can get now with Phosh,

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
and we also have the 5.9 kernel with better audio stack.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Oh, it's great to hear about autofocus in the camera.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
That seems like a big deal.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Somebody must have really worked hard on that.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
It was done by Martin from PostmarketOS,

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
and it's really good to have all the people

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
around all the distributions to push and help you out

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
to get these community editions out,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
and if they have a patch or some cool package,

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
then we speak internally with all the developers

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
and see how we can get it done on each base,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
and we also help each other to get it out

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
because in the end, it's about the phone experience,

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
and so everybody works closely together across the distros.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Yeah, man, that is a really nice aspect

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
of free software development, isn't it,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
and giving us a real edge

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
because we don't have teams 200 people deep

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
like some of the carriers or manufacturers do

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
to design certain aspects of their OS.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Well, it sounds like people that ordered one of these

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
will be getting them soon.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Any numbers?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Like, do you have a rough idea

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
of how many phones are going to be out there?

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
Well, we got half, so 3,000 are out,

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
so we still have some, so you can still buy them,

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
and the numbers are obviously the 3-gigabyte version

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
is the most wanted, so they mostly got sold there.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
Still, some people cannot afford the big price of 2,200,

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
so they go for the cheaper one for 1,500,

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
and, yeah, we have 7 to 3 ratio here,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
and, yeah, it's still there,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
and you can still grab them.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Very good.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Any other mangero news you want to share with us

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
before we move along?

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Well, we are working on the new version called Nibia.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
We might go with the 5.9 kernel

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
and the latest Plasma and the latest GNOME,

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
but if you want to keep the stable version,

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
we got released yesterday the Mica 20.1.2,

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
which fixed the Bluetooth bleeding tooth issues.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Very good.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
You can go there and have that.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
How was that process?

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
Did that get fixed upstream fairly quickly for you guys,

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
and then it was a matter of integration?

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
The problem was the news about the vulnerability was too early,

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
so nobody was informed.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
The kernel developers had it, so you could not do it properly,

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
like there's the patch, and then we release the vulnerability,

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
and everybody can be prepared and have it in every branch,

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
so we had to play the catch-up as usual.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
We did it first in the unstable branch,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
and then fast-forwarded to testing

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
and did a snap only for the kernels in the stable,

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
and then I had to spin all the isos,

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
which are six by now for the main releases,

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
and then I had to announce it and so on,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
so it took me one day to get the isos out,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
so today we have the homepage also updated,

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
and since yesterday, you can already download it.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Very good.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
Yeah, we covered the news in Linux Action News

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
and did a little analysis,

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
and one of my takeaways on that BlueZ story is,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
you know, once again, Intel blew the messaging.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
They didn't inform the kernel developers

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
or the distribution projects fast enough,

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
and then it essentially, you know, they put the word out

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
early Eastern time, and then by lunch Eastern time,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
it was on ZDNet and other sites.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
It had been released to the press as well,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
and so then people knew about an act of vulnerability

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
before the developers even had a chance

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
to start getting the patches shipped,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
so thanks for jumping on that really quick,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
and it sounds like good news is ahead

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
for Manjaro PinePhone Community Edition,

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
so thanks for joining us, Filip.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
No problem.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
I'm always happy to be here.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Well, then let's do a little bit of—

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
let's do a little housekeeping.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
I got it tidied up around here.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
I want to mention the Luplug is rocking.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
They had a great one this Sunday

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
where they talked about browsers

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
and had some extension developers stop by.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Talk about an awesome hangout.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
It's every single Sunday, noon Pacific time.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
It's on the calendar though,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Hang out at the Luplug.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
The other nice thing about it is you get your—

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
you get your mumble set up to do that,

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
and you do that in the lobby,

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
and then you can join us for the main show,

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
hang out in the show.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
You're set up for Tuesday.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Pro tip.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Also, another pro tip,

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
consider grabbing the Jupiter Broadcasting All Shows feed.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
We've relaunched Linux Action News and Coder Radio,

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
and you know the network itself has a nice focus now.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
It's a great feed,

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
and you get anything new we might be launching.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
Also, it is political season in the States,

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
so there will be a debate this week,

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
and I will be live streaming that over at twitch.tv slash unfilter,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
or you can just go to unfilter.show slash live.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Unfilter is no longer part of JB,

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
but it is up and cranking to cover the people's history in real time.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
So go check that out and join me and hang out.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
I think it's, is it Thursday night?

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
It is.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Yeah.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
So welcome to join me over there.

27:00.000 --> 27:06.000
Also, I am very excited to announce that Wes Payne is joining

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
the internet's favorite Linux news show very soon.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
Mr. Joe Resington will be taking over editing duties from Drew

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
on this podcast.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
It's a good news, bad news situation.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Drew got a job.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
We're very, very happy for that.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
But Drew also now has to make that his first priority.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
So he is transitioning editing to Joe,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
which takes a considerable amount of time.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
And one of the things we want to do is keep people sustainable.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Don't want to burn them out.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
I mean, we make a mess over here and someone's got to clean it up.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Learned that lesson the hard way last time we were independent

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
and taking that forward, you know, Joe and I had a real talk

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
and to keep him healthy and not overwork him,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
he's going to focus on editing

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
because if it's not Drew, there's really nobody else in the world qualified.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
And I mean it.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Thank you for offering to edit.

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
But this is a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

28:00.000 --> 28:06.000
sometimes eight or twelve track production live audio podcast.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
And we have a very high standard.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
And so when it came down to it, we wanted Joe to have that job.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
And it gives him his Sunday back, too.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
So he'll be editing and Wes will be taking his place on Linux Action News.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
And I'm really excited about that because not only has Wes always been involved

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
behind the scenes on Linux Action News,

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
he's been there when one when Joe or I needed a day off.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
But Wes follows tons of stories that never make it into LUP.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
So we're going to have a lot we can talk about there.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
And we'll do a good job of separating out what goes into LUP,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
you know, more of the community focused stuff

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
versus the stuff that really dented the open source universe.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
That'll be in Linux Action News every Sunday.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
And so if you want a little more Wes and myself, go over to linuxactionnews.com

28:49.000 --> 28:54.000
slash subscribe and start getting it because it's going to be us rocking it.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
I'm really excited to do it with Wes because you guys, you know,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
I love doing a show with him. Right. So it's great.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
Plus, it gives another day of the week we can barbecue, which is a victory.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
Oh, I'm excited for that as well.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
And I mean, Linux Action News is it's a network staple.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
I was so excited when it started being relaunched.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
And I've always been honored to be a part of it.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
And you're right. I think, you know, Linux Unplugged, it's our community space.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
It's time to hang out with the mumble room.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
It's time to talk to folks doing all this great work.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
But Linux Action News stands alone as this sort of, you know,

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
bastion of keeping up with what's actually happening, tight, critical analysis.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
The only thing I'm sad about is I no longer have my favorite Monday morning podcast.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
Yeah. And that is one of the things when you start doing the shows,

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
you can listen, but it's just not quite the same experience.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
So that'll be coming up at the beginning of November is when we're going to make that transition.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
So Joe's got one more week.

29:45.000 --> 29:50.000
And, you know, it's kind of nice for us because it means he can still be involved.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
We still get to hang out with our friend.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
He's now integrated into Linux Unplugged, which means that we'll be talking to him on a daily basis.

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
So for us, it means Drew gets a job, Joe gets a little better work life balance,

30:02.000 --> 30:08.000
and Wes gets to join me on Sundays to crank out a Linux Action News and do some barbecue.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
So I think it's going to be pretty good all around.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
It just means a little adjustments, but we wanted to give you a heads up right here

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
that it's happening so that way you're not caught off guard.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
And that is all the tidying.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
Let's get it all out of here and let's talk about Groovy Gorilla Ubuntu 2010,

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
which is released this week.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
The release candidates are like everything done and frozen has been out for a few days.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
That's what Wes and I have been kicking around.

30:31.000 --> 30:37.000
I may do a little follow up next week on a couple of other items once it's officially released.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
But by the time you're listening to this, it probably already is.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
Ubuntu 2010 ships with a lot of new stuff that we've been waiting for,

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
like a new version of GNOME Shell and what was once considered or called

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
the largest kernel update ever, Linux 5.8.

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
So there's a lot of really good stuff that makes 2010 a compelling release

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
and something I wanted to give a go.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
Some quality of life things that have improved like better fingerprint support

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
and active directory integration, more on that later.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
But also like, you know, actual decent hardware support.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
Getting 5.8 in there, which was released in May of 2020, no small feat.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
It has new features like the option to specify an initial RAM disk image.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
It has mitigations for the special register buffer data sampling flaw,

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
a.k.a. the crosstalk hardware vulnerability in Intel processors.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
It has inline encryption support for the block layer.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
It now supports the RockChip video decoders, which is awesome.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Yeah.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
It has a new event notification mechanism in 5.8.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
Also 5.8 has support for LZO RLE compression in the F2FS file system.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
And that's just scratching the surface.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
There's improvements in there for AMD graphics.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
There is CPU frequency scaler improvements in there.

31:52.000 --> 31:58.000
There's a ton of stuff in 5.8 that you just get by installing Ubuntu 2010.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
And also your video card still works.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Well, and, you know, 5.8 was a great kernel.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
But if you've been sticking with Ubuntu since 2004,

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
you get all those interim updates as well, right?

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
I mean, like 5.7 had some good stuff, everything in there.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
It's just a fancy, shiny new kernel.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
And I think in order to really appreciate everything that's nice

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
about the official flavor of Ubuntu, we can talk about the other ones later,

32:22.000 --> 32:27.000
is you also get GNOME Shell 3.38, which will also be landing in Fedora 33 soon.

32:27.000 --> 32:32.000
But you have an improved settings panel where you also can now manage

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
parental controls for standard user accounts,

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
which I have two kids that are using Linux as their desktop.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
That's actually kind of an interesting feature for me.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
There's other improvements to settings to include

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
the fingerprint enrollment stuff that I mentioned.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
And better multi-monitor support is in 3.38,

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
as well as a new revamped screenshot and sound recorder tools

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
which have been redesigned.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
And there's the new tracker search stuff.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
Tracker 3 is in GNOME Shell 3.8 and 3.38.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
And a lot of the core GNOME apps have been updated

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
to take advantage of the new search tool.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
And then under the hoods, they've switched from IP tables to NF tables

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
for the networking stuff.

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
So in a way, it's a really significant release that on the surface

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
doesn't feel ultimately all that different from 2004, the LTS.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Did you get that experience?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Things are definitely a little bit shinier.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
I can tell there's been polishing going on in the backend,

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
especially with GNOME 3.38, which is just...

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I've been spending a lot of time on Plasma lately,

33:33.000 --> 33:37.000
and it's nice to be back home in GNOME.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
But you're right.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
I mean, new background, you know, some smoothification,

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
some new updates, some new features.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
But honestly, I can't tell that much of a difference

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
because it just feels like being back on a modern Ubuntu desktop.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
I don't think that's bad, though.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
It definitely is the...

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
It's become cliche to say this now,

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
but it is the best performing version of GNOME Shell.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
And that translates to a very, very good desktop experience.

34:04.000 --> 34:10.000
And it is good enough that after what has been a very long, stable process,

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
it has pulled me off of Plasma again.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
I can't help but feel like GNOME Shell just feels like

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
a super refined, cohesive desktop experience that is barely in my way

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
when I'm using an application

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
and gives me just the right amount of tools

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
to do some window management in a way that I like

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
without it feeling sort of like it's been put together,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
like by multiple pieces, like the taskbar is one piece,

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
the system tray is one piece, the launcher is another piece,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
the icon is another piece, the desktop is another...

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
It all feels like in some desktops, like individual components

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
that are all working together, which it all really is,

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
but in GNOME Shell, especially with 3.3.8,

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
and I really like just the minor improvements to,

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
like, check a box now to show battery percentage

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
or Wi-Fi share with a QR code or...

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Now, it's just a small thing, right?

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
But they've added the...

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
They've just kind of redone the way that the user menu settings work,

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
so you click that down and you have an option right in there now to restart.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
It's just a lot of little small things that maybe should have always been there,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
but they're there now.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Right. That's it. I think it's...

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
This whole series of, you know, modern GNOME,

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
it started off with a very strong sort of design language,

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
design intent, but there's been holes, there's been gaps,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
there's been changes figuring things out.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
But I think we're now finally at, not the end of that road,

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
but a really healthy middle spot of that road,

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
where it all just works together,

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
and as each of the small pieces gets updated, brought into line,

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
it just gets smoother and smoother.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
Although the one thing that I have hated about Plasma is,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
you know, on your default login screen,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
when you're testing out a new distro, it looks terrible

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
if you haven't set yourself up a nice little home user icon,

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
you know, a user icon for yourself at the login screen.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
You've got that not-GNOME now, too.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Yeah, boy, that...

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
You know, I still... I know it's been out for a couple of releases

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
or at least one release, but the new login and lock screen is...

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
It's so good.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
So good. It's so good.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
I have decided, though, that I am not a fan

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
of bringing the OEM logo forward during the boot process,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
which is now supposed to be that, you know,

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
that so-much-lauded-after seamless boot process.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I don't like it.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
Because it makes it feel like my machine's taking way too long to post,

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
which, back in the day, if your machine was taking a while to post,

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
that meant something was wrong.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
And so it makes me uncomfortable.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
Is this one of those divides between new-school Linux users

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
and old-school Linux users, where you have that built-in suspicion?

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
But if you were just, you know, you were migrating from modern-day Mac OS,

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
wouldn't that be what you expect?

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
Well, I got a little special Ubuntu-flavored conspiracy bacon.

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
Actually, it's not just Ubuntu, but I think the reason, my conspiracy...

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Get your tinfoil hat ready.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
My idea, the reason why all the distributions went for the seamless boot

36:56.000 --> 37:02.000
is because it essentially puts the boot-up process on the OEM.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
So what I see when I boot up, say, like a ThinkPad,

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
is I get a Lenovo logo the entire time.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
So if I was just a, you know, an average user

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
who didn't really know how this stuff worked,

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
I would think it was something with my Lenovo that was taking a while,

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
and then, boom, all of a sudden, I get my desktop, right?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
They're punting the blame.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
That's it. All the hard work of, you know, enabling the nice UEFI pass-through,

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
keeping that vendor logo displayed seamlessly with no flashing,

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
it's just to blame the OEM.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Right. I figured it out.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
You're welcome, everybody.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
So I also know that one of the other major things about this release

37:36.000 --> 37:41.000
is straight-up desktop support for the Raspberry Pi 4.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
Now, I didn't get a chance to give this a go like I want,

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
so I think this will be one of the items I follow up on in the future.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
I downloaded it. It's an ISO, not a traditional, like, image

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
that you would get for an SD card.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
It's an ISO that I tried flashing to my SD card,

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
but I also tried flashing to a standard USB thumb drive.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
I was going to say, yeah, did you need a special tool to burn it,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
or it just worked?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
You know, it's possible that that Pi doesn't,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
hasn't been updated enough to support USB boot,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
but I think you're supposed to flash it to a thumb drive

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
because it's an ISO image, not like a file system SD card image.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
So what do I know?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
But I wanted to give that another pass and give that more time

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
and see, maybe if I could even pull out my 8 gig Pi and try it on that,

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
I thought that'd be kind of cool.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
So I'll follow up on that, but seeing Canonical just go after the Pi 4,

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
like a series platform, I just give high marks to.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Yes.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Really like it.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Well, you know, I think we kind of complained.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
It took a little while.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
It wasn't always where we wanted it, but once they've added it,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
just having that there as a continual burden of support

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
and seeing that followed through, that's awesome.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Yeah, and it seems like the situation on the Pi

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
just keeps going from good to better.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
Like, last week we talked about ESXi,

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
which will have some follow-up and the feedback coming out

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
for the Raspberry Pi.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
And then today, as we sat down to record the show,

38:57.000 --> 39:02.000
I saw that there was a pretty big update on the Raspberry Pi blog about Vulkan

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
getting merged into Mesa and then that being upstream.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
And so you're getting official Vulkan Mesa drivers

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
that are compatible with the Raspberry Pi 4 being upstream now,

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
and that is just...

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
Awesome.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Big news.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Yeah, it's big news.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
And it's passing 100,000 different Vulkan standard tests now

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
that come from the Kronos group, and it's just more and more.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
Like, it's basically becoming one of a small handful

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
of fully Vulkan-compliant little small board computers.

39:30.000 --> 39:35.000
And the Raspberry Pi, I think, should be taken more seriously

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
by all the distributions.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
I know they're all trying, but the reality is that, you know,

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
the Pi 4 is fantastic.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
The Pi 5 is going to be even better.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
The Pi 6, the Pi 7, the Pi 8.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
And if you start now, when it's just on the cusp,

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
if you start now, then by the time that the Pi 6 or the Pi 8

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
is rolling around, your distribution is going to have this nail.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Now, thankfully, all that will be upstream,

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
and other distributions will be able to jump on board,

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
but I think Canonical is showing leadership here.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
So I really do want to give it a go on the Pi 4,

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
because I think that has serious long-term potential.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
But we will see.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Maybe the performance will be horrible.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
I don't know.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
And I don't even know what desktop I'm on.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
I might be GNOME Shell.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
I don't know.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
I guess we'll find out.

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
I also had some strange issues that I didn't run into

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
that I kind of chalk up to being early days.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
But I didn't run into these issues before I put 2010 on the system.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
My Wi-Fi reception just seemed to be a lot worse,

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
dropping off a lot when I'm upstairs in the studio.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
I've never, ever had this problem on this machine.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
I had Manjaro on it before I put 2010 on there.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
No issues at all.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
I don't really know if that's a 2010 problem, a driver problem,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
or maybe just some weird Wi-Fi interference going on.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
It did strike me as funny that over on Discourse,

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
better Wi-Fi performance was one of the highlights for kernel 5.8.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
But to my end, I've not had that problem.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
And I think we're on pretty similar hardware.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
Yeah, yeah.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
It really could just be the Wi-Fi in the studio on that one.

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
The other one that bit me at one point was I did the minimal install,

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
because I love that they have that as an option.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Also, all of my test systems were CFS,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
because I'm going to push all the buttons.

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
And when I did the minimal install, the Ubuntu Software Center

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
was not installed, but the icon was in the sidebar.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
And as I try these in their earlier versions,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
I try to figure out if that's a bug or not.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
I didn't see that one listed as a bug.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
Might also just be my box, because I tried 2010 on another box,

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
and it didn't have that problem.

41:34.000 --> 41:39.000
So my intention here is to kind of take Ubuntu 2010

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
and try to give the audience an idea if it's worth upgrading

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
if they're running on 2004 every day.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
And I saw some people in the chat room were saying

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
they're actually going to put 2010 on their servers.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
I think that's a pretty clear line there is 2004 LTS

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
is going to be your best option for a server.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
But as far as a desktop or a workstation goes,

42:00.000 --> 42:06.000
I'm not absolutely convinced that 2010 is a must upgrade

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
unless you need something in 5.8

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
or you need something in GNOME Shell 3.3.8-like performance.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
But 2004 will get a lot of this backported.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Hardware enablements will be backported.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
Sometimes even significant GNOME Shell performance fixes

42:20.000 --> 42:24.000
will get backported to the LTS, to the version that's in the LTS.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
So I actually think I don't know if I could make the recommendation

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
if 2004 is working for you today to actually upgrade to 2010.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
You know, I think you're right about that.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
You know, it's just that the deltas get smaller and smaller,

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
you know, as you have more features, as more things are made,

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
snaps, as just the Linux ecosystem gets better and better

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
with more application support.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
Modern GNOMES, you know, a small point release

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
might get you a lot of nice features, but it's already pretty darn good.

42:52.000 --> 42:57.000
It feels like right now, 2010 is more of a back-end polish release

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
than it is as something maybe more user-facing.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
Now, if you, you know, you really love the Linux desktop,

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
yeah, there's a lot of great stuff in here to like,

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
really happy to see the work.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
It just doesn't have a noticeable feel difference.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
And it's clearly building towards the next LTS,

43:11.000 --> 43:15.000
which is going to accumulate all of this stuff and going to be really great.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
For myself personally, when I load a new Ubuntu system though,

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
I'll be going 2010.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
It's got enough for me that it pushes the buttons.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
I do think you're right there that the next LTS is going to be super solid.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Yeah.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
And then I think there's one other category of user

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
that should very seriously consider going to 2010,

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
and that is anyone who needs to integrate with an Active Directory environment,

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
because they've built an Active Directory support into the installer

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
like Fedora has now.

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
And with Fedora 33 coming out soon and 2010 coming out soon

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
and both of them rocking Active Directory support,

43:47.000 --> 43:53.000
and then today Microsoft announcing Microsoft Edge for Linux,

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
there is, there's a version of me from about 15 years ago

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
that was using Xandros and Crossover Office

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
to barely integrate with a Microsoft infrastructure

44:03.000 --> 44:07.000
that looks back at that and goes, wow, what an era we're in now.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
And so if you are an Active Directory user

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
that you need Active Directory support on your Linux desktop,

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
this kind of seems like a slam dunk for you.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Something Wes and I want to try in the future,

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
it's all a matter of timing,

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
is maybe set up something like free IPA

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
or maybe even Azure Active Directory, I don't know,

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
and see if we can point our Fedora and Ubuntu boxes at it

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
to start authenticating.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
Let's go crazy. Let's enterprise the studio.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
I mean, I would actually, even just for my LAN,

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
would very much like to have a single sign-on across all my machines

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
and across all the studio machines.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
I mean, you could have a Wes account here at the studio

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
and you could log into every system as Wes

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
and we wouldn't have to set it up manually for each one of them,

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
which we legitimately have enough now where that would be kind of nice.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
It would be nice.

44:52.000 --> 44:57.000
I think I'd also kind of like it to be everywhere I am though.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
I'd kind of like to be able to use the same logins at home

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
and get access to some of the same resources,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
which is maybe where hosted Azure,

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
I don't know if that's even worth it,

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
but if anybody out there has any experience with the like free IPA

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
or hosted Azure or something like that,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
I don't really fancy actually installing Windows

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
and running Active Directory.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
Yeah, we'd like this to be Windows free,

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
but also we want encrypted VPN everywhere roaming accounts.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
Yes, exactly. So if you've got any tips, linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

45:26.000 --> 45:32.000
That'll be on our to-do list to test as well as following up on Raspberry Pi 4 efforts.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
And just a big congratulations to the canonical team

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
and to Wimpy and the desktop team in particular.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
This is, in my opinion, it's one of the best looking.

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
I think it's now a toss up between 2010 and pop

45:46.000 --> 45:51.000
and they are two really great experiences that are very opinionated.

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
I think Ubuntu remains now one of the most opinionated Linux experiences

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
and I mean that in a good way than many distros out there.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
There's some out there, I'm not taking away from all,

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
but they have a real branded look going.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
You can tell you're on an Ubuntu system right away.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
I can tell because I know enough Linux desktops.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
I can recognize usually a SUSE system and a Manjaro system,

46:14.000 --> 46:18.000
but the Ubuntu colors with the Ubuntu theme and all of it just really pop

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
and they're really iconic at this point.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
And it's great because we will often talk about how the distribution doesn't matter

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
and that is so true in so many ways now.

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
But there's still some differentiation out there.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
Like next week when we try Fedora 33,

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
it's going to be a very upstream experience, which is also a good thing.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
It's just a different experience.

46:41.000 --> 46:47.000
And I am very grateful that we have some standout differentiators in the desktop.

46:47.000 --> 46:52.000
Some may look at it as fragmentation, but I look at it as everybody taking a crack at something

46:52.000 --> 46:57.000
and sometimes like in the case of Ubuntu, I think they get it right

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
and they get some things nailed that maybe upstream should consider.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
I really like their dock implementation.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
It is super slick as an eGPU user.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
I very much appreciate that I can right click on an icon

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
and right there from my launcher in GNOME Shell,

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
I can say execute this application on the external GPU.

47:16.000 --> 47:21.000
That's on a Linux desktop, a mainstream Linux desktop.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Yeah, so I'm hitting that all the time for Steam.

47:23.000 --> 47:27.000
What I used to do, and they're all still in there actually when I think about it,

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
but I used to have to do it in the Steam launch options for every single game.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
And this is way better.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
It's just right there integrated in.

47:35.000 --> 47:39.000
Notifications for Telegram look great on the dock.

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
It's all really, really well done.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
And the experience of getting things up and going is simple.

47:45.000 --> 47:51.000
I'm not always clear on when I install something if I'm getting a snap or deb still,

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
but I'm starting to get a better sense the more I use the system when that's going to happen.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
So it'll be my driver.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
Any Ubuntu system I set up, it'll be a 2010.

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
Now, the real question will be if I end up sticking with 2010,

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
Fedora 33 or POP 2010, but that's all yet to be seen.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
We will be trying Fedora 33 next week.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
So if you want to install that when it's released

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
and join us in the mumble or join us in the chat room and share your thoughts

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
or in the Luplug, you are absolutely welcome.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
And congratulations to all the teams involved and all of the hard work.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
It's a killer release.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Woo-hoo!

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
It's pretty great.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
It's pretty great.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
Also, thank you to the Unplugged Core contributors.

48:32.000 --> 48:36.000
We really appreciate you helping us keep this show independent at unpluggedcore.com.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
You keep this show going.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
You help reduce the ad load needed to make the show profitable,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
and you also get some perks.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
As a core contributor, you get access to two different feeds of your choice.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Well, or both, I suppose.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Feed 1 is an ad, limited ad version.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
I have to be careful because there are some we are contractually obligated to include.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
But it is a limited ad version of the show.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
It's the same full production.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
It's got now Joe's special touch and sauce that has been sprinkled onto it

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
and then packaged up and released for your consumption.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
And that's Feed 1.

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
Then there's Feed 2, which is the full live stream.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
All our screw-ups, all the stuff that never makes it into the show,

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
our test audio when we take a break, if somebody gets disconnected,

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
the extended pre- and post-show, which is almost an entirely additional show,

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
that's all in that feed.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
And you can get that as well if you like something that's long

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
and maybe doesn't sound quite as good.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
Full disclosure.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
But it is absolutely out there,

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
and it's another way we can be fully transparent with our community.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
That's a special sauce on the side.

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
Unpluggedcore.com, you become a member, you support the show.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Now let's do a little feedback.

49:39.000 --> 49:44.000
We got some messages in about ESXi Arm and Fling.

49:44.000 --> 49:49.000
So since this first one is in my namesake, will you take it?

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Yeah, all right.

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
Chris writes, and actually I think this feedback was over on Telegram.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Just caught the recent episode of Links Unplugged.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
That'd be last week.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
And your comments regarding ESXi on the Pi.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
VMware seems to be targeting this as a platform for edge computing

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
and network services.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
At the end of the day, I think for you and I,

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
a Pi 4 is really only going to give you a very limited ESXi host

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
without much in the way of features.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
You know, at least without vCenter,

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
running on a much beefier hardware somewhere else on the network.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
But I'm looking to play with this as well,

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
and it might just be a catalyst for me to purchase a couple more Pis.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
Now I don't believe VMware sees the Pi as anything other than a test

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
and development platform, but it's exciting nonetheless.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
I think so.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Yeah, Debrass in the IRC is asking,

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
is there any take on performance of ESXi on the Pi versus KVM?

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
So we don't have our own internal numbers yet,

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
but I did do early testing on KVM, and it was unusable.

50:53.000 --> 50:59.000
It was just, it took 10 minutes for an ARM version of Debian to boot.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
It's not going to happen, guys.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
So if ESXi is doing better than that,

51:03.000 --> 51:08.000
and what I seem to observe so far, it is doing much better than that.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Also, there's a, as I understand it at the moment,

51:10.000 --> 51:14.000
a limitation where you're not able to use local storage

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
on the Raspberry Pi for ESXi,

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
so you need to use something like NFS or iSCSI.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
It does make me think that Chris, other Chris might be right in that,

51:22.000 --> 51:26.000
you know, this is still probably set up for larger or lab environments

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
where you've got those resources already there.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
That's not a big deal.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
It might be a little more work if you're trying to set it up

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
just to play with at home.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Yeah, I think that's well put.

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
And obviously, and I talked a little bit about this on,

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
I think, Koda Radio too, but it's hugely compelling for developers

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
who are targeting large ARM servers in the cloud,

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
but they need something local that doesn't cost them $3,000 to $6,000

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
just so they can do their dev test on.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
And so, you know, if you can get a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8 gigs of RAM,

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
and you can run maybe two test VMs just to try executing your code

52:01.000 --> 52:05.000
in an ARM environment that isn't necessarily very hardware-specific

52:05.000 --> 52:09.000
because the virtualization abstracts away the individual hardware components,

52:09.000 --> 52:12.000
it may mean that developers now have a really easily

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
and approachable way to develop ARM cloud software

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
and then, you know, build it locally on a Raspberry Pi with VMware

52:19.000 --> 52:23.000
and then deploy it on a big beefy VMware server in the cloud.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
That could be it.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Well, let's see.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
Drew actually, Drew came in with some feedback, voice mail style.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Hey, Chris. Hey, Wes.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
First time, long time.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
I was just listening to LUP 3.75,

52:34.000 --> 52:39.000
and I think you guys might have missed the mark a little bit about ESXi on ARM.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
Yes, I know it's on Fling,

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
but this doesn't feel like just some random experiment to me.

52:44.000 --> 52:50.000
It feels more like they're trying to move towards being able to support ARM data centers.

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
And the Raspberry Pi is a really great way to build a minimum viable project.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
You have known hardware and you can start building on ARM

52:59.000 --> 53:04.000
before you start looking at some of the bigger processors that have been coming out.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
I don't know, I could be wrong,

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
but this feels more to me like they are planning for the next five years

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
of trying to make sure that they are up to standards

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
of what data centers are going to look like.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
And that could be ARM.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Anyways, love the show.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Keep it up. Thanks, guys.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
Thanks, Drew.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Yeah, that's kind of where I'm thinking.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
What do you think about that, Wes?

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
It's really a move for developers.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
Yeah, right.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
I mean, it's a big change.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
In some ways, maybe not,

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
but you got to make sure everything actually works throughout your entire stack.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
And this is the first step down that road,

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
get you comfortable using ARM.

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
And yeah, okay, maybe the Pis aren't the hardware that ends up being deployed,

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
but local development needs something in dev,

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
you need something in staging before that you actually ship it on, you know,

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
whatever hardware gets allocated down the line once the contracts are all signed.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Raspberry Pis are ubiquitous already.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
Probably a lot of developers in this space have one or two

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
or however many you have, Chris, already.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
So if you're going to start somewhere, make it cheap and easy.

54:01.000 --> 54:06.000
I plead the fifth on that one.

54:11.000 --> 54:15.000
All right, let's do some picks before we get out of here.

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
Self-hosted 30 comes out later this week.

54:18.000 --> 54:24.000
And in there, we'll talk about this cool rig for like under $100

54:24.000 --> 54:29.000
that Alex built to stress test a bunch of USB drives that he shucked

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
with Prime Day and Black Friday coming up.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
He wanted to go through and figure out, like,

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
if you're going to buy a drive on Black Friday,

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
get this one because it's got XYZ drive in there.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
And he actually found a real gem, but I won't spoil it.

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
However, and we'll take out a little bit that he used on the stress test system.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
If you would like to test your own disk, get a sense of their smart status,

54:48.000 --> 54:53.000
but also put them through their paces, I recommend you check out bad blocks.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
You may have heard of it before.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
It's been around for a very long time.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
But if you never have, it's worth a go.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Give it a try.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Punish one of your disks and see what happens.

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
So, you know, for example, if you get a disk that has a smart error,

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
that gives you an idea that something's wrong.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
But what if there's something further down on the disk

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
that you don't really access that very often that wouldn't trigger a smart error?

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
It's only going to passively watch for errors.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
So what you can do with bad blocks is actively write simple patterns

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
to every block of the device and then check them.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Search for damaged areas.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Kind of like you would do with a RAM check, actually,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
only it's on a disk and it takes a long time.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
And this is just a great way to say you get a used disk

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
before you put it in production.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
Run this at it.

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
We have very graciously a listener, Mike, has sent us like a whole batch of disks.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
This would be a great tool because they're refurbished disks.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
I'll run this on it first before we put them into production.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
It's bad blocks.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
It's just that kind of forgotten Linux infrastructure and tooling,

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
you know, that we all have at our fingertips

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
because many sysadmins before us have come and gone

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
and these tools are out there.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
If you're going to invest in a whole bunch of stuff, yeah,

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
why not test it first?

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
Right.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
Also, shaking the disk to try to find the bad blocks does not work.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Chatroom is suggesting that.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
They are incorrect.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
It is a good workout though.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
If you'd like to be in our chatroom or our mumble room,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
we'd love to have you join us live.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
We do it every Tuesday at noon Pacific.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
See you next week.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
Same bad time, same bad station.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
We do it over at jblive.tv.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
We also stream at twitch.tv slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
If you just want to follow us over there if you're already a Twitch user,

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
you get notifications when we're live.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
Or get the download version.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
Honestly, it sounds the best.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
You can subscribe at linuxunplugged.com slash subscribe.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
The show is at Linux Unplugged.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
On the Twitter, I'm at Chris LAS.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
He's at Westpane.

56:43.000 --> 56:47.000
And the whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.000
Thanks to our guests for joining us this week.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
Thanks to our listeners.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
And thanks to all our core contributors.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
We'll see you right back here.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Not Monday.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
No, not Sunday.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
Wednesday?

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Nope, nope, nope, not Wednesday.

56:59.000 --> 57:11.000
Next Tuesday!

57:29.000 --> 57:39.000
Do not hammer your disks either.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
That will also damage them.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
I do know somebody.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
We all know somebody.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
We've known him.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
He's been on the shows before that does like to take a big drill to hard drives

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
before he throws them out and just goes to town.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
Just drilling holes into them.

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
Well, you can't trust that encryption, Chris.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
I go for D-band myself.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Before I give away a disk, I run old D-band on there.

58:01.000 --> 58:06.000
And that's my preferred way to clear a drive before I turn it over.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
You don't just fill it with a bunch of good JB content.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Why not, right?

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Here's the back catalog, stranger.

58:12.000 --> 58:31.000
That's a great idea.
