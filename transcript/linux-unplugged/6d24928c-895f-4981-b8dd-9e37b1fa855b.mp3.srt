1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
There was something else I wanted to share with the class before we started, before we go here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh yeah, this might be kind of fun.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This was submitted to the Linux Action Show subreddit.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Here at JB, we fantasize about 4K video, 60 frames per second,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and we kind of joke about how long it's going to take us to be able to get there.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Meanwhile, these guys in the pro field are doing 8K video under Linux.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're seeing footage that's 4K, 6K, even 8K footage now with the RED coming in

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
with the weapon and all that stuff.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So we have to be able to run this back in a time when I have clients paying to work with me,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
paying to sit with me, where things run real time, nice and smooth, there's no hiccups.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I mean, I have Resolve on my laptop, and if I tried to put an 8K shot in my laptop, it might explode.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We're running on a Linux system. I'll show you what we've got in here.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So here she is. This is where all the magic happens.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 163 for September 20th, 2016.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's always looking for an excuse to talk about video games.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hello, Wes. 163 is going to be a big show today, sir.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We have really big updates to get into.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Big Plasma desktop updates, GNOME updates coming down.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The hype is real, we'll tell you why.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It looks like Slack may have a legitimate open source competitor,

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and before you go to sleep, I'll tell you why you should care.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Then we'll answer the question, is your SSH password accidentally revealed if you connect to the wrong server?

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The answer may surprise you. Stay tuned for more.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's what they say on your local media.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And then later on in the show, we're going to get our gaming on.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The Linux Gamer on YouTube is joining us.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The Linux Gamer on Twitter is here.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We're going to dig into a little bit of what he's doing, what he's up to.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And then I want to talk about some new games that are coming out for Linux.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
One specifically that if they had a line where you could stand outside a store and camp overnight to get it,

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I would be in that line.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll tell you about that game towards the end of the show.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So that's all coming up today.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Before all of that, we've got to get into some project updates.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Some of the favorites out there have got big news, big changes coming down the pipe.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So Wes, what do you say we bring in our virtual love?

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's do it.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Time appropriate greetings, Bumba Room.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hey.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hello.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hello.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hello.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hello.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hello, guys.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hello, guys.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So I'm excited everybody's here because we have much to catch up on

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
because I prerecorded last Sunday's Linux action show.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So I feel like I've been off the air for Linux topics for a while now.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You're fresh.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're ready.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Did you hear that airplane flying overhead to welcome us?

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He wants to hear some Linux news, too.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I bet he's transporting lawn mowers to another part of the country that still has lawns to mow.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yep.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why don't we start off with some interesting news?

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This one's coming in from Microsoft, and I suspect I have a prediction that I suspect it's going to go kind of good for Linux users.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It starts with some bad news.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
They're shutting down their London office as they're going to develop yet another Skype client.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Did you hear about the shenanigans?

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's crazy.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Microsoft, like, here's what they got right now on the market.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah, they set it up very well here.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Currently, the company has the traditional Windows desktop app, the new universal Windows platform app for Windows 10,

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Windows 10 mobile, Xbox apps, the Skype web client, a web-based or electron-based standalone app for Linux,

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
which reportedly has internal builds for Windows, too.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And, of course, then Skype has an iOS app, an Android app, and a Mac OS client.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So it's an excessive number of clients.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's ridiculous.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And so what Ars Technica is reporting is that Microsoft's solution has developed yet another client.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That'll solve it.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This one called Skype for Life.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think that means it's for everything.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Skype for Life.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I feel like that could be in a tattoo.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The one client to rule them all, as you could say, will be cross-platform, covering not just Windows, but Linux, Mac OS, iOS, and Android.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And you know what I read into that?

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This is my prediction.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That sounds like the electron app they started working on for Linux.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
They're like, oh, this is a good idea.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Turns out everyone's making everything an electron app.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I guess we'll jump on board.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's do it.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The new client along with Skype for Business and the new Slack-like Skype team features are being developed back in Redmond.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So the development's going to be happening here in Washington, in our neck of the woods.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is, I think, going to be one of the first huge apps, really one of the biggest apps using electron everywhere, eventually.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I would think they could be one of the first.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I know they're like, you and I, are you still using N1?

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes, a little bit.

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Probably one of the other most advanced electron apps I've ever used.

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's very sophisticated, lots of features.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And then my list begins to trail off on the level of sophistication of electron apps, and I usually think of them as bloated and slow.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Right, then it's just kind of a wrapper around a webpage.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is an interesting maybe.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't want to call it focus yet, but it's maybe focus coming onto the Skype platform, which I don't know.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I know some Linux users who feel kind of trapped because they have a lot of friends on Skype still.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
They have a Windows VM for it or whatever.

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If we can get somewhere where we don't need that.

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Jitsi meet everybody.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, Jitsi meet's a better way to go too.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay, so anyone in the Mamba room, if you have any thoughts on Skype, you are welcome to chime in, but I assume we'd probably just move on.

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I think we all kind of agree Skype is, it feels like it's yesterday's thing.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
A lot of us still have to use it.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm one of them.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So I can't say nobody uses Skype, but it feels like, oh, that's next on my list to stop using.

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We need like a plug-in that just sends people Jitsi meet rooms.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah, exactly.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm not available on this proprietary platform.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay, so let's talk about the next big releases from both GNOME and Plasma, or KD I suppose.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
These are going to be huge, and there's been some hype already started for GNOME 3.22.

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I thought I'd cover a couple of the nice items.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This is supposed to release tomorrow as we record this, so that's why we're going to talk about this.

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think the one that most of us will probably appreciate the most are the changes to Nautilus.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Nautilus' code base has been unified.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah, they're hyping this up a lot.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, they say newcomers can be able to dig in a little easier, which kind of makes sense.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, that's an impressive feature, especially if you're cleaning up a lot of cruft.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That takes a lot of work.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah, the internals are in a lot better shape.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There's a new batch rename tool.

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They've integrated file compression, which also integrates with the new Nautilus progress popover.

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
To build that in, they've been using FileRoller for years now.

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Also, it makes me feel like I know people are still upset about when they change things, they kind of drop a lot of features.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It feels like maybe now they're kind of adding some things, but they're doing it, or at least trying to do it in a cohesive,

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
thought-out, holistic approach where it fits when they do have it.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah, and as an example, so the detail, it sounds like, oh yeah, they've integrated compression into the file manager, whoop-de-do.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But actually, when they do this, they do it in a real unique kind of way.

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They really pay attention to details, and it's not just that they've integrated with the popover.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It also supports all of the standard key commands and functionalities that users just expect from Nautilus.

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So undo capability and things like that that traditionally you don't have, you now have,

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
because, well, as an end user, that's what you expect with Nautilus, so they deliver that functionality in the compression.

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So I think there's actually some nice work that went into it.

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Gnome Calendar is actually usable now with support for alarms.

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Hey, nice.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There isn't a good idea.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And the ability to drag and drop events and move them around on the calendar, again.

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Also, yeah.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Gnome Music got a big, big rework. It's fast as hell now, they say.

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And Gnome Games is kind of neat. I haven't played with it myself.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm going to reserve judgment to comment on it.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm a little skeptical at this point, but supposedly it automatically discovers ROMs on your box,

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
automatically downloads the cover art for it.

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Then you double click and it launches the appropriate emulator, assuming you have it installed.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Again, I'm a little skeptical of that particular feature.

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It seems like an interesting feature for a free software type platform.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But if it makes it pretty, I'm not opposed to it.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Now, there's also been some nice improvements to this version of GTK,

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
which I don't know if I'm fully up to date to speak on.

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't know if anybody in the Mumber Room has a better grasp of some of the big changes that are coming in GTK 3.22.

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I know Wimpy does, so if he stops by later, we might ask him.

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He's in the front and center of it.

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Ferronix covers a couple other features that I think we could grok a little easily.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I think probably one of the first places, or maybe not, it depends on the release,

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
but everybody takes a little while to ship Gnome,

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
so Fedora 25 will likely be one of the first places you can get Gnome 3.22.

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So far, one of the hopeful features of Fedora 25 is Wayland out of the box by default now.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh boy.

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And in conjunction, again, Gnome 3.22 has seen a ton of work for Wayland support.

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Big improvements here in this.

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So that's one of the major features in Gnome 3.22 that has also gotten some improvement.

162
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And Gnome software now supports flat packs.

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I wonder if there's anything that should be something for Gnome releases.

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You know how good kernels are, aren't they weasels?

165
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I wonder if there should be like Gnome.

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
At least in the three branches, there's been a lot of like, well, that's kind of the turning point,

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
when everyone started using it, and maybe we're coming to another good stable point.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah, maybe we can pick up on this next week when I know more,

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
but I seem to recall there's something important about Gnome 3.22 being a longer-term,

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
like, stable, predictable GTK.

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And I don't remember why that is, but I do remember there being some details about that.

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So maybe we'll pick it up next week if we can dig up the details.

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Stay tuned.

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So there's your Gnome update, now here's your Plasma update.

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Gnome 5.8 is also going to be released soon, and this is going to be a long-term support edition.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And there's a bunch of new updates and improvements to it, like improved desktop widgets,

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
the ability to sort of refresh the backend on things like the KDE App Store,

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
they've improved the Breeze theme, so it has a unified look across basically all toolkits,

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Qt 4, 5, GTK 2, 3.

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So even LibreOffice kind of looks like it belongs on a Breeze desktop now, which is pretty nice.

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
KDE Connect, the super cool app that connects your Android device and lets you text from your desktop

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and transfer files and copy files and clipboard stuff, that's going to be front and center in this release.

183
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And they also have unified boot up to shut down artwork, all kinds of things.

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And I will say when the release comes out, keep an eye out for their video because last release,

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't know if you remember this, Wes, because I can't remember if it was last or if it was this show,

186
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
but I teased them for not having a very good release video.

187
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That was our show.

188
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Was it? Yeah.

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So I teased them, I said, come on guys, when you have a big release like this,

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
you got to up the production a little bit, you got to have a better release video.

191
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And I said, look, I'll do it for free.

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Just ask if you want somebody to do it for you, I'll do it for free.

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So they actually took me up on it.

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No way.

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah, so I won't play it, but here's a little...

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
After a few hard months of work, the KDE community is pleased to announce Plasma 5.8 Long Term Support Edition.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So you'll have to watch the video to hear the whole thing.

198
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh, that's great.

199
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So they did take me up on it and I thought, all right, fine, I'll record it.

200
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So I think when they ship it, that'll be in there.

201
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So go there and watch it and see how it turned out for yourself.

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But I thought, good for them.

203
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I gave them a razzing and they held me up, they held me accountable.

204
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Well, it goes to show that they want to appreciate the input and to see the importance.

205
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Like, you know, just that little bit of extra work can go a long way in making people excited about your release.

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah.

207
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So that's nice to see.

208
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, that's true, and it helps communicate what you've been working so damn hard on.

209
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Exactly.

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Now, speaking of working hard, people are working hard to replace Slack.

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Now, don't skip ahead.

212
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is actually kind of important if you care about open source software development.

213
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
See, Slack has taken a critical role at many prominent open source projects to communicate the team.

214
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Now, I know you might be skeptical, you might be like, why I got IRC, I got the Telegram, why the hell do I need Slack?

215
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't want to debate that.

216
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
People have decided for whatever reasons they need it.

217
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And if you work in a professional space, you likely run into Slack.

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
How many – are you in a few Slack groups?

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm three at least.

220
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Three?

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah, I'm in three myself as well.

222
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And so this is why I'm always kind of keeping an eye out for something that is open, something that you can self-host,

223
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
because I would really love to see open source development move over that.

224
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Some projects, you know, they just mailing lists are good enough for us, or we're going to run Rocket Chat.

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But a lot of projects, they just don't have the time or the people to run the back-end infrastructure.

226
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They need something that works, that they can just use, that's free, that they don't have to maintain.

227
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So that's why Riot's kind of interesting, and it's caught TechCrunch's, Mike Butcher's, attention.

228
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And he writes that Riot wants to be like Slack, but with the flexibility of an underlying open source platform.

229
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We've talked about Matrix before on the show.

230
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
In fact, we've interviewed the guys behind it on the show before.

231
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And Riot, which we've talked about in the past as Vector, we've covered Vector in the past.

232
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Vector.im was their old site.

233
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Has been renamed to Riot, and they are launching like a Slack-like service that is powered by Matrix on the back-end

234
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
that you can either run on their servers or self-host.

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And it's not bad.

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
No.

237
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It supports Matrix's encryption, so that's kind of nice.

238
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It has end-to-end encryption, as they put it, using Matrix's Malcom? MG Malcom?

239
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah, I think that's Malcom.

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Their type of encryption, I guess.

241
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And teams can have the flexibility of self-hosting, which is also very nice.

242
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So this could be big.

243
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You and I were just quickly experimenting with it this morning.

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, I just got it down on my phone.

245
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, how's the app?

246
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I didn't get a chance to play with the mobile app.

247
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It looks pretty nice.

248
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, I suspect the mobile app might be nicer than the web app.

249
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, it definitely looks like it, but it synced up here nicely.

250
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's showing all this.

251
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Now, the big question is, is the GIF animated on the mobile app?

252
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Oh, let's see.

253
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Because it is not animated in the web version, and I've got to have animated GIFs.

254
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh, no.

255
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It doesn't look like it.

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You know, mine was animated in the web version, but it was very inconsistent.

257
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, you know, it's downloading the phone.

258
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It might have just been a preview here trying to save my bandwidth.

259
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Consider yourself either that could be a feature or a downside.

260
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But I kid, that's super cool to see a real Slack competitor coming.

261
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yep.

262
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And one thing that interests me is I've been looking at Mattermost, looking at Rocketcat again.

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
GIFs.

264
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
GIFs.

265
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Sorry.

266
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, Mattermost is nice too.

267
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And I like those things, but it's interesting the matrix backend just because if matrix

268
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
takes off, then this benefits a lot just by that in the bigger ecosystem.

269
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Matrix already has all kinds of different bridges, Slack bridges, that kind of stuff.

270
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So if we can see development there, it might benefit all kinds of different clients.

271
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
There's command line clients.

272
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
There's web clients.

273
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There's this client.

274
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I still – I think I'd have to really speak intelligently about Riot.

275
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It was just announced today on TechCrunch – I saw it on TechCrunch – or yesterday.

276
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I would have to try setting it up because that's one of the things about – like

277
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Pope is joking in the chat room, but there legitimately is a snap to set up RocketChat.

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
In fact, I think you can even – I think on RocketChat's website, I think they even

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
have like a spin up on DigitalOcean button.

280
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah, I believe both Docker – I mean both Mattermost and RocketChat have Docker images

281
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
as well.

282
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You've got to be really easy.

283
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's the thing because Slack is you click one button.

284
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And in fact, you can do it from your phone even I think.

285
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Right.

286
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Slack even goes as far as having that beta Linux electron app.

287
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So yeah, the competition is pretty high.

288
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah, that's nice too.

289
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's nice too.

290
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And then of course, you have that massive intranstraction which is why we're still

291
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
talking about Skype to this day.

292
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's the same problem.

293
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And I don't know how you overcome that.

294
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So it has to be people that know what they want and they have to elect to use it.

295
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But maybe they'll have a chance.

296
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'll have to check it out too because one big thing for us is like at work for instance,

297
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
like the Slack charger is a pretty big thing if you want like single sign-on type LDAP

298
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
integration.

299
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Mattermost, you have to pay for it as well.

300
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
RocketChat has a plug-in for free.

301
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm wondering where they're going to fall in that because a lot of times it seems like

302
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
places end up migrating because they need that extra accountability or separation control.

303
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Geez, that could get expensive fast.

304
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah, for sure.

305
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What were you going to say, William?

306
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Go ahead.

307
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh, I was going to say they already have the LDAP integration.

308
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
So single sign-on should work if you're doing it through LDAP.

309
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Okay, that's great.

310
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
On the matrix side.

311
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And I think what's also great about this over Mattermost or RocketChat or Slack is that

312
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
everyone can host their own and it's federated so you can talk to other people's home servers.

313
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I do like the federation.

314
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Chris could host one.

315
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Wes could host one.

316
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I could host one.

317
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah.

318
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
We could all be in the same chat and all the messages would get distributed to all the

319
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
home servers every time someone sends something.

320
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That sounds kind of fun to try.

321
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Just like it should be.

322
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's super cool because it means you can control all your own data but be a part of

323
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
someone else's chat without having to go through their server.

324
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah.

325
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So William, how much have you played with this?

326
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I've been playing with this since May because I wanted to use it as a way to replace Quossel

327
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
as an IRC client.

328
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So you were playing with it as Vector?

329
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah.

330
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Well, I was playing, yeah, as Vector.

331
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I mean, it's basically still Vector, right?

332
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Like they announced the name change but they're still doing all the code through the Vector

333
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
IAM web client and through the iOS and Android clients.

334
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
They're all the same code base still.

335
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

336
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Just a rename.

337
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So a sound endorsement though, huh?

338
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's been really, really nice.

339
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah, yeah.

340
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I've been using the IRC Bridge to connect to IRC and it's been super handy in that way

341
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
because I like the app much more than I liked Quossel on say iOS.

342
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh, sure.

343
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah, I can see that.

344
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So how difficult is it to set up the Vector or now the Riot server?

345
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It was kind of painful for me but I mean I'm already kind of trudging my own way building

346
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
my own packages and creating my own stuff anyway so everything is kind of painful in

347
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
that sense.

348
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It doesn't bother me too much.

349
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It wasn't like it just deploy on DigitalOcean button or something, huh?

350
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So that doesn't really interest me so I mean I don't have a good opinion on like easy install.

351
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I feel like if I was going to use it in production I would want to build it myself too but if

352
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I want to just try it for a weekend to see if maybe there's a use for it then I'm more

353
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
inclined to just do an easy setup.

354
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I mean it's a couple of components, right?

355
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So you have like this Node.js thing that is the IRC Bridge connecting to the home server

356
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
which you also set up and then there's an identity server for handling all the logins

357
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
that you also have to run.

358
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Microservices.

359
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah, you've got all these microservices and so it is a little weird to get set up the

360
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
first time.

361
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's funny.

362
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Back in my day we called those dependencies.

363
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That was before JSON was invented, Chris.

364
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You're so old.

365
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Now, yeah, I know.

366
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It looks like the chat's trying to tell you there is a Slack bridge too so if you wanted

367
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
to have Slack conversations in Matrix you could import them in real time.

368
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah.

369
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
See that's the thing that I think right there really appeals to me about Riot is on the

370
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
back end you have all of the capabilities of Matrix.

371
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Like it's inherent WebRTC.

372
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And you can use whatever client you want.

373
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah.

374
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Right, exactly.

375
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah, that's another good point.

376
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You wouldn't have to use the Riot client either.

377
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I do like the way that sounds.

378
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And without having to wait for Slack.

379
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And you could use both simultaneously.

380
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You could have Riot on your phone and you could use whatever command line client you

381
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
have on the desktop.

382
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And if you want to develop your own client.

383
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yeah, exactly.

384
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Super flexible.

385
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
All right.

386
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I think this is the most exciting messaging text so far that we have.

387
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I am officially hyped.

388
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I am officially hyped and you managed to get me hyped over something that I think some

389
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
of the audience probably just snoozes out over like they couldn't care less about this

390
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
kind of stuff.

391
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Well, maybe I'll play and try to get my own server set up and some we can check back in

392
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
in a couple of shows.

393
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yeah, I think it's mixed.

394
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I think some people care a lot.

395
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So yeah, I would be curious to keep following up on it.

396
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Thanks, William.

397
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That's good hands on information to have.

398
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So why don't we take a moment before we stray too far from the self-hosting topic and let's

399
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
talk about DigitalOcean, our first sponsor this week.

400
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If you'd like to go spin up a droplet and try out anything that we've been talking about

401
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
on the show that you can host yourself, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

402
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's one word.

403
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You smush it all together and you can just apply it to your DigitalOcean balance.

404
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You get a $10 credit.

405
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Now you can try out their $5 rig two months for free or take advantage of their hourly

406
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
pricing.

407
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider that has a freaking great infrastructure all

408
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
running on top of Linux rigs with SSDs.

409
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
They use KVM for the virtualizer and then they wrap it in this UI that's so freaking

410
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
great.

411
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
If they shipped this as a standalone desktop application, you'd be like, damn, well, that's

412
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
just a great UI.

413
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But the fact that it's a freaking web page, it works on all my different browsers.

414
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Even on Linux, I can get HTML5 style right in all good console-ness access.

415
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Console goodness in my browser.

416
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What?

417
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I love it and that's really where the secret sauce lies for some things.

418
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

419
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
They got data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto, Germany,

420
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
India.

421
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I just like that Toronto one because I like to think that my data is close to Alan Jude.

422
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah, right.

423
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Just close.

424
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He's just there watching over it.

425
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Even if he's not personally there, I feel like perhaps his aura extends around data

426
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and it will protect my droplets.

427
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's the only reason otherwise Toronto is Canada.

428
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Come on, right?

429
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Who knows what happens up there.

430
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED and check out that great interface.

431
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They're a straightforward API where there's tons of good open source code already written

432
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
and they now have high memory droplets where you can get over 200 gigs of RAM on your droplet

433
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
and like a nuts amount of just SSD storage for days.

434
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And plus they have high availability block storage.

435
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You can just attach it to your droplet as you need it up to 16 terabytes all backed by SSDs.

436
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's super nice.

437
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
They're really hitting that perfect mix where you're like, well, if I want to just try and

438
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
develop it, maybe I have an idea for a thing.

439
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And then you get real users and they make it so easy to just take that and instantly

440
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
scale up and they've got like a real production grade server running or five of them.

441
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And I think this is – I want to stress this point for people that are collaborating over

442
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
the internet, working with either it's like an open source project or in our case it's

443
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
podcast production, having a few tools like a Slack or a Mattermost or Telegram and having

444
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
something like DigitalOcean where you can work as a team and you can try things out

445
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and people can be spinning up droplets.

446
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And because the interface is so straightforward, we all know how the interface works and there's

447
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
been times where I'll log my account in right here on a machine and I'll be upstairs testing

448
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
something and Rekai can come down here and do the things he needs to do right there in

449
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
the DigitalOcean interface because it's the same interface he uses upstairs.

450
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's super easy for the whole team to speak the same language about this stuff.

451
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's like the opposite of AWS.

452
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You don't need to take two courses just to understand it.

453
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Really, legitimately, it just helps us get going and just figure stuff out as fast as possible.

454
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and a big thank you to DigitalOcean

455
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

456
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Over 200 gigs of RAM in a droplet.

457
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That's nuts.

458
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That is full on nuts.

459
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So let's get through these updates because we got things to talk about.

460
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But I did mention there is that question, if you log in to an incorrect, if you attempt

461
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
to log in to an incorrect SSH server, does your SSH password get revealed?

462
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Now before I reveal the answer, before I tell you what it is, what does somebody in the

463
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
mumble room want to take a guess?

464
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
If you put the wrong IP address into your SSH client and you try to type in your username

465
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and password, could that password be revealed to the SSH server you're connecting to?

466
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
What do you think?

467
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
No.

468
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I mean.

469
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't think so.

470
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
All right, okay.

471
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yes, it could.

472
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Oh!

473
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
All right, let's go with it.

474
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Here we go.

475
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Let's see.

476
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
We still have to make sense of the yes or no, right?

477
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So here's, basically the answer is yes and here's why.

478
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And this is over at Stack Exchange.

479
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
If you connect to a machine, when you connect to it, the session is encrypted, but what

480
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
gets essentially sent inside that encrypted session is basically clear text.

481
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The password that hits the system is inside an encrypted SSH session.

482
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So it's not going over the web or the internet as clear text, but inside that connection

483
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
it is clear text.

484
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And you could configure PAM if you were evil enough to dump that password to a text file

485
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
when somebody attempts to log in.

486
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You'd have to mess.

487
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Or just a fake little service running on port 22 for you.

488
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh, that would do it too, yeah.

489
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But this enables all that PAM magic or LDAP integration or the Yubikey one-time password.

490
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
So they need it in clear text that you can send it to a third-party service to actually

491
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
verify that it works.

492
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Right.

493
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But if you had, and I actually had a listener contact me about this.

494
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
He's like, I meant to log into one of my local IP addresses, but I fudged a couple of the

495
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
numbers or saw I can't remember the details and I connected to a public SSH server that

496
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
had something listening on 22 and I attempted to log in a few times.

497
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And he asked me, do they have my username and password now?

498
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And after we were looking into it, I had to tell him, you need to change the password

499
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
because that is a super common IP address that you just accidentally connected to.

500
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And he totally agreed.

501
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
He's like, yeah, I mean, it's possible they just set it up there.

502
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And legitimately, if you just configured PAM correctly to spit all this stuff out, it'd

503
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
just be a real easy poor man's password dump.

504
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Log the IP it's from, take that, log back into it.

505
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
This is why you should use a key.

506
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yes.

507
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
At least.

508
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yes.

509
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yeah.

510
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
At least a key.

511
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah.

512
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Go ahead.

513
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Or take host key verification seriously, at least.

514
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah.

515
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That is not one of those options.

516
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It'll say that the key doesn't match.

517
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You've never connected to the server before.

518
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Right.

519
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Good point.

520
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Good point.

521
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You should notice that.

522
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I think now in this particular listener's case, it was on a brand new machine.

523
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And that could totally happen to me, too, where I don't move my known host file around.

524
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah.

525
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I am horrible with this kind of stuff.

526
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I really just – because I reload machines so often for reviews that it's really hard

527
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
to actually stay on top of it.

528
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And especially then maybe you're spinning up and down a lot of hosts and you end up

529
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
changing DSS names a lot.

530
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh, yeah.

531
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Oh, yeah.

532
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Oh, yeah.

533
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Yeah.

534
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It can get confusing really quickly.

535
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Oh, yeah.

536
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,600
So while we're talking about SSH, Wes has found some magic that claims to be modern

537
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,200
SSH for clusters and teams.

538
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,960
And it's thrown a lot of features in our face.

539
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,400
It says that it has no need for distributed keys.

540
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,440
It can enforce two-factor authentication, including things like Google Authenticator,

541
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,480
I believe.

542
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,840
You have collaboration, so you can actually have shared sessions or support session sharing.

543
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,520
It can record and replay SSA sessions.

544
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,600
And it has cluster introspection.

545
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,040
Now this is where it loses me, Wes.

546
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,680
I don't know what cluster introspection is.

547
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,760
Every teleport node becomes a part of a cluster and is visible on a web UI.

548
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,280
So this is for people that have a lot of systems.

549
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Yes.

550
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,260
And so there's a couple other systems that are comparable to this.

551
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,440
Like Netflix has one called Bless that they use.

552
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,440
It's pretty neat.

553
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,420
They run it in an Amazon Lambda function that basically they use their own certificate authority

554
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,620
for SSH.

555
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,660
Also open source.

556
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,560
Also open source, which is great, and how you can use AWS primitives to build this neat

557
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,040
authentication layer.

558
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,680
And the teleport guys, they run their own private SaaS company offering type thing.

559
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,000
They're just trying to set this up for a lot of big companies.

560
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
There's another one from Facebook that actually have a really great tutorial in the show notes

561
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,120
kind of talking about how to set up your own SSH infrastructure with certificates, how

562
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
you can use that.

563
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
That is a great article.

564
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,120
It really is a great article.

565
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,120
We have all that linked in the show notes.

566
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,400
And so in your Facebook, you have security people.

567
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,320
You have multitudes of engineers with time on their hands to build you this kind of system.

568
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,600
And the Facebook article, it tells you enough to do it yourself, but it's not all the pieces.

569
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,800
They have some of their own pieces.

570
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,080
How they handle the like, hey, I have my, here's my thing, sign it with your certificate.

571
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,400
That part kind of, you need your own.

572
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,360
So teleport has a solution for you.

573
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,760
You do have to kind of replace some of your SSH daemons and that sort of stuff.

574
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,200
So why would I want a certificate for my SSH login?

575
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,520
Why would I want certificate based SSH logins?

576
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,640
So we've just kind of talked about how passwords are bad.

577
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,760
A lot of people then go to keys, but when you're like an enterprise style organization,

578
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,600
keys can be unwieldy.

579
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,300
You either are rolling your own system to manage the keys and make sure that they're

580
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,520
getting to ship it to the right host.

581
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,680
And when user separates, you have to remove that.

582
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
And how secure is that?

583
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Yeah.

584
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,920
How much are you staying on top of that?

585
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,920
And so certificates, you can set it up so that each of your hosts trust a certificate

586
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,640
and then they're looking for something to be signed with that certificate.

587
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,140
But you can also have, they use what's called principles.

588
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,360
And so you can basically, you have your own, your public part of the key, right?

589
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,760
And you give it to them and you can then like maybe do an LDAP check.

590
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
I don't know.

591
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
It depends on how you do it for the background.

592
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,720
And so then the advantage here is if it's certificate based, then it checks to see if

593
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,200
the cert's valid when I connect.

594
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,680
And so that means as an IT department, I could revoke somebody's access to all my servers

595
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,480
simply by disabling or revoking their certificate.

596
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
Exactly.

597
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
You can also have it be time bound, right?

598
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,240
So, all right, you can have, you have root on this box, but you have it for the two hours

599
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,440
of your change window and then otherwise no.

600
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,240
And then it can also, you can, when you get that cert signed stuff, you can have it list

601
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
the principles.

602
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,080
So you can be like, okay, you're allowed to do root on these hosts and you're allowed

603
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,760
to do this person or those.

604
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,940
And as long as that's set up, that's what they get.

605
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,960
So Teleport provides this as like, if you're not a company that's big enough to make that

606
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,460
infrastructure yourself, but you want auditability, you want to be able to have logs, you want

607
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,440
to have maybe a nice web UI to configure who has access and who doesn't, Teleport gets

608
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,520
that all for you ready to go.

609
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Wow.

610
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,520
And it's all open source?

611
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Yeah.

612
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
And so this is maybe like a software option.

613
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,040
Dylan has mentioned a couple like hardware boxes.

614
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,960
This, though, for somebody who even just has like a handful of droplets might actually

615
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
be kind of useful.

616
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Yes.

617
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Right?

618
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
I mean, especially just, you know, it's all centralized.

619
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,580
I think what they're talking about with like the introspection is you, you know, rather

620
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,360
than just hoping that you have it, you can see, you can make sure all your nodes are

621
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
online.

622
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,520
It's a little bit kind of like a, like a chef or a configuration management where you have

623
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,640
a little bit of metadata associated with your whole cluster.

624
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
Yeah.

625
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
I follow that.

626
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,640
That's kind of nice.

627
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,880
A web UI for my SSH connections.

628
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
I don't know.

629
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,960
I thought Mosh was pretty hip.

630
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
I thought I was hip with Mosh.

631
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,200
So if you're willing to do a little bit of a, you know, stack change, this might be something

632
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,240
to try out, especially if you kind of building your own little cloud and you want some better

633
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,240
security.

634
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,440
Speaking of building your own little cloud, and I'm busting through these updates because

635
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,840
I want to, I want to get to the gaming stuff.

636
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
I'm chewing at the bit.

637
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,560
And plus I just haven't had a chance to talk with Gartner since we were at System76, so

638
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,800
I'm looking, looking forward to that.

639
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,360
But I hinted, oh man, oh, oh man, oh man.

640
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,420
Last week's show, two hint bombs and I don't know how many of you caught the first one.

641
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,120
There was two massive hint bombs in last week's Linux Unplugged.

642
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,640
The first one was about a surprise from the next cloud project that would be announced

643
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,640
in the coming days.

644
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,960
I'm about to reveal what that was right now.

645
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,320
And the second one, and he's not here probably on purpose, is Wimpy got a new job.

646
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
Did you hear about this?

647
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,320
Yes I did.

648
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,320
And Ryan totally called it in last week's episode.

649
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Yes he did.

650
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,320
Oh man, he was spot on.

651
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,000
And I felt, and I was like, I downplayed it because like it felt super awkward to be saying

652
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
that.

653
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I was like, oh, come on.

654
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,560
And I tried to get Wimpy out of it for him because it was like, it felt awkward.

655
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,200
But he was totally right.

656
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,440
Wimpy is now working at Canonical.

657
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,920
So congratulations to him.

658
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
Congrats.

659
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
That's great.

660
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
He's going to do a lot of good work there.

661
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,920
Congrats.

662
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
That's awesome.

663
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
It is.

664
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,080
And since he's not here, and I'm going to make him pay for it, I'm going to embarrass

665
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,160
him.

666
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,680
You always watch these companies that are super important to our Linux experience to

667
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,240
see if they're making good decisions, to see when they fumble.

668
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,520
And everybody loves to point to things like Ubuntu TV.

669
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,520
Look what they did there.

670
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,260
They never shipped it.

671
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:08,360
But rarely do you get to see a company show its cards at how insightful it actually is

672
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:15,000
into people that have really contributed something solid to open source.

673
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,280
They showed their nimbleness recently when they organized around getting the SnapCraft

674
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
sprint and all that stuff.

675
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
And they brought people in.

676
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,720
They showed their nimbleness, which seemed clever.

677
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,040
But it didn't necessarily show a ton of insight.

678
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:36,880
I genuinely believe that by hiring Wimpy, it shows insight that Canonical has into the

679
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,040
people that are contributing in their community.

680
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,920
And really, it's many of the steps they've been taking, with their quick adoption of

681
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:49,040
Ubuntu Mate as a flavor, with making Wimpy an official Ubuntu contributor and member,

682
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,220
and now with hiring him at Canonical.

683
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,680
And I have a sense, I've spoken with Wimpy, and I have a sense of what his contribution

684
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,680
will be.

685
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
And it's brilliant.

686
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,920
It's just absolutely brilliant, and it shows that Canonical isn't so far up in their cloud

687
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,160
strategy heads.

688
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,160
They're not so far up there that they can't come down to the ground level and say, these

689
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,260
people are making a difference.

690
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,120
We should bring them in, give them a paycheck, and utilize their great skills.

691
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:19,500
And that move that they just made shows that cleverness in a way that I don't think we've

692
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,680
seen out of the company in a while.

693
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:27,240
I think it also shows a good commitment to, just as much as we've seen Unity 7, Stagnator.

694
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,800
We haven't been necessarily happy with it, and it seems like they've focused a lot on

695
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,200
mobile and there's obviously a big cloud focus.

696
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,520
And so I think it shows that their official support here, them supporting the community

697
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,880
and the clear momentum that Mate has around it and Wimpy, it kind of seems like, yes,

698
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,080
this traditional desktop paradigm, yes, these values, yes, the community who supports those

699
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,960
is still an important aspect to Canonical.

700
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,500
And just like when ByteMark became an infrastructure sponsor for the project and they said, these

701
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,920
are one of the things that happen that make a distribution in it for the long haul that

702
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,480
you can count on maybe another decade or generations of releases.

703
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,600
This too, this is a move because it's not like Wimpy hasn't had a day job already.

704
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,760
He's had a day job.

705
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,300
He's been maintaining Ubuntu Mate while he has a day job.

706
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,760
Now his day job is going to be more directly aligned with supporting that project.

707
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,240
Not directly, but obviously if you're sitting there speaking with Canonical staff every

708
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,280
single day and you're working on Canonical projects and you have direct insight on the

709
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,920
direction of where it's going, you are in a much better position to maintain a flavor

710
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,860
of Ubuntu.

711
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,860
It's obvious.

712
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:31,320
So it's a huge win for Ubuntu Mate users too, which are growing rapidly.

713
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,080
So there you go.

714
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:39,880
And I think it's Popi Jhampi, yeah, Popi mentions that they do have openings at Canonical.

715
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,680
Yeah, there's quite a few here.

716
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,160
Oh, maybe they're just desperate then.

717
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
I don't know.

718
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:49,320
All right, so this was what I, that was hinted later in the show last week.

719
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,120
Earlier in the show I hinted that Nextcloud had a surprise for us and here it is.

720
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,520
With the Nextcloud box, and I think this is kind of clever because it is inside a box,

721
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,560
in the box for the Nextcloud box, you get a one terabyte USB 3 hard drive from Western

722
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,760
Digital, you get the Nextcloud case with room for a drive and a board, you get a micro USB

723
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,400
charger, cable and adapters and a screwdriver and screws, you get a micro SD card loaded

724
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:19,600
with snappy Ubuntu core, and you get Nextcloud 10 pre-installed with Apache and MySQL configured.

725
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,720
But what you don't get is the compute board, you supply that yourself.

726
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,400
The box is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 2, which you need to supply.

727
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,440
The box can also fit the Raspberry Pi 3 and the Odroid C2.

728
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,240
Just go with 3, why would you use that?

729
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,880
I know, I know, right?

730
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,640
And I kind of, I don't know how much it is because I have been traveling so I didn't

731
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,480
get a chance to look after they announced it.

732
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
What's the C right here?

733
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,920
I want either, I either want to pick one up or I'm going to ask Josh if he'll send me

734
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,920
a review unit.

735
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,920
Looks like it's like 80 bucks, US.

736
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,440
I think I might just buy one then.

737
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
Yeah, that seems actually pretty neat.

738
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,360
Yeah, I would like to try it out.

739
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,040
I would like to really try that out.

740
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,680
I would like more storage but it's a good starting place and it's a good way to introduce

741
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:02,400
people to Nextcloud and Nextcloud supports online storage options too.

742
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,160
So if you got to grow, that's a solid option.

743
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,020
So that seems like a nice little place for hobbyists to kind of get it.

744
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,760
Maybe you're not that interested in having it run on a cloud droplet or whatever and

745
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,520
you just kind of want something to sit by your TV or sit in the basement somewhere.

746
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:21,880
I think too, 80 bucks isn't going to break the bank for some and if you have some investment

747
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:27,280
in Nextcloud as an ongoing open source project, probably not a bad way to not just throw a

748
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,600
little money towards Nextcloud but also to validate to hardware partners that Nextcloud

749
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,240
was worth their time and that might be the bigger long term benefit that we as a community

750
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,760
could do here is if we pick this thing up, it shows Western Digital and it shows everybody

751
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,680
that's involved with this, all the hardware partners that, hey, this company actually

752
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
shipped some orders.

753
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,680
We should pay attention to them.

754
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,600
Wouldn't that be great if we could kind of set those up to facilitate those kinds of

755
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
partnerships?

756
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Right, because what happens next?

757
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,600
What happens next?

758
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,360
And the conversation is, well, what is it about this people like?

759
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,200
Well, it's got this Nextcloud thing on it.

760
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,920
Well, what's so great about Nextcloud?

761
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,440
Well then the answer to that is, well, you get the control of your own data and it's

762
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,900
not on a hosted service and wouldn't that be a great conversation for all these companies

763
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,900
to start having?

764
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
Yes.

765
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,900
Like I'm fine with embracing a hardware provider.

766
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,840
You know, maybe they have great hardware, but I don't want to use their weird half-supported

767
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,880
proprietary platform.

768
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,880
So if they can partner with someone that has open source support, that would be amazing.

769
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,680
And then you could see, I mean, it could start Western, you know, this could lead to something

770
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,120
like where companies like Western Digital, instead of having their Western Digital, Mybook,

771
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:31,760
Mycloud proprietary old version of Linux, it could simply be running a more modern version

772
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,800
of Snappy Core with Nextcloud running on top of it.

773
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,880
And imagine for a moment if multiple vendors started doing this.

774
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:46,720
So then they started competing on hardware and RAID features and the software to manage

775
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,200
it all and the interface and all that stuff was in the Nextcloud level.

776
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
And it was just something to be...

777
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
One upstream.

778
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Yeah.

779
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
Oh, man.

780
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
I don't know.

781
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
That's putting the cart way ahead of the horse.

782
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,760
But yeah, it seems like if this goes well, that's the kind of thing that could follow

783
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
years down the road.

784
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
Exactly.

785
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,760
Building a platform.

786
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
That's pretty cool.

787
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,760
Yeah, building a platform.

788
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,560
I'm following Flatpak and SnapCraft and Snappy snap package news all the time and there's

789
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,720
a new version of the SnapCraft GUI, which I don't know how much we've talked about.

790
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,080
And it seems like it's a pretty big deal to me.

791
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,720
The SnapCraft GUI is just what you would expect.

792
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,800
It's a graphical interface to create snap packages, which it's not the snap packages

793
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,600
are hard to make in the first place.

794
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,800
And there's already been a command line tool to do this.

795
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,280
But this is there's going to be a version two of the SnapCraft GUI shipping soon.

796
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,640
And it kind of is bad ass.

797
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,920
Also, I don't see a lot of unity desktops with the with the launcher at the bottom.

798
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,920
No, I don't see that.

799
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,960
Yeah, it is kind of it is kind of I should have tried that like a purple Windows 10.

800
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,960
But without all the tiles.

801
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,000
Now I hate it.

802
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Now I hate it.

803
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
All right.

804
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Geez.

805
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Sorry, everyone.

806
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
God.

807
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Damn it.

808
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Damn it.

809
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,500
And I was all happy that it does seem like a big thing, especially for like, you know,

810
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,680
you make a Windows app, you have Linux users telling you they want it.

811
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,680
You're trying to figure it out.

812
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,560
And suddenly you're like miles deep and make files and in the command line.

813
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,720
So if this can help you package your app in an easy way that lets Linux users consume

814
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
it then totally great.

815
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
Yep.

816
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,620
I I've I've heard many, many complaints at Koda radio at Jupiter broadcasting.com at

817
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,620
Michael Dominic.

818
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,480
Boy, the people get out there writing these emails saying like, I got all excited after

819
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,360
hearing the show about starting Linux development.

820
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,000
And then I spent three days trying to figure out how to deliver an application on Linux

821
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,560
and I gave up and went back to the app store.

822
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,560
Yeah.

823
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Oh, no.

824
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
So close.

825
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
Don't go.

826
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,560
Don't go.

827
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
Yeah.

828
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
We'll use it.

829
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
We just have some weird requirements.

830
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,760
Oh, and Poby points out in the chat room that SnapCraft is a community maintained effort,

831
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,760
which is really kind of awesome.

832
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
That is awesome.

833
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
Yeah.

834
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
I hadn't really hadn't really thought about mentioning that.

835
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,960
But that is that does actually show some serious investment from the community that looks like

836
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,200
a gives a sense of that people are really liking this platform.

837
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,880
It's a QT based application, too.

838
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,320
So all right.

839
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,360
So let's let's we've been here for a little bit.

840
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
We have let's see.

841
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,360
What word do we have?

842
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
Oh, yeah.

843
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
Oh, yes.

844
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Oh, good.

845
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Oh, good.

846
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Good.

847
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
We finally get to we finally get to the point of the show that I've been waiting for all

848
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
episode.

849
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,360
Let's take this moment then to thank Ting.

850
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,640
Everybody, if you do me a favor and go to Linux dot ting dot com, you can support this

851
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,720
show and you learn more about Ting and you also get twenty five dollars off your device.

852
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,920
Or if you bring one, you'll get twenty five dollars in service credit.

853
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,600
Now, this is why I'm recommending.

854
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,160
So it's first full disclosure, more than two and a half.

855
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,920
I mean, it's gosh, I guess this year is.

856
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
Wow.

857
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,520
I'm like I'm like two years.

858
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,640
I'm like way over.

859
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
Way over two years now.

860
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
It's been it's been a while.

861
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,780
And I every time I think to myself, what is it about Ting now that I like?

862
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,440
Because as I started using the things that initially blew me away were the price.

863
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,520
It's six dollars for my line and then I pay for what I use.

864
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,800
And if I use Wi-Fi for most of my downloads, my big phone usage, honestly, is if I'm not

865
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,680
on Wi-Fi, it's when I'm driving and I don't like to really do a lot of text messaging

866
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,200
or a lot of stuff when I'm driving anyway.

867
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:00,600
So I just pre-download my podcast and my data, my data connection on Ting is is really handy.

868
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
It's a great backup.

869
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,120
And where I am, where I'm at here at the studio, we get like, are you on CDMA or GSM on that

870
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
phone?

871
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
GSM.

872
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
Have you ran the speed test here at the studio?

873
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
No.

874
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
You should turn off your Wi-Fi and run it.

875
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,120
It's like twenty two, twenty three, twenty four megabits.

876
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,120
Wow.

877
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,120
It's really nice.

878
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,280
So you can the nice thing about Ting is they have two cellular networks, CDMA and GSM,

879
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,520
and you can pick whichever works better for you in your area.

880
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,120
And some places here in Washington, because we have a lot of hills and a lot of trees,

881
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,920
CDMA legitimately works better.

882
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,200
Might not be super fast, but at least you have service.

883
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
Right.

884
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
But here in town, we're at the studio.

885
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,460
GSM is rock solid fast.

886
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:38,840
And it's so solid that Alan was in studio for a special tech snap episode a couple of

887
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,240
years ago.

888
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,240
And like, when does that happen?

889
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,240
No, never.

890
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,240
That's rare.

891
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,240
Twice.

892
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
Yeah.

893
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,240
Three times ever in the history of the show.

894
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,240
And of course, our Internet was out.

895
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,760
And it's not like he's not like we could reschedule that episode.

896
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,160
I'll just like, you know, book your flight again.

897
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
It's fine.

898
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,400
So we set up the Ting hotspot on my phone, which is, you know, is just a checkbox in

899
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,400
Android.

900
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
There's no extra fees.

901
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
You must authorize with your carrier.

902
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
None of that bull crap.

903
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,960
And it just turns on and we used it for a couple of hours.

904
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
It saved the day.

905
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
It was really nice.

906
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,400
And the flexibility like that is what's really great about Ting.

907
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,600
And I'll also mention that if you're a Nexus phone user, they have some great tips on their

908
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,400
blog right now on ways you can save with Wi-Fi assist.

909
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,520
So I'll link you up to that.

910
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,400
We've also got articles up there about bringing the iPhone 7 to Ting.

911
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,480
So start right now by going to linux.ting.com.

912
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,720
Try out their savings calculator.

913
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:32,320
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program, linux.ting.com.

914
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,320
That's how they say it.

915
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,320
That's exactly how they say it.

916
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,320
No, that's how Yahoo says it.

917
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
I apologize.

918
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
I apologize.

919
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
Yahoo's done a thing anymore, Chris.

920
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,320
Oh!

921
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,320
No, too soon.

922
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,320
That's sad.

923
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Too soon.

924
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,640
So Gardner is joining us in the mumble room.

925
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,040
He is the Linux gamer on YouTube and on the Twitter.

926
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,200
Gardner, welcome to Linux Unplugged, sir.

927
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,080
Hey, I'm glad to be here.

928
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:55,520
So would it be embarrassing for you or would it be okay if I played your channel trailer

929
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,560
to introduce people to you who are not familiar with you?

930
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,400
Because I know for me, it's hard to watch my own stuff.

931
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,040
But I thought actually your trailer would be probably a good way to just kind of introduce

932
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,040
people to you.

933
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,040
Are you cool with that?

934
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
Oh, absolutely.

935
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,040
Okay.

936
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,040
Yeah, it's a good trailer.

937
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,600
You wouldn't use a hammer like this.

938
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,560
So why would you play PC games like this?

939
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,800
Sure, you might accomplish what you're trying to do, but there's a much easier way.

940
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,840
The answer to your PC gaming woes is Linux.

941
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,000
Hi, I'm the Linux Gamer and this is my channel.

942
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,160
I produce weekly reviews of Linux and SteamOS games, titles you can buy from the Humble

943
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,880
Store, GOG, and Steam.

944
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,320
I also make informational videos, do product unboxings, create informative tutorials, produce

945
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,640
hilarious let's plays, and a whole lot more.

946
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,880
Please take a moment and check out some of my stuff.

947
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,320
And if you're intrigued by what you see, you can mash that subscribe button.

948
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,960
I'm the Linux Gamer and there's a better way to PC game.

949
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,560
So I don't know how hilarious my let's plays are, but okay.

950
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,040
Well, I did like the goat one.

951
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,040
What was that?

952
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,040
I forget now the name of that.

953
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,040
Goat Simulator.

954
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,720
Yeah, that one's pretty good.

955
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,880
So Gardiner, why Linux gaming?

956
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,880
And are you crazy?

957
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,840
I mean, there's no games for Linux.

958
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,720
That's impossible.

959
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,320
I hear that all the time in my comments and I don't listen to them.

960
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
Yeah, I bet you do.

961
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
Yeah.

962
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,320
Yeah.

963
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
I mean, why YouTube, too?

964
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,320
That is...

965
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,320
I mean, so not that...

966
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,320
I mean, we publish to YouTube, too.

967
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,560
I have no problem with YouTube, but it's not necessarily known as the most Linux friendly

968
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
place.

969
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:28,160
Well, if I'm going to be totally honest, I think of my channel as a gaming channel first

970
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,280
and I just happen to play games on Linux.

971
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,280
I like that.

972
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,280
Interesting, yeah.

973
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,280
That does make sense.

974
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,280
And what do you...

975
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,160
Do you do all of the production on Linux for your setup?

976
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,160
Yeah, I do.

977
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,200
I use a AVerMedia capture card that captures to SD to capture all my video.

978
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,440
I edit on a Linux rig.

979
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,160
I use Ubuntu and I edit with Kdenlive.

980
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,160
Okay.

981
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,320
Hey, that's awesome.

982
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,320
And you...

983
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,320
But you also have a day job, too.

984
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,840
So you're doing this as like a...

985
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,840
Is it a...

986
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,400
It's not even fair to really call it a side project because it's more than that.

987
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,320
How is that working out for you?

988
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,320
It's a passion project.

989
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,880
I really, really enjoy gaming and the reason I started my channel was kind of twofold.

990
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,280
The first thing was that I didn't think I played enough games, so I wanted an excuse

991
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,280
to play more.

992
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,280
I understand.

993
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,880
And the other reason was I wanted to feel like I was doing something with my life.

994
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,880
Sure.

995
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,880
We've all been there.

996
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,880
Yeah.

997
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,880
It's a passion project for me and I really enjoy everything that I have gotten to do

998
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,860
so far and hope it can expand in the future.

999
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,960
So as we record the episode, he has 11,000 subscribers, which is really a great number

1000
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,080
on YouTube for Linux-focused content like that.

1001
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,120
And that takes a long time to build up.

1002
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,600
I mean, that's a big commitment of a lot of releases.

1003
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:47,560
I'm looking at your channel right now, Gardner, and it looks like, YouTube doesn't tell me,

1004
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,240
but I mean, thousands of videos.

1005
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,240
How many videos?

1006
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,920
Do you have an idea that you've posted over on YouTube?

1007
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,900
So I post some for my Patreon subscribers that are private, but I think I have something

1008
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,900
like 110 or 140.

1009
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:58,900
Geez.

1010
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,900
Somewhere in there.

1011
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,900
Yeah.

1012
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,900
I've been doing it for about, sorry.

1013
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,900
No, go ahead.

1014
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,900
I was going to say, so what?

1015
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,400
That's what, a few years at least you've been doing it?

1016
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,400
Yeah.

1017
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,640
I started my channel actually two years ago, almost to the day.

1018
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,640
Wow.

1019
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,640
So congratulations.

1020
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,640
Happy birthday.

1021
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,640
Wow.

1022
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
Yeah, that's wonderful.

1023
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,640
Happy YouTube birthday.

1024
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,240
So I kind of wanted to get a picture of life for Gardner.

1025
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,080
Where are you based out of?

1026
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,560
I live in Maine.

1027
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,560
Oh.

1028
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,920
The opposite end is over here.

1029
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,120
The beard's from Maine.

1030
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,460
So yeah, that's very interesting.

1031
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,480
And so you have the day job, and then you do production on the weekends?

1032
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,480
Do you do it at evening?

1033
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,480
Are you up late working on this thing?

1034
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:43,320
Most of the time I do my editing on a Monday, typically.

1035
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:49,720
And then I work on recording the video and writing the scripts on weeknights after work.

1036
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,940
And how much time do you have to spend ever fiddling with things to get the game to work

1037
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:54,940
under Linux?

1038
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,940
Has that been a problem?

1039
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,760
Or are you for the most part be able to install these things and they just work because you've

1040
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,840
probably tried more games than most people?

1041
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:07,080
Typically I don't like to review games that require a lot of work because of who I'm kind

1042
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:13,000
of targeting on YouTube, but there are some games that have had more headaches than they're

1043
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
worth.

1044
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

1045
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,640
All right, so we've got some new games that have come out recently that I want to talk

1046
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,920
about in a moment, but if anybody in the Bumba Room has any questions for Gardner, go ahead

1047
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,160
because I don't want to dominate, or Wes if you have any questions, but I think one of

1048
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:32,680
the things that we've all kind of discussed recently is the big games that have been announced,

1049
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,800
some of the big releases.

1050
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,200
There's though some independent games that are coming out soon that I want to talk about,

1051
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,760
but there is some rumors too.

1052
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,240
So why don't we start with the rumors, then we'll get into the confirmed releases.

1053
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,920
Now one of the resources that people are probably familiar with is there is a subreddit for

1054
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,360
gaming, gaming on Linux, is that what it is?

1055
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,360
What is the subreddit?

1056
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,280
Because I just saw, I was just, go ahead Gardner, you probably know what it is.

1057
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,760
Linux underscore gaming, is that what it is?

1058
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,760
Linux underscore gaming?

1059
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,760
Yeah, it's Linux underscore gaming.

1060
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,760
Yeah, okay.

1061
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,760
So this is not a bad resource for Linux gaming news, and gaming on Linux is another one.

1062
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,680
Gardner, what are some of your favorite resources for learning news about Linux, besides your

1063
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,720
Twitter feed?

1064
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:17,140
I like gamingonlinux.com, and I actually go to OMG Ubuntu quite a bit, but the Linux gaming

1065
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,840
subreddit is one of my favorite places.

1066
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,880
All right, so this was in the Linux gaming subreddit, and it's tagged as speculation,

1067
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,920
so take it with some grain of salt, but 21 hours ago they posted that Star Citizen may

1068
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:34,840
be confirmed for Linux as the dev was doing a coding streaming session, and in the IDE

1069
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,500
here you can see something tagged Linux launcher.

1070
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,680
Did you happen to catch this one, Gardner?

1071
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,120
I actually didn't see this one.

1072
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:46,400
Now, I don't think it's shocking that there's going to be a Star Citizen for Linux.

1073
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,080
Google even, I just Googled Star Citizen, says it's an upcoming space sim game for Microsoft

1074
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,080
Windows and Linux.

1075
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:57,180
Yeah, that's not the shocking part, but they're really, they've been super dodgy about when

1076
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,880
we'd see it and how far along it is for a long time now, and people have been getting

1077
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,880
a little concerned.

1078
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,880
That's sort of been my sense of it.

1079
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,520
There's been that history of like, well, okay, you say it's happening, my Windows friends

1080
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,440
are going to be playing it, I want to play it.

1081
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:13,840
But that could be, so that's in the rumor category, but there is some big games that

1082
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,680
people are looking forward to that we're going to mention, we're going to talk about.

1083
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,040
So quickly, let's mention Linux Academy at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, go there

1084
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,520
to learn more about the Linux Academy platform.

1085
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,600
This is where they teach you everything you need to know about the basics of Linux, the

1086
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,760
advanced topics, and all the stuff that runs on top of it.

1087
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,760
Which is everything.

1088
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,760
Yeah, really.

1089
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,080
And they have instructor mentoring available, downloadable comprehensive study guides.

1090
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,080
They have a great community.

1091
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,800
They have people working around the clock to make Linux Academy better all the time,

1092
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,880
so that way your subscription constantly gets value.

1093
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,880
I also mention, I will just briefly say that they have some great news, Linux Academy students

1094
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,120
can now make their profile public and share their credentials and their professional certs.

1095
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,840
So when you're getting a gig, you can link that in your resume.

1096
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,980
See, that actually, I know there's a lot of organizations that will let you use their

1097
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,240
company account for this, so if you can come in as an applicant and just be like, well

1098
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,960
look, you were going to have me do this if I'm hired, I've already done these three things,

1099
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,240
you should probably hire me.

1100
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,960
And one of the great things is Linux Academy has just been growing more and more and more

1101
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,960
in notoriety.

1102
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,120
So Linux Academy's being a staff, they've worked a lot with the Linux Foundation, so

1103
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,840
in a professional space, they're becoming a well-known name.

1104
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,680
And so that's a great feature just at the right time.

1105
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,840
So my hat's off to them, and I wanted to give them a shout out.

1106
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,840
I'd like you to learn more.

1107
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,780
If you go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, you support the show, you can check out their

1108
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,680
features page, and I'll have a video for you there.

1109
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,440
If there's topics we've talked about that have been over your head at all, this might

1110
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,080
be a great resource to learn more, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1111
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,580
Thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1112
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:46,720
So this came out just a couple of days ago, and I'm going to say it's pronounced Deus

1113
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,720
Ex.

1114
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,720
How's that?

1115
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,720
How's that?

1116
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,720
I think that's beautiful.

1117
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,720
Yeah, I know Deus Ex.

1118
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:56,040
Deus Ex is coming to Mac and Linux this year, and that's big news.

1119
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,160
Everybody's talking about it.

1120
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,040
I saw you tweeted about it, Gardiner.

1121
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,040
Why is this big news?

1122
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,120
I'm not familiar with the franchise.

1123
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,120
Deus Ex, the franchise actually started in, I think it was like 1989.

1124
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,120
Forever ago.

1125
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,120
Yeah.

1126
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,120
Yeah.

1127
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,120
And it was, what's his name?

1128
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,120
Warren...

1129
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,120
Warren Spector.

1130
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,120
Yeah, Warren Spector.

1131
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,120
That's it.

1132
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:20,000
And he's a big name in the gaming world, and I think I played the original Deus Ex, and

1133
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,240
it was really interesting, and it was like a pioneer of storytelling.

1134
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:31,200
And the previous game to this incarnation of Deus Ex was really well received.

1135
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,680
So it's kind of big news that Deus Ex Mankind Divided is coming to Linux.

1136
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,640
Yeah, and I guess it's already out for Windows, and it's kind of got a mixed review, at least

1137
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,640
according to Steam.

1138
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:47,160
It's got a, kind of like a, not a fully loved product, but people still seem to be pretty

1139
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,160
excited on the Linux side.

1140
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,320
I saw a lot of Linux press for it.

1141
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,800
And the graphics look incredible, but that's all my, that's really the extent of my excitement

1142
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,360
about it.

1143
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,200
I assume though that you yourself will probably be getting it on release day.

1144
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,200
The world apart.

1145
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,200
Probably.

1146
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,200
Yeah.

1147
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,200
The trailer looks good.

1148
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,040
I'd like to get a release, an early release, but I don't know.

1149
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,560
Have people been working with you on that?

1150
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,560
Some people.

1151
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,560
Feral's pretty good about it.

1152
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,440
Ah, it depends on the shop, huh?

1153
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,440
I see.

1154
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,440
Yeah, that makes sense.

1155
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,480
So, just a hint, hint, nudge, nudge, but speaking of OMG Ubuntu, they, well we were speaking

1156
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,000
of them, they have the game that I'm really the most excited about.

1157
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,840
This is the one I've been waiting to talk about all episode.

1158
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:30,600
I don't know what it is about me and space shooters, but Everspace is going to hit Linux

1159
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,600
later this month as early access, I believe.

1160
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,600
So keep that in mind.

1161
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,640
I don't think it's a finished product yet.

1162
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,520
Holy scrumptious space shooter though.

1163
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:45,840
This looks like I could spend an evening just totally set, get my food, get my snacks, get

1164
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,840
myself a beverage.

1165
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,840
Oh man.

1166
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,840
And stare at my screen.

1167
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,840
Can I come over for this?

1168
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,240
Yeah, it looks really good.

1169
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,120
How would you describe these graphics, Wes?

1170
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,120
Sublime.

1171
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,120
Intense.

1172
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,120
Titillating.

1173
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,120
Perfect.

1174
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,640
Yeah, and you're flying around in space like a madman.

1175
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,640
Space dogfights.

1176
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,640
I mean, what more could you ask?

1177
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,040
It's like Star Fox grew up.

1178
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:09,880
Yeah, it's Star Fox and Descent meet, I'm trying to remember what that old game was,

1179
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,880
Descent 2.

1180
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,240
I can't remember what the game was called, but this really just looks, this really looks

1181
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,440
like it's pushing my buttons.

1182
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,600
Now, Mr. Linux Gamer, have you seen this game?

1183
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,600
Have you seen this story?

1184
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,240
Yeah, I'm pretty hyped about it.

1185
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,520
I really like how it looks.

1186
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,480
I think it's going to be pretty interesting.

1187
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,120
Not too hyped about the early access though.

1188
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,120
I don't mind that.

1189
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,120
Yeah, yeah.

1190
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,320
It's always a mixed bag.

1191
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,520
What are your thoughts on it, on early access in general?

1192
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,880
I mean, I try and steer clear of giving reviews of early access games because they're not

1193
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,880
finished.

1194
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,520
It's kind of like why I haven't done a lot of open source games is because they're not

1195
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,520
always finished.

1196
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,200
Yeah, sure.

1197
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,680
I feel like this though will fill that Star Citizen void that I have until Star Citizen

1198
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,600
does ship for Linux, because I feel like this is the game that I can play for a while.

1199
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,640
I mean, one of the things I love about No Man's Sky under wine is just going up into

1200
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,120
space and flying around and blowing up stuff and getting the materials from it.

1201
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:07,120
So now I'll have this, so it's Everspace and it's going to be on Steam and GOG by Rocketfish

1202
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,120
Games.

1203
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,640
It's something to check out if you've got a few bucks laying around.

1204
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,720
It uses the Unreal Engine, which is damn good looking.

1205
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:20,120
It looks like right now it's on those platforms, it's 30 bucks US greenbacks, $29.99 is how

1206
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,120
much it is.

1207
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,800
Is there any other games, Gardner, that you're kind of looking forward to, big releases or

1208
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:28,080
ones that you have your eye on that you can't wait to install when it finally ships?

1209
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:33,480
So two games that I've been really interested in lately are What the Box, which is kind

1210
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,160
of like Garry's Mod Prop Hunt.

1211
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,840
It's kind of everyone is a prop and you're just a box and you run around.

1212
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,120
It's what Metal Gear Solid Online should have been.

1213
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:49,160
And then there's also, let's see, what's the other one, Cluster Truck.

1214
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,840
That looks like a very interesting game.

1215
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,940
It's a procedurally generated game where there's like a bunch of trucks and you just run on

1216
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,360
top of them as far as you can.

1217
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,360
It looks really fun.

1218
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,360
It does look fun.

1219
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,360
Race the truck.

1220
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,360
Yeah.

1221
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,880
That doesn't seem like a super complicated game to port over to Linux, so I would think

1222
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,880
that'd be coming.

1223
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,440
I love it just says, jump on trucks.

1224
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,000
It says it's going to be available on September 27th, which is just a few days away too.

1225
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,880
Mr. Tonell, you had a question for Gardner.

1226
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,880
Go ahead.

1227
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:21,720
Yeah, I was wondering if you're doing any plans, do any reviews for games like emulation.

1228
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:27,120
What do you think about games on emulations that are not technically for Linux native?

1229
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:32,240
Because I noticed that one of your recent videos was Aladdin.

1230
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:39,520
So I was just wondering, would you do a review that's not necessarily native?

1231
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,800
I've thought about it and I've talked to some of the people who watch my stuff and it's

1232
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,040
not really something that my viewers are probably interested in.

1233
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,240
Although, I definitely am going to cover GNOME games when it finally hits.

1234
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,240
Oh, that's good.

1235
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,240
Yeah.

1236
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,400
What do you think of GNOME games?

1237
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,000
I've been kind of hyped about it.

1238
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,760
From what I understand, it seems like a Mednafen front end, which is really interesting to

1239
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,920
me.

1240
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:13,280
I don't know if it actually can be used with a controller, which is something I'd be interested

1241
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,280
in seeing.

1242
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah, I really like the idea of...

1243
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,280
So you're not as skeptical about it as I am?

1244
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,280
No.

1245
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,600
I'm a big fan of GNOME anyway, so to have something like that...

1246
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:32,680
I mean, I do play emulators quite a bit and I'm interested in having a unified front end

1247
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,680
for it.

1248
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,680
Yeah.

1249
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,680
That is what I do like about it.

1250
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,680
Go ahead.

1251
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,680
What?

1252
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,040
Have you tried Lutrix?

1253
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,040
I haven't.

1254
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,320
I've never heard of that.

1255
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:46,040
It's basically a front end for games that you can create launchers for any game and

1256
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,440
it doesn't necessarily have to be an emulator or anything.

1257
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,760
It could be any game and it could be even a Steam game that just has a launcher connected

1258
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,760
to it.

1259
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,480
So it's all in one manager.

1260
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,480
Nice.

1261
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,840
I'm definitely going to check that out.

1262
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,840
So Gardner, you've...

1263
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,840
Oh, go ahead.

1264
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,840
Was there another question in there for him?

1265
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,840
I can wait.

1266
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,840
Yeah.

1267
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:10,120
Linux gamer, what's your view on speedrunning an app?

1268
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,880
I really enjoy watching speedrunners, especially like AGDQ.

1269
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,760
I follow mainstream gaming quite a bit.

1270
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:23,360
So when stuff like that pops up on Polygon or wherever else, I definitely check those

1271
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,360
out.

1272
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,360
I love speedrunning.

1273
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,360
I don't do it myself.

1274
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,360
I don't think I'm good enough.

1275
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,000
What is speedrunning?

1276
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,680
It's where you basically break a game to beat it as fast as possible.

1277
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,680
Oh yeah, okay.

1278
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,680
So exploiting glitches.

1279
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,680
I love it.

1280
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,680
I love watching those.

1281
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,840
I don't know if I'd want to do those, but I'd like watching them.

1282
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,840
They're fascinating to watch.

1283
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,560
Yeah, it really takes a lot of skill sometimes.

1284
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,360
I saw one guy play Super Mario 64.

1285
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,160
I think he beat it in about five minutes with one hand.

1286
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,160
Like he did.

1287
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,160
Oh man.

1288
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,160
He used one hand to play the game.

1289
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,160
It was awesome.

1290
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,160
So what do you think about...

1291
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,160
Oh, Ww, you have a question.

1292
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,160
Go ahead.

1293
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,160
Okay.

1294
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:01,120
So a lot of games that I've played on the Windows side and that are on Linux, like let's

1295
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:05,720
say Payday 2, they have a heavy modding community.

1296
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:14,000
And it seems like I would love to play Payday 2 or other games that have a good modding

1297
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,200
community, but it doesn't seem like that translates over.

1298
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:23,320
Do you think that's a hurdle to overcome in the future for gamers that want to game on

1299
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:29,800
Linux and want to be able to mod games and add different features or change the UI how

1300
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,720
they want?

1301
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,080
I definitely think that's important.

1302
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:38,720
One of the staples of PC gaming is definitely the modding community.

1303
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,400
I'm very excited to see that Unreal Tournament, the new one that's coming out, is going to

1304
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,240
support that.

1305
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:50,400
And I'm hoping that they create a modding platform that allows someone to just publish

1306
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,440
to the platform and then it works across Linux, Mac, and Windows.

1307
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,960
But yeah, it's very important.

1308
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:06,040
Games that support Steam Workshop on Windows and not on Linux, I dock them points when

1309
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,760
they do that.

1310
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:14,440
It's very important to me to maintain that kind of compatibility, especially since Linux

1311
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,960
is such a community-based initiative.

1312
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:28,640
So what is your sense of the take on developers and continuing support of Linux?

1313
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,160
Do you think it's increasing?

1314
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,840
Do you think developers have sort of had a cold reaction to SteamOS and maybe it's tapering

1315
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,840
off?

1316
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,240
What's your sense at this point?

1317
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:44,920
So it definitely boils down to the publisher, I think.

1318
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:54,680
Square Enix has been publishing games like Eidos and they're bringing Deus Ex to Linux

1319
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,760
and they've done a couple other games before, Life is Strange and stuff like that.

1320
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:07,240
And Take-Two has also kind of, or 2K I guess, has been bringing games to Linux.

1321
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:12,640
Certain developers need to be pushed a little more, I think.

1322
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,920
It's kind of a mixed bag, honestly.

1323
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,520
So it's still kind of early days then.

1324
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,520
Definitely.

1325
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,560
I guess that's where we'd expect it to be.

1326
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:23,520
I think there's room to grow, for sure.

1327
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:28,420
It's also, we're on the precipice of Vulkan taking off, we're going to be making a big

1328
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,600
display server transition.

1329
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,600
So it's maybe not-

1330
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,600
There's all this AMD work to try to get better.

1331
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,960
Yeah, maybe it's okay that it's still not, we have some time.

1332
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,960
We still have some time.

1333
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,700
And it's come a long way just in the past three or four years.

1334
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:39,700
That's true.

1335
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,700
It definitely has.

1336
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,680
I suspect that Valve has something else up their sleeve.

1337
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,320
They're not dumb and they understand that Windows is definitely trying to wall off the

1338
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,680
open garden that PC gaming has been.

1339
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,360
And they have to have something up their sleeve.

1340
00:58:54,360 --> 00:59:01,360
I don't think they're going to go quietly into the universal Windows platform or whatever

1341
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,320
Windows is trying to push on us.

1342
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,800
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

1343
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,800
I hope.

1344
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,800
I hope.

1345
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,800
Lyle, you had a question before we wrap up.

1346
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,800
Go ahead.

1347
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:16,360
Oh, I was just going to ask, do you think, Garner, do you think that, sorry, I'm hearing

1348
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,360
echo.

1349
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:26,360
Anyways, do you think Steam is kind of a scapegoat for native Linux gaming because you're not

1350
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:35,120
really, in Steam, you're not really using the Linux desktop per se as a native client?

1351
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,760
I don't know if that made sense.

1352
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,600
Because you're using the Steam Runtime?

1353
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,600
Yeah.

1354
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:49,960
Do you think there's a way that we could convert programmers to make native clients instead

1355
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,480
of Steam?

1356
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,400
So that's an interesting question.

1357
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:59,520
I haven't actually heard that before, but I guess you can turn off the Steam Runtime,

1358
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,480
but it sometimes will break compatibilities with games.

1359
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,760
And if you're downloading games from like GOG or the Humble Store, they're going to

1360
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:12,240
be using like the native libraries on your system.

1361
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,320
I don't know if I like the classification native.

1362
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,960
I know that's the term we've been throwing around, but native makes it sound like it's

1363
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,080
not a Linux developed code.

1364
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:26,440
It's just, they're just libraries that shipped with an older version of Ubuntu.

1365
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,440
That's what we're talking about here.

1366
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,120
We're talking about things that were created for Linux, that are compiled for Linux.

1367
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:36,360
They're just shipped with a, essentially, it actually makes a lot of sense, and I don't

1368
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:40,760
know if you'd really want to do it differently, because it allows developers to target a single

1369
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,480
target, Linux, Ubuntu, 1204, whatever it is now, I don't know.

1370
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:52,200
And that is a real easy, okay, this is something I can wrap my head around, I can ship to that.

1371
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,900
And then we as end users, if it bothers us, have the means, especially with distributions

1372
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:02,120
like Solace, have the means to switch over to our native distribution, now I'm using

1373
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:06,600
that term again, to switch over to our distribution bundled libraries, if we want.

1374
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,600
Right.

1375
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,600
Comes with the package manager.

1376
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,600
Yeah.

1377
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,600
If we want.

1378
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,600
And that's where something where it's like, maybe if you see more open source in games,

1379
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,320
where it doesn't matter as much, because they can link when they're building all the

1380
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,120
packages, maybe we see more static compilation in games.

1381
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,880
But when you do have the Steam runtime, and you have all the Steam users, and you have

1382
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,200
the library, and the support services, and the cloud sync, and all that, I can see why

1383
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,240
it's a popular target.

1384
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,820
A game development shop needs some amount of predictability.

1385
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:33,080
You can't really ship a game without some level of predictability of what your target

1386
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,260
system is going to be, and that's what the Steam runtime gives them.

1387
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:40,660
And it's something that I think Linux was missing, and it's not something that you are

1388
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:45,960
dependent on to have gaming on Linux, as Gardiner just pointed out, GOG or Humble Bundle games

1389
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:50,160
as another real easy source to get games, don't use those runtimes.

1390
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:55,580
And it's very simple on Arch and on Solace, and probably other distros, to flip a switch,

1391
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,460
and now you're using your built-in bundled runtimes.

1392
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:58,460
It does bring up libraries.

1393
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:02,280
It is important, then, for that runtime to see maintenance, upkeep, updates, that sort

1394
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:06,280
of thing, to make sure that it's easy and not a hassle as we move forward on the Linux

1395
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,280
desktop.

1396
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,280
So that will be interesting to see what Steam does.

1397
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,880
I don't necessarily disagree with you, Chris, at all.

1398
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:22,760
I think Steam is a great intermediary between getting games on Linux and having them outside

1399
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,000
of Steam native, if you will.

1400
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,720
I agree with you that Steam is native, okay?

1401
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:32,840
And the games are still Linux binaries at the end of the day.

1402
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,440
I agree with that.

1403
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:41,560
Running a program to run a game is the same in some respects as just using Wine, correct?

1404
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,520
Because you're using a program to run the game.

1405
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,360
Well, no, Steam doesn't run the game.

1406
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,480
The game runs as native code on the system.

1407
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,320
Steam might launch the game and authorize the game or something like that.

1408
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,560
And include additional libraries that it uses.

1409
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,160
So when the game starts, it starts on its own volition.

1410
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:00,920
I mean, Steam might kick it off, but then it runs its own process, and it uses its native

1411
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,720
compiled Linux code, in most cases.

1412
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,720
Okay.

1413
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:09,880
And aren't Snap packages going to do something similar to that, where the developers are

1414
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,760
going to be able to publish their own libraries, or package their own libraries along with

1415
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,760
their app?

1416
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:21,880
Snap and Flatpaks are going to reimagine the runtime structure, so Linux will be that for

1417
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,880
everything native.

1418
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,120
Those are coming to a lot of things, yeah.

1419
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:29,520
That's actually where I was going to go next.

1420
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:38,880
If we got a community donating money to advancing Flatpaks or Snappaks or whatever for the development

1421
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:48,360
of AAA games like WoW or SwoTor or any other huge MMO out there, then wouldn't that gain

1422
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:55,600
more credibility to gaming on Linux?

1423
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,600
What's the difference, though?

1424
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:02,400
Because if you're creating a runtime that's making it easier to develop on it with Flatpaks

1425
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:07,120
or Snaps, or you're creating a runtime with Steam as your base, what's the difference

1426
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,440
with it not being native and is native?

1427
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:14,680
Because to me, it sounds like you're just kind of picking at straws, and it's totally

1428
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:18,800
native and you're kind of trying to imply that it's not.

1429
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:27,320
I would say the conversation around runtimes is actually, that is a valid one.

1430
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:33,640
Because what is the point of having this always up to date, perfectly synced, rolling release

1431
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:38,640
of a Linux distribution just to rely on runtimes that might be two years old or something like

1432
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,640
that?

1433
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:46,400
So Flatpaks today ship with GTK 3.20 version, right, that's what the base Flatpak runtime

1434
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,560
GTK setup is.

1435
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:52,680
Well, that's great today, but it's already going to be out of date in a couple of days

1436
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,120
and practically speaking.

1437
01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:02,040
And then really in a year or two, that's going to feel limiting when I might be on GTK 4.0

1438
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:07,760
potentially at that point, and yet the Flatpak runtime will still support GTK 3.20, which

1439
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,880
will probably also get upgraded.

1440
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,920
But that runtime discussion we should probably have on a future date, because I got to run,

1441
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,960
because it is time for me to start recording a special edition of On Filter coming up a

1442
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:18,960
little bit.

1443
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,960
What?

1444
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,640
Yeah, Mr. Chase is in Shoreline right now as we record.

1445
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,960
Oh, he's hot on the way.

1446
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:23,960
I can see that.

1447
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,200
He is, and I don't have clips ready yet.

1448
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,840
So we have someone in his seat.

1449
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:28,980
It's just a hot mess.

1450
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:31,520
So let's pick that conversation up on a future date.

1451
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,840
But Gardiner, thank you for joining us on the Unplugged program.

1452
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:39,560
So we've got links to your Twitter account and your YouTube channel, but also to your

1453
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,720
Patreon if people want to support the work you're doing on Patreon.

1454
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,020
And please feel free, if you're ever bored on a Tuesday, come back, hang out, chime in

1455
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:47,800
with your awesome Linux opinions.

1456
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,800
Totally.

1457
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,800
You're always welcome back, sir.

1458
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,800
So thanks for being here.

1459
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,360
Thanks for having me, guys.

1460
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,360
Absolutely.

1461
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,780
I'm glad you were able to make time for it.

1462
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:58,960
And Wes's invitation extends out to you at home there, audience, if you'd like to join

1463
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,360
us on a Tuesday.

1464
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,600
Next week won't be the week to do it.

1465
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,600
No, not next week.

1466
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,400
In fact, big disclaimer to you guys in the Mumba Room, check the calendar page, because

1467
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,040
Wes and I, we got a date.

1468
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,040
We're going down to the-

1469
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,040
You better treat me right, Chris.

1470
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,040
You better treat me right.

1471
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,120
Just saying right there.

1472
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,800
We're going down to the Open Daylight Summit, which is something the Linux Foundation is

1473
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,800
putting on.

1474
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:21,520
And it's all about software-defined networking and Linux, which is a huge area that's growing

1475
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,640
for Linux like crazy.

1476
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,960
But it's really happening down at the infrastructure level.

1477
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,040
It's not really something that we have a lot of eyes on.

1478
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,320
And users haven't seen too much yet.

1479
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,320
Yeah.

1480
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,880
So Wes and I are going to try to attend that and come back with the bits and pieces that

1481
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:38,120
you probably actually would care about and want to know about and see how well Linux

1482
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,040
is dominating or not.

1483
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,440
So those are things we'll be doing next week.

1484
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:47,560
But here's the catch, happens during the unplugged lifetime.

1485
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,560
So when we would normally-

1486
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,560
Who schedules things like that?

1487
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,560
Come on.

1488
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,560
Doesn't Linux Foundation-

1489
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,200
Don't they watch the Jupiter Broadcasting calendar, Wes?

1490
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:59,760
So we, right now, are tentatively planning to have a later recording.

1491
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:05,120
So maybe more like four o'clock JB time, something like that, a couple hours later.

1492
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:09,800
So we can go down there, get the interviews, get everything recorded, hustle back up here,

1493
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,080
edit it all together, and then put together a masterpiece for you.

1494
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:18,960
Take many hours of interviews and condense it down to a few minutes of actually interesting

1495
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,960
bits.

1496
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:20,960
The hot shit.

1497
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,960
Yeah.

1498
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,960
That's very well put.

1499
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:23,960
And that'll be next week's unplugged.

1500
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,440
So the time's going to be all jabberwonky.

1501
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,220
But we'll try to let you know as soon as we have some good time.

1502
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:31,120
So we'll put it up at JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar as soon as we know.

1503
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,640
I apologize for that.

1504
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,840
Thank you for sticking with us.

1505
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:38,660
But the idea is we'll go down to the event, we'll get it all done, and we'll come back

1506
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:44,000
all still fresh from the event with everything on our mind and sit down and have, hopefully,

1507
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,340
a good tale to weave, I suppose.

1508
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:49,000
And you guys should go check it out too and maybe comment on the subreddit if there's

1509
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,220
anything you want us to really pay attention to or people we should go try to track down

1510
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:53,860
and you're curious about, let us know.

1511
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:57,360
And if you're going to be in the area Tuesday and you're going to be at the Open Daylight

1512
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,600
Summit, come find us.

1513
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,600
We'll be walking around.

1514
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,600
Come say hi.

1515
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,320
We'd be happy to shake a hand or two and chat a little bit with you.

1516
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,320
See what you're doing.

1517
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,320
See what you're up to.

1518
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,920
So JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar is where we have our new live time for just

1519
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,920
next week.

1520
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,200
We're just making a change for next week.

1521
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:18,240
And you can just check there and there's an RSS feed if you want to.

1522
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,240
And you know what?

1523
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:22,920
If you're not a live timer, if you don't watch live, you don't go to jblive.tv, you don't

1524
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,680
have the Roku app, you don't watch it on MPVs using the RTMP stream.

1525
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,680
I understand.

1526
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,680
I understand.

1527
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,960
You're not watching on the YouTube live shirt.

1528
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:31,960
No, that's cool.

1529
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,120
Because what you do is you subscribe to the RSS feed and then you automatically get the

1530
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,240
unplugged program every freaking time we have a new release.

1531
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,120
It's this brand new technology.

1532
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,840
It's just brand spanking new.

1533
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,480
I think Twitter invented it.

1534
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,480
I'm not sure.

1535
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:49,280
It's called the really simple syndication and they just added this new enclosure tag,

1536
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,280
Wes.

1537
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:51,280
It's incredible.

1538
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,280
What?

1539
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,280
Oh my god.

1540
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:56,960
So now you can get downloaded files via RSS and then people have created these podcast

1541
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,960
players.

1542
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:58,960
Oh man, Wes.

1543
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,520
I can't wait to tell you about it, but we got to run.

1544
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:01,520
So I'll have to tell you after the show.

1545
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,520
Be here next week.

1546
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,520
Yeah.

1547
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,200
I'll tell you the whole world about podcast apps.

1548
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,200
It's amazing.

1549
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,200
We're really on the top of things.

1550
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:14,160
If you'd like to join us though, we will have that mumble room live so you can tune in next

1551
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,160
week.

1552
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,160
Join us live.

1553
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,160
Hang out in the mumble room and chat with us.

1554
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,240
LinuxActionShow.reddit.com is where you go for feedback.

1555
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:24,600
Thanks for being here and we'll see you next Tuesday, probably, assuming we get up here

1556
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,600
in time from Seattle.

1557
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,600
I don't really know.

1558
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,600
Roll the dice.

1559
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,600
This shit won't work out.

1560
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,600
Oh god, Wes.

1561
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:30,600
Get it out of here.

1562
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,600
I never installed GNU slash Linux.

1563
01:09:31,600 --> 01:10:00,920
I secretly use Arch Linux.

1564
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:14,200
Wes has got this Sputnik Dell laptop that he just, it really just gets loaded with stuff

1565
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,520
all the time, really for purposes of the show.

1566
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:21,940
But every now and then, the man has the opportunity to load an OS, to load a desktop, to load

1567
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:24,160
a distribution just for himself.

1568
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,160
This is true.

1569
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,840
And I think the last time you did this, didn't you do Antigros?

1570
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,200
Well, it was Apricity for quite a while.

1571
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,160
You actually, you did Apricity for the show and then stayed there.

1572
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,160
Yeah, it really wasn't too bad.

1573
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,160
But not anymore.

1574
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,160
Well, I did try.

1575
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:40,800
I did upgrade because they had another release or another beta out or something, so I did

1576
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,800
try it.

1577
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:48,920
I was having a very strange issue where my backlight would just flash, just intense flickering.

1578
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,640
And this is nothing, that's not the Skylake Sputnik, right?

1579
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,040
It's like, everything should be well supported.

1580
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,040
Yeah, and normally, right now, the screen is not flickering.

1581
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:02,840
So I don't know if I can blame it on Apricity or just a random kernel version, library version,

1582
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:03,840
who knows.

1583
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,840
It is a rolling release.

1584
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:05,840
So I didn't investigate it too hard.

1585
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,840
I was playing around with Antigros.

1586
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:12,640
I usually have five Antigros live CDs or USBs laying around, and I was playing with their

1587
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,480
bootloader and I was playing with their live CD.

1588
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:18,680
And I like to do fun things like download it and then loop back mount into the ISO so

1589
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:23,080
you can do it, or copy the ISO into RAM so you can do it all easily without needing USB

1590
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,080
or it's faster.

1591
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,080
Yeah, you're crazy.

1592
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,080
I know you.

1593
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:30,920
And it just reminded me, just playing with extracting the ISO and looking at how they

1594
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:36,080
do the init RAMFS, and it's just enough different from Arch that it's kind of outside of my

1595
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,480
comfort zone.

1596
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:40,320
And I like all the way it's set up, but I started getting frustrated too that sometimes

1597
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:45,520
the Antigros mirrors for the Google TrueType fonts and their other fonts, some of their

1598
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:49,720
extra packages are really slow to download, even though they take the time to update all

1599
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:50,720
your Arch mirrors and stuff.

1600
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,720
Yeah, yeah.

1601
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,720
And I'm like, what am I?

1602
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,080
It just didn't feel like the fine grained control that I wanted.

1603
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,920
So I just wiped it and installed Arch straight away.

1604
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:58,920
Vanilla Arch.

1605
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,400
Well, then we might chat more about that.

1606
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,400
Huh.

1607
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,400
So how's it working so far?

1608
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,400
Oh, it's beautiful.

1609
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,360
You know, there's like that you have to give yourself that like hour or two hours to get

1610
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,760
stuff going.

1611
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,640
But after that, I'm really – it's not quite there yet.

1612
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,080
I need to get a bunch of the like YubiKey GPG stuff set up, which I haven't.

1613
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:19,180
I need to re-get like my TinkVPN and SyncThing and maybe play with some LibreVault, get that

1614
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:20,180
going here too.

1615
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:23,320
Anything been a challenge that you didn't expect or anything odd during setup?

1616
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:26,640
Because, you know, the only thing I ever find when I'm building my own machine or my own

1617
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:33,480
Arch install versus like Antigros or Apricity or Manjaro is there's usually one or two

1618
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:38,640
defaults that don't really make sense in a desktop config that you end up having to

1619
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,640
go tweak or change.

1620
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,640
I think there will be.

1621
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,600
I have not heavily – just right now I've got a few extensions, like a little bit of

1622
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,280
theming, but I haven't like gone and tweaked a bunch of stuff.

1623
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:55,600
But also, setting up a bare Linux box is so much easier – not to downplay what you did

1624
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,380
– but it's so much easier than it was back in the days when you used to have to manually

1625
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:04,320
configure X and manually configure all of your init system and manually set up all of

1626
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,160
the basic stuff.

1627
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:09,440
Now, you know, X auto-configures itself.

1628
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,360
SystemD takes care of tons of things.

1629
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:17,360
It is – building a Linux box from scratch is – depending on how you define scratch,

1630
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,600
has gotten so much easier than it was a few years ago.

1631
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,600
I know.

1632
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,880
And I love how Arch kind of exposes that.

1633
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:25,800
So it's like, okay, well, you format your things, you dump all your packages to the

1634
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:32,680
file system, configure a few things, add yourself a user, enable GDM, install GNOME if you want,

1635
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:35,400
and hey, now you've got a desktop.

1636
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,840
That is pretty cool.

1637
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,560
So what happens when you have to try another distro?

1638
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,520
Well, see, that's one of the things I want to do, too, is before – I think it all started

1639
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,760
– I had to wipe the whole hard drive to install some distros, but somehow, I think

1640
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:55,000
from one of the installer GUIs, it had set it up GPT on MBR, or maybe it was the opposite.

1641
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I don't know.

1642
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
It was configured in a weird way.

1643
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,560
So now it's nice and UEFI and it's GPT, so I'm not limited by how many primary partitions

1644
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:03,560
I can have.

1645
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,560
Like, it's the 80s.

1646
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,400
So it should be perfect so I can install a whole crap-ton of OSes for us to review on

1647
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,400
the show.

1648
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,960
Nice dig.

1649
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:11,960
Yes.

1650
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:12,960
Cool.

1651
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:13,960
Well, congrats on the new fresh installation.

1652
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:14,960
Oh, thank you.

01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:15,960
That's always fun.

1654
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:20,040
I've been recently reloading a box of my own, and every time I do it, I try things

1655
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,040

1656
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,040
Just a little tweak.

1657
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,040
Right, exactly.

1658
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:40,320
So you're like, hmm, what's new this time around?
