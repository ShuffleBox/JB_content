1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Noah's just outside this studio right now,

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,440
setting up, he's soldering, he's wiring,

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,960
he's unboxing our whole Linux Fest display, really.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,980
It's more than a production this year,

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,760
it's a bit of a display, really.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,320
The FedEx guy is like, I got some packages,

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,880
and he comes up with the first cart load,

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,720
and I'm like, okay, thanks.

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,860
He's like, oh no, oh no, no, no, no.

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,700
I have a lot more.

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,520
I'll be back.

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,720
So many more.

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,320
So we just stand there holding the dogs,

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,680
and we're like, well, we can't let the dogs out,

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,720
but this guy's taking like three trips back and forth,

16
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,560
and now the-

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,400
Fills up the whole kitchen.

18
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,720
The whole kitchen got full of box,

19
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,120
and now the living room's full of boxes.

20
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,520
We got gear everywhere.

21
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,360
But I don't know.

22
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,680
I kind of think this year, more so than any year,

23
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,120
the booth itself could be an exhibit.

24
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,040
Oh yeah, yeah.

25
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,240
Really high-end Linux production equipment,

26
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,320
like the highest-end stuff we've ever done.

27
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,440
Noah did some last-minute flying around

28
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,440
to secure a really high-end production digital mixer for us.

29
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,920
That's why you're soldering wires,

30
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,040
because it turns out,

31
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,920
when you go into a certain category of hardware,

32
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,800
they don't just make average consumer connections anymore.

33
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,360
You've got to custom build everything.

34
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,600
Yeah, if you look at an XLR cable,

35
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,840
you figure there's three conductors.

36
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,960
The wire's that big, right?

37
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,840
And we put this big old honkin' connector on it.

38
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,680
Why?

39
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,720
In a live environment,

40
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,040
where you're unplugging and plugging things in,

41
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,920
you need that flexibility.

42
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,240
But in a studio environment,

43
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,480
you're really putting the microphone in,

44
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,280
and it's gonna stay there for 15 years.

45
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,200
And so we're gonna put XLR cables in,

46
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,640
so that we can unplug them and plug them into the Linux.

47
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
It'll be beautiful.

48
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,840
And then we're gonna move it to Linux Fest.

49
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,220
We're gonna have a heck of a show.

50
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,060
All right, Bramberry,

51
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,880
you come back in later on the show

52
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,720
and you chat with us

53
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,540
as we talk about more of what we're doing.

54
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,960
But you go out there and keep on boxing.

55
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,220
This is Linux Unplugged,

56
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,720
episode 246,

57
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,280
for April 24th, 2018.

58
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,280
Welcome to Linux Unplugged,

59
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,560
your wiggly Linux talk show

60
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,360
that's flying a little blind this week,

61
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,400
a little raw,

62
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,440
and there's a lot of plasma all around me.

63
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,280
My name is Chris.

64
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,100
My name is Wes.

65
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,120
It has been a re-install fest, Mr. Wes.

66
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,960
That almost,

67
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,560
that looks beautiful around here.

68
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,720
So fresh, so clean.

69
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,920
You know, it's been really nice.

70
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,760
It's been a lot of fun.

71
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,520
We'll talk about our adventures in Kubuntu 18.04

72
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,640
coming up a little bit here in this here show.

73
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,900
But we have so many other things to get into.

74
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,400
As always, we have ourselves some community news.

75
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,280
We'll get through all of that in the beginning,

76
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,000
including an open source modular router

77
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
that's being crowdfunded.

78
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,240
The Linux terminal coming to Chrome OS.

79
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,960
The state of Thunderbolt in Fedora 28.

80
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,960
A reevaluation and an update on Ubuntu's beta milestones.

81
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,220
And then very quietly recently,

82
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,040
Microsoft disbanded the Windows division.

83
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,400
There's no more Windows division at Microsoft anymore.

84
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,360
Let that, let that sink in for a second.

85
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,480
They've been merged into a larger group

86
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,120
that's responsible for just general consumer devices.

87
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,800
The biggest empire inside Microsoft is gone.

88
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,320
So we'll talk about what that could mean

89
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,160
for their Linux future.

90
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,680
Then I've got a couple of app picks for you.

91
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,360
A great update on that big no memory leak

92
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,560
and the fallout of the conversation

93
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,000
and the discussion in the community that took place

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,480
because of that memory leak.

95
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,000
And then after I talk about my new favorite backup program,

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,920
we'll reveal the big change that we've been making

97
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,120
in the studio, the new investment in Linux

98
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,960
that we're making,

99
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,880
and discuss some Linux Fest Northwest plans coming up.

100
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,080
Ooh, I'm excited.

101
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,120
Which is just this weekend.

102
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,960
Can you believe it?

103
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,800
No, that's crazy.

104
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,000
Oh!

105
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,640
Yeah, that's gonna be a big deal.

106
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,600
But before we go any further,

107
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,320
we've got to bring in our virtual log.

108
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,440
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

109
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,280
What's up?

110
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,960
Hey, to you.

111
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,360
Oh, man, that was a thick introduction.

112
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,200
I liked it.

113
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,020
That was nice.

114
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,720
So let's start with something that is really, really,

115
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,520
really, really potential for,

116
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,640
has a lot of potential for fixing a big problem

117
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,000
in the consumer market.

118
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,560
One of the things that just drives me crazy

119
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,360
is the state of routers.

120
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,840
Home routers, those cheap routers

121
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,480
that people are buying from electronic stores

122
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,720
or from Amazon or wherever,

123
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,220
they throw them in and then three years later,

124
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,360
they never, they haven't given a second thought.

125
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,680
They've missed 16 updates

126
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,760
and they're just little vulnerability boxes

127
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,080
that are waiting for some sort of attack,

128
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,160
some sort of attack,

129
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,120
either just monitoring or some sort of DNS attack.

130
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,400
They're just such a sad state.

131
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,640
And they're really the early canary in the coal mine

132
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,600
for Internet of Things.

133
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,440
Very much so.

134
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,940
And we blew it.

135
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,520
And we still haven't really solved it.

136
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,280
And there's tons of good open source projects.

137
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,360
We've talked about MonoWall,

138
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,040
we've talked about PFSense,

139
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,240
but there hasn't been like this consumer focused,

140
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,040
all in one solution that us geeks

141
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,120
could really wrap our head around.

142
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,080
Right, anything else is like a cloud managed service

143
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,800
that manages the updates for you.

144
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,640
No good.

145
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,460
And while that may work,

146
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,000
it doesn't really fit our features.

147
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,820
That's not, I mean,

148
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,280
no one might prefer a cloud connected router.

149
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,120
You sure would.

150
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,580
But not me, no, no way.

151
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,680
So this has left a spot in the market

152
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,080
for somebody to fulfill an Enter Turris Mox.

153
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,320
I think I might be saying that right,

154
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,600
but who really knows.

155
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,160
It is a modular open source router

156
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,720
that is currently being crowdfunded.

157
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,440
And the goal of the campaign

158
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,520
is to make a modular that has three individual components.

159
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,840
This is where the modular part comes in,

160
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,240
depending on what you need.

161
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,800
They want to give the user the ability

162
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,360
to put together a custom router

163
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,400
that fits your network's requirements.

164
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,420
And they say it's probably the first router

165
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,520
that's configurable and easy as a sandwich.

166
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,280
You just choose the parts you actually want

167
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,120
and you assemble it like you would a sandwich.

168
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,800
To make it happen, there's five modules available,

169
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,400
but really you could just focus on a couple of them.

170
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,100
And they hired a fancy voiceover guy to do it,

171
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,900
so I'll have him do it instead of me.

172
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,120
Your perfect router can consist of these modules.

173
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Basic, Extension, Ethernet, and SFP.

174
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,660
The basic module is powered by a passive-cooled

175
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,660
Marvell Armada processor,

176
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,660
has a micro SD card slot, USB 3, and a gigabit WAN port.

177
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,780
With the Wi-Fi card alone,

178
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,300
it can serve as a pocket-ready router,

179
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,820
or you can connect it to your router,

180
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,540
for example, Omnia, as an access point.

181
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,820
If you need faster wireless speed,

182
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,100
just connect the Extension module

183
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,100
with a five gigahertz Wi-Fi card connected to the MPCI Express slot.

184
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,100
Or, you can switch the Wi-Fi card with an SSD to make a NAS.

185
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,100
Or, you can insert a SIM card to the slot,

186
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,100
connect an LTE modem,

187
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,100
and use this module as a backup connectivity solution.

188
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,100
You can also connect the Ethernet module with four gigabit ports.

189
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Hoorah! Man, tell you what.

190
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,100
That is the worst voice-over ever.

191
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
Got me all fired up!

192
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,100
Yeah, Taurus.

193
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,100
Didn't make you want to buy, huh Wimpy?

194
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,100
They could have paid Popey to do that for twice as much and got better value.

195
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,100
They might have been able to hire the Mycroft device and got a better value,

196
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,100
I'm not sure, but the idea is pretty neat.

197
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,100
You've got this router that has the different components depending on what you need.

198
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
If you need lots of gigabit, it can even do it.

199
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,100
And then they have software features,

200
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,100
like an open VPN server, an SSH honeypot, parental controls.

201
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,100
The kind of neat thing is the honeypot is set up to be involved in a research project,

202
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,100
so it is involved in a wider honeypot collection metric thing.

203
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,100
That's kind of neat.

204
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,100
So, it's a Taurus Mox.

205
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,100
Neat idea.

206
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,100
I don't think they sold us though, did they?

207
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,100
They didn't sell us.

208
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,100
How is their funding?

209
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
This is their second round.

210
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,100
They've had success.

211
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Wes, did you fund them?

212
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
Wes, did you fund the last one?

213
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,100
Because you got an email about this.

214
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
No, I think I just subscribed for updates.

215
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,100
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

216
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
So, I was clearly interested in the past.

217
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,100
Yeah, it's a neat idea.

218
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,100
Does anybody know what chip they have from Marvell?

219
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:50,100
Because from what I understand, Marvell's best chips are our mother's latest chips,

220
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:57,100
and those are based on A72 Cortex-R, which are vulnerable by meltdown and stuff.

221
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:03,100
I'm sorry, I was already not buying much of their premise,

222
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,100
because I think it's duplication of efforts of Freedombox.

223
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,100
I want somebody to come in and make a device that looks good,

224
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
that fits just the general consumer,

225
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,100
but I believe that there's a project for that already,

226
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,100
and if they could actually bring a consumer perspective to that project,

227
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,100
I would be very glad to support it.

228
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,100
But also, the stuff that I'm hearing doesn't make it much better,

229
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:32,100
and most of Marvell's chips are Cortex-A72 and A53, which are both vulnerable.

230
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:38,100
It says here it's based on the Marvell Armada 3720 with a 1.2 GHz dual-core.

231
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,100
Yes, that's a Cortex-A53.

232
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,100
I'm just checking it right now, and that's vulnerable.

233
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Oh, good meltdown.

234
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,100
Because better security, great, awesome.

235
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,100
Also, it'll be using Kernel 4.14 LTS, which is the same as OpenWRT 18.5,

236
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,100
which it is based on, it's Czech Republic,

237
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Chaotix says in the chat room is where they're from.

238
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
So there you go.

239
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,100
You know, I like the idea.

240
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,100
I actually like it.

241
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
I'm not going to back it myself.

242
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,100
For me, I've sort of moved on to larger hardware for this kind of job.

243
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Yeah, I have as well.

244
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
Neat idea though.

245
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
And the pricing is not bad.

246
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Early bird is $130.

247
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
It's bad.

248
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Routers are becoming expensive.

249
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Routers were always cheap and most of the times even offered.

250
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:26,100
Yes, I'm not advocating for the offers that ISPs usually provide,

251
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,100
but they've always been cheap.

252
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,100
Out of a sudden, they're becoming these expensive things,

253
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,100
like they fix your problems and they never fix your problems.

254
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,100
Yeah.

255
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Also, do you need your router to be a NAS?

256
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Like I don't ever want my router to be a NAS.

257
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,100
By the way, Dart, I would like to issue a correction.

258
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Good routers, those are expensive.

259
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,100
The cheap ones are like don't really have much security

260
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,100
and don't really have updates just to give you a little bit of a contortion.

261
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
I understand.

262
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,100
What I mean is it should never be something too expensive.

263
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,100
Look at the hardware that they bring inside.

264
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Most of the times what they bring is a benefit.

265
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,100
The higher range ones are not really on chips,

266
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,100
but rather on design of antennas, on ways of actually capturing signal,

267
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,100
which is what a router is supposed to do really well.

268
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Of course, when you're talking at a high bandwidth,

269
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
that has an impact on the chips you're having there

270
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,100
and, of course, increases the price.

271
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,100
But oftentimes when you're going to the $500 range,

272
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,100
what you really mean is you should be paying a hundred-something dollar range.

273
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,100
I do like that it's open source.

274
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,100
So there is a premium as a particular type of consumer that I'd be willing to pay,

275
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,100
but it's not a premium that I think the average consumer would be willing to pay.

276
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Absolutely not.

277
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
It's doing well, Funny Wise.

278
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,100
We'll have a link in the show notes if you guys want to check it out after the show.

279
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,100
But this is actually the story I was going to start the show with, this next one.

280
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,100
And it's going to be one of these revelations

281
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,100
that I think is going to be received in two different ways in the community.

282
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
Oh good, more Linux and open source users.

283
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,100
And the other one is, oh my God, Chrome OS is going to crush Linux.

284
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Sort of like the subsystem for Linux on Windows has been.

285
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,100
This is happening.

286
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,100
It just seems nothing but absolute at this point.

287
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,100
There is additional screenshots that have surfaced indicating that a terminal app

288
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,100
that gives you access to the Bash shell on Chromebooks is shipping soon.

289
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,100
It started back in February when there was some code base that revealed

290
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,100
that Chrome OS would have some capability of running Linux applications using a container,

291
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,100
which we talked about a little bit, but there wasn't a lot to go into.

292
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,100
Now it appears that additional builds have come out

293
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,100
and more evidence of this feature has appeared in the Chrome OS dev channel.

294
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,100
And several Reddit users did some digging

295
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,100
and they found a new terminal app that's been added to the app drawer.

296
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
And when you click on it, it explains the feature.

297
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,100
It comes up with a dialogue, and the dialogue says,

298
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
you can now develop on your Chromebook.

299
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,100
You can run your favorite native apps and command line tools seamlessly and securely.

300
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Installing the terminal will download 200 megabytes of data.

301
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,100
Probably a container, huh?

302
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
Wow, interesting.

303
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,100
And then when you try to do it, it fails at this point because it's not actually done.

304
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,100
Look at that little logo, fits right in.

305
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,100
What do you think about this, Wes? Terminals on Chromebooks.

306
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:09,100
I mean, that would go a long way to leave the needs I have just to get more work done.

307
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,100
Sure, web browsing is fine, but if I could get even just SSH into some servers very easily,

308
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
that would be maybe just a sweet spot.

309
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Not for me still, but I think a lot of people could use it.

310
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,100
Google is learning that they need to actually attract developers,

311
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
and that's the tool to attract developers.

312
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,100
I think it's a little bit too late and not really a threat for Linux.

313
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
Yeah, I don't think so either.

314
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,100
In fact, I think more so, I think about my son who's been issued a Chromebook,

315
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,100
and I think my daughter gets issued one next year as part of hers.

316
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,100
And they're his school curriculum, and potentially now my son will have access to a terminal.

317
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,100
That seems like it has way more upsides than it does downsides.

318
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,100
And I'm sure Google is going to implement it in a way that he can't go like RM-RF root or something.

319
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,100
So we'll see that.

320
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Maybe, maybe it won't matter because we'll all switch to Bollock.

321
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
I don't know how you actually say it.

322
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
It's Block.

323
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Oh, what's your mouth at?

324
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,100
Bellock, what do you think, guys?

325
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,100
What is it, Wes? B-L-L-O-C?

326
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
No, there's no A.

327
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
No A.

328
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,100
It's Bollock or Bollock or what? Block?

329
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Everybody's switching to Bollocks.

330
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Yeah, it's all Bollocks, my friends.

331
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,100
No, I think Block, like a block of wood maybe.

332
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,100
Oh, yeah, a block of wood.

333
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,100
It's a phone that is focused on simplicity.

334
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
Simplicity, it's easy for me to say.

335
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:30,100
They say a plain, minimalistic smartphone that combines a power-saving operating system

336
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:36,100
with efficient hardware and an easy-to-use messaging platform, and it's monochrome.

337
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,100
The whole thing is monochrome.

338
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
Nobody's buying it.

339
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,100
I don't know.

340
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
Quite a sharp look.

341
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
That's my prediction.

342
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Another messaging platform.

343
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,100
Well, it uses WhatsApp.

344
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,100
It has Uber and Facebook Messenger, and it has Google Maps.

345
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,100
So they're bringing somehow, they're bringing a small set of applications.

346
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Instead of multiple distractions, we aim for focus.

347
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,100
Instead of fragmented conversations, we strive for continuity and fluidity.

348
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Booking your flight, checking weather, or ordering on Uber,

349
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,100
it all happens in one place, the root.

350
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,100
So they have this UI system that they've designed,

351
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,100
which looks a lot like Windows 8 tiles, only maybe a little more minimal and clean,

352
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,100
and the whole UI is built around monochrome, black and white.

353
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,100
You mean it looks like Fushio OS?

354
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,100
Kind of, yeah.

355
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,100
I would say more Windows phone possibly.

356
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,100
Yeah, like a combo.

357
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,100
It's a combo of them.

358
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,100
It's a combo and then black and white, and like if you were going to design today,

359
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,100
it's got 4 gigs of RAM, which seems like a ton for a device like this.

360
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,100
It's got an octa-core 2 gigahertz ARM A53 Cortex processor.

361
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,100
It's got a 3000 milliamp battery.

362
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,100
It's got a camera in it, a decent Sony 13 megapixel camera in it.

363
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,100
USB-C.

364
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Yep, USB-C.

365
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
It's got a headphone jack.

366
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
It's got fast charging.

367
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Let me see if I got it right.

368
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,100
So we took years and years of developing excellent cameras

369
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
to then see them in a monochrome screen.

370
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,100
Yes, yes, and years and years of all these mobile applications

371
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,100
to just have them on a simple black and white screen.

372
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,100
I don't know if it's going to work, but I'll tell you, I know what the market,

373
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
I just know it.

374
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,100
They're going for people that kind of want a feature phone,

375
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
but they don't want to go that far back in time.

376
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
They still want to be able to book an Uber,

377
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
and they still want to be able to use Google Maps.

378
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,100
And so they need something that isn't full-fledged smartphone

379
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,100
because they've determined that's the evil thing in their life

380
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,100
that's wrecking their life.

381
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,100
And so if they purge the smartphone from life,

382
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,100
but they get something that's still capable of booking a ride

383
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,100
and nav, then they're not a crackpot that's trying like a pager

384
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
or something in 2018.

385
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
So I think there is a market for it.

386
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
It can't be $350.

387
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,100
It can't be some boutique thing.

388
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,100
It'd have to be sold at scale, at carriers.

389
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
It'd probably have to be something from a Samsung or a Nokia,

390
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
in my personal opinion.

391
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Yeah, that's 360 euros, so it's like 440.

392
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
Oh, okay.

393
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,100
That's even more, yeah.

394
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,100
And Doug and Doug and Doug, I didn't see a lot of references

395
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,100
to Linux or Android in there, but it must be Android.

396
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,100
I didn't see which frequencies bands it supported either.

397
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,100
It's a weird device, but it's also, it's one of those devices

398
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
that if you had this device, it would stand out.

399
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
It sure would.

400
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,100
I would say if somebody really wants something like it,

401
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
they would get a Yota phone.

402
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
Is that the one with the e-ink?

403
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Yes, it has a back of e-ink and the front is an actual screen,

404
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
but you can actually just get away with using the e-ink.

405
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
Yeah, that would be cool.

406
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Yeah, the difference between the Yota phone and this phone

407
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:33,100
is that the Yota phone's display is very low, very low in frame rate.

408
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Yeah, but that's the thing.

409
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
If you said it is because it's Russian, I mean,

410
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,100
if the person really wants to get away from the modern smartphone

411
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,100
and have this as an excuse to, I'm cutting down on this,

412
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,100
yeah, the only downside would be that this phone is kind of Russian.

413
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
It's the only real thing.

414
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
Minimac, you make a good point that they might be overshooting

415
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,100
with that screen, not because it's monochrome, but because of the size, huh?

416
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,100
Yeah, if you're a really feature phone user,

417
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,100
you don't want a 5.5-inch phone, you want a smaller one.

418
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:10,100
I'm looking for a small 5-inch phone again, but you don't find some.

419
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
Only Sony does want some.

420
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Yeah, I've looked at that Sony one a couple of times and went,

421
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
oh, that'd be sweet.

422
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,100
I had a Sony Ericsson back in the day that could fit in my coin pocket,

423
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,100
just this tiny little phone, a little GSM feature phone,

424
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,100
the neatest little thing.

425
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
Lasts for days.

426
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Yeah.

427
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,100
It doesn't have to do much except make phone calls.

428
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Yeah, yeah.

429
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,100
All right, well, let's take a moment right here and thank Ting then

430
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,100
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

431
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,100
This seems like a natural spot.

432
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,100
Go to, you ready for this, linux.ting.com.

433
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,100
You get to put Linux in there, linux.ting.com,

434
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,100
and you'll get a $25 service credit or $25 off a device.

435
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
It's smarter than unlimited mobile.

436
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,100
It's paid for what you use.

437
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,100
So right now, Wes, myself, and Noah are sitting here at the studio,

438
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
and all of our phones are on Wi-Fi.

439
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,100
Every push notification we get, every telegram we get,

440
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
it all is coming in over Wi-Fi.

441
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,100
And I think that's why when you're a geek and you kind of understand

442
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,100
that there's different networks and some are like you own them

443
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,100
and you can use as much data as you want,

444
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,100
and some are like rate limited by a service provider or monitored,

445
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
if you just understand that concept,

446
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,100
that's the only hack you need to get a ton of value out of Ting.

447
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,100
It's paid for what you use, just a fair price for how much you talk,

448
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,100
text, and data you use, and you can rock that.

449
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
I download my podcast, I pin my music on Wi-Fi,

450
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,100
and that covers most of it.

451
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
I text message over telegram, now Bob's my uncle.

452
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,100
They have nationwide coverage, and like I said, CDMA and GSM,

453
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,100
so you can bring a device or you can just pick one up from Ting directly

454
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
and choose whatever works best in your area.

455
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,100
And when you go to linux.ting.com, you get $25 off a device.

456
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,100
If you bring one, they'll give you $25 in service credit.

457
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
And if you ever get stuck, you ever have a question,

458
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,100
the best customer service in the industry,

459
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,100
I wouldn't say that unless it was true.

460
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
It is absolutely 100% true.

461
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,100
They have the best customer service in the industry,

462
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
and you can just get a taste of it when you call in.

463
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,100
linux.ting.com, that's where you go to get started.

464
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,100
And speaking of those feature phones, they got a good smattering of them.

465
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,100
They have around $60, you can get a couple of great ones,

466
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,100
and then they have one as low as $49, the Anzatel Go Flip.

467
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
It's got a monochrome, speaking of monochrome,

468
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,100
it's got a monochrome screen on the front so you can get a clock and stuff like that,

469
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
and you open up, it's got a full color screen.

470
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,100
Even these have like cameras and stuff.

471
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,100
Yeah, totally.

472
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,100
It's like even then, the reason why that camera is nice on these feature phones

473
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,100
is for like insurance situations or whatnot.

474
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Just a casual picture doesn't need to be great, just a quick document.

475
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,100
Come on, you know what you're taking pictures of,

476
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
you don't need it to be that high resolution.

477
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,100
You know what I'm saying.

478
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:39,100
linux.ting.com, a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring this year Unplugged program,

479
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,100
and thanks to Ting and thanks to you guys,

480
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,100
not only for sponsoring to Ting, but for you guys out there,

481
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
going out there and using linux.ting.com to keep us going.

482
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,100
246 episodes.

483
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,100
Keep on going over at Fedora too.

484
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,100
Fedora 28 is just around the corner,

485
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,100
and one of the cool features in Fedora 28

486
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,100
is how badass their Thunderbolt 3 support is.

487
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,100
It really all starts upstream with Bolt.

488
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,100
Bolt's been getting development for a while.

489
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,100
We've covered it once before on the show.

490
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,100
Bolt is a project that's been moved now over to freedesktop.org

491
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,100
that works with the security models of Thunderbolt 3,

492
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,100
a D-Bus API, and in this case, Gnome and some kernel changes

493
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,100
to give users control over Thunderbolt 3's permissiveness.

494
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,100
So you hook up a device.

495
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,100
If it's Thunderbolt 3, it's essentially on your PCI bus.

496
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,100
It's like you just put a card inside your case.

497
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,100
And so that gives you access to things like memory contents

498
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,100
that are on the PCI bus.

499
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,100
You might not want that, especially if you're in a more

500
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,100
secured environment or there's other people around.

501
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,100
You may want to be able to say, no, don't give that access

502
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,100
to all of the things like my keys that are being stored in RAM right now.

503
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,100
So there's bits now that have been added in Gnome Shell

504
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:57,100
and backported to the Gnome Shell that's shipping in Fedora 28,

505
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,100
which is part of why Fedora 28 has a little bit extra sauce here.

506
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,100
A little extra magic.

507
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,100
Gnome 3.3.0 will have these changes upstream.

508
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,100
I suppose anybody can probably backport them.

509
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,100
But it comes with a new panel in Gnome that allows you to manage all of this.

510
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,100
And it gives you features like being able to temporarily disable authorization

511
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,100
if you don't want to do anything for a little bit.

512
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,100
In technical terms, without authorization on the PCIe tunnels,

513
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,100
no new tunnels are allowed to be created on the bus.

514
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
And then you get a failure mode.

515
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,100
And the Thunderbolt port, yeah, it's hard for me to say, Wes,

516
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:39,100
will still function as USB and DisplayPort, but it will not act as PCIe.

517
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,100
Oh, wow. This is sophisticated.

518
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,100
Yeah, you'll get options in Gnome, and you set those.

519
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
It'll support firmware updates.

520
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,100
If your screen is locked, if you're away, if your machine's asleep,

521
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,100
it'll automatically default to disable.

522
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
Oh, perfect. Some smart stuff like that.

523
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,100
Yeah, so that's coming in Fedora 28 is some really good Thunderbolt support.

524
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,100
Some quality desktop operating system level feature right here.

525
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,100
I don't think you even get, you don't get that crap on the Mac.

526
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,100
My other favorite part is that they're calling the activity indicator the cable snake.

527
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,100
That is good. Good catch. That is a good part of it. You're right.

528
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,100
Cable snake. I don't have a lot of Thunderbolt 3 devices to test,

529
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,100
but I bet Wimpy, actually, you probably have some of the most in the room

530
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
because all your eGPU shenanigans have been over Thunderbolt.

531
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,100
Have you thought about the security model stuff with this?

532
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,100
Is this something you're concerned about when it comes to Thunderbolt?

533
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,100
Well, by and large, I've been using NUX in the house,

534
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:37,100
so I've just been turning on the open it all up mode.

535
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,100
I've got a couple of laptops that I've used,

536
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,100
and I've been toggling the BIOS settings,

537
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,100
and I've been going out and about with those.

538
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,100
And I have been tracking this project,

539
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:50,100
and it's something that I want to look at during the Ubuntu 18.10 cycle

540
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,100
to try and integrate, because like you say, it's a bit niche, right?

541
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,100
You need to be somebody that's using this stuff in order to appreciate its value.

542
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,100
So something I'm going to be looking at over the next six months.

543
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,100
Neat. Yeah, it is something that not a lot of us have a need for yet,

544
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,100
but I could see it coming down the road,

545
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,100
especially if eGPUs get more and more common.

546
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,100
I'm really kind of excited about the potential of getting a low-power laptop

547
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
and then hooking up an eGPU to it.

548
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,100
So I could see this becoming more common,

549
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,100
but it'll probably take a little while to warm up.

550
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,100
I can see it for compliance reasons, too.

551
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,100
There may be things that you need to be able to prove

552
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,100
about attaching peripherals to devices that the subsystem can support now.

553
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,100
Yeah, I mean, enterprises have been getting their pants in the knot

554
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
about USB devices for years,

555
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:38,100
and this is an interface where you're basically plugging into lanes on the CPU.

556
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,100
So it needs to be well-controlled and managed.

557
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,100
Yeah, fair enough.

558
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,100
All right, I might need somebody to translate a little canonicalese for me here.

559
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,100
But a couple of weeks ago, and covered on the Ubuntu podcast,

560
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
as well, was the Quigley proposal,

561
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,100
which was a reevaluation of Ubuntu's testing milestones.

562
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,100
And now this is where I need the translation.

563
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
So Simon made the proposal, and it came on up,

564
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,100
and we talked about it a little bit, and it sounded pretty solid.

565
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:09,100
The general idea is starting from now on, there will be an opt-in milestone,

566
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,100
or I guess that's going to be discontinued, that's what it was,

567
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,100
and there will be testing weeks from now on, starting with the 1810 cycle.

568
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,100
And different flavors, I believe, will just say,

569
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,100
I'll opt-in, I'll do the testing, other flavors won't,

570
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,100
and there will just be a period of focused testing,

571
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,100
and this is just going to start happening with the next cycle.

572
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Is this all accurate? Anybody want to correct me on that?

573
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,100
Okay, so I – well, Poppy, do you want to go for this, or should I?

574
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,100
Knock yourself out.

575
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,100
All right, I'll do it then. You can do the next one, whatever the next one is.

576
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,100
Yeah, good.

577
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,100
I hope it is, actually. We should make it mate and make Poppy do it.

578
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
Actually, that's a really good idea.

579
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
Let's do it, let's do it.

580
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,100
If you have any suggestions, though, I need a suggestion.

581
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,100
Hmm, I don't know.

582
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,100
Despite his blushes and refusals, he's an expert, by the way.

583
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
I believe it.

584
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,100
So did I get my coverage of the milestones shift rate, the testing weeks?

585
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,100
What's going on?

586
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:08,100
Yeah, so we use – well, we currently do, the flavors in Ubuntu currently do,

587
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,100
like Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Beta 1, and then at Beta 2, that's when Ubuntu steps in.

588
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,100
We all do Beta 2. We all do RCs.

589
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,100
So right now, Ubuntu 18.04 is two days away,

590
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,100
so we're on our second release candidate image right now for those people

591
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,100
that are following the QA train and testing stuff.

592
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,100
What the flavors are going to do for 18.10, and we've all bought into this,

593
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:37,100
is we're going to drop those Alpha 1s and those Alpha 2s and those Beta 1s,

594
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:43,100
and as a community, those flavors are going to replace those milestone releases

595
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,100
if this is a week that all of the Ubuntu community get behind to say,

596
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,100
this is a week we're going to do testing.

597
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,100
This is a week where you can go and grab the daily image

598
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,100
for any of your favorite flavors and perform the testing,

599
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:02,100
and we're going to coalesce around a week of testing as a community in the whole,

600
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,100
rather than what we have now is silos of the flavors doing testing

601
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,100
within their own organizations.

602
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,100
And we're going to be replacing some of the manual testing that we've been doing

603
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,100
with the automated testing that already happens within Ubuntu proper.

604
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,100
So that will mean that we can focus, the flavors can focus on the new

605
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,100
and interesting things that they're working on, rather than making sure

606
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,100
the mechanics of installing and upgrading the distribution work.

607
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,100
So we can move away from manually testing that stuff to just focusing on the good stuff.

608
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,100
Now, how does this exactly go down?

609
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,100
So Simon makes a proposal, and essentially nobody says no,

610
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,100
and so then it just becomes the way it goes now?

611
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
It wasn't out of the blue.

612
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,100
For anyone that's in the Ubuntu developer community,

613
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:59,100
Simon had had the good grace to contact us all on a one-to-one basis beforehand

614
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,100
and sound us out.

615
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:07,100
So his proposal was crafted around feedback he'd got from those one-to-one conversations.

616
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,100
So this wasn't from left of field.

617
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:16,100
This was Simon presenting an idea that everyone was already aware of

618
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
and had already opted into to some extent.

619
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,100
I guess I was more commenting on what seems to be a low level of friction

620
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,100
to implement what is a rather significant type of testing change,

621
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,100
which is a good thing, right?

622
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,100
It doesn't have to go through 10 levels of council before it happens.

623
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,100
But that was interesting to see go down.

624
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,100
It makes sense if you discuss it ahead of time,

625
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,100
you communicate it ahead of time to the stakeholders, quote, unquote,

626
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,100
and they're on board, pretty safe bet it's going to sail through smoothly.

627
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,100
And I think there's only a couple of flavors that have represented this.

628
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:51,100
There's only one downside, and the downside that I see is that

629
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:58,100
the only version that people are going to adopt early now will be the final beta.

630
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,100
So Ubuntu proper and the flavors

631
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,100
are going to have a version that's available on the same day.

632
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:12,100
And that's going to make it difficult for the flavors to grab a new cycle.

633
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:17,100
So traditionally, we've kind of argued the toss between us about, you know,

634
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,100
I'm going to make a big grandstanding announcement for Alpha 2

635
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,100
and you're going to make a big grandstanding announcement for beta one.

636
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,100
And we know that those new cycles are clear for the flavors

637
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,100
and those are going away now.

638
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,100
So that's the only downside.

639
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:37,100
But we've decided, by and large, we're prepared to give that up

640
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,100
in order to work towards better testing methodology.

641
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,100
That's interesting.

642
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,100
Thank you for that insight.

643
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
I appreciate that.

644
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:50,100
And I guess, to me, I look at it as sort of it draws in the focus.

645
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
That's what I loved about the proposal,

646
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,100
is it just sort of focuses everyone's attention on a period of time.

647
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
Yeah, exactly.

648
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
Now, Pobie, you want to add something to this mix.

649
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,100
Why don't you jump in?

650
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,100
Yeah, it's something you've highlighted.

651
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,100
The fact that Simon just brought this up on a mailing list

652
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,100
and then it becomes law, right,

653
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,100
is something that I think is a bit of a misconception about Ubuntu.

654
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,100
People seem to think that canonical dictate all the decisions in Ubuntu

655
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,100
and all the flavors and nobody has any autonomy,

656
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,100
which is like this shows just how far from the truth that is.

657
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
That anyone within the project, if they've got a good idea

658
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,100
and they can articulate it well and they can specify what the advantages are

659
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,100
and what the costs will be, then people will adopt it

660
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,100
and it's the new way forward.

661
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
That's exactly how Ubuntu works,

662
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,100
is people all around the community putting in their suggestions

663
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
and coming up with ideas on how to improve the project

664
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,100
and it's not all just Mark sitting in a gold chair

665
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
dictating how the project is going to be run.

666
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,100
It's brilliant.

667
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
I love it.

668
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,100
Yeah, it's like you always say, Pobie, the proof is in the pudding.

669
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
I think you've always said that.

670
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,100
You've always said that every time.

671
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,100
I've never said that.

672
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
I literally never said that.

673
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,100
Well, I thought I heard that.

674
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
Yeah, good point though.

675
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,100
And I guess we'll see this play out in 18.10 right now.

676
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
I think we've probably spent enough on it

677
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,100
because we should probably start focusing on 18.04 coming up

678
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,100
because gosh knows I have.

679
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
I'm excited.

680
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
Gosh darn it.

681
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,100
But I want to talk about this Microsoft story just for a moment

682
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,100
because it's one of those where it really slipped through the cracks

683
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,100
because the corporate speak around it is all positive.

684
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,100
You know, so-and-so has departed from the company

685
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:25,100
and we will be moving this group under this new group that we've just formed.

686
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,100
And this new group is fantastic because it's future

687
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,100
and future is good and the future is bright.

688
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,100
And everything is good because future.

689
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,100
And that's essentially the announcement that came out two weeks ago.

690
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,100
And it's taken me a couple of weeks to process what's happened.

691
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,100
Noah was here with me last night while I was doing the prep.

692
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,100
I was like I will not go off of one story.

693
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,100
I don't care if it's trajectory.

694
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,100
I don't care.

695
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,100
I want three additional sources that are citing this.

696
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,100
And so we found three additional sources.

697
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,100
We have them linked in the show notes that are citing this.

698
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
Using GoogleFu to the maximum.

699
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
Yeah, both of us were, yeah.

700
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,100
The thing is it's sort of a huge, huge development.

701
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,100
So I didn't want to come on the air

702
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
and accidentally overstate what had happened

703
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,100
because when you're digging through this corporate speak,

704
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,100
it's early to misunderstand.

705
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,100
But there were clues that kind of all led to this.

706
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,100
I say maybe dots that could have been connected.

707
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,100
The first big clue about Windows future was that

708
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,100
Microsoft's Windows and Devices group is now called

709
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,100
the Experience and Devices group.

710
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,100
They've dropped the Windows thing.

711
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,100
And it includes now Windows Office and Surface.

712
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,100
Microsoft's Office Chief is now in charge of the division.

713
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,100
So the guy that runs Office 365 is now in charge

714
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,100
of the people that are developing Windows.

715
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,100
Which that used, Windows used to control the shop.

716
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,100
Windows and Office were really the two major fiefdoms

717
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,100
in Microsoft that really fought.

718
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,100
And then SQL came up.

719
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,100
I mean, in the good old days of Microsoft,

720
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,100
the whole company, the balance of the entire company

721
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,100
was shifted towards Windows.

722
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,100
And now it's being run by Office 365,

723
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,100
which Microsoft internally just considers to be

724
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,100
a smashing success.

725
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,100
So Experiences instead of Windows was really the first big hint.

726
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,100
You could see really kind of signaling from Satya Nadella.

727
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,100
When you look at the numbers really, it's kind of obvious.

728
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,100
If Microsoft just took their heads out of their arse

729
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,100
and looked around, they'd see that there's 2 billion

730
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
monthly active Android devices.

731
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,100
And there's more than a billion monthly active iPhones,

732
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,100
or Apple devices, iOS devices, all around the world.

733
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,100
Well, Microsoft claims there's 1.5 billion Windows users total.

734
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,100
And 600 million Windows 10 users as of November.

735
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:46,100
So Windows is now a tertiary platform, really.

736
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,100
That doesn't make it tertiary, though.

737
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,100
So here is how I will say it does not.

738
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,100
The customers that pay the most are the ones

739
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
that are obligated to do so.

740
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,100
And those are enterprises and governments.

741
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,100
How many governments are using iOSX?

742
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,100
I wouldn't look at it from the desktop perspective.

743
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
In that case, you could flip that question around

744
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,100
and you could say services.

745
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:11,100
And there would be, why would they even be going to cloud services?

746
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,100
And a lot of times it's because they're trying to address

747
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,100
a massive mobile demand.

748
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,100
I mean, that was a huge source of my client base

749
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,100
towards the end of my IT career was companies scrambling

750
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,100
to redo their services because of the demand from mobile clients.

751
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,100
I think if you look at it, every Windows user

752
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,100
has an Android or an iPhone.

753
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,100
So it's just huge in terms of end user reach.

754
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,100
And you look at companies like Uber,

755
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,100
who are worldwide phenomenons,

756
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,100
and they've never written a Windows app.

757
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,100
Those haven't written necessarily an Android app

758
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,100
or an iOSX app.

759
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,100
You could make a point that they might be using Windows

760
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,100
to make the Android app.

761
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,100
So I'm not trying to discredit Windows.

762
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,100
But my point is, if Microsoft has their head out of their arse,

763
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,100
they've got to be seeing this.

764
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Windows isn't the biggest game in town anymore.

765
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,100
They've got to be seeing that.

766
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Of course, you are preaching to the choir.

767
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
The person in here who made the prediction

768
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,100
Microsoft would have a Linux distribution,

769
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,100
which they now do have.

770
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,100
Just a moment.

771
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,100
Yeah, you did get that.

772
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,100
Just a moment.

773
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,100
You got that.

774
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,100
And not only, I will tell you that in a year and a half

775
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,100
to maximum of two years, they will have a desktop environment

776
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
that is proprietary on a Linux machine.

777
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,100
Wow.

778
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,100
I mean, I would have said no way last time.

779
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,100
I want to say that now.

780
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,100
I can't say it now.

781
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,100
You never know.

782
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,100
I mean, you just never know.

783
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,100
It just makes business sense.

784
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,100
It does.

785
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,100
They have the subsystems, which they can now start building

786
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,100
their own apps against the subsystems.

787
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,100
And the devices, so they sell already Android phones.

788
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,100
They sell Samsung S8s, by the way.

789
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,100
So that's actually how they acquired the skill set.

790
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,100
They bought Android apps businesses so that they would

791
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,100
get the skills without indicating to the market

792
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
that they would be ditching Windows.

793
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
That's how they wanted to get the developers.

794
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,100
They got the developers by acquisition, not by hiring.

795
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:08,100
Because you can't lie on a hiring job advertisement

796
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
of what the person's going to do.

797
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,100
Otherwise, you don't hire the right person.

798
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,100
Don't you think, though, that it is sort of like the biggest

799
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:21,100
anti-climactic ending to the Windows empire?

800
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,100
No, it's actually strategic.

801
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
Oh, sure it is.

802
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,100
So I don't think it's even anti-climatic because what's

803
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,100
going to happen is you get the Windows experience.

804
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Like the thing that Microsoft always gives you, which is

805
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,100
continuity with partners.

806
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,100
This is the thing that Windows and Microsoft have always

807
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,100
guaranteed to you.

808
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,100
Yes, it was not the perfect operating system.

809
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,100
It never was.

810
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,100
It never intended to be.

811
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,100
It was never the unified experience.

812
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,100
But it always worked.

813
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,100
And when you got a peripheral from a partner,

814
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,100
it always worked.

815
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Yeah, you know what I would do if I was Microsoft?

816
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,100
Is I would look back, you know, with the same glasses that

817
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,100
they're looking at the rest of the market and going,

818
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,100
God, look at all these iOS and Android devices.

819
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,100
I'd look back and go, well, so what is the market for

820
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,100
Windows?

821
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,100
Because when you've got a billion users and 30 years of

822
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
user base, you're not going away.

823
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
You know, just like IBM.

824
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,100
You're going to be here forever.

825
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,100
It will go away.

826
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,100
It will go away.

827
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,100
Well, I mean, eventually.

828
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,100
But what could they do right now, say in the next 10 years,

829
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,100
to make Windows super relevant?

830
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,100
And I would look at the technical and development

831
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,100
market, the people building applications and services.

832
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
Like, that seems like where Windows goes.

833
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,100
Too slow, too little for Microsoft.

834
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,100
See?

835
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Yeah.

836
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,100
See, my prediction here is the following.

837
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,100
Okay.

838
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:41,100
Google has invested in making their assistant the best as

839
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,100
possible.

840
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,100
And they've captivated people into using for alarms and

841
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,100
things like that.

842
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,100
So it's already useful, right?

843
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,100
Yeah.

844
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,100
Microsoft has been trying to put the assistant mostly on

845
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,100
professional fields first.

846
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,100
For example, Skype for Business includes live translation.

847
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,100
Things like that in China, you know?

848
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,100
So things like that are the most powerful to integrate.

849
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,100
For example, you also look into Cortana.

850
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Cortana is not intended to just do calendars and stuff.

851
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,100
It's mostly for you actually to try to find files,

852
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,100
to run applications.

853
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:18,100
It's kind of more of an assistant design strategy.

854
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:22,100
And that means that if they get it right over time,

855
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,100
Microsoft has the capacity to, oh,

856
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:29,100
we sell you an Android phone, which includes Cortana.

857
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,100
And by the way, we sync it with a desktop.

858
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,100
And really, when Samsung comes out with a phone,

859
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,100
which is like about one to two years different distance

860
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,100
from now, which is going to be full glass,

861
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,100
there's not going to be buttons on it,

862
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
the assistant makes full sense.

863
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,100
It's just the phone that the assistant shows you some

864
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,100
stuff.

865
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
Sure, yeah.

866
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,100
And you talk to it.

867
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,100
I agree.

868
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,100
They would love that.

869
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,100
That would be really big for them.

870
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,100
Okay.

871
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
Thanks for getting here because you tagged me.

872
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,100
River, you still think there's a spot for Windows to be

873
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,100
pretty relevant, don't you?

874
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,100
Not really.

875
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,100
No, I can tell you the situation that I have right now

876
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,100
at work that's happening.

877
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,100
I manage probably 40 or 50, maybe 60 Windows desktops.

878
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,100
And I can tell you 99.9% of the applications that they

879
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,100
are running are open and free source applications.

880
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,100
Really?

881
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,100
And we're just, I'm on a precipice right now of

882
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,100
developing a Linux desktop for them.

883
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
And they can just take away the entire overhead of

884
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,100
running Windows desktops.

885
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,100
There's just almost no necessity for it.

886
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,100
Yeah.

887
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,100
The problem I'm facing now is a cultural one.

888
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,100
They don't want to switch.

889
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,100
They don't want to get from my cold dead hands.

890
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,100
They really don't want to get away from that.

891
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,100
But I am in a fortunate position where the entire

892
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
backend infrastructure is Solaris and Linux.

893
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,100
So it's really going to dovetail in quite nicely if

894
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,100
I can make it happen.

895
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,100
And the other thing really to think about is most users

896
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
don't care what's running underneath.

897
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,100
They just want to get into the apps.

898
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,100
You guys are really kind of clarifying the strategy here.

899
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,100
I think it's the right one for Microsoft to be making.

900
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
And maybe they should have even done it a decade

901
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,100
sooner, you could argue.

902
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,100
No.

903
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,100
No?

904
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
You don't think so?

905
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,100
No, I don't think so.

906
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,100
If they had done it a decade sooner, they would not

907
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
get the support of the people.

908
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
I agree with that.

909
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,100
I think they screwed up enough now that people are

910
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,100
like, yes, yes, do not spend money doing this stuff.

911
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,100
Yeah.

912
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,100
Just keep on doing what's already tested.

913
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,100
And the staff inside Microsoft know it too.

914
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,100
They can see it.

915
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,100
And they see Satya Nadella making the choices to,

916
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,100
I'm not trying to put this all on Satya, but they see

917
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,100
the company shifting away from Windows.

918
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,100
They see it.

919
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,100
There's got to be internal support.

920
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,100
Because the stock price, okay, so I looked at the

921
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,100
stock price, since they started talking like this

922
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,100
years ago, and the more they've talked like this,

923
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,100
the more shifts they made, the more they've de-emphasized

924
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,100
Windows, their stock price has continued to climb.

925
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,100
The staff see that.

926
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,100
The management sees that.

927
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,100
The market sees that.

928
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,100
I think it makes sense, right?

929
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,100
They seem more like the other big tech companies now, right?

930
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,100
I think of them, it's almost like Google had bought

931
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,100
Windows from Microsoft and running it that way.

932
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,100
Except they're doing it with the Microsoft way and Azure, right?

933
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,100
Going to even say something bolder.

934
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,100
Microsoft will save Linux from Apple.

935
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,100
Whoa.

936
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
Okay.

937
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,100
This is reality.

938
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,100
So look at this.

939
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:10,100
Apple has got the most of normal users, okay,

940
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,100
with their devices, and now they're getting education,

941
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,100
which is how you hook up.

942
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,100
It's the old Microsoft strategy.

943
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:22,100
First, those is free, and then forever you pay for it, right?

944
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,100
So now they've got education, and they've also got governments.

945
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,100
Most governments tend to use Apple devices,

946
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,100
because it's simple to use.

947
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,100
They've now managed to make a singular programming language,

948
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,100
which actually has attracted a large sum of developers

949
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,100
that would otherwise not work in Apple devices,

950
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,100
and made it all super appealing.

951
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:48,100
They have made the good headlines in the privacy sector.

952
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,100
Even though we know better technologically,

953
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,100
we still know that most of the common Joe picks up that

954
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,100
and says, oh, Apple sticks up to us.

955
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,100
And ultimately, Apple is running the game.

956
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,100
Google has the best services by far,

957
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:09,100
but Apple is the platform where those services run the most part.

958
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,100
So it becomes really hard.

959
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,100
Yeah, the industry does seem to follow their lead in a lot of areas.

960
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,100
So if Microsoft really picks up on this desktop world of Linux,

961
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:23,100
then yes, Microsoft will be the most popular Linux distribution on the planet.

962
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,100
I'm going to need to have a few drinks

963
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,100
before I can even think more about that one.

964
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,100
Some prophetic stuff right there.

965
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,100
And their money is going to be made on the cloud, and they know it,

966
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,100
so it's not a problem,

967
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:41,100
because hey, they can play the cool guy that has everything open source,

968
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,100
and everything is nice.

969
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,100
But ultimately, you buy an Xbox and runs your Linux games,

970
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,100
because that's your Steam machine, by the way.

971
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,100
It's an Xbox.

972
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,100
No, you're crazy now. You're crazy now.

973
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,100
Come on. Come on.

974
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,100
I'm telling you, like, a ten-year plan, right?

975
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,100
So in two years, they'll have the desktop,

976
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,100
and I already can tell you this.

977
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:03,100
And in about ten years, I expect this to be your normal thing.

978
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,100
It's like, when you look at Tron,

979
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,100
when you look at Tron, that there is this company that has one OS

980
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,100
that everybody uses, that's Microsoft,

981
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,100
but that OS underneath will be Linux.

982
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,100
Yeah, they do like that, and you could also see their IoT platform,

983
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,100
Azure Sphere, what starts out very humble,

984
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,100
scaling up to a very high-performance system ten years down the road.

985
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,100
I mean, ten years, there's going to be a lot of different types

986
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,100
of CPU developments and memory.

987
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:32,100
They've got the head-on collision with AR.

988
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:37,100
They've built the most sophisticated AR display system

989
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,100
for actual professional world.

990
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,100
They are not even kidding about making entertainment pieces.

991
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,100
And guess what?

992
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,100
When you go to your doctor, your doctor is going to use HoloLens,

993
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,100
not Oculus stuff, not Vivo stuff,

994
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,100
not iPhone stuff, not Apple stuff.

995
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,100
It's going to be HoloLens, because that's the one that works right now,

996
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,100
and they've been using surgery right now.

997
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,100
I never hear anyone talking about HoloLens.

998
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:07,100
I hear people talking about Vive and Oculus.

999
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,100
So where's this shift to HoloLens going to come from?

1000
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,100
Okay, I can tell you already, for example,

1001
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:21,100
Portugal, Spain, Finland have already done government contracts

1002
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,100
where HoloLens is being deployed in hospitals for remote surgery.

1003
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,100
Whoa.

1004
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,100
Well, the idea of a dedicated piece of hardware

1005
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,100
that comes from a company like Microsoft,

1006
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,100
that seems like that'd be more appealing

1007
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,100
than a doctor holding up an iPhone to a patient.

1008
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,100
So I definitely get that.

1009
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,100
I don't know if we'll see.

1010
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,100
That'd be remarkable, remarkable developments.

1011
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,100
There are a couple of things,

1012
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,100
a couple of threads that you've touched on

1013
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,100
that do seem very Microsoft.

1014
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,100
Like their ability to sell to business channels

1015
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,100
for a HoloLens-type device

1016
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,100
is something that Microsoft's going to do better at

1017
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,100
than anybody else making a device like that.

1018
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,100
And the fact that they do really want one OS

1019
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,100
that they can run everywhere.

1020
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,100
I think that's in the DNA of the company,

1021
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,100
but just Windows is no longer that OS,

1022
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,100
and so they're in an awkward teenage transition phase right now.

1023
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,100
They lost every knowledge that they had about Windows

1024
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,100
that was relevant.

1025
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:12,100
They hired React OS guys to help them understand Windows.

1026
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,100
It no longer makes sense to do that.

1027
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:19,100
They just bought a few Android apps companies.

1028
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,100
People with knowledge about the Linux operating system,

1029
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,100
and now they hope to keep it on because it's open source

1030
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,100
and it's easy to go and read and learn about it.

1031
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,100
It's making my head spin thinking about this.

1032
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,100
You mentioned React OS for a second.

1033
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,100
I gave it a go for Linux Action News 50.

1034
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,100
I gave a little mini review on Linux Action.

1035
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,100
Wow.

1036
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,100
I'll just short TLDR is

1037
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,100
I'm going to be following that project with some interest.

1038
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,100
It's like peak Windows is how I describe it.

1039
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,100
Peak Windows.

1040
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,100
Hitting that sweet spot right for you.

1041
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,100
It's a little tricky to get up and running,

1042
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:53,100
but they really have something there.

1043
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,100
I wrote it off as a joke, so I never tried it,

1044
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,100
because I thought the only reason I would ever use Windows

1045
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,100
would be to run applications that are proprietary

1046
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,100
that I can't run on Linux.

1047
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,100
Why would I want to run React OS,

1048
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,100
which would probably be like trying to use Wine?

1049
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,100
I'll tell you what.

1050
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,100
That was a mistaken assumption on my part.

1051
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,100
This is an amazing, impressive, open source operating system

1052
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,100
they've built.

1053
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:23,100
I forgot how the Windows 98 SE 2000 era UI

1054
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,100
is just hard cold efficient.

1055
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,100
It's hard cold efficient.

1056
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,100
Pretty simple.

1057
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,100
Just straight up.

1058
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,100
You're very familiar with it already.

1059
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,100
That sounds familiar.

1060
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,100
Yeah, it does.

1061
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,100
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1062
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,100
Oh, yeah.

1063
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,100
I was supposed to throw a mate hardball at Popey.

1064
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,100
Popey, could you tell me specifically

1065
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,100
what's the major stuff I'm going to be missing

1066
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,100
if I install Ubuntu Mate 1804 Minimal Edition?

1067
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:49,100
The Minimal Edition for Ubuntu proper

1068
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,100
stripped out only a few applications like LibreOffice,

1069
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,100
but the Ubuntu Mate developers went a bit further

1070
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,100
and stripped out pretty much everything.

1071
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,100
There's very little left for you.

1072
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,100
For example, you might think,

1073
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,100
oh, I'm losing stuff because I'm ripping it out,

1074
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,100
but actually it makes a great base to start from

1075
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,100
because if you install Ubuntu Mate Minimal,

1076
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,100
then you could maybe make it auto login,

1077
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,100
install Steam, and there you go.

1078
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,100
You've got your Steam box.

1079
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,100
What do you say?

1080
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,100
What do you think?

1081
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,100
I'm welling up with pride right now.

1082
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,100
You did so good.

1083
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,100
Yeah, you did.

1084
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,100
You know what?

1085
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,100
I'm going to give you...

1086
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,100
How do I know that?

1087
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,100
I did that yesterday.

1088
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,100
Nice.

1089
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,100
I'm going to give you an RMS.

1090
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,100
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

1091
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,100
You earned that one.

1092
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,100
You earned that one.

1093
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,100
That was good.

1094
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,100
All right.

1095
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,100
Well, as we get down the show a little bit,

1096
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,100
I'll talk about my experimentations recently

1097
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,100
with a minimal install and loving it,

1098
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,100
but I'll tell you more in detail in a moment.

1099
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,100
But let's talk about DigitalOcean for just a moment here.

1100
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,100
dio.co slash unplug.

1101
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,100
DigitalOcean is simplicity at scale.

1102
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,100
You can get started in less than 55 seconds.

1103
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,100
You spin up a rig on DigitalOcean

1104
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,100
and get off to the races.

1105
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,100
If you want to use a base system and build it from there,

1106
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,100
you can, or an entire application stack.

1107
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,100
You want a simple Markdown-based blog,

1108
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,100
WordPress is too much, deploy Ghost in one click.

1109
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,100
You decided it's time to use your own GitLab?

1110
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,100
Deploy that with a single click.

1111
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,100
Or you want to build something from the ground up.

1112
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,100
You go deploy Fedora, Debian, CentOS,

1113
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,100
or, of course, Ubuntu and others,

1114
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,100
including FreeBSD, and you're good to go.

1115
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,100
In less than 55 seconds, you'll have a machine.

1116
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,100
It'll have predictable pricing.

1117
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,100
It's secure. It's reliable.

1118
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,100
It's easy to scale up when you need more.

1119
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,100
And if you go to dio.co slash unplugged,

1120
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,100
and you have a new account, you sign up.

1121
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,100
$100 credit.

1122
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,100
A $100 credit at DigitalOcean.

1123
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,100
It's designed for developers, but it works for everybody.

1124
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,100
A new user, an experienced user,

1125
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,100
you'll be really, really impressed.

1126
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,100
Countries of open-source projects use DigitalOcean.

1127
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,100
Companies like Slack use DigitalOcean.

1128
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,100
And they have block storage.

1129
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,100
They have S3-compliant spaces.

1130
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,100
They have network-level firewalls.

1131
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:52,100
And they have super-fast systems with SSDs everywhere,

1132
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,100
40-gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors,

1133
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,100
and 12 data centers all over the world.

1134
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,100
We got the memo right here to prove it.

1135
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,100
dio.co slash unplugged.

1136
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,100
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean

1137
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,100
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1138
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,100
So go to dio.co slash unplugged and get that $100 credit.

1139
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,100
Oh, man, that's a great credit.

1140
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,100
Hey, a wild Dan the Rabbit enters.

1141
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,100
Hello, Dan. Good to see you. Nice to have you.

1142
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,100
Hey, how's it going?

1143
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,100
It's going good.

1144
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,100
How are things going over in elementary land?

1145
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,100
Oh, they're going great.

1146
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,100
Yeah, I bet.

1147
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,100
I bet it's busy days over there, I would imagine.

1148
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,100
I saw you guys had a new app spotlight this week.

1149
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,100
That app center is cranking.

1150
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:33,100
Yeah, we're 87 apps now, I think.

1151
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,100
I wonder if you'll get to 100.

1152
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,100
Is that 87 or 86 or 88?

1153
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,100
Can you be more specific?

1154
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,100
Yeah, right?

1155
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,100
Yeah.

1156
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,100
Well, it's just, you know, they're coming in all the time,

1157
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,100
so it's hard to keep track of how many there are.

1158
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,100
That's the right answer.

1159
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,100
How many are Electron, Dan?

1160
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,100
Oh, zero.

1161
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,100
Oh.

1162
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,100
All right, I do want to change topics for a moment.

1163
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,100
I want to talk about this infamous Gnome shell leak,

1164
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,100
which was more like a memory misbehavior problem,

1165
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,100
which I broke down in Linux Action News,

1166
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,100
so I'm not going to recap it here.

1167
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,100
But it does look like a fix is in the works.

1168
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,100
So I want to talk about another part that they bring up.

1169
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,100
After all the technical discussion in this post is complete,

1170
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,100
there's some final thoughts.

1171
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,100
And the author writes,

1172
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,100
I'd like to raise an interesting discussion about how people reacted

1173
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,100
to the memory leak news and reflect upon this

1174
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:25,100
and screenshot some comments, which I think might be from OMG Ubuntu,

1175
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,100
but as you know, it doesn't really matter.

1176
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,100
It's comments or comments on the internet.

1177
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,100
And when you read through there, you see people saying things like,

1178
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,100
oh, of course, this is Gnome.

1179
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,100
This is how they always do it.

1180
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,100
They don't know what they're doing.

1181
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,100
I know you all ask, but the answer is no.

1182
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,100
A fix for the big Gnome memory leak is not going to come.

1183
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,100
There's all these negative things about Gnome.

1184
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,100
And the author says, as a regular contributor for the last few years,

1185
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,100
this kind of comments, they sound alien to me.

1186
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,100
These comments sound so completely disconnected

1187
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,100
from the reality of the development process of Gnome.

1188
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,100
It completely misses the individuality of the people involved,

1189
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,100
maybe because we all know each other,

1190
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:03,100
but it's just plain impossible for me to paint this whole community as a they

1191
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,100
or as, quote, the Gnome developers.

1192
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,100
To a deeper degree, it misses the nuance and the beauty

1193
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,100
of the community-driven development

1194
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,100
and each and every individual that make it happen.

1195
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:20,100
It almost feels, now this is the part that really got me because it's true,

1196
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:24,100
it almost feels like there's a wall between the community

1197
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:28,100
and the users of the community for what it produces,

1198
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,100
which is weird.

1199
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,100
We are an open community with open development,

1200
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,100
no barriers for new contributors.

1201
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:38,100
And yet there is such a distance between the community of users

1202
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:42,100
and the community of developers, design, outreachers, et cetera.

1203
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,100
Is it a communication problem from our side?

1204
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,100
And how can we bridge this gap?

1205
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,100
It's a communication problem from their side

1206
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,100
because Red Hat continuously sponsors events

1207
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,100
about talking about the Gnome project,

1208
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,100
embeds everybody into the Gnome project

1209
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:00,100
when individual applications drive within the Gnome project,

1210
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,100
they make it a Gnome application,

1211
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:08,100
and now they expect the credit or criticism to be attributed individually.

1212
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,100
Get real.

1213
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,100
And I'm a Gnome supporter.

1214
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,100
I see your point.

1215
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,100
It's sort of been their branding in a sense.

1216
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:19,100
It's been their public persona, has been this cohesive Gnome environment.

1217
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,100
Absolutely.

1218
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,100
I know that projects are individual.

1219
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,100
Once you try to contribute, you learn about it.

1220
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,100
But if you're a user, you never see it.

1221
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,100
That's the truth.

1222
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:35,100
Even the Git or the source trees goes under Gnome slash Browse Source,

1223
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,100
and all projects are listed there.

1224
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,100
Never expect that to be a non-unified team of people.

1225
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,100
Yeah.

1226
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,100
One issue that I've run into just from an outside perspective

1227
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:49,100
is when things get published on like planet.gnome.org,

1228
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,100
and then people take that as like,

1229
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,100
oh, this is news from Gnome,

1230
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,100
and then people in the Gnome community will say,

1231
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,100
no, no, that's just like a random individual's blog.

1232
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,100
We're just aggregating it.

1233
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:05,100
So it's really like unclear like what is speech coming from Gnome officially,

1234
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,100
and what is like just some guy that happens to work on something

1235
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,100
tangentially Gnome related.

1236
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,100
Is this a symptom of how open source software gets made?

1237
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,100
You have people that...

1238
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,100
It's a symptom of Red Hat.

1239
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,100
Sorry, Chris.

1240
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,100
You think so?

1241
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,100
No, it's not.

1242
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,100
It's not unique to Red Hat.

1243
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,100
We've had this as well.

1244
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,100
It's because there's concentric circles of activity,

1245
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,100
and you've got people right at the core.

1246
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,100
You've got someone like Daniel and Cassidy who work on elementary,

1247
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,100
and then there are people in the periphery around them,

1248
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,100
and then people further out,

1249
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:39,100
and then you've got all the idiots on Reddit who have an opinion

1250
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,100
and aren't afraid to use it,

1251
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:45,100
and will voice that uninformed reckon on the internet

1252
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:49,100
and won't be engaged with those people right at the center of the circle,

1253
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:53,100
and that's unfortunately how all open source projects seem to work right now.

1254
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,100
Yet when canonical says something,

1255
00:52:55,100 --> 00:53:00,100
I can usually know that canonical said it or an individual person said it,

1256
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:04,100
and you guys, actually Ubuntu has made an extreme effort

1257
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,100
of demonstrating what is community related,

1258
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,100
and you coming in this show many times clarified

1259
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,100
what is a community effort, what is a canonical effort,

1260
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,100
and it has always been kind of clear as a developer

1261
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,100
trying to contribute on things.

1262
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,100
When it came down to GNOME, not as much.

1263
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:24,100
I wouldn't characterize it as we do it differently or better

1264
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,100
than them in inverted commas.

1265
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,100
I'm saying as somebody who has done the outreach, right?

1266
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,100
I'm just some guy.

1267
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:35,100
When I tried, I felt better about Ubuntu communication

1268
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,100
and canonical communication than I felt about GNOME,

1269
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,100
and I'm a GNOME user.

1270
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,100
I'm telling you that personally I've had this experience.

1271
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,100
I don't want to make this about me or us because it's not.

1272
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:50,100
It's about the GNOME project and the way they manage their projects,

1273
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,100
but myself and Martin, we're not paid to be here.

1274
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,100
Canonical don't tell us to come on this podcast.

1275
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,100
We do it because we want to as individuals.

1276
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,100
It's nothing that is part of my job.

1277
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,100
I would be here whether I was doing this job or not because I enjoy it,

1278
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,100
and I'm pretty sure the same goes for Martin.

1279
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:08,100
Look, that's great, and that benefits Ubuntu and canonical

1280
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,100
to the point that there have been cases in the past

1281
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,100
that we have detected and I have felt that there was a confusion,

1282
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,100
and because you were here, it clarified.

1283
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,100
Now, I cannot say the same about the GNOME outreach team,

1284
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,100
paid or not paid.

1285
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:27,100
I have not seen people that were clarifying it,

1286
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,100
and because there's people in the Ubuntu and canonical community

1287
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:34,100
that understand it and explain it to people, it's easier to understand.

1288
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,100
That was my feeling.

1289
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,100
Dan usually comes here and also does the same effect to elementary,

1290
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,100
and it kind of just enriches the experience.

1291
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:50,100
I guess there could be stronger voices, multiple voices coming from GNOME

1292
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,100
that are making it clear what they're doing

1293
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,100
and trying to reach out to different mediums.

1294
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,100
I think that would be helpful.

1295
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:00,100
I think it's a little bit difficult because they've now got this perception

1296
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:04,100
that there is the them and us, there is that barrier between them,

1297
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,100
that whenever they do put their head above the parapet,

1298
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:11,100
they get shot down quite heavily, and I know Daniel has seen that as well.

1299
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,100
When he puts a public post out or when Cassidy puts a public post out,

1300
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,100
they get a lot of abuse,

1301
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:20,100
and some people just aren't prepared to put their head above the parapet.

1302
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,100
Yeah, you'd rather keep your head down and develop and create.

1303
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,100
Yeah, that's understandable.

1304
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,100
I wonder where they're going to take this,

1305
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,100
but it seems like maybe there's some self-awareness of the issue,

1306
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,100
and that is, as they say, the first step, starting with...

1307
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,100
We're talking about it now, right?

1308
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,100
Yeah, and they're talking about it.

1309
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,100
I want to share, I guess, an epic that I came across this week

1310
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,100
that I thought was pretty neat.

1311
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,100
I've just begun experimenting with backing up different aspects

1312
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,100
of my Plasma desktop configuration,

1313
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:49,100
and I wanted to create some sort of standardized method to do that,

1314
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,100
and so I thought, well, you know, maybe I'll look for an app

1315
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,100
that would do it on the Linux desktop,

1316
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,100
and I came across KBackup.

1317
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,100
Surprise, surprise, KBackup is an application that lets you backup

1318
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,100
any folders or files in a TAR archive to a local folder

1319
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:07,100
or a locally mounted device or a USB stick or a remote URL.

1320
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,100
So it's pretty simple, straightforward.

1321
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,100
It's got profiles and things like that.

1322
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,100
I can see why you like this. It just screams, Chris, to me.

1323
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,100
It is nice.

1324
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,100
Simple, nice graphical tool. You like TARs.

1325
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,100
I do. Clear to see what the target is.

1326
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,100
Clear to see where it's coming from.

1327
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,100
I could say this is my config backup.

1328
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,100
These are my documents backups.

1329
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,100
You have different profiles in there,

1330
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,100
and you can set up jobs and whatnot.

1331
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,100
So it's simple, easy, and I'm all about the Plasma desktop these days.

1332
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,100
So it's KBackup.

1333
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,100
Nice.

1334
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,100
I was reading, too, speaking of the Plasma desktop,

1335
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,100
in 5.13, there's going to be some implementation

1336
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:45,100
for a pipeline support for remote screen sharing on Wayland.

1337
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,100
And I think that also includes screenshots and stuff.

1338
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:52,100
So we'll start getting screen sharing,

1339
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:56,100
maybe even OBS screen capping, remote desktop,

1340
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,100
which, remember, all the haters for years have always said,

1341
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,100
I can't go to Wayland. I need X as a network transparency.

1342
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,100
Well, looks like they're building it into KWayland.

1343
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,100
I think you accidentally planned a happy themed episode here.

1344
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,100
KWayland. I know. Oops. I know. Oops.

1345
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:13,100
So 5.13 is going to have the early piping for Wayland's desktop session

1346
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:18,100
with remote screen recording and sharing in Plasma 5.13, it looks like.

1347
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,100
So I'm looking forward to that. Some good news.

1348
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,100
Some good, good news.

1349
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,100
It's tradition for us to destroy our studio and rebuild it

1350
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,100
just hours before Linux Fest kicks off every year.

1351
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:30,100
It's the one time of year where Noah and I just set a week aside

1352
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,100
before Linux Fest.

1353
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,100
All of the things we've been thinking about all year, we can bust out.

1354
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:39,100
And this year, you guys have heard me threatening for many, many weeks now

1355
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,100
to load my systems up with Kubuntu 18.04

1356
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:46,100
and use that as our production OS here at Jupyter Broadcasting.

1357
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:50,100
But a son of a gun thing about the timing of Linux Fest Northwest

1358
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:58,100
is every single damn year, it falls right around the release of the next major Ubuntu,

1359
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:04,100
which always means every dang year, we end up in this perpetual debate cycle.

1360
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:07,100
Should we use 18.04 or whatever the next release is?

1361
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,100
Should we use the current stable interim release?

1362
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:13,100
What should we do if we install the current interim release?

1363
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,100
We're going to have to upgrade in a few months to the next release

1364
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,100
and all this could break.

1365
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:20,100
Or should we roll the dice and go with something that's a release candidate

1366
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,100
but not officially released yet?

1367
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,100
Could have some last minute changes.

1368
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,100
You never know if software compatibility is there.

1369
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:30,100
It has been tiring and obnoxious because it happens every single year

1370
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,100
because we always land on this schedule.

1371
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,100
And we've chosen different routes at different times.

1372
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:38,100
I think it might have even been what kind of led us to start using Arch in production

1373
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:43,100
is we just needed current OBS and FFmpeg packages and we were sick and tired of this.

1374
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,100
The dance just doesn't exist there.

1375
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,100
It just doesn't exist.

1376
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,100
But we're back.

1377
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,100
We're back on Ubuntu in production.

1378
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,100
Full circle.

1379
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:55,100
We decided to just commit to 18.04 and try to make it work and put it in production.

1380
00:58:55,100 --> 00:59:02,100
So since our last episode, we have reloaded many systems here in the studio to Kubuntu 18.04,

1381
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:07,100
which as you know, I've gone into a tirade about every time our Gnome 3 system

1382
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,100
crashed on us and our recording was interrupted.

1383
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:16,100
I'd go on about how Kubuntu 18.04 is this beautiful mix of LTS Cute and LTS Plasma

1384
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:19,100
and LTS Ubuntu and it's just going to sit there and be an appliance

1385
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,100
and it's the perfect solution.

1386
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:26,100
But when it came down to it, we almost went with XFCE.

1387
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,100
Almost.

1388
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,100
Almost ended up going with XFCE 16.04.

1389
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,100
Wow.

1390
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,100
Really?

1391
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,100
Yeah.

1392
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,100
I'll tell you about that story and why we ended up on it.

1393
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:34,100
This would be a different episode.

1394
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,100
I know it would be.

1395
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,100
It would have been titled Joe was right.

1396
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:42,100
But first, let's talk about Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1397
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,100
They have a huge, huge month.

1398
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:46,100
April is big for Linux Academy.

1399
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:50,100
70 plus new courses and challenges and learning activities.

1400
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,100
It breaks down like this.

1401
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,100
20 new courses with some refreshes, 50 new cloud assessments,

1402
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:57,100
hands-on learning activities and new challenges.

1403
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:00,100
And if you're watching live today, you can catch Linux Academy's live stream.

1404
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:04,100
They're doing some giveaways tomorrow, Wednesday, and it's a big month for them.

1405
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,100
It's been really impressive.

1406
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,100
They've been staffing up and adding new people.

1407
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,100
They have instructors that are there to help you and they're writing new courseware.

1408
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,100
They're refreshing the old courseware.

1409
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,100
When you're a subscriber to Linux Academy, you just get all this stuff.

1410
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,100
All this new content, all these courseware refreshes,

1411
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,100
all the new things they're developing, you get that.

1412
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:26,100
For example, the Orion Papers is a huge success for Linux Academy.

1413
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,100
If you haven't checked it out yet, go check them out.

1414
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:32,100
You can go Google Linux Academy Orion Papers as an example of some of the content you get

1415
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,100
that is like nothing else anybody else is doing.

1416
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,100
Because Linux Academy is stacked full of Linux enthusiasts and lovers

1417
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,100
and they've got educators and developers that have come together to create this platform

1418
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,100
to help you learn more with self-paced, in-depth video courses,

1419
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:48,100
hands-on, scenario-based labs, and like I've mentioned, those human beings that can help you.

1420
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,100
And they have a community that's stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members

1421
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,100
because we've been working with them for almost five years now

1422
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:58,100
and so people have been subscribing from Linux, from Jupyter Broadcasting to Linux Academy.

1423
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,100
It's a nice community over there.

1424
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,100
We like seeded it with like some of the best people.

1425
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,100
It's true. I take credit for that.

1426
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,100
Yeah, now it's just great, friendly.

1427
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,100
Yeah, and they've just grown and grown and grown.

1428
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,100
And they have a course scheduler that's amazing.

1429
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:14,100
It'll work with your busy day to help you set a learning goal and stick to it.

1430
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,100
They have practice exams to help you get ready to test.

1431
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,100
And if you need certification training, they've got that too.

1432
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:22,100
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1433
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,100
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1434
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:29,100
Go there and sign up for a free seven-day trial and support the show.

1435
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,100
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1436
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:39,100
All right, so we did end up on Kubuntu 18.04, but we almost went with XFCE's Ubuntu 16.04

1437
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:45,100
because there was a few unknowns when you're going with a yet-to-be-released version

1438
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,100
of an operating system.

1439
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:51,100
And we tested against 16.04 quite a bit with our capture cards and the whatnots.

1440
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,100
We loaded XFCE up.

1441
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:57,100
I keep saying XFCE because it doesn't matter which distro it was,

1442
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,100
but it was the desktop we were going for.

1443
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,100
But it was Ubuntu 16.04.

1444
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,100
And it was okay. It was actually pretty good.

1445
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:07,100
I liked it, but we started noticing a couple of little oddities.

1446
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:10,100
A couple of our production applications we use use system tray icons.

1447
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:14,100
And I didn't expect this with XFCE, but they just stopped showing up.

1448
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:15,100
Really?

1449
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,100
They weren't showing up.

1450
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,100
And so we were like, okay, maybe we can fix that.

1451
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:23,100
And then we had a couple of other little glitches where it looked like things were –

1452
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,100
I had this issue where one of the panels were flashing when I would move the OBS.

1453
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,100
It was just small things.

1454
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:30,100
And Noah and I looked at each other and we thought, you know,

1455
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:34,100
neither one of us are using XFCE on a daily basis.

1456
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,100
All the other machines in the studio are Plasma.

1457
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:39,100
We're both using Plasma as our daily drivers.

1458
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:43,100
This is just the OS – I mean, this is just the interface we're getting the most familiar with.

1459
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:46,100
And when you're using something in a live production environment,

1460
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,100
you really want it to be something you're hyper-familiar with,

1461
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,100
so that way you can use it almost with muscle memory.

1462
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,100
Yeah, just second nature.

1463
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,100
Yeah.

1464
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,100
So we talked about it, and you know what?

1465
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,100
Okay, all right.

1466
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,100
Let's put Kubuntu 18.04 on there and see how it does.

1467
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,100
And it's been pretty great.

1468
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:04,100
It's really been problem-free, actually.

1469
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,100
OBS loaded up just fine.

1470
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:09,100
Our production software, the mixer software, is working just fine.

1471
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,100
Our remote control surface is working great.

1472
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,100
The usability has been top-notch.

1473
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,100
Really, I have no complaints.

1474
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,100
It's been solid.

1475
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,100
Hey, Brown Bear, if you want to come here and talk – come on in.

1476
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,100
Come on, get in here.

1477
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,100
Come on, Brown Bear, get in here.

1478
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,100
Give me one second.

1479
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,100
Come on in.

1480
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:28,100
So Noah's been here since Thursday of last week,

1481
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:31,100
and we've been retooling different aspects of the studio,

1482
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:34,100
which really starts with the reloading of the operating systems.

1483
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,100
That's really how we start.

1484
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,100
That's the root of it.

1485
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,100
Yeah.

1486
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,100
Okay, what machines do we want to reload first,

1487
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,100
and how critical are they, and what shows can we do this in?

1488
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,100
We had a small production window when he got here

1489
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:46,100
where there was no shows being recorded until Sunday.

1490
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,100
We didn't end up on CentOS, so there you go.

1491
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,100
Yeah, so we got the machines.

1492
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,100
We got the machines reloaded basically Thursday until Sunday.

1493
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:57,100
We got all the machines refreshed, reinstalled.

1494
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,100
We still have a couple of machines to swap out

1495
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,100
because we found some problems as we went along.

1496
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,100
But it's been smooth, right?

1497
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,100
Yeah, I think so.

1498
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:07,100
I think what's been really exciting for me is I can tell –

1499
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:10,100
pretty much early on I can see when you're comfortable with something

1500
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,100
and when you have some reservations,

1501
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:15,100
and it's never the first few days,

1502
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,100
it's never the first week that I'm worried about, right?

1503
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:20,100
It's one month in, it's two months in, it's six months in.

1504
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,100
That's where I know where something has come,

1505
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:24,100
because while I'm here and while you can say,

1506
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,100
hey Brown Bear, come here and fix this problem,

1507
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,100
then it's not an issue, right?

1508
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,100
It's when something becomes routinely problematic

1509
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,100
and it starts as like, well, this is a little bit of a problem,

1510
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,100
but you have to solve it week after week after week by yourself,

1511
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:38,100
that's when you hit a limit and you say, okay, that's it,

1512
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,100
I'm done with this.

1513
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:42,100
And so far we have not hit any of those things where you're like,

1514
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,100
well, this is even mildly frustrating.

1515
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:47,100
So, I mean, time will tell obviously if this work pans out long term,

1516
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:53,100
but it seems like you're making a whole new investment even a year in

1517
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,100
to this entire Linux infrastructure.

1518
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:59,100
Yeah, well, I think the way to put it is we had too much vodka.

1519
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:03,100
We sat around the studio living room and we said, all right,

1520
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,100
if we were going to hit the reset button today

1521
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:10,100
and just did like a total restart, would we stick with Linux?

1522
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,100
Do you really, really want to stick with Linux?

1523
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,100
And we ended up putting another Linux box in

1524
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:18,100
and we're switching over our multi-track recording system,

1525
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:21,100
which for a little while was being done on Windows 7 using Audition

1526
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,100
as we were just experimenting with something that could record 32 tracks

1527
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,100
off of a USB interface.

1528
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:29,100
But, you know, it's expensive and it's Windows

1529
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,100
and it's proprietary software.

1530
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:34,100
And we couldn't find something that was true top to bottom open source,

1531
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:38,100
but we did manage to find something that does multi-track recording

1532
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,100
on Linux really well.

1533
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,100
You've been using it a little while for Ask Noah,

1534
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,100
so we knew it was a pretty safe bet.

1535
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,100
And it's called Reaper.

1536
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:48,100
And they don't want you to know it's available for Linux.

1537
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,100
They won't even give you a link to download it.

1538
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:52,100
But if you know how to find it on the internet,

1539
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:54,100
you can get a binary, you download it,

1540
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:58,100
and it's a full-fledged production quality multi-track editor and recorder

1541
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:03,100
that we're using right now to record one, two, three, four, five channels.

1542
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,100
And we used it last night to record a 16-track band.

1543
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,100
Yeah, really.

1544
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,100
And what do you think of it?

1545
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,100
Oh, I love it.

1546
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:14,100
I've got a Yamaha OM-V96i and picks up all the inputs

1547
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:17,100
and I sign them in and just streams it straight in and records them all.

1548
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,100
Yep.

1549
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,100
Let me ask you something.

1550
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,100
What kind of milk do you guys sell in the state of Washington?

1551
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,100
Why is that?

1552
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,100
I'm just curious.

1553
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,100
Do you have Land O' Lakes here?

1554
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,100
I don't think we have that as butter, but not as milk.

1555
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,100
Okay.

1556
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:28,100
Well, we have Land O' Leet.

1557
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,100
I mean, sorry, not Land O' Leet.

1558
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,100
Land O' Lakes.

1559
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,100
Not Land O' Leet.

1560
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:35,100
I mean, to say Land O' Lakes, not Land O' Leet.

1561
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:39,100
But yeah, Kuko is the company who makes Reaper.

1562
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:42,100
They won't let you have the download link to the Land – or not Land –

1563
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:44,100
why do I keep saying Land O' Leet?

1564
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,100
They won't let you have the download to Reaper.

1565
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,100
You just have to Google it a little bit.

1566
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,100
Yeah, you Google it around.

1567
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,100
You're giving us a hint there.

1568
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,100
Is that what you're trying to do?

1569
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,100
You're giving us a hint right there?

1570
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,100
No, I just – I really felt like milk.

1571
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,100
Milk, yeah.

1572
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:55,100
It's a hint.

1573
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,100
Okay, I see.

1574
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:57,100
I see what you're doing there.

1575
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:59,100
Okay, I don't know how to decode it, but I know there's some hint there.

1576
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:02,100
But yeah, they won't even let us share the link.

1577
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,100
We can't – they will come after us.

1578
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,100
So just get yourself a glass of milk and you'll be set.

1579
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,100
Okay, okay.

1580
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:08,100
I'll try to remember that.

1581
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:14,100
But I was really sort of like relieved because after, you know,

1582
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:18,100
being really kind of stuck with Final Cut and then looking at going, oh, man,

1583
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:22,100
now we have audition, like this is just not the right direction to go in,

1584
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:25,100
it's a big relief to find something like Reaper that does really good multi-track

1585
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,100
recording in a production environment and it has all these other little aspects,

1586
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,100
like I like about it.

1587
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,100
So it's great.

1588
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,100
I'm really happy.

1589
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,100
You know, and one of the things we should talk about too is,

1590
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:36,100
so when we started talking about actually using a machine, right,

1591
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,100
you're pretty OS fluent, right?

1592
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:41,100
You can jump on a Windows machine, you can jump on a Mac,

1593
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:44,100
you can jump on a GNOME desktop, you can jump on a KDE desktop.

1594
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:47,100
And one of the things that you said that really resonated with me early on

1595
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:51,100
in this project is, man, I sure would like to have one desktop environment

1596
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,100
that just runs everywhere because your hands start to get into that muscle

1597
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:57,100
memory thing of launching applications and where to find individual settings

1598
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,100
and stuff like that.

1599
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:01,100
And under stress, particularly in a production environment,

1600
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:05,100
the ability to know where all of that stuff is and not have to look or find it

1601
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,100
is a huge plus, right?

1602
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,100
So if we can get all of these machines running identically,

1603
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:13,100
I think that bodes very well for the future of Linux in here.

1604
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,100
Yeah, I mean, I'm sort of famously the rolling release person,

1605
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:20,100
but the truth of the matter is there's a super compelling aspect,

1606
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:26,100
compelling, appealing, it's compelling, aspect to combining a desktop

1607
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:30,100
that I'm really excited about right now with a distro that's super well

1608
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:34,100
supported in the industry and a couple of applications that are getting

1609
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:35,100
good support too.

1610
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,100
Because at the other end, so Reaper is for our audio,

1611
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:40,100
but on the other end, we have OBS Studio, which is also getting

1612
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,100
a ton of good support.

1613
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:45,100
So it's like this is a really sweet spot to be in in terms of

1614
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:48,100
well-supported application from the community, from the developers,

1615
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:52,100
upstream, like all of it's all pretty solid right now ground that we're on.

1616
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:57,100
I'd say this ground feels more solid to me than if I was doing all of this

1617
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:01,100
on an Apple machine and I'm looking at how Apple is floundering

1618
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,100
with the professional market right now.

1619
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:06,100
That feels way, way shakier ground than what we're on.

1620
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,100
Yeah. Oh, absolutely.

1621
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:11,100
Especially they can put pressure on a lot of these software manufacturers.

1622
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:15,100
So Final Cut isn't going anywhere, even if they do dump x86, go to ARM.

1623
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:20,100
But what might happen is Reaper may not decide to port their software.

1624
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,100
Actually, they already have it on ARM.

1625
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:25,100
I'll use Audition, may not decide not to port to this new Mac platform.

1626
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:29,100
And they'll say a lot of the people, especially in the video side,

1627
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,100
they're sticking on Windows.

1628
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,100
And so if that's the case, are they going to port that code base over?

1629
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,100
Maybe, maybe not. We don't know.

1630
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,100
And so the ability to be able to buy any machine,

1631
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,100
and then the interchangeability of these machines too.

1632
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:43,100
So we were talking about just earlier before we went on the air,

1633
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,100
we've got one machine that's dying, we've got another machine.

1634
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:49,100
Now, if you had to square up the fact that, well, this is an all-in-one

1635
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:52,100
that doesn't have PCI ports, and this is the older one that has the PCI ports,

1636
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:55,100
and this is the new one that has the – you don't have to worry about any of that.

1637
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,100
They're all interchangeable. Any one of these machines can serve any purpose.

1638
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,100
They're all different PCs.

1639
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:03,100
Well, actually, we have similar PCs, but they're not like –

1640
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,100
it's not like a fleet of iMacs in here.

1641
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,100
But it's the same desktop environment, it's the same OS,

1642
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,100
it's the same exact software.

1643
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:13,100
And that is really nice from somebody who's working on a tight budget.

1644
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,100
I just need something that's high-quality production

1645
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,100
that I know we can drop in, that's going to be stable,

1646
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:21,100
and realistically, I might be able to hang out here for five years

1647
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,100
on these 1804 machines if I so choose to.

1648
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,100
You only got to make it a year, and I'll be back.

1649
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,100
I know, right?

1650
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,100
Well, if we get it right, and it just keeps working.

1651
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,100
Well, I knew this time we had a pretty good shot,

1652
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:34,100
because if this doesn't work, then he can't do the Ask Noah show here,

1653
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,100
so he had to get rid of it.

1654
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,100
So that sort of sealed the deal, I figured.

1655
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:42,100
And then we just have been really sort of just doing acrobatics around the shows,

1656
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,100
trying to like break components.

1657
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:48,100
Well, we know like yesterday, or no, just this morning,

1658
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,100
this morning we didn't have an OBS machine we could control.

1659
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,100
We just, you know, it wasn't done yet, but we didn't need it to do TechSnap.

1660
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,100
So we didn't have to fix that until the afternoon.

1661
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,100
We did kind of buy this, though, because I forgot to set up Love.

1662
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,100
Yeah, there was that, and we started a little late.

1663
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,100
But that's just the sort of fine wire we're working on,

1664
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,100
but hopefully we'll get this all done.

1665
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:08,100
We'll even maybe have a chill day on Friday and then go to Linux Fest.

1666
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,100
Yeah, right, I know, I know.

1667
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:13,100
That's a pipe dream, because for extra credit,

1668
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:15,100
we're going to try to get down to Wes's pad tomorrow

1669
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,100
and maybe set up a little local studio for Wes down there.

1670
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,100
Thursday, I think, yeah.

1671
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,100
Oh, yeah, right, my days are running together.

1672
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,100
Yeah, that's right, we still have more things to do here first.

1673
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:26,100
So we can point you to Reaper.fm,

1674
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:28,100
but you won't find a download for Linux there.

1675
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:31,100
But we can tell you, because I'm recording this very podcast in it,

1676
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:35,100
there is a Linux version, and it meets my persnickety needs.

1677
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,100
I'm pretty picky when it comes to this type of software,

1678
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:39,100
and it's meeting my needs.

1679
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:42,100
We've recorded three shows with it so far, and this will be the fourth.

1680
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:45,100
And for the listeners using Arch, it's in the AUR.

1681
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,100
Yeah, of course.

1682
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,100
I'll be interested.

1683
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,100
I'm making a snap now.

1684
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,100
Are you really?

1685
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,100
Yeah.

1686
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,100
You know what else needs a snap badly?

1687
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,100
Yeah, I can pick up on the clues.

1688
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,100
I've deciphered your code.

1689
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,100
I've found it.

1690
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,100
Right on.

1691
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,100
That is huge for me.

1692
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,100
Let me tell you something.

1693
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,100
You can't just find it by Googling it.

1694
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,100
I'm a pretty proficient Googler,

1695
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:11,100
and I know a lot of people in both the Linux world and the audio world.

1696
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,100
You know what?

1697
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,100
You must suck at Googling, because with your clues,

1698
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:16,100
I Googled it up in no time at all.

1699
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,100
Yes, once you know the name, but if you don't know the name of the site,

1700
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,100
you're not going to find it.

1701
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:23,100
Anyway, but I'm not going to do the snapping.

1702
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,100
Popey, are you listening carefully?

1703
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:28,100
Because the reason I'm not at Linux Fest Northwest this weekend

1704
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:31,100
is because I'm at UbuCon Europe this weekend.

1705
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:35,100
I fly out tomorrow, so I'm away.

1706
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,100
Popey, however, he's got nothing better to do,

1707
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:40,100
so he can work on snapping this up.

1708
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,100
Wow.

1709
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:44,100
Yes, boss.

1710
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,100
I'm looking forward to that.

1711
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,100
And for extra credit, somebody ought to snap up,

1712
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:50,100
but the broadcast using this tool, B-U-T-T,

1713
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,100
it doesn't work on modern versions of Ubuntu,

1714
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:55,100
but it's one of the only graphical tools for Linux

1715
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,100
to do a live ice cast stream.

1716
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:00,100
And there's other ways to do it,

1717
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,100
like with dark ice and liquid soap and whatnot.

1718
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,100
You know, there is another tool that I just,

1719
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,100
I don't know why I didn't think of this when we were looking at this,

1720
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,100
but it's so stupid.

1721
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:12,100
Mix has an option for taking a local input,

1722
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:15,100
you specify an audio device, and it'll just, boom, it'll seal it.

1723
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:16,100
I had that same thought.

1724
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:19,100
That's a lot of software to run for that.

1725
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:23,100
The other problem with Mix is it captures the audio device,

1726
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:26,100
so that is the only thing that can use that particular audio device.

1727
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,100
But it's just a really old X app

1728
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:30,100
that just depends on a lot of old libraries.

1729
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:33,100
You've got to load a whole bunch of stuff on your Linux box,

1730
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,100
and then you've got to build it from source.

1731
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,100
And it can be done, but then the results vary.

1732
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,100
But it's so nice because... I'm on it.

1733
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,100
Oh, man, man.

1734
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:43,100
I'll tell you what, we may be in a future where our OBS is a snap,

1735
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,100
our broadcast software is a snap, and our editing software is a snap.

1736
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:47,100
OBS is a snap. I know, I know.

1737
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,100
We trust us. We know it's great.

1738
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:52,100
And I'll tell you what, it's making me really excited about

1739
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:55,100
even another level of stability because then, you know,

1740
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,100
we can keep updating these operating systems

1741
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,100
and not worry about this stuff breaking.

1742
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,100
Like I'm saying, we're standing on firmer ground

1743
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:03,100
than both Windows and Mac OS, I say.

1744
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:06,100
We may not be so bold, but I think we are.

1745
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,100
The future is bright for production on Linux.

1746
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,100
And we're going to make an example out of that at Linux Fest Northwest.

1747
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,100
Hopefully.

1748
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,100
Heck yeah, I think we will.

1749
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:17,100
People that can make it out, we'll give you an example there at the booth

1750
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,100
how we're doing it on Linux.

1751
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:22,100
I mean, the truth is, if I can assemble even a haphazard setup

1752
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:25,100
while you're on the air without making too much noise

1753
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:28,100
soldering on the back end of a cast iron skillet,

1754
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:31,100
I think by the time we actually have some time where I'm not prepping a show

1755
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,100
with right hand and soldering with the left hand,

1756
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,100
I think it'll really be a cool display.

1757
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,100
Probably should work pretty good, imagine.

1758
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:41,100
Wimbyo, will you be sharing any stories from your trip

1759
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,100
in the Ubuntu podcast in the near future?

1760
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,100
I hope so.

1761
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:47,100
Me too.

1762
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:50,100
We haven't fleshed out everything that's happening

1763
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,100
the week that I'm back from that because obviously

1764
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,100
it's following the 1804 releases,

1765
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:59,100
lots to talk about there, and nobody wants to hear about me

1766
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:02,100
gallivanting around Spain and having a great time

1767
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:04,100
and socializing with everyone in the Ubuntu community.

1768
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,100
Oh boy.

1769
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,100
No, we would hate that.

1770
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,100
Who would want to hear that?

1771
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,100
Hate it.

1772
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,100
Who would want that?

1773
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:10,100
Yeah, I know.

1774
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,100
We might do our 1804 review live from Linux Fest.

1775
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,100
I think that might be what happens.

1776
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,100
Looking forward to that.

1777
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,100
And I don't know, we may try to record a Linux unplugged from there,

1778
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:20,100
so keep an eye out for that, and then we'll release it

1779
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,100
at our regular time the following week.

1780
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,100
So that could be happening as well.

1781
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:26,100
It's all kind of up in the air, but those are the things we're aiming for.

1782
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,100
So if you want to join us on a Saturday, I would bet.

1783
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,100
Have you seen the timesheet?

1784
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:31,100
Do we have it up on the timesheet?

1785
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:32,100
I don't know.

1786
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:34,100
I can tell you for sure that Ask Noah will be live at 2.

1787
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,100
On Saturday?

1788
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,100
Yep.

1789
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,100
Maybe.

1790
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,100
That's our time, you bastard.

1791
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,100
It's 2 p.m.

1792
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,100
It's 2 p.m.

1793
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,100
Yeah, that's right.

1794
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:42,100
Sorry.

1795
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,100
It's fine.

1796
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,100
You take my time.

1797
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:45,100
Maybe we'll do it a different time.

1798
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,100
I'll take the Ask Noah time.

1799
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:47,100
There you go.

1800
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,100
I'll take it and I'll stink it up.

1801
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:49,100
There you go.

1802
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:50,100
I'll fart in your time slot, dude.

1803
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:51,100
Don't fart in my time slot.

1804
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,100
I have to live in that time slot the rest of the year.

1805
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,100
Yeah, you can go catch more Noah at the Ask Noah show.

1806
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,100
Go get more Noah.

1807
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,100
Do it.

1808
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,100
They'll be coming up live in just a little bit.

1809
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:04,100
You can get more Wes, TechSnap.Systems, and I'm on there too.

1810
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:07,100
And of course, you can follow the whole network at Jupiter Signal.

1811
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,100
And you heard me mention that they're Ubuntu podcast.

1812
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,100
You can go get the Ubuntu podcast.

1813
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,100
Go search YouTube.

1814
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,100
It's up on the YouTubes now and you can watch it there.

1815
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,100
Isn't that a development?

1816
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,100
Fancy.

1817
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,100
We are living in the future.

1818
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:22,100
Now rumor has it that we got to clear out of here because Brown Bear is going to take

1819
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:24,100
over and do even more Linux coverage.

1820
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,100
Destroy everything.

1821
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,100
That's true.

1822
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,100
That's true.

1823
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,100
That's how it goes.

1824
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:29,100
Every day.

1825
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:34,100
If you want to participate in that shenanigans live, head over to our neck of the woods.

1826
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:38,100
We start all around 1.30 Pacific on a Tuesday at jblive.tv.

1827
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:42,100
You can go to jupiterbroadcasting.com.calendar to get that converted in your time zone.

1828
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,100
Now we got lots of links.

1829
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:46,100
We got RSS feeds and additional podcasts.

1830
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:53,100
All that good stuff at linuxunplugged.com and links for this episode at linuxunplugged.com.246.

1831
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,100
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1832
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:27,100
Unplugged.

1833
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:29,100
Unplugged program.

1834
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,100
All right.

1835
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,100
It's post-show time.

1836
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:32,100
Little post-show.

1837
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:34,100
Who wants to get their post-show on?

1838
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:38,100
I thought you were out there soldering while we were in here doing a podcast.

1839
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,100
Who needs to worry about show prep, right?

1840
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:42,100
There are wires that must be connected.

1841
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:44,100
They must be connected properly.

1842
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,100
Now you got a new toy.

1843
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,100
That's all you worried about.

1844
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,100
All right.

1845
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:54,100
So elementary OS, in my personal opinion, got right the fact that they have a toolkit for UI,

1846
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:56,100
which makes it consistent across the desktop.

1847
01:17:56,100 --> 01:18:01,100
They've got it right on using mostly one language for development,

1848
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:04,100
even though it's not required that the apps are like this.

1849
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:12,100
Now my challenge is going to be how about start integrating smart file system management,

1850
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,100
like music recognition.

1851
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:20,100
So it automatically sorts by genre, category, and like of your user.

1852
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,100
If you're interested, I can give you the research papers.

1853
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,100
I can give you pseudocode.

1854
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,100
I can give you an example project.

1855
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:36,100
And you would be essentially the first operating system in the world to have intelligent file system organization.

1856
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,100
Can you elaborate on what you mean like that?

1857
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:41,100
Or are you just talking like an API that apps can tie into?

1858
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:42,100
No, no API.

1859
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:43,100
It's something that can run locally.

1860
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:45,100
The software is all open source.

1861
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:46,100
You can benefit from it.

1862
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:49,100
I'm willing to give you all of the source code about this.

1863
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:52,100
The first category that is already done, it's music.

1864
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,100
What does it mean?

1865
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:55,100
How do you use it?

1866
01:18:55,100 --> 01:19:01,100
Well, it actually goes through your music collection and evaluates it and does general recognition of the music.

1867
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:04,100
And because you have the music players already on the system,

1868
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:09,100
you can actually track the amount, you know, the quantity of times that was listened to,

1869
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:14,100
appreciation of music and basically do organization based on it.

1870
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:19,100
So this is like Zeitgeist, but it only does music?

1871
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,100
No, this is not Zeitgeist.

1872
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:25,100
Zeitgeist just keeps track of, you know, history of usage, right?

1873
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:29,100
And tries to make those things accessible or preloaded.

1874
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:34,100
This is about making actual your music files sorted.

1875
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:40,100
So the algorithms recognize genre, recognize style and recognize music patterns of likings.

1876
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:45,100
And all of these source code is open source, so you can use it.

1877
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:51,100
The idea is that you actually get it so that it sorts the music for your users.

1878
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:56,100
So even if it's just thrown up in the download folder, you can actually categorize that music.

1879
01:19:56,100 --> 01:20:00,100
You can say, give me all the rock and it will give you all the rock.

1880
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,100
This is like tracker.

1881
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:05,100
This is like your file systems, terrible mess on this for years.

1882
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,100
Yeah.

1883
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:11,100
The big problem with those kind of things is it's like it just leaves your file system is horrible mess

1884
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:18,100
and then people end up touching it and it breaks and it's slow and it's better to just like actually manage the files.

1885
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,100
So here is the part that I'm going to tell you.

1886
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:25,100
If you don't do it, Microsoft will do it first and then they will have those users.

1887
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,100
That's all.

1888
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,100
Didn't Microsoft just shut down their operating system department?

1889
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,100
Yeah, because they're going to use Linux.
