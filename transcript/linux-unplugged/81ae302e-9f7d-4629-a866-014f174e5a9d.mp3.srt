1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,260
Well, Chris, did you hear someone posted a native in kernel patch set for wire guard to open BSD?

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,880
Is that possible? Yeah, you know actually they've been working with upstream with with Jason

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,540
They've learned a lot from the Linux kernel implementation and they've got the right licensing in place

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,820
So yeah, I mean it hasn't been accepted

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,640
I don't know if it ever will be

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:37,800
But it actually might be simpler than Linux because turns out open BSD already had good crypto

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,680
Hello friends and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello Wes

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,160
It's episode 354 and I think it's too big of a show way too big. We're not being very responsible today

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,720
I know we needed to get one of those vehicles behind us with the sign that flashes that says

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,800
Oversized show just go around us on the internet. There's too much to cover today

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,400
We have a bunch of great community news. It turns out this is one of those weird weeks

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,800
That only 2020 brings us these days where Microsoft is going to dominate a large portion of our community news section

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,480
Say what? I know it's not just gonna stop there

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,520
We have a bunch of other things to get into including

15
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,520
Philip is here from Manjaro. Hello, Philip. Thank you for joining us again. Hello. Hello

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,280
So stay on the line there Phil because we're gonna be talking about some Manjaro hardware here in a moment

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,600
But before we go any further, I gotta say a big hello to drew and cheese who are also here today. Hello guys. Hello

18
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,100
Hello. Oh, hello gentlemen cheese. You're looking fabulous today. I like this new beaded sweatshirt. You've got here

19
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,520
Did you hand bead this thing hand beaded and hand sequined? I'd never seen a hoodie made out of beads before

20
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,480
It's really pretty impressive. This is one of those times. I wish we are a video show

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:53,260
And of course a huge time appropriate greetings to that mumble room. Hello virtual lug. Hello

22
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,540
Hello who let the eagle in the lug? Oh my gosh ridiculous. Well, I didn't want you to get lonely

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,800
Yeah, it is nice to have a pet eagle. I gotta say it is it is pretty pretty sweet

24
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,640
We have some strange news to start with

25
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,640
Everybody take a moment prepare yourselves because today is Microsoft build and we have a build

26
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,640
blast of Microsoft news for you

27
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,640
It starts with a Microsoft executive recently saying we got it wrong on open source

28
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Microsoft's Brad Smith acknowledges they were wrong in past remarks made by Balmer and other executives

29
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Brad Smith has served as the president of Microsoft since 2015. He held a virtual talk slash Fireside Chatskies

30
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,640
During that there was a quote that Michael liberal at pharaonic scrapped

31
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,640
Microsoft was on the wrong side of history when open source exploded at the beginning of the century

32
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,640
And I can say that about me personally

33
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,640
The good news is that if life is long enough, you can learn that you need to change

34
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,640
Today Microsoft is the single largest contributor to open source projects in the world when it comes to business

35
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,640
When we look at GitHub, we see it as the home for open source development

36
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,640
Now we see our responsibility as its steward to make it a secure productive home for developers

37
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,640
How does that make you feel when you read that? Do you feel like they get it? They actually get it this time

38
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,640
I mean, you know Brad Smith is is high up there and it does seem like their workforce gets it

39
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,640
So at this point the executives sort of have to play catch up, you know, all the best talent that they want to hire

40
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Those are folks that want to be involved in are involved in open source

41
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
And you heard that little business reference in there

42
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,640
I think really what they picked up on is hey, this is working for our bottom line

43
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
Yeah, indeed

44
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,640
So build like I said happening right now Microsoft's annual developer conference

45
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,640
And there's been a couple of bombshells that apply to the Linux world

46
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,640
Let's start with the biggest the one that made me go. Holy crap

47
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:04,640
There was some hints going around about this that a developer on Twitter named Alex happened to mention

48
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,640
And notice and took some screenshots of some weird DirectX stuff that seemed like it was being baked into WSL

49
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,640
But he didn't know what was going on behind the scenes

50
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,640
And today we learned that Microsoft, Sachi Nadella himself up on stage actually announced that WSL

51
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:27,640
The Windows subsystem for Linux on Windows 10 will include GPU compute support and full GUI application support

52
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:34,640
And there's even some DirectX magic happening here to support certain DirectX calls on your WSL applications

53
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,640
This is full fledged graphics supports

54
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,640
And their initial prototypes right now are even using Wayland as some of the windowing technology

55
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:51,640
To make it possible to run full fledged Linux GUI applications with GPU acceleration via WSL

56
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,640
They're going to beat us to Wayland on the desktop. Oh, no

57
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:05,640
It turns out how they're accomplishing this is essentially making this technology on par with what Windows applications can achieve

58
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Graphics performance wise will link to the developer post where Microsoft explains all of this

59
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:19,640
But essentially for a while now Microsoft has been baking in para virtualized GPU support into the core of Windows

60
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:25,640
And Windows drivers including requiring all of the OEMs to support this

61
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
Think about this for a moment

62
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,640
This has been a long term project actually in part to support HoloLens of all things

63
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:39,640
And launching with WSL 2 and WDDM version 2.9 which is part of the Windows display driver model

64
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:47,640
They're going to expand the reach of GPUs to Linux guests using this para virtualization technology that Windows itself is already using

65
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,640
So it's the same pipeline Windows is using for graphics rendering now being opened up to the WSL

66
00:05:53,640 --> 00:06:01,640
And it's one part Windows software but it's also one part Linux kernel software

67
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:09,640
Yeah, they've made a new kernel driver DXG kernel brand new and it basically exposes a little device slash dev slash DXG

68
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,640
To the user mode Linux running in your virtual machine there

69
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,640
And it's got an iOctal that basically mimics the native WDDM stuff that happens on the Windows side

70
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,640
And it sits there on the bus between the virtual machine and the host and just sort of forwards those calls along

71
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,640
So once you're in Linux, I mean, you just get the full capabilities that you would get in Windows

72
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,640
And there's not a whole bunch of throttling, it's not like the Linux has some sort of second tier access to the hardware

73
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,640
It competes just the same as any native Windows application

74
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:45,640
Yeah, like Bruce in the chat room puts it, so now you can play your Steam games using Proton on Linux on Windows

75
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:54,640
And as Jill very accurately and acutely puts it, there's really no need for VMware on Windows to run Linux with the full GPU anymore

76
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Applications that are running inside of the Linux environment have the same access to the GPU as native applications on Windows

77
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,640
There's not a partitioning of resources between Linux and Windows or limits that are imposed on the Linux applications

78
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,640
None of that exists, the sharing is completely dynamic just based on what application needs what

79
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:19,640
Also sort of interesting from the open source perspective, not really the open source perspective but just the targeting Linux at Microsoft perspective

80
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Is they've added stuff like DXCore and D3D12 to Linux, so this is like DirectX driver code now running on Linux

81
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,640
But it's compiled from the Windows codebase, the same codebase that they make the DLL for Windows

82
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,640
That's what they make the.so file for Linux on

83
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Although it seems that their kernel, while it shares some of the same names as Windows components

84
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,640
The kernel driver they've created is a clean room implementation that will be GPO

85
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,640
Nice to see, now of course you know we mentioned Proton and I had the same thought but

86
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Probably what a lot of this is targeted to especially right now before the full you know the GUI stuff comes into WSL

87
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,640
Well it's machine learning

88
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,640
Yeah those kind of jobs and stuff like that

89
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:06,640
And I think it's also about reassuring certain OEMs that if you wanted to continue to invest in DirectX

90
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,640
You've got still a Windows Avenue here as long as they're running it under WSL

91
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,640
And they do address the question around Vulkan in this post

92
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,640
And they say they're still exploring how to best support Vulkan in the Windows subsystem for Linux

93
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Although it seems like they're looking at basically adding stuff to Mesa that implements OpenCL and OpenGL

94
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,640
And some of those technologies on top of DX12

95
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,640
So this is like the reverse of the shims that we've been using to get DX implemented on those

96
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
They just flipped the script on us Wes

97
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,640
What?

98
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:44,640
On one hand it's really nice to see that Microsoft is giving more prominence to Linux as a whole even in their conferences

99
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:53,640
But like my principal worry about this is that it'll continue to suck the oxygen out of further advancing the Linux platform

100
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:01,640
In favor of just well Windows is good enough so we'll just do that and then all the crap that we have to run on Linux will just run on Linux on Windows

101
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,640
And it's a very very dangerous and bad path for the success of free and open source computing

102
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Because if people in large droves actually do embrace this attitude

103
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Like I don't want to bring up an old dead meme but it's embrace extend extinguish in a very very real way

104
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Yeah I see others in the chat room saying the same exact thing they're echoing the embrace and extend extinguish

105
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:42,640
I think it's the other way around though is I think this is a dramatic reaction to trying to shore up what has been a pretty lacking aspect of their quote unquote workstation desktop OS

106
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:50,640
And I think they've looked at what sold a whole bunch of MacBooks few years ago when a bunch of people bought MacBooks for development in the cloud

107
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,640
And they're looking at that going well a rich command line a good terminal

108
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:04,640
And now moving towards the future machine learning and being able to use the GPL for the GPU I should say for compute

109
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,640
Is a big part of what's going to make the future workstation for developers I think they're making that calculus as a reactionary move

110
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:18,640
And I think the problem here is because of the nature of the GPL because of the nature of Linux as sort of a unifying technology platform that anybody can kind of build on

111
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,640
And then bring their final value to make it a complete product

112
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,640
I think that's an unstoppable force and it eventually will continue to consume the desktop

113
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,640
It'll just be a 10 15 it's the it's the multi 20 year multi decade saga

114
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:38,640
But when you zoom this thing out and you go 5 10 15 years down the road it's not a Windows future

115
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:47,640
This is a stop the bleeding kind of move right now Windows itself and the NT kernel has a limited long term potential

116
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Windows 10 is sort of the big last hurrah for that platform and in a way what they're essentially doing is just making Linux the de facto runtime

117
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:04,640
If you target Linux you can run it on the cloud you can run it on Android you can run it on Windows you can run on Linux desktops

118
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,640
You can run it on ARM you can run on everything that's in everyone's pockets

119
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,640
And I think that is just too big that's bigger than any one product is bigger than any one company

120
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:23,640
And this is sort of just attempting to become at least competitive with the kind of workstation you get out of the box with Linux or Mac OS

121
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,640
It's almost Microsoft sort of just selling you know fancy developer tooling on top of Linux like here's this whole OS

122
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,640
But but really it's just a wrapper around Linux to smooth that experience and let you play games on the side

123
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,640
That's it we're taking what you know we're taking what you like and we're just going to shave off some of those rough edges

124
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Why even concern yourself with leaving the Windows experience

125
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:52,640
But I don't think it will supersede Linux as a whole because it's just utilizing part of Linux which has already been so successful

126
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,640
That doesn't mean it's not extremely clever and I think the company that's most at risk is Apple

127
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:06,640
This is clearly going after the developer market in a very aggressive way and I think it's going at the heart of what made Mac OS good

128
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:13,640
Because they've taken Windows 10 now and they're doing this iterative update process they're trying to make it a stable OS with WSL with all these new features

129
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,640
It's not us Linux users that should be concerned. It's Apple

130
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:26,640
If this was really the way that you know Microsoft was going towards us like they're trying to stave the bleeding and trying to recover a little bit and attack Apple more

131
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:36,640
Why not invest in wine. Why not build up that part like essentially what Valve has been doing to beef up the GPU and and and the hot pads for supporting video games

132
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Why not do the same for the rest of the stuff that Microsoft tends to care about which is productivity and and things of that nature

133
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,640
I've been wondering about that myself if that would be something we start seeing them do

134
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,640
But I think instead you'll see them just start targeting the platform

135
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,640
I've recently for the first time used teams on Linux Have you ever tried that

136
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,640
It's not bad It's actually not bad on Linux

137
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,640
They've done a decent job of creating the teams application for Linux

138
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:09,640
It lacks some of the features like background blur right and it did take them a while to add that support

139
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,640
But you saw it there as a bug and I think that that's part of their process

140
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Right they have ways to get feedback about products

141
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:23,640
And when they saw that oh yeah there there are a bunch of Linux users out there who maybe wants not the right word but need to use our software and want a native ish version

142
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:29,640
Let's make it for them I have this Chris last dot com slash consulting where I'm doing the podcast consulting for folks

143
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,640
And I had a client who is interested in working with me for a serious chunk of hours

144
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:41,640
But the requirement to work with them was I had to use teams because everyone on their team is using that

145
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,640
And I was like OK I didn't realize that until like the call was supposed to start

146
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,640
And so I was like I bet this is in the managerial repos

147
00:13:52,640 --> 00:14:00,640
And so I did I did a quick search there was teams I did a dash teams and hit enter and within 30 seconds I had Microsoft teams installed

148
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:07,640
I click the link and I selected my audio source and I was done and I've used it three times since then and it's worked perfectly fine

149
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,640
I think the only thing I can say to that is yeah exactly

150
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,640
There's also called a couple of other Microsoft things before we move on to manager which I want to talk about next

151
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:23,640
They also officially today released the Windows Terminal which was announced at build 2019

152
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:28,640
And has become official with 1.0 at build 2020

153
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,640
This is their open source terminal application where you can have in one tab the Windows command line

154
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:40,640
And then in another tab any Linux distro you want and you can have four or five tabs open with different Linux distros in each tab

155
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,640
It's a very well done piece of software it's something Wes and I were very impressed with when we tried Windows 10

156
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,640
I hope it doesn't get too good or might be better than our native terminals I mean it's already graphically accelerated

157
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,640
It's got a ton of customization options and of course first class emoji support right there

158
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,640
You know it's one of these new breed of sort of Windows apps that have been reimagined in this Microsoft loves open source future

159
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,640
So I imagine this be a lot of new workflows going on

160
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:14,640
Well you and I met a couple of the individuals behind the project at WSL Conf and the people behind the project from what we could tell

161
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:22,640
They came to Microsoft after this new open source kind of attitude so they came with this whole fresh perspective

162
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,640
I mean I've known people who worked at Microsoft for a very long time because it's here in my backyard

163
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,640
I've had family and friends that have worked there and there was an old way of looking at a Windows first world

164
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,640
And then there's been a shift since then and they joined the company since that shift

165
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:42,640
And they came in with that open source first mentality and then they built this terminal

166
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,640
And it's just a fascinating story

167
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,640
But last but not least in all of this because there's actually even more

168
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,640
Microsoft announced a built in package manager for Windows now

169
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,640
And this one's interesting the company today announced the Windows package manager

170
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,640
I knew they would do this I felt like Windows needed this

171
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,640
It's a new native package manager that will be built into Windows 10

172
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:15,640
With the new win get or wing it if you want to be silly about it command Windows package manager automatically gets the latest version of an app you want to download

173
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Validates its authenticity I mean you want that too and installs it on your machine

174
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,640
So as an example you can install the latest version of that Windows terminal we were just talking about

175
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Just by running win get one word install terminal

176
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,640
And that just pulls down the latest version from the Microsoft store and sets it up for you

177
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,640
Yeah so when I read this at first I was like oh so it's it's a command line front end to the Windows store

178
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:44,640
That's not very exciting but no the company will also allow users to download apps from third party repositories

179
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Which I think is the key thing to actually making a package manager useful

180
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,640
Yes right it's a little more it's generic tooling in that sense and not just tightly tied to their proprietary infrastructure

181
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:00,640
Yeah command line front end of the store is boring but a legitimate package manager that also can pull from the store

182
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,640
Okay that's interesting the Windows package manager supports Windows 10 version 1709

183
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,640
So you need to build 1709 or later and it will come pre-installed with Windows 10's desktop app installer

184
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Once that reaches version 1.0

185
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,640
It seems nice for automation too you know we'll tie this into some of your scripts and setups

186
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,640
And instead of relying on third party tools well you just do it all with the Windows stuff built in

187
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,640
This speaks to the larger point that you made about Microsoft looking at the landscape of Mac OS maybe

188
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,640
What sold a bunch of Macbooks well brew sold a bunch of Macbooks so let's just copy brew and have our own thing

189
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,640
I think that's it I think what you're seeing here with this package manager is Microsoft looking at Linux workstations

190
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,640
And Mac workstations and saying what works how do we do a modern take on that and build that into Windows

191
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:57,640
And where I sit as a Linux user it feels like it takes four freaking ever for this stuff to land in the operating system

192
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,640
It could have been there for years but to Windows users this stuff's coming at a rapid pace

193
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
They said it from a totally different perspective

194
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,640
Definitely big changes I mean it's interesting just from the velocity aspect to see how much stuff Microsoft's able to get done

195
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,640
And in the new Windows 10 world of you know frequent and smaller updates actually push this out to people

196
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,640
I think as Linux users we're going to have to get comfortable with a new reality where there's a lot of people on Windows that are playing in our space

197
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:31,640
And we need to be inviting and understanding and help them when they're ready to make a transition to a fuller Linux system

198
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Because if we're lucky we can set a good example we can make it look like a friendly place and we can encourage them to move to a richer fuller Linux ecosystem

199
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,640
I mean that's just it all right you got Windows from your you know enterprise supplied workstation at work

200
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,640
And oh hey you were able to start playing around with this Linux stuff

201
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Well now when you go home maybe you want to try putting some stuff on a Raspberry Pi and doing home automation

202
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,640
We've got the tools for you yeah exactly we got to set our defensiveness aside as much as we can

203
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:02,640
And just try to help these new users be successful so that way they become part of the greater community and further the cause

204
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,640
And I think it won't be for everyone I mean every user of the system won't be thinking like that but we'll be able to get some of them

205
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:14,640
All right I know that's a lot of Microsoft news and a Linux podcast but today's build and that concludes our build blast

206
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:27,640
And we move on now to some new hardware the mangero book AMD Ryzen running a Ryzen 5 series which is a 3600 I believe

207
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:35,640
Phil help me sort this out because I was thinking when mangero announced a Ryzen system it was going to be the 4000 series

208
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,640
But looks like we have maybe an interim release hardware here

209
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:47,640
Well it's like you have a normal desktop CPU flagged into your laptop so you can even change the Ryzen later on

210
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,640
If you have a different CPU simply swap it to a powerful one

211
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,640
Oh so this is like one of those workstation killer laptops

212
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Something like that this is a standard M4 CPU and you can simply swap it out

213
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:11,640
There's a powerful cooling system so it works so we have a smaller version but you can also put in a Ryzen 9 up to 3900 12 core

214
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,640
So we've got a whole range of systems here we mean we've had you on recently talking about Intel based systems now we have an AMD Ryzen system

215
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:26,640
There was talk recently about a ultrabook style mangero system it would also be Ryzen based so how do we keep all of this straight now

216
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:37,640
Well we have several vendors so this one is the computer shop from Belgium and they said hey we're looking also into the Ryzen plate and said okay let's go for that

217
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,640
And we said yes why not and we promoted for them

218
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:49,640
And so are they doing the bulk of the heavy lifting for getting the OS to run on there or is it because at this point the hardware is so well supported there's not a lot of heavy lifting to do

219
00:20:49,640 --> 00:21:01,640
Well we test with them the main developer of their shop is also using mangero so he is testing with us and we give him some pointers to get his hardware supported

220
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,640
So yeah it's a win-win situation that he is so active in distributing mangero on his machines

221
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:16,640
So I see kind of a split now in the strategies because some distros have one laptop and it's like the KDE neon laptop

222
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,640
There's one machine you can get it when they update it they update it infrequently but it's that one box

223
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Mangero seems to be going the approach of working with multiple vendors with multiple different laptops

224
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,640
Are you concerned at all about that getting confusing

225
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:41,640
Normally not we have tuxedo laptops where we have the complete branding then we have mangero computer from Belgium which is also doing some kind of branding for us

226
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:51,640
And having more vendors than only one you have more options and with this vendor from Belgium you can sell also to the US and Canada without the taxes

227
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,640
So we get a discount of 21% of each automatically

228
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:04,640
Oh that's pretty significant actually so you are in a sense trying a different model here and I couldn't be more for it

229
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,640
I think it's great to see some just stick with one piece of hardware and they iterate it infrequently and there's that choice

230
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,640
And then you have the mangero approach where there's several vendors which might work better for different customers with different machine options

231
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:23,640
I absolutely for a very long time and long time listeners of mine will know this I was a fan of the battle station laptop

232
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:31,640
I would haul these hunkers to my clients and then I would just plug in and I would have the power I needed of a desktop in a laptop

233
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:40,640
These days and I think kind of like yourself I'm more of portability first because you know I end up on a plane or I'm carrying a machine around at home and work every day

234
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,640
So it sounds like they'll just be multiple options for different types of users

235
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:53,640
Well Phil I got you here let's just do a quick update on the mangero project itself I saw a bunch of updates come out recently for my workstation

236
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,640
How are things in the land of mangero generally

237
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:04,640
It's pretty good we're working on getting the updates for the 20.0 releases out so the first point release went out there as well

238
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,640
And we found some issues we fixed them and we hopefully will also update the new KDE packages as they come out soon

239
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,640
I love that I'm running plasma on my mangero workstation and I just I just love it

240
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,640
I told the story recently on the show but it's so nice having one package manager for everything

241
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:31,640
Even my stupid printer drivers were in the AUR and then you combine that with the curation that happens at the project level on top of ARJ

242
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:38,640
I was initially skeptical but as an end user I have just absolutely loved it and I'm going to keep an eye on these hardware choices

243
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,640
Will you let us know when the 4000 series Ryzen box gets close

244
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,640
As soon as some vendor has a 4000 series then I'll let you know of course

245
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Oh I'm excited already

246
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:57,640
Yeah I mean everybody is that's what everybody is and truthfully in our testing the Intel 10th generation CPU based systems are also very competitive

247
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,640
So it's a good time there's lots of lots of choice

248
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Well thanks for coming on Phil and updating us on this it looks like a serious machine for anybody who needs workstation performance from a mobile rig

249
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:15,640
Yeah and the 10 generation of Intel we will have some new laptops soon also from the UK and Germany so stay tuned for those as well

250
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,640
Thank you sir

251
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:28,640
Now on the other end of the price spectrum but also well supported by managerial are the pine devices and recently as in since the last show

252
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,640
That's my definition of recently I'll take it

253
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:44,640
Yeah the pine tab had a pretty significant update with dates on shipping and also other new features like unless I missed this and cheesy maybe you can correct me

254
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,640
The last time I saw information about the pine tab I didn't see this keyboard attached with it

255
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:56,640
Well yeah they've always had the idea of magnetic keyboard in play for the pine tab

256
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,640
He was in November when they were initially kind of talking about it and there were dev units out there

257
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:10,640
I know Marius from reports had gotten one the magnets on the keyboard case weren't very strong

258
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:17,640
So they were having issues with those so I think they reengineered where those were placed and use stronger magnets

259
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:27,640
I mean it seems like a great little tablet to get it kicked off there's already some videos out there of the pine tab running Ubuntu touch

260
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:40,640
You know from reports with the five six kernel in it Lima graphics drivers seems like a solid little machine six thousand milliamp battery full size USB 2.0 socket

261
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:54,640
Does have two gigs of DDR3 RAM which is a little low but it's definitely not a killer for a small tablet like that 10 inch 720 IPS display 64 gigs of EMMC flash storage

262
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:03,640
But you can expand this and I thought that this was super cool so they have an optional M.2 adapter that you can open up

263
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:17,640
Apparently with one screw you can take the back off tab toss in this M.2 adapter so you can add in your NVMe SSD even an LTE module

264
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,640
They're talking about LoRa modules a lot of interesting stuff

265
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,640
Yeah that really stood out to me cheese it just because you know they mentioned a little bit like some of this is for aimed at personal users

266
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:33,640
But some of this is aimed also maybe at commercial applications like LoRa support which is that low bandwidth but long range wireless protocol

267
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:40,640
So wouldn't a pine tab especially at that price be something just flash on your like commercial thing give it to your employees

268
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,640
They've got it there in the truck with them they when they need to go service something that'd be awesome

269
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:52,640
Precisely and the one thing that does seem to be kind of a hiccup with that adapter though is that you can populate it with two modules

270
00:26:52,640 --> 00:27:04,640
So you can populate it with the LTE module for example or a LoRa module which isn't quite out yet and say an SSD but you can only use one at a time

271
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:15,640
But I mean you got to think that this is a $99 price tag with a $20 keyboard upgrade that's really a pretty awesome deal

272
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:27,640
There's a lot of cool stuff that actually came out of this update so the pine phone itself they're going to be adding a QI wireless charging that attaches via the pogo pins

273
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:34,640
They're exploring adding a another 5,000 milliamp battery to the back of the case to give you you know more runtime

274
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:43,640
The keyboard that they've talked about for the pine phones kind of been put on hold but that's going to be coming around eventually whenever you know this kind of COVID thing has died off

275
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:50,640
And I think that really comes down to they need some in-person visits which you really can't do right now with these factories

276
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,640
So until that opens back up you know they won't be kind of going down the keyboard route for a little bit

277
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:08,640
A couple of things jump out at me first of all $20 for a magnetic backlit keyboard is crazy and when you compare that to the $300 entry price for the new Apple iPad keyboard

278
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:25,640
The other thing I really like to see is adding QI wireless to the pine phone is a big deal because there are millions of QI wireless devices already out in the market made by some of the biggest manufacturers in the mobile industry

279
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:33,640
You know they've said that there's going to be compatibility there so any QI wireless devices that you already have or charging mats that you already have will work

280
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:43,640
It's a genius idea that they added the pogo pins so that you can easily you know make these additional devices that you can attach to the pine phone

281
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:49,640
As far as software I tried the latest UbiPorts I still don't have a SIM for it it is getting better

282
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,640
In the video they released it looks like UbiPorts was designed for a tablet

283
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,640
I think that really kind of crosses that convergence area where everyone's been talking about

284
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:09,640
The tablet itself is also supposed to support display out I don't know if that's USB OTG how exactly they're going to handle that but should be interesting

285
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:17,640
I got a question for you you said that they have the same quad core a64 system on a chip is that which is that just essentially the rock pro 64 in there

286
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:30,640
Well it's similar they use the same CPU as in the normal Pinebook the original the 1080p so you have the same CPU in the phone in the Pinebook original and in the tab

287
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:42,640
And with that you have the possibilities to have the same hardware and us as vendors of the software we don't have to release multiple kernels

288
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,640
So it's easier for us to have one kernel for the Pine devices and to work on the phone on the tab and on the original

289
00:29:48,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Yeah I bet as a developer you're very pleased to see that I want to be the guy here for a moment who just says you know set phasers to stun on your expectations

290
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,640
It's not going to be a performance powerhouse it's not going to shame the iPad Pro in that regard

291
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:16,640
But in price, customizability, tinkering, future expansion and potentially your preferred workflow this could be an unmatched value

292
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,640
I am very excited to see where they take this

293
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:26,640
I mean it's just the beginning right I mean this will be the you know the first try out and I'm sure it will evolve as a platform as it keeps going

294
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:34,640
Very cool all right well let's do a little housekeeping we don't have a lot in this week's episode

295
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,640
I do want to mention that we'd love to have you join us live we have a great attendance today 33 people in the mumble room right now as we go

296
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:50,640
You can join us on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv and we convert that to your local time zone with the assistance of robots at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash live

297
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,640
And that's good because you don't want us doing it

298
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,640
I'll mess it up every time, every time

299
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,640
We also have the Luplug happening every Sunday and this is how I know some people skip housekeeping because they don't know about this

300
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,640
They show up in the telegram group and they're like isn't there some sort of lug thing yeah the Luplug

301
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Sundays at noon pacific but we got that calendar so you can convert that stuff

302
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:21,640
Noon pacific which is the same exact time we do this here show only on Tuesdays so it's the same bat time just a different bat day Sundays

303
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,640
And we use our here mumble

304
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:29,640
Yeah easy peasy and it's a great way to practice your setup if you want to come join us live on Tuesday which you should

305
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:36,640
And you know Chris you did mention the telegram group and that's still happening going stronger than ever jupiterbroadcasting.com slash telegram

306
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,640
Yeah some say it's too strong I say they don't know what they're talking about

307
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,640
So we'd love to see you in there it's a great way to continue the conversation in between shows but also get us looking at something

308
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:52,640
Is there something in the open source world that you think needs our attention that's a great way to get it in front of us

309
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,640
So there you go also you know I'm going to plug right here linuxunplug.com slash contact

310
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,640
Get your feedback in ha how about that we love that feedback

311
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:08,640
How can we never plug that in the housekeeping West I don't know let's add that right now there you go

312
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:16,640
Well let's just do a quick old update on our pie holes pie hole 5.0 came out and we run pie hole here in the studio

313
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:26,640
I'm sure some of you run it yourselves but those that are not familiar pie hole is a network level ad blocking software

314
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:33,640
That is predominantly designed to run on a raspberry pie there is where you get the name obviously

315
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:43,640
But because we're maniacs we just run it on our big old x86 server in a container old school old school well actually kind of sort of I don't know

316
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,640
Or new school I don't know what's old is new again

317
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:56,640
So version 5.0 has landed and I thought well let's jump on the old server here at the studio and do an update right before the show

318
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,640
Because what could go wrong on the very thing I used to access the internet and nothing did it was very boring

319
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:12,640
I did a docker compose poll and then I did a docker compose up dash D and waited one minute impatiently

320
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:20,640
And then the new page loaded and I was running the next version and it was the most boring upgrade in network software history

321
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
It was just a good thing in my opinion

322
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,640
Yeah you know they do have some notes as a project that this is a one way upgrade so if you leave version 4.0 and you go to version 5.0

323
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,640
There ain't no going back except for your backups and yeah you probably should have some backups

324
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,640
But they also note that docker is a great way to run this because the upgrades I mean they're just a little safer

325
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,640
You don't have to worry about any intermittent state as long as the configs don't break

326
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,640
Well you've got a time tested image right there available

327
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:53,640
As far as 5.0 goes what I noticed pretty much immediately was improved graphics on the dashboard

328
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:01,640
For like my history charts of what's been blocked and whatnot and a little bit of more information in log and areas like that

329
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,640
But I think probably the biggest deal for me and why I went ahead with the upgrade

330
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,640
Was the custom host names from the web GUI now through local DNS records tab

331
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,640
This is where you can assign the host name to an IP address

332
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:20,640
Which I think Wes was the reason why we ended up not using PyHole for our DNS

333
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Does that sound right to you because they didn't have this feature when we first deployed it

334
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,640
Yeah exactly you know it wasn't quite ready to do everything on the network

335
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,640
We had some other infrastructure options available to us at the time

336
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:37,640
Now that they have this well yeah why not just do it in PyHole because it really does have a pretty friendly GUI

337
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,640
Especially if you've been used to configuring things like DNS mask by hand in the command line

338
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Yeah it is so nice when you just once or twice or three times a year want to go in and do that kind of stuff

339
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,640
It's really nice just to have a UI that sits on top of tried and true Linux technologies

340
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,640
It's not creating some weird implementation itself

341
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,640
Overall pretty solid release though I mean the update was done

342
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,640
I got in there and is one of those experiences where I was like hmm I don't notice a lot of differences

343
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,640
But what I have noticed is an improvement

344
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,640
Her device blocking is quite nice so you're able to block individual clients

345
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,640
So you have a teenager that wants to access Facebook between a certain time

346
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,640
You can do that now through the PyHole web interface

347
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Yeah it's a pretty nice customization you know PyHole is one of those systems that by and large you sort of forget that it's running on your network

348
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,640
But for folks all stuck at home right now with a lot of diverse use cases

349
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:33,640
That might be causing some problems or maybe you don't need some of that blocking on your work computer that needs to get some stuff done

350
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,640
But you do want it to block out those things for your smart TV

351
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,640
Yeah very true I recently just did the math the back of the napkin math

352
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,640
And I looked at some paid for blocking services for the kids

353
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,640
I was actually kind of doing it on behalf of Angela for her because at the RV I have PyHole

354
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,640
But she wanted something for her network and we were just kind of doing the math

355
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,640
It's like if you look at it if you put this on a Raspberry Pi it doesn't need to be the latest Pi either

356
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,640
So you may have one already which changes the math or maybe you just buy a Raspberry Pi 3

357
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:10,640
For a very reasonable cost around $35 and then you load this image on there

358
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:20,640
When you look at it it's probably a grand total of an hour of investment of your time at $25 to $55 worth of hardware

359
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,640
So when we were done with that back of the napkin math 12 months or so you could kind of justify the cost of a subscription service

360
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,640
But by year two you were clearly saving money by deploying this yourself

361
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:38,640
I don't remember exactly how long ago we deployed PyHole on our machine here in the studio West

362
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,640
But I think we're getting close to that year mark now

363
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,640
Yeah and it's really been a good test that by and large nothing's broke you know

364
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:51,640
It's not that like sites mysteriously fail or all kinds of stuff just hangs when you expect it to load

365
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
So I've been pretty impressed

366
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,640
They've improved some other stuff there just as from the admin perspective too

367
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,640
They've got deep CNAME inspection which is pretty cool

368
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,640
So you can have multiple CNAME redirects you know when you've got a DNS name and it could be a whole chain of them

369
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,640
PyHole can now inspect that chain and determine if any of those are on your blacklist and then block that original request

370
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,640
And you mentioned better logging info one of those things is more information about why something was blocked

371
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,640
So now in the GUI you can go in find that something was blocked and if you're curious like what rule is blocking this

372
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,640
Maybe it is something that you don't want to be blocked it'll tell you just what that rule is

373
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:36,640
I do like that I always love seeing other notable features include quote unquote more efficient memory usage

374
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,640
Always love seeing that on a new software release because it makes it easier to run it on lower spec hardware

375
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,640
Which makes that whole cost calculation even easier

376
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,640
I think there's other things in here for those of us who subscribe to different blacklist

377
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,640
They've improved the parsing of imported blacklist

378
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,640
They have a gravity script that will now show how many domains were not able to be imported from that list too

379
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,640
And then give you some examples as to why they didn't import so you know where to start from

380
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:09,640
Which is exceptionally nice especially for people who are doing this casually and don't spend a lot of time

381
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,640
Managing these types of lists or even trying to block things at a DNS level

382
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,640
Yeah exactly it's an interesting blend I think because it is you know actually pretty nice for the power user

383
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,640
You can get in there and go into the command line you can customize the DNS mask or DNS FTL whatever they call it these days

384
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,640
You can customize all that stuff if you need to we've got some custom configs and host files entry setup

385
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,640
But if you just want to use this from a casual end-user perspective that works great too

386
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,640
Do you struggle with the morality of using something like this Wes? I've never had this problem with piehole

387
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,640
But when I use something in my browser, I've gotten a couple of hey, you know to use our website

388
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,640
Please whitelist us from your ad blocker

389
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,640
That is a little bit harder when you're using a network level blocker because it just you got to go login

390
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,640
You got to go add the URL it takes more time than just clicking something in your browser toolbar

391
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:03,640
There's a bit of a disconnect here when you're using this do you struggle with that at all because I kind of do

392
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:09,640
Yeah, I mean you are just sort of blanketly saying hey, I want as few ads as possible and that's pretty great from you know

393
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,640
The actual end-user experience, but we do have to acknowledge that many of our favorite sites on the internet

394
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,640
Well traditionally a lot of their revenue let's and the things they use to pay for their servers or pay for their staff

395
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,640
That does come from advertising. So it is a good workflow to get into maybe practice once you set this up

396
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,640
Like what does it look like to whitelist something? What are the sites I go to a lot and you know, especially right now

397
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,640
It's just it's just a good time if you have the resources available

398
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:38,640
Maybe go subscribe send some money to those sites that you turn off ads for that's a good point

399
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,640
Bloomberg just recently did a piece about piehole interestingly enough and

400
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,640
According to their research piehole is installed on only a hundred and forty thousand network

401
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:53,640
So we're not talking like, you know a plague that is impacting the advertising industry

402
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,640
But what are your thoughts on this Alex aka? Mr. Ironic Badger

403
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:04,640
Is this one of those situations where end-users are essentially robbing the creator of revenue?

404
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,640
I mean, I hate to put it at such dramatic terms, but that is kind of what we're talking about here

405
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,640
Yeah a little bit but then on the flip side you have websites that are designed entirely as ad revenue

406
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:24,640
Farms, you know all these ones that have 10 things about this thing that you don't really care about

407
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,640
They make you click through a 10 image slideshow instead of just writing the article properly

408
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,640
Also trying to browse some of these websites on mobile is just horrible

409
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,640
And there's no real good way to block ads on mobile

410
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:45,640
So for me piehole or ad guard home is is just a it's a necessity to get a decent mobile browsing experience these days

411
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:51,640
I completely agree, you know in lady dupes right now. I'm on a mobile connection

412
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:59,640
I get maybe if I'm lucky 4 megabits where I'm parked right now and having a network level ad blocker

413
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,640
That just prevents pre-rolls and prevents certain components from loading on the web page

414
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,640
Means I put less traffic on the cellular network

415
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:12,640
I've been subscribing to the New York Times for a couple of months now just to try and support proper journalism

416
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:19,640
And I think that is the way that we should go about this not forcing advertisements down our our throats really

417
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,640
Yeah, there is the tracking element to of this and I think in a way

418
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,640
It's users pushing back saying this isn't the right way to monetize and I don't mean to make this about this

419
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,640
But to your point the unfiltered podcast, I've relaunched it recently and I very intentionally am just crowdfunding

420
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,640
I've committed to no sponsors. No advertising. It is very much

421
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,640
Not a feasible way to monetize news in my opinion

422
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:54,640
I think it's fraught with problems when it when it requires tracking of clicks tracking of views tracking across multiple properties

423
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:04,640
It's fraught with so many user hostile issues that if you just took a more direct to audience approach would be completely avoidable

424
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,640
And I'm not trying to justify the use of ad blocking

425
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,640
But I do think in a sense it's users attempting to vote with their wallet

426
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,640
Well, right. I mean we haven't had a lot of feedback mechanisms and there's you can talk to individual sites

427
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,640
But there's no other real way to go yell at advertisers and marketers out there and we get that some of that stuff's needed

428
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:30,640
Sometimes it might even be useful rarely maybe but sometimes but we've just seen a relentless increase in tracking and fingerprinting

429
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,640
That's it was well said and it would be nice if you know

430
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,640
Maybe a little more than 140,000 of us were using this because it might send a very clear signal

431
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:48,640
Also, I want to mention this Bloomberg piece is worth reading because the other thing they talk about is the core developer now

432
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,640
Who's taken over the project recently will kind of semi recently in the last few years

433
00:42:52,640 --> 00:43:00,640
He's got about five to 20 hours. He says to work on this thing between college and his project

434
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,640
Now there is a flourishing community here. So it's not all on one individual

435
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:11,640
But the elite dev for this project this piehole project that I think is it's one of those showcase open source projects

436
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:17,640
That even people who have no idea what Linux or a Raspberry Pi or open sources you can show them piehole and they love it

437
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:26,640
It's being created by somebody who's spending roughly roughly five to 20 hours depending on how busy he is at school

438
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:34,640
I think that's pretty humbling when you think about it. It's a guy who started this when he was in high school

439
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,640
Got involved with the project when he was in high school and now he's in college

440
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,640
And when science classes are busy, he's only got about five hours a week to spend on this thing

441
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,640
Yeah, I think that does underscore a little bit too of you know, this is an organic need

442
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:56,640
It's not some conspiracy to hurt websites and advertisers. It's just end users getting frustrated and doing what they can

443
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,640
All right. Well, let's cover a little feedback here on the show. I think that's a piehole for you

444
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,640
And now let's talk about a Linux Mint success story from Zachary

445
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,640
He writes I wanted to share a Linux Mint success story about my grandmother

446
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,640
She loves it. Her computer is a six-year-old HP all-in-one

447
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:20,640
It had all of the programs from Windows 8 and she hated Windows 8 didn't we all?

448
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,640
Yeah, you know, it was amazing Wes. It really was something the touchscreen worked intermittently

449
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,640
Oh, that's good took three minutes to boot

450
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:34,640
Oh my god, and she had a metered internet connection that Windows did not respect

451
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,640
Which she was constantly worried about going over her cab all the time

452
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,640
There were weekly printer issues then eventually the Windows key deactivated itself

453
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:51,640
So and not the key, but the actual like serial key. So she got the Windows watermark saying this is not a license copy

454
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,640
She stuck it out as long as she could but it got horribly slow unreliable

455
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:01,640
She desperately needed a new computer, but I convinced her to first try Linux Mint and she loves it

456
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:08,640
I do as well because computer problem calls went from weekly to only twice in the last year

457
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,640
Wow, isn't that the truth? I've noticed that as well

458
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,640
She likes it and says that it's easier to use than Windows ever was

459
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,640
I even forgot to show her how to shut the computer off

460
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,640
And so I called her and told her how to do it, but she said she'd already figured it out

461
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:26,640
Can you imagine how proud he must be of his grandma right now?

462
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,640
Oh my gosh, I know. He said like really you figured it out and she just said yeah

463
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,640
I mean it has a big red power symbol labeled shutdown. Of course I did

464
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:41,640
Obvious. How simple. Yeah, yeah that grandchild pride is real though

465
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,640
Camille writes in with a question that I get about once a day right now

466
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,640
So I'm very thankful for the opportunity to clear this up

467
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,640
It's about Pi Boot. He says hello in episode 347

468
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,640
You mentioned putting some info about booting from the USB drive with the Raspberry Pi 4

469
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,640
It's in the show notes you said, but I can't find it. Help please

470
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,640
Well, we'll link it again

471
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,640
And I'll say the guide we have linked here

472
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,640
You really only need to jump down to about midway where it talks about preparing your SD card

473
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,640
That's about where the guide is relevant today

474
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,640
But what this question is getting at is something that I think is fantastic

475
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:27,640
With Ubuntu 20.04 on the Raspberry Pi 4 and it's that you can run from an external USB drive

476
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,640
Now you do need the SD card

477
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,640
You got to have boot on the SD card

478
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,640
But the process is so simple

479
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:42,640
And once you do this the read and write access to the SD card is so limited that it's probably going to last forever

480
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,640
Right. I mean at that point it's basically okay

481
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,640
Anytime you boot it needs to read the RAMFS on the kernel

482
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,640
And then when you update and get a new kernel then it has to write you back

483
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,640
But that's about it

484
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,640
And what's nice is it's so much faster

485
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,640
And yes it's over USB 3.0

486
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:07,640
So huge caveat, past Chris would never ever ever ever recommend that you run your system from a USB drive ever

487
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,640
Don't do it

488
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,640
Current Chris has accepted this compromise in hopes that the USB code base has gotten more stable as time has proceeded

489
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,640
And so far, so far, current Chris has not been proven wrong

490
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,640
Yeah I mean USB has been adopted for so many things these days

491
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,640
And I think there are a lot of systems

492
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,640
I mean I've definitely been guilty of that before

493
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,640
Even running Windows off a USB drive once in a while

494
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,640
So it seems to just work

495
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,640
I hope so

496
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,640
Because I'm doing it

497
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,640
The way this works is you take the Pi image

498
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,640
And this may work for other distros as well

499
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,640
This is something I'm going to try

500
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,640
But you take the Pi image for your favorite distro

501
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,640
In this case I use 2004

502
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,640
But try it with others

503
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,640
It just really requires a more modern kernel

504
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,640
You take that image, you flash it to the SD card like you always would

505
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,640
Maybe using DD or using

506
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,640
I don't know

507
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,640
Do you do you?

508
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,640
Maybe you use Etcher

509
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,640
I'm not judging

510
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,640
Then get ready for this

511
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,640
Ready?

512
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,640
Take the USB drive

513
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,640
You plug it in

514
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,640
You flash the same image to the USB drive

515
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,640
I know

516
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,640
Revolutionary

517
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,640
You plug both devices in

518
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,640
You log in

519
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,640
You change the file system ID

520
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,640
To match the SD card on the USB drive

521
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,640
And from that point forward

522
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,640
Once the kernel loads up from the SD card

523
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,640
It sees that file system label

524
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,640
But from what we could tell essentially

525
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,640
It just the way that it's hard coded

526
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,640
It first attempts to boot from USB

527
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,640
Yeah, it seems to work out that

528
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,640
How the kernel chooses its boot devices

529
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,640
They both ended up having the same label

530
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,640
But it just picks the right one to start with

531
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,640
So we didn't even have to erase the label from the SD card

532
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,640
So that means too that in the worst case

533
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,640
Your USB dies

534
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,640
Well, you can still boot to repair things from the SD

535
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,640
Yeah, and we'll link to the guide that I used to do this

536
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,640
And like I said, start about midway down

537
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,640
And it's so much better

538
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,640
First of all, you reduce the wear and tear on the SD card

539
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,640
But these SD cards are slow

540
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,640
So slow

541
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,640
So slow, where I have USB 3 and an SSD

542
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,640
It's about as fast as you're going to get

543
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,640
In fact, I did some benchmarks just to test it

544
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,640
Because I wanted to get some real numbers

545
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,640
And from what I can roughly tell

546
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,640
It's about as fast as I could possibly get a Raspberry Pi 4 now

547
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,640
Without overclocking it

548
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,640
You know, and just from our own experiments

549
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,640
When you SSH into one of those things

550
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,640
And it's on the SD card and you launch something

551
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,640
Boy, can you tell

552
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,640
But running from the SSD

553
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,640
It just feels like you've SSHed into any old x86 VPS

554
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,640
Yeah, you'd have no idea it's a Raspberry Pi

555
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,640
You really wouldn't

556
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,640
You'd just think it's a VPS or a physical x86 box

557
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,640
And things just run

558
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,640
Yes, and so much stuff is supported on these systems

559
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,640
It's all been cross compiled, it works on ARM

560
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,640
It's great

561
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,640
Alright, well now Wes, you've got that brand new

562
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,640
Really nice looking Dell XPS 13

563
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,640
In your hot little hands for a review

564
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,640
And we got some feedback on the

565
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,640
Hey, include this in the review feedback that we asked for last week

566
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,640
And it came from Cory and he said for the XPS 13 review

567
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,640
I'd love to hear about using it with a generic install

568
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,640
Of Ubuntu 2004

569
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,640
He says, what changes has Dell made to the drivers?

570
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,640
Do they submit them upstream? How will this machine run

571
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,640
22.04 in two years?

572
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,640
You know, Cory, thank you for that feedback

573
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,640
Those are all definitely things I'll be checking out

574
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,640
Actually, a little spoiler right here

575
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,640
It came with 18.04 I think on there

576
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,640
Everything worked out of the box, WiFi was working

577
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,640
I just wanted to test it and I've been loving 20.04 so of course I overrode it

578
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,640
And stuck that on there

579
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,640
So far, no WiFi yet

580
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,640
I'm going to do some more testing, I'll definitely dig into what drivers are in use

581
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,640
And what you actually need to get this working

582
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,640
Unfortunately, it's like it's still new enough that that's a little bit tricky

583
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,640
Interesting

584
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,640
I'm glad you're trying that, a little early discovery there

585
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,640
The way my understanding of this process is

586
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,640
Dell is not creating drivers

587
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,640
And then creating a bastardized image

588
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,640
That ships on the XPS to make it work

589
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,640
They contract with Canonical

590
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,640
And Canonical developers

591
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,640
Make it work, they generate an image

592
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,640
And they certify it and they deliver that to Dell

593
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,640
And then Dell ships that on the XPS

594
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,640
What I'm saying here is, this isn't Dell hacking it into an image

595
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,640
It's the Canonical developers making it work

596
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,640
So it has a very, very good shot

597
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,640
That it's going to get upstreamed into mainline Ubuntu

598
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,640
And that is part of the arrangement

599
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,640
There is a licensing agreement that Dell

600
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,640
Pursues with Canonical

601
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,640
There is a revenue share for every laptop sold

602
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,640
And those support services are part of that agreement

603
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,640
That Dell makes with Canonical

604
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,640
The good news for Dell is that the Ubuntu developers themselves

605
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,640
Are doing some of the coding necessary to get things to work

606
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,640
Like maybe that WiFi

607
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,640
Or maybe that new fingerprint reader

608
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,640
The nice advantage for end users is

609
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,640
You're not having some third party OEM just slam jam code

610
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,640
Into your image where they've hard coded a PPA and you're good to go

611
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,640
You actually have the maintainers of the distribution

612
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,640
That are writing this

613
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,640
And Dell makes it always into the mainline ISO

614
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,640
But it has a very good shot

615
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,640
And it also is a revenue source for Canonical

616
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,640
Yeah absolutely, and I should note I was just using the same

617
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,640
Random 2004 USB stick I had laying around from our review

618
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,640
So that hadn't been updated and because I didn't have WiFi during the install

619
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,640
I actually haven't updated the thing yet

620
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,640
So it may be that I do some updates and everything just works

621
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,640
Yeah and on top of that, you know me, I'd be also interested in other distros as well

622
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,640
You know what you've got to do Wes, you've got to kegzak into some RAM disks

623
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,640
As if I won't be doing that already

624
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,640
Yeah I know, you've got to put at least some of the major ones

625
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,640
I'm sure Fedora 32 will be getting a run on there and Menjaro as well

626
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,640
One of Wes' most recent duties was

627
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,640
He was put in charge of hiring our new soundboard guy

628
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,640
Who just sits here

629
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,640
Too soon, he just did it too soon

630
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,640
Come on, we talked about this

631
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,640
I don't know what to do about this guy

632
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,640
But we do have some pics to get into

633
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,640
It's not the same now

634
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,640
We've got to get rid of this guy

635
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,640
Maybe one of our pics eventually will be a machine learning model that replaces him

636
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,640
I told you hiring a soundboard guy out of Bangladesh

637
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,640
Was going to be fraught with latency

638
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,640
I told you that

639
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,640
But doing this for a long time Wes, that's how these things work

640
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,640
Yeah you're right, in fact I think he's paying us

641
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,640
I don't know how that works

642
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,640
Well we have a couple of pics

643
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,640
This one was sent in by several individuals

644
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,640
I think the whole internet in a way that doesn't typically happen noticed this pic

645
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,640
But we'll give credit to Stephen because he actually used the contact form

646
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:06,640
Stephen wrote in and he says I just found this little tool that converts any USB thumb drive to a multi boot ISO stick

647
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,640
All you do once it's finished is copy over the ISO and reboot

648
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,640
It can hold numerous ISOs all at once

649
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,640
Also any normal files you might want just to use it as a USB stick

650
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,640
It's got a GitHub page and it's undergoing very rapid development

651
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,640
Alex N on Twitter also sent this in

652
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:30,640
Interestingly enough on my own accord I also found this one and tagged it

653
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,640
Everybody found this and it does seem like a super cool pic Wes

654
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,640
Oh yeah absolutely

655
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,640
Way back in the last days I think you guys talked about some hardware that could do this

656
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,640
You know a special USB stick that you could copy ISOs on

657
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:48,640
But talk about easy peasy when you're making these USB drives from ISOs all the time

658
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,640
Why even bother with Etcher when you can just use CP

659
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,640
Yeah it's like the last USB stick you need and you just throw the ISOs on there

660
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,640
And you're right I had I think it was a Zalman drive

661
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,640
Yeah that's what it was and that's pretty slick and kind of makes sense that you might do this in hardware

662
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:08,640
I'm really impressed I'm going to have to do some digging here in the repository to see how they're making this work

663
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:14,640
And just how slick it is because they even talk about having UFI support and legacy BIOS both working the same way

664
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,640
It presents you with a nice little menu that finds all your ISOs and lets you choose between them

665
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,640
Holy cow

666
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:24,640
Yeah you just now stick the USB disk in copy the ISO over

667
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:30,640
I mean I love this about my Zalman USB drive but it would do classic CD-ROM emulation

668
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:36,640
So it would actually show up to the host OS as an actual USB CD-ROM drive which is just too much

669
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,640
This is much simpler and you just copy them over and you're good to go

670
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,640
I think this is going to change my Linux distro hopping game forever

671
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,640
Big statement

672
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,640
I think you might be right

673
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:52,640
Well how can we top that that brings us to the end of this week's unplugged broadcast

674
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,640
We'd love to get your feedback at linuxunplugged.com slash contact

675
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:01,640
Please do and if there's anything else you want to know about that XPS before we do the official review let me know

676
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:06,640
It's coming soon and you can hit me up on Twitter I'm at ChrisLS, Wes

677
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,640
At Wes Payne

678
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,640
And go get yourself some cheese bacon cheesy

679
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,640
At cheese bacon

680
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:18,640
Oh it's magic and of course the show is at linuxunplugged on Twitter the network is at Jupiter signal

681
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,640
Thanks so much for tuning into this week's episode of the unplugged program

682
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,640
And I'll see you right back here next Tuesday

683
00:56:52,640 --> 00:57:10,640
I found the WSL content really refreshing because I got to know the change from within Microsoft when it happened

684
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,640
So I was there with the Windows 7 to Windows 8 and Windows 8 to Windows 10

685
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,640
And you really notice the change from Baltimore to Nadella

686
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:26,640
And it's like day and night and people are still in the embrace, extend, distinguish mentality and I really can't hear it anymore

687
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,640
It's just so like tiring

688
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,640
So you were an employee of Microsoft?

689
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,640
It was a close contract, it was like subcontracting I did

690
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,640
They have lots of contractors

691
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:42,640
Yeah so I was teaching sales for the Microsoft employees and for the retail guys and stuff

692
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:48,640
So from what you witnessed personally you felt like the transition was legitimate internally

693
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,640
Yeah for sure absolutely

694
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:56,640
They had meetings, they had people flying out to Redmond and showing them Azure

695
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:02,640
And when the whole canonical stuff happened people started getting really curious

696
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:08,640
So I did some workshops because I was always Linux curious and did use it privately

697
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,640
And so I did some workshops for the sales guys that had to deal with Azure back then and stuff

698
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:18,640
So I mean I'm from a little country like I'm from Austria but you know small changes

699
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:29,640
Yeah I feel like my proximity to people at Microsoft gave me a bit of a view into the company that people maybe outside of this area don't have

700
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:40,640
Not only that but I will be honest that I now looking back at it feel like I was childishly irrationally angry at Microsoft

701
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:48,640
In the late 90s and the early aughts Microsoft was the greatest evil in the technology industry that I perceived

702
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,640
And the technology industry had the greatest potential for influence on mankind

703
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,640
You might even say they were a cancer

704
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:05,640
Yes and so it became my life's work to inform people about alternatives to Microsoft

705
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:13,640
And so when I had the opportunity to go down to Redmond because of some content we were covering in Koda Radio

706
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:17,640
I actually was contacted by some folks at Microsoft and asked to come down there

707
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:27,640
And when I sat down there and started chatting with folks that were Gentoo users and SUSE users and Fedora users and Windows users all around the same table

708
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:38,640
I went oh this is different this really is like something that's been multiple years at that point when I went in it was like five years in the works

709
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:48,640
And I just couldn't be intellectually and emotionally honest with myself without recognizing the cadence difference in everything they were saying to me

710
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:59,640
And the fact that a lot of the employees there were listening to our podcast because they're interested in what Linux users are thinking and doing and care about

711
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:06,640
Was also very telling because when I walked around there it was like I was kind of at a Linux conference like people knew me and I didn't know who they were

712
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:15,640
You know that awkward kind of like you know me and I don't know you but you know me that's weird and that was the Microsoft office

713
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:24,640
And I walked away from that and I brought my wife with me and I walked away and I remember talking to her and I'm like this isn't the Microsoft that I grew up with

714
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:29,640
Now we can all just circle up hold hands sing kubaya and just beat up on Oracle

715
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:36,640
Amen
