WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
Now that Wimpy's here, and he's got an audio setup working, and Popey's here, right?

00:03.760 --> 00:04.760
Popey, you still here?

00:04.760 --> 00:05.760
Or did you leave?

00:05.760 --> 00:06.760
What an asshole.

00:06.760 --> 00:07.760
Maybe.

00:07.760 --> 00:08.760
Oh, okay.

00:08.760 --> 00:11.320
So, I saw some shenanigans on Google+.

00:11.320 --> 00:12.760
I don't know if you guys are familiar with this.

00:12.760 --> 00:15.920
It's a super-secret social network that apparently nobody knows about.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.920
Yeah, that's the first town I had.

00:17.920 --> 00:18.920
Yeah, that's what I've told.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.320
Yeah, there's no one on it.

00:20.320 --> 00:24.240
But just some guy on there, Alan something or other, Pope something or other, posted

00:24.240 --> 00:28.840
a link about a super-retro installer that reminded me of the good old days.

00:28.840 --> 00:34.160
And then I dug a little deeper, and I discovered there is a brand new edition of Ubuntu Mate

00:34.160 --> 00:40.400
in the works, but it's not based on like 1504 or some shenanigans like that.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.420
No, friends, it's based on 1404.

00:43.420 --> 00:47.120
What the heck's going on here, guys?

00:47.120 --> 00:48.120
People want it.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.120
It's as simple as that.

00:49.120 --> 00:52.780
Just giving them what they need.

00:52.780 --> 00:56.880
Since we started this, the number one thing that everyone's been asking for is when is

00:56.880 --> 00:59.360
there going to be an LTS version.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.480
People want to install it and forget about it.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.480
Set it and forget it.

01:02.480 --> 01:09.440
And then after that, it'll be 1004, then 804, then 606 Mate edition.

01:09.440 --> 01:12.640
Wait, isn't 804 already basically Mate?

01:12.640 --> 01:13.640
Yeah.

01:13.640 --> 01:14.640
That's interesting.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.240
So I guess, boy, huh?

01:16.240 --> 01:17.240
Look at that.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.240
What's wrong with this picture?

01:18.240 --> 01:22.200
It sounds like you're listening to your users.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.200
I know.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.200
I know.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.200
I actually pay attention to what they say.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.200
Well, actually, yeah.

01:26.200 --> 01:32.200
I was listening to the user, the guy who comes in and says, I would like 1404.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.200
That guy?

01:33.200 --> 01:34.200
We're making a distro just for him.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.200
No, that's awesome.

01:35.200 --> 01:38.200
Thousands of people would have asked for this.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.200
I'm kidding.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.200
No, that's good, though.

01:40.200 --> 01:45.840
I think it also shows that people are all in on the LTS model, which is-

01:45.840 --> 01:46.840
Yeah, it really does.

01:46.840 --> 01:47.840
Exactly.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.720
Especially on Ubuntu, that's what wins.

01:49.720 --> 01:53.360
But actually, 1404 is quite an evolution on 1410.

01:53.360 --> 01:58.560
So I think this 1404 release is going to be what 1410 should have been, a lot of new features

01:58.560 --> 01:59.560
and a lot of fixes.

01:59.560 --> 02:00.560
Really?

02:00.560 --> 02:02.600
So in some ways, it's more of a newer version?

02:02.600 --> 02:04.200
It is a newer version.

02:04.200 --> 02:09.000
So for example, in the 1404 version, there's indicator support.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.680
So you can add indicators in there now.

02:11.680 --> 02:17.060
And we've pulled in all the latest Mate packages from Debbie and Jesse.

02:17.060 --> 02:18.760
So there's a number of updates there.

02:18.760 --> 02:23.160
And then I've been working with all the guys from the Accessible Computing Foundation.

02:23.160 --> 02:27.040
And we have fixed everything that they've reported that didn't work with regards to

02:27.040 --> 02:28.040
accessibility.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.120
So for them, this is a big deal.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.120
This is freaking brilliant.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.120
Yeah, yeah.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.120
I like it.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.120
It seems backwards.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.120
And I think it's better.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.480
Yeah, it is backwards in a sense.

02:37.480 --> 02:38.480
I'm good with it.

02:38.480 --> 02:39.480
And you know what else?

02:39.480 --> 02:42.920
Like the Mate desktop environment is perfect for something you can set and forget for a

02:42.920 --> 02:43.920
long time.

02:43.920 --> 02:49.440
Because it's very much like of a time that is sort of already established, right?

02:49.440 --> 02:50.540
So it's like perfect for that.

02:50.540 --> 02:52.640
I think it's the coolest thing.

02:52.640 --> 02:57.600
And I've just come back from a weekend in Germany where I've been at the X2GO gathering,

02:57.600 --> 03:02.400
where the Mate desktop is very popular amongst them for deployment of remote terminal services.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.400
Oh, really?

03:03.400 --> 03:06.400
Boy, I've been wanting to do a segment on X2GO for a little while now.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.520
Well, okay.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.000
If you look at X2GO, there's a couple of new features.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.320
They've got this new layer called telekinesis.

03:13.320 --> 03:17.240
And then they've developed this mTelePlayer.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.780
And that is stonking.

03:18.780 --> 03:25.760
So this is a tool that's been developed for doing real time streaming of audio and video

03:25.760 --> 03:27.840
through the remote terminal services.

03:27.840 --> 03:36.360
And the demo I saw this weekend was a dual screen with full 4K video streaming over a

03:36.360 --> 03:38.120
remote terminal desktop.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.120
And it was stunning.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.120
Wow.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.120
That is slick.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.120
Going to check it out.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.120
Yeah.

03:43.120 --> 03:47.660
And this has been developed because there's a company that's trying to develop some sort

03:47.660 --> 03:54.400
of set top box type devices for use in China for delivering streaming video services.

03:54.400 --> 03:59.800
And they're doing it by bringing the whole desktop application to the client rather than

03:59.800 --> 04:02.560
just the streaming video.

04:02.560 --> 04:03.840
That's going to be exciting.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.000
I've played with some of that stuff.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.360
And it works surprisingly well even a few years ago.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.360
Yeah.

04:09.360 --> 04:10.640
Well, it's hot rocking now.

04:10.640 --> 04:11.640
I'm really impressed.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.480
I didn't know much about it until this weekend.

04:13.480 --> 04:17.160
And I came away thinking, yeah, this is something I really need to get more involved in.

04:17.160 --> 04:23.040
So I've already started adding some integration pieces for X2Go into Marte.

04:23.040 --> 04:24.320
All right.

04:24.320 --> 04:29.880
Wimpy, just before you wrap up, Chris, there's a question in the IRC.

04:29.880 --> 04:35.200
One of the JB Live listeners is asking, can you turn a standard Ubuntu 14.04 install with

04:35.200 --> 04:38.440
a PPA into a Marte 14.04, do you think?

04:38.440 --> 04:39.440
You can.

04:39.440 --> 04:43.240
And there's a blog article I posted on the Ubuntu Marte website that explains how to

04:43.240 --> 04:44.240
do it.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.240
Boom.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.240
Nice.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.240
Yeah.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.240
That's exciting.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.240
I think it's almost new.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.240
It's not as good as the real thing, though.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.240
Wait for the ISO.

04:51.240 --> 04:52.240
It's coming out at the weekend.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.240
That's what you want to use.

04:53.240 --> 04:59.440
Boy, isn't it interesting how the Mateo edition, in a way, is sort of eschewing so much of

04:59.440 --> 05:01.960
the trendy, like, it's different.

05:01.960 --> 05:07.080
It's pushing it forward and introducing a lot of new stuff and making users happy.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.680
But it's not chasing the shiny, right?

05:10.680 --> 05:12.800
It's a different kind of pushing it forward.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.480
And it's really cool to see it.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.440
So the LTS makes so much sense in that context.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.440
I think that's really exciting.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.120
It really appeals to me.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.120
I like it.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.120
Yeah.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.120
That's exactly it.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.120
I'm thinking Skype machines.

05:25.120 --> 05:29.040
You want to install the 14.04 version because you know how you like to wait a couple of

05:29.040 --> 05:30.960
months for all the bugs to get wrangled out.

05:30.960 --> 05:31.960
I do.

05:31.960 --> 05:35.640
Well, curiously, it's that backstep to 14.04 that's got all the stability and fixes in

05:35.640 --> 05:36.920
it that you'll be waiting for.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.400
So that's the one you want to install.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.400
Nice.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.400
Yeah, I'll check that out.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.920
14.04 install, just because it's going to get, like, hardware enablements for a while

05:43.920 --> 05:47.840
and I mean, so that's awesome.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.800
It's brilliant for running Steam as well.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.800
Nice.

05:50.800 --> 05:51.800
Nice.

05:51.800 --> 05:52.800
Yeah.

05:52.800 --> 05:56.400
Or I was actually thinking it's probably the perfect Skype and Mumble rig always.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.400
Yes.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.400
Yeah.

05:58.400 --> 06:04.520
That's what I'm using exactly that now, 14.04 Ubuntu MATE with Mumble.

06:04.520 --> 06:05.520
It all works fine.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.520
I have a random question.

06:06.520 --> 06:12.320
Do you guys know of any, we've been playing with a couple of different packages, VSXU,

06:12.320 --> 06:13.920
I think is one of them, something like that.

06:13.920 --> 06:18.880
I'm looking for something that will monitor your default line in and do a full screen

06:18.880 --> 06:21.520
real time, like, waveform visualizer.

06:21.520 --> 06:25.160
Almost like, you know, like the old classic Winamp or iTunes plug-ins.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.380
Maybe not something as gaudy.

06:26.380 --> 06:28.380
Maybe something that's just a straightforward waveform.

06:28.380 --> 06:32.380
So like right now in this show, we have the chat room up on the screen, but from time

06:32.380 --> 06:34.740
to time, we might want to have a show that's not live.

06:34.740 --> 06:37.200
So we wouldn't have a chat room to put up there, so we were thinking, but it's an audio

06:37.200 --> 06:41.740
only show, it would be neat to have the waveform as we talk and I'd love to have a Linux box

06:41.740 --> 06:46.780
that just has whatever is coming in on the default in, visualized, that I can then capture

06:46.780 --> 06:51.480
and put that into our video recording.

06:51.480 --> 06:55.440
I believe there is, and I will look at that while the show is going on.

06:55.440 --> 06:56.440
Cool.

06:56.440 --> 06:57.440
Yeah.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.440
Maybe you mentioned the post-show or something, because I've looked at a few of them and like

06:59.440 --> 07:03.760
we really need something that would be kind of full screen, something that's attractive

07:03.760 --> 07:06.340
and something that doesn't require, like a lot of them I looked at will play your music

07:06.340 --> 07:13.440
collection or things like that.

07:13.440 --> 07:17.800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's powered by deep philosophical

07:17.800 --> 07:18.800
discussions.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.680
I don't even know what that means, but I'm going to go with it.

07:21.680 --> 07:22.680
My name is Chris.

07:22.680 --> 07:23.880
And my name is Matt.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.480
I guess it'd be philosophical discussions.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.480
I was trying to come up with a new term and I had nothing, Matt.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.480
Nothing.

07:28.480 --> 07:29.640
You were kind of morphing with the words.

07:29.640 --> 07:30.640
I felt it though.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.000
That's what I get for doing a cold open.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.800
Well, 65, episode 65, and we've got a big show.

07:35.800 --> 07:40.040
We got some follow up on the OpenSUSE review, plus some new news and developments there.

07:40.040 --> 07:43.760
Producer Eric, he's become like our local OpenSUSE advocate.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.760
He's been running it.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.040
He's switched to Tumbleweed.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.200
He's even rolling the good stuff now.

07:48.200 --> 07:52.000
And he's got some follow up notes from our review, so we'll cover that.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.280
There's a new device, an open source hardware device that promises to replace all password

07:57.280 --> 07:58.280
managers.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.720
I think we can talk about that a little bit.

08:00.720 --> 08:08.040
And then one of our brothers has fallen, one of our fellow podcasts is coming to an end.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.240
And we'll spend a little time talking about that.

08:10.240 --> 08:16.400
And maybe what the root, the cause of that, and if it's a problem that's going to spread.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.840
We'll discuss that in the show today too.

08:17.840 --> 08:18.840
Plus lots of feedback, Matt.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.720
So man, we got a whole big show.

08:20.720 --> 08:24.120
I got like 15 tabs open right now.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.120
You know what I need, Matt?

08:25.120 --> 08:26.680
I need something like tab groups.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.600
Just imagine if I could group all of my tabs together.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.040
Too bad Chrome doesn't support that, huh?

08:32.040 --> 08:33.040
That's really a shame.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.800
I was waiting for that to dig in.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.960
I guess there's just no way to do that.

08:36.960 --> 08:37.960
Anyways.

08:37.960 --> 08:38.960
Oh, boy.

08:38.960 --> 08:39.960
Hey, mumble room.

08:39.960 --> 08:40.960
How are you guys doing?

08:40.960 --> 08:47.960
You know, I was actually waiting for that discussion to happen at some point, ever since

08:47.960 --> 08:48.960
I became a producer.

08:48.960 --> 08:49.960
I don't know.

08:49.960 --> 08:50.960
Is that something Firefox does?

08:50.960 --> 08:53.960
Oh, that's good to know.

08:53.960 --> 08:54.960
Yeah.

08:54.960 --> 08:55.960
Yeah.

08:55.960 --> 09:01.080
Well, that was a heated discussion we had on the pre-show where the entire mumble room

09:01.080 --> 09:03.840
ganged up on me and tried to get me to switch to Firefox.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.960
But I believe I emerged unswitched, although still considering.

09:07.960 --> 09:08.960
I have tried it before.

09:08.960 --> 09:09.960
I may try it again.

09:09.960 --> 09:10.960
You never know.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.360
Like sometimes I walk away and I'm like, I'm never switching.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.000
And then a couple of days go by and you know, I'm going to switch.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.320
I'll take a challenge.

09:16.320 --> 09:24.560
So if you're inspired to take a Firefox challenge, you know what, all right, all right.

09:24.560 --> 09:25.560
I'll do it.

09:25.560 --> 09:26.560
I'll take it.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.560
I'll take it.

09:27.560 --> 09:28.560
I'll take it.

09:28.560 --> 09:29.560
I'll take it.

09:29.560 --> 09:30.560
I'll take it.

09:30.560 --> 09:31.560
I'll take it.

09:31.560 --> 09:32.560
You just convinced yourself.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.560
Yeah, I just did.

09:33.560 --> 09:34.560
I just, I literally.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.560
If you guys are wondering what the pool's going to be for how long, how many days he

09:35.560 --> 09:36.560
does this, I'll start one later.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.560
Yes, I just flip flopped right here on air.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.560
All right, Popeye, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going in with you, Popeye.

09:39.560 --> 09:42.880
I'm going to take, starting tonight, I'm going to start taking the Firefox challenge.

09:42.880 --> 09:49.200
So if anybody out there at home is listening and is ready to switch back to Firefox or

09:49.200 --> 09:54.160
switch to Firefox from something, maybe it's Chrome, maybe it's Internet Explorer.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.360
I'm going to start tonight.

09:55.360 --> 09:58.880
So start with me and we'll see if we make it to the next Linux unplug.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.260
That's my benchmark.

10:00.260 --> 10:04.840
And I'll tell you upfront, I'm concerned about UI leginess, inadequate syncing, and a lack

10:04.840 --> 10:08.880
of appropriate markdown extensions, primarily template, which is the name of the extension,

10:08.880 --> 10:12.600
which is extremely hard to Google when the template extension is called template.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.920
Anyways, you know what the most important thing is, Chris, is that as long as you can

10:15.920 --> 10:19.280
go ahead and watch Netflix in it without any problems, you're golden.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.280
Oh wait, that's right.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.280
You can't.

10:21.280 --> 10:27.000
And by the way, if I have problems with Firefox, the answer coming back is, well, you should

10:27.000 --> 10:30.200
submit a bug is not going to be acceptable when there's an alternative that does the

10:30.200 --> 10:31.200
things.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.880
Anyways, moving on from that, we'll do a, we'll do follow up in next week's episode.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.600
And so if anybody out there wants to take the Firefox challenge with me, let's start

10:37.600 --> 10:38.600
tonight.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.880
In the meantime, and Popeye, how long are you going to do it for?

10:40.880 --> 10:43.200
Are you going to go try to make it till next week or are you just going to keep going as

10:43.200 --> 10:44.200
long as possible?

10:44.200 --> 10:46.640
I'll, I'll try and last longer than you.

10:46.640 --> 10:49.480
Let's have a little competition, shall we?

10:49.480 --> 10:51.480
You know, so wait a minute.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.480
Okay.

10:52.480 --> 10:53.480
Are you, are you going to try to make, okay.

10:53.480 --> 10:54.480
All right.

10:54.480 --> 10:55.480
Fine.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.480
Popey.

10:56.480 --> 10:57.480
No, wait, no, I can't do it.

10:57.480 --> 10:58.480
I can't do it.

10:58.480 --> 10:59.480
Cause I have show prep stuff that you don't have to do.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.480
You don't have to worry about the markdown stuff like I worry about.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.480
All right.

11:01.480 --> 11:05.760
I'll tell you what, I'm going to try to get it to next week.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.480
Show prep is going to take longer and I have a lot of shows.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.480
All right.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.520
I'll get to it till next week and then if I can keep going, I'll be like Kramer driving

11:12.520 --> 11:13.520
on empty.

11:13.520 --> 11:17.040
I'll keep on going as long as I possibly can until I run out of fuel in the, in the Firefox

11:17.040 --> 11:18.040
tank.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.040
I'll check it on you.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.040
Okay.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.040
And rotten corpse.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.040
You're going to take a challenge too.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.040
Yeah.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.040
I'll take the operium challenge.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.040
Okay.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.040
You know what?

11:26.040 --> 11:27.720
I'm younger than all of you.

11:27.720 --> 11:28.920
I better stamina.

11:28.920 --> 11:32.240
So I will try to last the longest on the Firefox.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.480
What are you on right now?

11:34.480 --> 11:35.480
I'm on Chrome of course.

11:35.480 --> 11:36.480
Okay.

11:36.480 --> 11:37.480
Good.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.480
All right.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.480
Okay.

11:39.480 --> 11:40.480
Good.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.480
All right.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.800
So we've got, we've got, we've got a, we've got a genuine masters of our own domain competition

11:43.800 --> 11:44.800
here.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.800
I like.

11:45.800 --> 11:46.800
Oh hell I'll join.

11:46.800 --> 11:51.280
Ooh, can you install Firefox on openSUSE so they got a repo for that, Eric?

11:51.280 --> 11:52.280
Don't need a repo.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.280
It's in the main.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.280
Oh, is that how that works?

11:56.280 --> 11:57.280
All right.

11:57.280 --> 12:01.840
Uh, so David from Alabama writes in and uh, he says, save me from unity.

12:01.840 --> 12:02.840
Sorry guys.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.560
For those of you who love unity, don't take offense, but he'll, he, he breaks it down

12:05.560 --> 12:06.560
here.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.560
He says, what's up guys?

12:07.560 --> 12:10.680
I love all the JB shows, especially last foe and unplugged.

12:10.680 --> 12:11.680
I'm a football coach.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.760
And he says, yes, insert your dumb jock joke here.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.760
Hey, jocks are allowed in Linux.

12:16.760 --> 12:17.760
Just us.

12:17.760 --> 12:18.760
It's fine.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.600
I mean, we might just resent you a little bit, but your totes allowed.

12:20.600 --> 12:21.600
Uh, no, I kid.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.920
Uh, but really, he says, I like Linux and I listen to you guys on my way to work on

12:24.920 --> 12:26.440
my Nexus 5.

12:26.440 --> 12:29.080
Even though a lot of what you guys talk about tends to be over my head.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.080
I learn a lot.

12:30.080 --> 12:34.000
I noticed that you said Borderlands 2 and Borderlands the pre-sequel have come to Linux.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.520
So I downloaded both on my Ubuntu 14.04 box.

12:38.520 --> 12:42.440
I have the Nvidia proprietary drivers installed and my hardware specs are pretty good.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.800
I got a GTX 750 TI.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.540
It's got an AMD FX 8320 CPU.

12:48.540 --> 12:52.720
Everything seems groovy under Ubuntu, but he's just, he's not liking Unity.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.240
It's not working for him.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.340
He says, I just don't find it aesthetically pleasing for myself.

12:57.340 --> 12:58.380
So I loaded Gnome.

12:58.380 --> 13:04.800
I like it a lot, but when he plays games in full screen in Gnome, he notices there's like

13:04.800 --> 13:06.260
a screen tearing effect.

13:06.260 --> 13:12.040
He said under Unity, he used compass settings manager to disable full screen rendering or

13:12.040 --> 13:18.360
what's it called, the unidirectional, unredirected full screen applications is what the checkbox

13:18.360 --> 13:19.980
is called in compass manager.

13:19.980 --> 13:23.160
So he did that for Unity, but now there's no such setting under Gnome.

13:23.160 --> 13:29.260
So I'm not totally sure that the screen tearing he's seen under Gnome is due to any compositing,

13:29.260 --> 13:31.240
but I thought maybe we could punt it to the mumble room.

13:31.240 --> 13:34.660
Maybe there's been some folks in here that have trouble shot this kind of stuff.

13:34.660 --> 13:37.800
Any ideas for what could be causing screen tearing on his 3D games?

13:37.800 --> 13:40.840
Well, by chance, did he say what kind of game it was?

13:40.840 --> 13:41.840
Borderlands.

13:41.840 --> 13:42.840
I'm assuming it's Borderlands.

13:42.840 --> 13:46.520
And it's an Nvidia graphics card with the proprietary driver.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.680
And I was wondering if it could be a V-Sync issue.

13:49.680 --> 13:50.680
Me too.

13:50.680 --> 13:51.680
It sounds like it.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.680
Yeah.

13:52.680 --> 13:57.200
Sorry, this cropped up on the Ubuntu Marte community a couple of days ago and somebody

13:57.200 --> 13:58.520
actually found a fix for it.

13:58.520 --> 14:01.200
So if you give me a minute, I'll go and find the solution.

14:01.200 --> 14:06.520
There's a similar problem in XFCE with its compositor turned on, causes a lot of screen

14:06.520 --> 14:07.520
tearing.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.520
You can get rid of that by using Compton, I believe it is.

14:10.520 --> 14:11.520
Yeah.

14:11.520 --> 14:19.840
And I'm not positive because I've been essentially the same setup, Gnome 3, Nvidia graphics card.

14:19.840 --> 14:24.200
I think mine's, I've tried it on a 600 series and a 700 series graphics card.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.240
Full screen, Borderlands.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.280
I don't have any tearing on my local screen.

14:28.280 --> 14:31.440
I actually sometimes get tearing on capture because it's sending an interlaced signal

14:31.440 --> 14:32.440
out.

14:32.440 --> 14:35.560
But on my local LCD panel, no tearing.

14:35.560 --> 14:38.280
And I cannot remember if V-Sync plays a role in this.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.480
I seem to remember it does.

14:40.480 --> 14:44.900
So if anybody has any suggestions too, you could also put it in the comment sections

14:44.900 --> 14:45.900
for the feedback.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.280
I'm reading the chat room right now.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.280
Floppy Bacon says GLX blank is the option.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.280
Check for that.

14:51.280 --> 14:52.700
GLX V blank.

14:52.700 --> 14:53.700
Look for that.

14:53.700 --> 14:54.700
So yeah.

14:54.700 --> 14:59.520
And if you do find it, you can drop it in the chat room or if you're listening after

14:59.520 --> 15:00.760
the fact in the subreddit.

15:00.760 --> 15:07.360
I believe the Arch subreddit has something about that with graphics in particular.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.360
Okay.

15:08.360 --> 15:09.360
Yeah.

15:09.360 --> 15:15.520
And I know like Cinnamon 2.4, which was just released last week, one of the things that

15:15.520 --> 15:19.920
they enabled by default is when an application goes full screen, the compositor disabled

15:19.920 --> 15:20.920
is disabled.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.880
Kaywin does this as well.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.000
My understanding is though Mudder does as well.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.480
But I'm not sure.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.680
And I have not noticed the problem myself.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.680
Okay.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.400
Next email comes in from Les.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.920
So we just heard about a hardware woe.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.120
Les wants to take the other track.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.240
In fact, he thinks maybe we don't do this often enough.

15:38.240 --> 15:41.920
He says, hey Chris, Matt in the mumble room, in a recent episode of Linux Unplugged, there

15:41.920 --> 15:45.800
was discussion about a laptop that had a graphics issue when booting Linux.

15:45.800 --> 15:50.040
Chris made a comment that he was disappointed these kinds of things are happening still.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.360
I think as a Linux community, we beat ourselves up about this far too much.

15:53.360 --> 15:57.880
Yes, there is occasional problems, but as a community, we focus on these problems, often

15:57.880 --> 16:01.880
cite them as reasons why Linux is unsuccessful on the desktop even.

16:01.880 --> 16:04.560
But to counter this, I wanted to mention my recent experience.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.000
I bought a Samsung laptop.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.120
I use it for testing and have had no problems installing Ubuntu, elementary, or even OpenBSD.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.760
With the exception of a binary driver for Wi-Fi and OpenBSD, everything works out of

16:14.760 --> 16:18.200
the box, including graphics and power management sleep mode.

16:18.200 --> 16:22.000
Last week though, I had the need for a Windows 7 system.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.080
So as the laptop originally came with it, I installed a fresh copy of Windows 7.

16:26.080 --> 16:30.120
After the install, the graphics were terrible and on inspection, Windows had failed to identify

16:30.120 --> 16:32.240
nine items of hardware.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.960
This included both the wired and wireless NICs.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.960
I then had to spend a whole evening first trying to get my NIC working and then trying

16:37.960 --> 16:39.480
to track down the drivers.

16:39.480 --> 16:44.800
I had many hours of searching using Samsung's tool, only to find six of the nine drivers.

16:44.800 --> 16:49.320
After many hours, I finally got it all working using another detection tool from Intel that

16:49.320 --> 16:51.920
identified some of my chipset.

16:51.920 --> 16:56.080
Then when the system finally restarted after installing everything, it all ended with the

16:56.080 --> 16:58.640
blue screen of death loop.

16:58.640 --> 17:02.240
At that point, I gave up and just installed Ubuntu Mate edition, which of course worked

17:02.240 --> 17:03.240
perfectly.

17:03.240 --> 17:04.240
Sorry for the long story.

17:04.240 --> 17:07.240
But I think it's important that we recognize it's far worse than other platforms and maybe

17:07.240 --> 17:09.400
we should focus on the positives a bit more.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.240
Linux hardware detection is pretty good.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.800
I remember the days of Red Hat 4.x.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.160
Keep up the great work and stay positive, Les.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.160
Isn't he right?

17:17.160 --> 17:18.160
He's really right.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.160
Yeah, I would agree.

17:19.160 --> 17:20.160
I would definitely agree.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.160
It's gotten so much better.

17:21.160 --> 17:25.760
And then out of the box, the only system that is better than hardware detection out of the

17:25.760 --> 17:28.480
box is OS X because you can only install it on Macs.

17:28.480 --> 17:33.120
But as soon as you try to put it on anything else, it is a full-fledged train wreck.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.840
And Windows is just as bad.

17:34.840 --> 17:39.920
You get lucky with the Windows box if your NIC's detected and it's semi-older hardware,

17:39.920 --> 17:43.800
like it's in that Windows sweet spot, it'll pull down a lot of it, but nothing matches

17:43.800 --> 17:44.800
Linux with the diversity.

17:44.800 --> 17:45.800
Right?

17:45.800 --> 17:46.800
I mean, nothing.

17:46.800 --> 17:47.800
That's true.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.840
I mean, I remember back in the repair days, you always had that spare NIC that you kept

17:50.840 --> 17:53.760
on hand so that when you repaired someone's computer and you knew you were going to have

17:53.760 --> 17:58.200
to chase down those drivers, you had a means of connecting to the internet to do so.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.640
That was a definite interesting time.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.640
And yeah, Linux really solves those problems.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.080
I mean, legacy peripherals are even a better example.

18:05.080 --> 18:09.600
Derek Devlin, do you suppose that we sometimes focus on the negative stuff because we're

18:09.600 --> 18:10.600
problem solvers?

18:10.600 --> 18:13.320
We want to analyze the problem and try to fix it?

18:13.320 --> 18:14.320
Totally.

18:14.320 --> 18:20.960
And I think this non-acceptance of something still missing or something not working is

18:20.960 --> 18:26.640
what puts us in the position we are really.

18:26.640 --> 18:31.840
And I think we actually should keep that mentality, is that we'll keep improving Linux.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.800
But Windows folks, which stabilize, look, they're dying.

18:35.800 --> 18:40.560
Eric, have you ever had that experience where you pull a drive from one Linux rig and move

18:40.560 --> 18:43.440
it over to another machine and plug it in and it actually boots up?

18:43.440 --> 18:45.040
Yes, I have.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.040
It's brilliant.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.920
It just automatically, the kernel knows what it's doing.

18:48.920 --> 18:54.040
It detects the hardware, configures the machine for that hardware, and boom, you're done.

18:54.040 --> 18:59.360
I actually, not exactly moving a drive from one machine to another, but using Clonezilla

18:59.360 --> 19:03.400
to clone an entire disk from one disk to another.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.440
And it just works.

19:05.440 --> 19:09.400
It works better than Windows and a lot better than Mac.

19:09.400 --> 19:13.040
Yeah, Windows will just blue screen if the controller changes too much.

19:13.040 --> 19:16.040
And Wimpy, you've got some experience with moving the hard drives around to do an install,

19:16.040 --> 19:17.040
right?

19:17.040 --> 19:20.680
Yeah, I mean, I've got some really ancient hardware.

19:20.680 --> 19:24.640
And back in the day, I used to install the operating system, I used to take the hard

19:24.640 --> 19:31.200
disk out of a laptop that had no NICs and had no Wi-Fi and had no USB and put the disk

19:31.200 --> 19:36.320
in a different machine, install Debian, then take the disk out, plug it into the laptop

19:36.320 --> 19:40.280
and then boot and configure everything and install the desktop I wanted.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.120
And I was doing that back in the late 1990s.

19:43.120 --> 19:46.520
So it's been possible for a long, long time.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.440
Yeah, it's just so cool.

19:49.440 --> 19:53.280
It is, I think, one of the best aspects that Linux doesn't get credit for anymore.

19:53.280 --> 20:00.400
And I think there was a time where the Roses were not as red, but it's pretty awesome and

20:00.400 --> 20:05.220
something that really sells people when you show them, like, yeah, this USB thumbstick,

20:05.220 --> 20:08.680
I can just boot your computer with this and everything just works.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.440
And it just blows people's minds still.

20:10.440 --> 20:15.400
All right, Aaron writes in, I like Aaron, I like the way he thinks, he says, I'd like

20:15.400 --> 20:19.800
to hear more about your latest experience with ButterFS and why you switched to XFS.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.640
Where's the love for good old Extended 4?

20:21.640 --> 20:27.680
I'm running OpenSUSE a factory, soon to be Tumbleweed, and I was affected by the ButterFS

20:27.680 --> 20:32.760
read-only snapshot bug after upgrading from kernel 3.16 to 3.17.

20:32.760 --> 20:37.560
So for now, I've disabled snapshots by uninstalling Snapper and the Snapper Zipper plugin.

20:37.560 --> 20:41.200
Thankfully, the damage seems to be limited to some corrupted snapshots.

20:41.200 --> 20:45.360
Hopefully, when the bug is fixed, the snapshots can be re-enabled and my two dozen corrupted

20:45.360 --> 20:47.080
snapshots can be deleted.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.920
I don't want to go Nuke and Pave style, but if it's necessary, I may go back to Extended

20:50.920 --> 20:51.920
4.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.820
From there, I can at least upgrade to ButterFS when it becomes a little more stable.

20:55.820 --> 21:02.520
So I want to talk about, over the weekend, I finally reloaded my Bonobo Extreme that

21:02.520 --> 21:07.000
was the original install since our Arch Challenge, that I was pretty proud that I held that install

21:07.000 --> 21:08.080
that long.

21:08.080 --> 21:10.120
And it was really, really a great install.

21:10.120 --> 21:14.080
The only problem was, I was totally out of storage space.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.800
Like I couldn't install any more games, it even got to the point where I was having a

21:16.800 --> 21:22.120
hard time, like I couldn't do any more VirtualBox images for demos for LAS, I couldn't install

21:22.120 --> 21:26.120
some of the apps I wanted to install to demo on LAS, so it was actually starting to impact

21:26.120 --> 21:27.240
show production.

21:27.240 --> 21:33.920
So when I really realized I was hitting that phase of the install, I decided to Nuke it.

21:33.920 --> 21:38.920
And I used Angros, Antaragos, Antardos to install it.

21:38.920 --> 21:40.780
And it's been rocking.

21:40.780 --> 21:44.800
And I decided to go this time around, XFS instead of ButterFS.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.000
Even though I was so tempted, you guys, I was so tempted.

21:48.000 --> 21:53.040
But it was really the discussion that we had had here in the Mumble Room at some point,

21:53.040 --> 21:58.560
where so many people were really advocating XFS, that I decided to pull the trigger on

21:58.560 --> 21:59.560
that.

21:59.560 --> 22:05.800
And my main problem with ButterFS came down to just the fact that DF doesn't actually

22:05.800 --> 22:10.440
report the file sizes isn't a huge deal, but it was like, it just really gnawed at me that

22:10.440 --> 22:16.040
I never really felt like I had a super clear snapshot of what my storage situation was.

22:16.040 --> 22:19.080
And it was slowly getting worse and worse over time.

22:19.080 --> 22:25.200
And so, because I have, in my Bonobo, I have a 128GB SSD for my home drive, and I have

22:25.200 --> 22:32.160
a 256GB SSD that I slice up amongst my main Arch installation, another distro that I'm

22:32.160 --> 22:35.840
trying, and like all of the applications and anything like that.

22:35.840 --> 22:40.800
So it's kind of a tight operating margin, and with ButterFS just sort of fudging the

22:40.800 --> 22:44.560
extra metadata and things like that, it just became too expensive.

22:44.560 --> 22:50.720
And I don't even remember, I can't remember if it was Blaster or if it was Wimpy who was

22:50.720 --> 22:53.960
really advocating XFS so strongly, but somebody sold me on it.

22:53.960 --> 22:58.240
And I was an old XFS user from years back as a sysadmin, so I'd had some experiences,

22:58.240 --> 23:02.400
it seemed to be a good file system when I used it.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.520
Anybody in here a big XFS user?

23:03.520 --> 23:04.680
Who was that?

23:04.680 --> 23:05.680
It was me.

23:05.680 --> 23:09.640
Okay, Wimpy, so do you remember the bullet points of sort of what your main points were

23:09.640 --> 23:11.560
for me to switch, because you convinced me.

23:11.560 --> 23:17.200
Yeah, well I went through something similar when I had a disk fail recently, and what

23:17.200 --> 23:18.320
I've done is slightly different.

23:18.320 --> 23:24.720
I've kept ButterFS for the root file system, but I'm using XFS for the home partition,

23:24.720 --> 23:28.440
for the reasons that you've just outlined.

23:28.440 --> 23:36.160
Toolbox machines and large files, ButterFS was, I couldn't seem to rebalance it to get

23:36.160 --> 23:39.160
the space back, I don't know where it had gone, but it wasn't letting me have it.

23:39.160 --> 23:43.880
And I knew full well that there wasn't as much data on the device as it was claiming

23:43.880 --> 23:44.880
was there.

23:44.880 --> 23:45.880
That was my situation as well.

23:45.880 --> 23:46.880
So that's why I made the switch.

23:46.880 --> 23:52.080
But for me as an Arch developer, I want ButterFS on my root file system because I get all the

23:52.080 --> 23:57.400
benefit of ButterFS on the development tools, so that's where it pays off then.

23:57.400 --> 24:01.980
You know, I actually like the, it sounds crazy, I never thought I would become a fan of it,

24:01.980 --> 24:07.880
but the real time LZO compression on ButterFS worked excellent for me, performance was good,

24:07.880 --> 24:10.560
so I missed that, especially on an SSD.

24:10.560 --> 24:11.560
Yeah that is great.

24:11.560 --> 24:16.840
And then I've still got that on the root partition, so I've got those benefits at boot time.

24:16.840 --> 24:18.840
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.

24:18.840 --> 24:23.640
I was just, I felt so burned at the time that I thought, no I'm going to go XFS everywhere.

24:23.640 --> 24:24.640
Keep it simple.

24:24.640 --> 24:29.720
I typically use XFS everywhere, but on my Arch machines I'm sticking with ButterFS on

24:29.720 --> 24:30.720
the root partition.

24:30.720 --> 24:35.560
So the million dollar question was, why XFS over XT4?

24:35.560 --> 24:36.760
It's just brilliant.

24:36.760 --> 24:37.760
It's rock solid.

24:37.760 --> 24:45.000
It's been, it's a bit like Marte, you know, it's got a long heritage, it's super mature,

24:45.000 --> 24:50.680
it performs as well as or as close to everything else or exceeds some of the others, so you

24:50.680 --> 24:51.840
don't need to tweak it.

24:51.840 --> 24:57.800
All the defaults are tuned for performance and it's just bulletproof and if you want

24:57.800 --> 25:04.240
some ButterFS like facilities, then stick LVM underneath it and then you can snapshot

25:04.240 --> 25:05.240
it.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.240
Yeah, that's true.

25:06.240 --> 25:10.720
Yeah, for me it was sort of the antithesis to ButterFS, like it was going to something

25:10.720 --> 25:17.040
that was, I mean I literally deployed systems with XFS in the 90s, so I mean I've used it

25:17.040 --> 25:22.240
for a really long time and so I just trust it and after getting burned by something new,

25:22.240 --> 25:24.360
I think I went to the other extreme.

25:24.360 --> 25:28.400
Wizard, I know you had to mention about parallel writing, is that for ButterFS or is that another

25:28.400 --> 25:29.400
file system?

25:29.400 --> 25:30.400
No, that's XFS.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.400
Oh.

25:31.400 --> 25:37.200
XFS does do, it does a very good job at parallel writing at the same time.

25:37.200 --> 25:40.360
So you go and you have multiple files, you're writing them all at the same time, it'll go

25:40.360 --> 25:45.440
on and it'll actually split up and it'll write them in a very even way and still maintain

25:45.440 --> 25:47.480
a fairly decent speed.

25:47.480 --> 25:53.600
XFS is great if you don't want copy-on-write or if copy-on-write isn't a super big deal.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.600
Right.

25:54.600 --> 25:56.880
That was sort of, I think I remember from our discussion, it was sort of like you get

25:56.880 --> 26:01.680
a lot of benefits of ButterFS, a lot of optimizations I wanted from ButterFS, but if I don't want

26:01.680 --> 26:05.600
copy-on-write and I don't want compression, then might as well just go XFS.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.580
Yeah, it's absolutely wonderful.

26:07.580 --> 26:11.040
The only real thing that you'll hear from people and they're usually people that have

26:11.040 --> 26:17.760
been using XFS or used XFS in the very distant past was they'll go and they'll say, well,

26:17.760 --> 26:22.920
I had a brownout and this did weird things and I couldn't recover the file system.

26:22.920 --> 26:27.400
And you know, it's not a big deal, at least I don't see it as a big deal, and I wouldn't

26:27.400 --> 26:31.080
worry about it yourself just because you have a laptop battery, you know, and it's going

26:31.080 --> 26:33.120
to go and shut down.

26:33.120 --> 26:38.480
That truncating to zero bytes on files, that was fixed about 10 or 11 years ago.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.480
Exactly.

26:39.480 --> 26:40.480
It's old news.

26:40.480 --> 26:41.880
People still bring it up.

26:41.880 --> 26:47.160
But one other thing that kind of burned me about ButterFS was I realized maybe six, seven

26:47.160 --> 26:51.160
months into the game that there was a thing called defragmenting that I should be doing.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.160
Right?

26:52.160 --> 26:54.760
And Wimpy, that's not such a problem with XFS, is it?

26:54.760 --> 26:57.520
Yeah, XFS has got really brilliant defrag tools.

26:57.520 --> 27:03.040
So you can do online defragmentation and it works really well and you know exactly where

27:03.040 --> 27:05.160
your data is being used.

27:05.160 --> 27:09.900
And for someone like you who will have large video files, you can defragment individual

27:09.900 --> 27:12.920
files rather than having to do the whole file system.

27:12.920 --> 27:18.520
So if you leave your laptop on overnight, just stick a cron job in there to do the XFS

27:18.520 --> 27:24.000
defrag on your partitions and it will just stay all nice and hunky-dory.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.120
And Wizard, do you have a comment on the XFS toolset?

27:27.120 --> 27:32.880
Yeah, the actual commands for going and doing stuff like repairing your file system, all

27:32.880 --> 27:39.200
this other stuff, you can use all the stuff that you're regularly used to, like fcsck.xfs.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.760
That was big for me too.

27:40.760 --> 27:41.760
Yeah.

27:41.760 --> 27:46.520
There's also, and if you're used to the ButterFest, you're like, oh, I want to use X program to

27:46.520 --> 27:47.520
deal with this.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.440
You can do that as well because almost every single one of them has a program of their

27:50.440 --> 27:54.840
own, like XFS repair, or they all have their own.

27:54.840 --> 27:59.640
And it's super simple, they're not crazy, you really can read a man page for once and

27:59.640 --> 28:00.640
know how it works.

28:00.640 --> 28:01.640
Right.

28:01.640 --> 28:02.640
That is very true.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.280
And Wimpy, we probably should make a mention because the chatroom is asking, XFS, as far

28:05.280 --> 28:07.120
as you know, supports Trim, right?

28:07.120 --> 28:08.120
It does, yeah.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.120
So there you go.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.800
And I remember one of the reasons I went ButterFest was, well, it's SSD optimized.

28:11.800 --> 28:16.960
When you look into the SSD optimizations, I think it's like they don't massage the access

28:16.960 --> 28:19.200
times, and it supports Trim and a few other things.

28:19.200 --> 28:24.360
And I realized when XFS can do that too, that was one of the deciding factors for me to

28:24.360 --> 28:25.360
choose ButterFest.

28:25.360 --> 28:28.240
It's like, this is the SSD ready file system.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.400
Actually the old dog XFS can do it too.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.880
So yeah, I thought, what the heck?

28:32.880 --> 28:34.560
So anyways, that was my thought process.

28:34.560 --> 28:38.140
Long and convoluted, and probably a lot of it was in pre and post shows.

28:38.140 --> 28:41.240
But it was a long series of discussions that brought us there.

28:41.240 --> 28:50.800
And I still have, let's see, one, two, three, four current production systems that are still

28:50.800 --> 28:52.240
running ButterFest.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.240
So it's not like I've switched.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.280
I just switched my main, my Bonobo.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.000
I haven't switched all my systems.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
And I still have a server running ButterFest.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Here's a question then.

29:00.000 --> 29:05.900
So you were obviously loathe to lose ButterFest and the compression from the performance point

29:05.900 --> 29:06.900
of view.

29:06.900 --> 29:10.440
Did you notice any performance degradation?

29:10.440 --> 29:11.440
You know, not really.

29:11.440 --> 29:14.880
But it's hard to tell when it's such a new install.

29:14.880 --> 29:15.880
Because my...

29:15.880 --> 29:17.880
So you really need to fill it up in a few months time and then call back.

29:17.880 --> 29:21.420
Yeah, I think as the drive gets fuller, I'll see if I start to notice it slowing down.

29:21.420 --> 29:25.540
You know, the interesting thing is this Bonobo is a couple of years old.

29:25.540 --> 29:30.980
And when I was setting up, I was like, wow, this, I really could not ask for this to be

29:30.980 --> 29:31.980
a faster computer.

29:31.980 --> 29:34.240
Like, this is still exceptionally fast.

29:34.240 --> 29:39.760
And so it seems like the current higher-end hardware for the last couple of years to throw

29:39.760 --> 29:41.920
at desktop Linux is more than sufficient.

29:41.920 --> 29:45.080
If you have an SSD and a decent processor, you get really good performance.

29:45.080 --> 29:47.440
So I don't know if I'll be able to tell the difference, to be honest.

29:47.440 --> 29:51.840
But I do feel like when ButterFest really filled up, like when I'd have a virtual machine

29:51.840 --> 29:55.160
that was sort of eating away at storage and I didn't realize how fast my drive space was

29:55.160 --> 30:00.840
ticking down because it was all happening inside a VM, I really felt like I could tell.

30:00.840 --> 30:06.320
It almost seemed like to me, I went down to like spinning hard drive speeds and it was

30:06.320 --> 30:07.320
painfully slow.

30:07.320 --> 30:11.840
Like having to watch like my directories like actually like load out and you know, all that

30:11.840 --> 30:13.320
just felt really slow.

30:13.320 --> 30:14.840
And the only thing that happened is I'd fill up the drive.

30:14.840 --> 30:18.640
And when I deleted the drive and rebalanced, the performance came back.

30:18.640 --> 30:19.840
So I don't know if that'll happen.

30:19.840 --> 30:22.680
I doubt that'll even happen in XFS.

30:22.680 --> 30:23.680
We'll see.

30:23.680 --> 30:25.480
Only find out after a little bit of usage.

30:25.480 --> 30:29.400
Hey, we're going to follow up on some of our OpenSUSE coverage, including producer Eric's

30:29.400 --> 30:30.400
notes.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.600
But before we do that, I want to thank our first sponsor, Linux Academy.

30:32.600 --> 30:38.160
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to get our 33% discount.

30:38.160 --> 30:39.240
And that's on your subscription.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.640
You're going to stay subscribed to Linux Academy once you go over there.

30:41.640 --> 30:46.240
I heard from a lot of folks at Ohio Linux Fest who've really been enjoying Linux Academy.

30:46.240 --> 30:50.600
And I just got a message from somebody last night that said their power was out.

30:50.600 --> 30:55.840
But they had downloaded Linux Academy's comprehensive study guides and the tutorials offline before

30:55.840 --> 30:56.840
the power went out.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.680
And they're still doing their study without the power.

30:58.680 --> 30:59.760
It's kind of incredible.

30:59.760 --> 31:02.480
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

31:02.480 --> 31:03.480
Check them out.

31:03.480 --> 31:06.360
They've got all the different distributions you could possibly want to try.

31:06.360 --> 31:07.360
You choose from those.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.080
They'll automatically adjust your courseware.

31:09.080 --> 31:12.260
They just added four more courses over the last week.

31:12.260 --> 31:14.260
It's a ton of new stuff coming out.

31:14.260 --> 31:17.240
They have stuff in the pipeline all through the remainder of the year.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.240
Go over there.

31:18.240 --> 31:22.040
You can learn anything you really could possibly imagine in the Linux system itself.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.800
And they're expanding beyond that into AWS, OpenStack, DevOps.

31:24.800 --> 31:29.480
You can go over there and get an introduction to Android development, introduction to VMware,

31:29.480 --> 31:30.480
VFXI.

31:30.480 --> 31:34.320
If you ended up having to support a VMware environment, go there and pull that down.

31:34.320 --> 31:37.320
And what's really nice is as you go through these courses, you can keep track of your

31:37.320 --> 31:38.320
progress.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.240
They'll give you estimations as you log back in and say, here's where you left off.

31:41.240 --> 31:42.440
Here's the index of where you're going to go.

31:42.440 --> 31:43.800
This is how long it's going to take.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.240
Here's the guide that goes with it.

31:45.240 --> 31:48.560
And they also have learning plans where you can set exactly how much availability you

31:48.560 --> 31:49.560
have.

31:49.560 --> 31:52.200
And they'll automatically adjust the courseware to match that availability.

31:52.200 --> 31:55.080
And they'll nudge you and say, hey, remember, you've got a test at the end of the week to

31:55.080 --> 31:57.400
keep you involved, to keep you going back.

31:57.400 --> 32:00.520
They've got an active support structure in their community as well, live streams where

32:00.520 --> 32:03.200
you can ask questions directly to the instructors.

32:03.200 --> 32:08.040
It's one of these things that you really don't understand until you go there and you engage

32:08.040 --> 32:10.000
in those resources that are available to you.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.960
You begin to move something forward.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.200
And it's very rewarding.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.840
I've been doing it now since they became a sponsor.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.920
Every week I go in there and I try something out.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.640
And it's very rewarding.

32:19.640 --> 32:20.960
It's intellectually stimulating.

32:20.960 --> 32:23.760
I'm able to see what new things interest me.

32:23.760 --> 32:26.320
And I'm able to stay current at a much deeper level.

32:26.320 --> 32:29.840
And so even though I'm not in the IT field anymore, I still find it to be an incredibly

32:29.840 --> 32:30.840
valuable resource.

32:30.840 --> 32:33.880
I could only imagine if I was still in IT how handy this would be.

32:33.880 --> 32:39.280
You can get a full end-to-end course on the LAMP stack, Apache self-signed SSLs, remote

32:39.280 --> 32:45.120
GUI administration set up on Linux, setting up an NFS server, NGINX, Nagios, backing up

32:45.120 --> 32:48.760
with rsync, taking care of the Heartbleed bug, all of that.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.240
They have scenario-based training too.

32:50.240 --> 32:54.360
So you can do some of these things in lab environments where you'll actually go end-to-end.

32:54.360 --> 32:57.480
You'll deploy the software, you'll deploy the application on top of that.

32:57.480 --> 32:59.520
You'll integrate in third-party services.

32:59.520 --> 33:03.440
You'll have a working product that's accessible from the public because as the courseware

33:03.440 --> 33:07.000
requires it, they automatically spin up Linux servers for you on the backend, give them

33:07.000 --> 33:10.720
public IP addresses, give you a login, you're going to sign them roles.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.800
It's a really cool system.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.340
People just go on and on about it when I meet them in person.

33:15.340 --> 33:16.340
It's awesome to hear that.

33:16.340 --> 33:21.200
So go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and keep sending in your success stories too.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.720
I really love hearing that.

33:22.720 --> 33:27.520
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a really big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

33:27.520 --> 33:29.600
the Linux Unplugged Show.

33:29.600 --> 33:34.240
Okay, so OpenSUSE as the version 13.2 is officially here.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.560
We got ourselves a new green baby.

33:36.560 --> 33:39.740
You can go over and get it at the OpenSUSE website.

33:39.740 --> 33:40.880
Lots of nice stuff in there.

33:40.880 --> 33:45.160
They've also given us the new deets on their new rolling setup.

33:45.160 --> 33:48.560
And so I thought we'd talk to producer Eric and anybody in the Mumble Room that's up and

33:48.560 --> 33:50.040
running OpenSUSE.

33:50.040 --> 33:53.280
Do some follow up from our review, touch on a couple of items.

33:53.280 --> 34:00.120
Eric, let's start with, really quickly, I know we mentioned it in the review, but you

34:00.120 --> 34:03.440
kind of, you had a defense for GNOME software that I thought was fair, we should give it

34:03.440 --> 34:04.440
some time.

34:04.440 --> 34:07.280
Because in the review I was like, man, there's so many ways to install software in OpenSUSE.

34:07.280 --> 34:11.040
You've got three or four different ways, and now they've just thrown in GNOME software.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.400
And you kind of raised the point.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.880
It does serve some purpose.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.000
Yes, it does, absolutely.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.320
If you understand OpenSUSE, and this is something that you've actually had a gripe about in

34:21.320 --> 34:26.240
the past, is that they don't have any good way for software discovery.

34:26.240 --> 34:30.600
Well, that's where GNOME software comes in and fills in that gap.

34:30.600 --> 34:34.280
So it's not the best for software discovery, but it's definitely better than nothing.

34:34.280 --> 34:39.440
Yeah, I would love, love to see an app that could expose the coolest and best stuff in

34:39.440 --> 34:40.440
software.OpenSUSE.org.

34:40.440 --> 34:45.620
Because I feel like there's projects that are plugged into that and generating RPMs

34:45.620 --> 34:47.480
for SUSE that I don't even know about.

34:47.480 --> 34:52.360
Yeah, but software.OpenSUSE.org is something that you want to search because it's directly

34:52.360 --> 34:54.960
tied to the build service.

34:54.960 --> 34:58.520
Think of it almost like the AUR in ARCH.

34:58.520 --> 35:01.040
Basically there's no way to discover software in the AUR.

35:01.040 --> 35:04.560
You've already got to know about it and then search the AUR to find out.

35:04.560 --> 35:08.080
Well, software.OpenSUSE.org is the exact same way.

35:08.080 --> 35:13.240
In fact, there's the Firefox extension for being able to search the AUR.

35:13.240 --> 35:18.920
I've installed that a lot when I've run ARCH, but also in OpenSUSE, I've actually made it

35:18.920 --> 35:23.920
so that that search box in there, I can directly search that from my bar using a keyword.

35:23.920 --> 35:24.920
Oh, that's handy.

35:24.920 --> 35:25.920
That's neat.

35:25.920 --> 35:26.920
Yeah, that makes it super handy.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.400
It makes it super fast to search it as well.

35:29.400 --> 35:30.400
Okay.

35:30.400 --> 35:33.960
And I also noticed too that you had a Chrome extension in the show notes for a one-click

35:33.960 --> 35:36.160
installer for OpenSUSE.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.160
Yes.

35:37.160 --> 35:41.040
Basically this kind of comes by default with Firefox.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.040
Oh, it is.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.440
Oh, that's in Firefox.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.480
So you mean an add-in to Firefox?

35:45.480 --> 35:46.480
Oh, okay.

35:46.480 --> 35:47.480
It's not really an add-in.

35:47.480 --> 35:51.440
It's basically they kind of have it in their code.

35:51.440 --> 35:55.240
There's like an OpenSUSE enhancements extension that does a few things, right?

35:55.240 --> 35:58.640
Does a few small things to make Firefox work a little better under SUSE.

35:58.640 --> 36:01.000
Yeah, just a few small things.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.240
This basically fills in the gap for Chrome.

36:03.240 --> 36:06.320
If you want to use Chrome, you can just click on that.

36:06.320 --> 36:11.400
It'll bring up the YMP file in your browser and say, do you want to install this?

36:11.400 --> 36:17.400
You can click on yes, and as long as you follow the instructions from the plugin page on the

36:17.400 --> 36:21.960
Chrome store, it will just basically start that one-click installer.

36:21.960 --> 36:25.000
Yeah, it'll fire off the install and you're off the races.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Exactly.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.600
Calls your uncle, as you say.

36:27.600 --> 36:30.960
You had a make good in the review.

36:30.960 --> 36:36.040
We forgot to touch on how horrible the fonts are by default in OpenSUSE, but it's actually

36:36.040 --> 36:37.440
pretty easy to fix.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.440
Correct.

36:38.440 --> 36:43.960
In the show notes, all you have to do is you could check out that there's a repo that Chris

36:43.960 --> 36:48.840
has on the screen if you're watching the video version and select one of those repos on there,

36:48.840 --> 36:56.040
depending on which version you have, whether it's 13.1, 13.2 or factory slash tumbleweed.

36:56.040 --> 37:05.600
You click on that, go ahead and copy that into that whole URL into your software repositories

37:05.600 --> 37:16.440
in Yast, and then you add that into a pseudo-zipper DUP, which is Distribution Upgrade, basically,

37:16.440 --> 37:22.640
and it will move your font config files over to that from the default and basically change

37:22.640 --> 37:24.320
them to the Infinity version.

37:24.320 --> 37:25.320
That's pretty straightforward.

37:25.320 --> 37:31.120
If you're having trouble following, Eric has links in the show notes to do that.

37:31.120 --> 37:35.240
I would definitely recommend that because I meant to mention that in the review.

37:35.240 --> 37:37.660
You're absolutely right about the font rendering.

37:37.660 --> 37:39.480
It's atrocious by default.

37:39.480 --> 37:40.480
Why is that?

37:40.480 --> 37:41.480
I don't know.

37:41.480 --> 37:47.400
It's like they haven't taken anything that Infinity or the Ubuntu people have done forever

37:47.400 --> 37:48.600
and integrated.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.600
I don't know.

37:49.600 --> 37:56.280
Honestly, in their defense, it's also pretty crap in Fedora by default, too.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.320
I'll give them that.

37:58.320 --> 38:02.080
Fonts just need to get better.

38:02.080 --> 38:06.620
This is the thing I'm the most excited to talk about because the rolling release thing

38:06.620 --> 38:09.000
could be extremely compelling if it's done right.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.960
You took the dive, right?

38:10.960 --> 38:11.960
You've been doing it for what?

38:11.960 --> 38:12.960
Two, three weeks or more?

38:12.960 --> 38:13.960
How long have you been running?

38:13.960 --> 38:14.960
About two or three weeks.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.440
After we got done with the Ubuntu back at last 3.35.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.360
That was three weeks ago, I think.

38:20.360 --> 38:21.720
That was about three weeks ago.

38:21.720 --> 38:26.080
I went ahead and went all in with OpenSUSE and knowing it's coming out next, I had been

38:26.080 --> 38:32.200
running Factory off and on since Factory was announced to be a full rolling distro.

38:32.200 --> 38:36.440
I've been very impressed with the results, to be honest.

38:36.440 --> 38:39.680
There's the initial article right there.

38:39.680 --> 38:43.880
That's about Factory merging with Tumbleweed.

38:43.880 --> 38:48.120
Have you had to do any open source versus proprietary driver installs on their role?

38:48.120 --> 38:49.800
How does that work?

38:49.800 --> 38:52.960
I don't have to do that on my machine because it's running full Intel.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.640
I really don't have much experience with that.

38:55.640 --> 39:00.240
However, there are one-click installs for the NVIDIA drivers using an actual Factory

39:00.240 --> 39:02.680
repo or whatnot.

39:02.680 --> 39:08.200
One thing that's important to note is that as of today, Tumbleweed and Factory are pretty

39:08.200 --> 39:09.680
much synonymous.

39:09.680 --> 39:16.840
Basically, the Factory repos are just linked over that is alias to the Tumbleweed repos,

39:16.840 --> 39:23.840
and Tumbleweed is now the name for the rolling distribution as of today, November 4th.

39:23.840 --> 39:27.960
We have linked in the show notes frequently asked questions that the OpenSUSE project

39:27.960 --> 39:30.440
has posted up.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.880
Do you get updates every day?

39:32.880 --> 39:33.880
Pretty much.

39:33.880 --> 39:37.960
It reminds me a lot of Arch in that way, except without the headache of having to manually

39:37.960 --> 39:40.800
config files and whatnot.

39:40.800 --> 39:45.520
You mentioned, too, something about the way the update manager is constantly running the

39:45.520 --> 39:46.520
background, right?

39:46.520 --> 39:47.520
Correct.

39:47.520 --> 39:53.560
Now, that update manager you were talking about for GNOME, the package updater, that

39:53.560 --> 39:57.880
is constantly running in the background, just kind of checking to see, pinging the repos,

39:57.880 --> 39:59.320
see if there's anything.

39:59.320 --> 40:02.040
It's always using zipper as the backend.

40:02.040 --> 40:03.920
It's just basically using zipper.

40:03.920 --> 40:07.020
If you were on a rolling release, does this just kind of constantly check for updates

40:07.020 --> 40:09.720
and just sort of notify you when there's a new update?

40:09.720 --> 40:13.180
That's the funny thing about rolling is that I'm not sure if it does because I haven't

40:13.180 --> 40:20.920
had it pop up at all, but in rolling, you're supposed to use zipper dup every time you

40:20.920 --> 40:21.920
want to update.

40:21.920 --> 40:22.920
Oh, okay.

40:22.920 --> 40:27.040
So, you don't use any of the built-in software tools?

40:27.040 --> 40:28.040
Correct.

40:28.040 --> 40:29.880
Not for factory or Tumbleweed.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.200
It's basically that.

40:31.200 --> 40:35.600
But those tools are still there if you convert to rolling?

40:35.600 --> 40:36.600
Correct.

40:36.600 --> 40:37.600
Yes.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.600
Yeah.

40:38.600 --> 40:43.380
The other thing that's kind of nice is there is a way to sort of jump in more current.

40:43.380 --> 40:46.800
If you want to go straight to rolling, you can get snapshot ISOs, right?

40:46.800 --> 40:48.360
Or am I wrong?

40:48.360 --> 40:49.360
Yes.

40:49.360 --> 40:53.640
There are snapshot ISOs you can do if you want to go straight to rolling, like do a

40:53.640 --> 40:55.360
fresh install with rolling.

40:55.360 --> 41:00.680
You can also convert your repos over to the factory or Tumbleweed, and there are instructions

41:00.680 --> 41:01.680
on that.

41:01.680 --> 41:02.680
But it seems cleaner.

41:02.680 --> 41:04.360
Wouldn't it just be cleaner to go right into a rolling release?

41:04.360 --> 41:05.360
Yeah.

41:05.360 --> 41:06.360
That's exactly what I did.

41:06.360 --> 41:11.120
I didn't even bother with installing 13.1 and switching the repos over.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.760
I just installed from the ISO.

41:12.760 --> 41:13.760
Right.

41:13.760 --> 41:17.640
I've converted one install to rolling, and it was pretty painless.

41:17.640 --> 41:22.680
But I remember there's like a couple of repos I had that there specifically was like a 13.1

41:22.680 --> 41:26.480
version for, but there wasn't a Tumbleweed version for, so I couldn't switch that one

41:26.480 --> 41:27.480
or something like that.

41:27.480 --> 41:32.980
That was a problem where people haven't published more updated quote-unquote Tumbleweed packages.

41:32.980 --> 41:35.780
There's only like the release versions of packages, and it sort of depends on the project

41:35.780 --> 41:36.780
or something.

41:36.780 --> 41:39.720
I don't know what I ran into, but there's a couple of repos that had to get disabled

41:39.720 --> 41:41.440
when I switched over to rolling.

41:41.440 --> 41:42.440
Right.

41:42.440 --> 41:47.360
I've run into that myself, and it's kind of annoying when that happens.

41:47.360 --> 41:51.920
At the same time, you can still stick with those packages and just install the packages,

41:51.920 --> 41:55.000
not subscribe to the repo.

41:55.000 --> 42:00.960
And so there's a six-month transition window as we switch from factory to Tumbleweed?

42:00.960 --> 42:03.320
Am I getting my terminology right?

42:03.320 --> 42:04.400
That's kind of correct.

42:04.400 --> 42:08.000
Basically factory is just kind of linking over to Tumbleweed, but what's happening is

42:08.000 --> 42:14.520
that that factory alias is going to go bye-bye in six months, so basically it'll stop working.

42:14.520 --> 42:19.840
The new repo that you have to subscribe to is that Tumbleweed repo.

42:19.840 --> 42:21.480
Okay, RottenCorps, go ahead.

42:21.480 --> 42:25.000
I think you're reading my mind.

42:25.000 --> 42:30.320
One thing that annoys me about OpenSUSE is their phrasing for the one-click install from

42:30.320 --> 42:32.920
their software website.

42:32.920 --> 42:35.760
It irritates me because it's like 15 clicks.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.480
Yeah, it is a lot of clicks.

42:37.480 --> 42:38.480
It is a lot of clicks.

42:38.480 --> 42:41.040
It is, and it's really just a branding thing.

42:41.040 --> 42:46.680
Basically the reason it's one-click install is you click on it once in the browser, and

42:46.680 --> 42:51.920
then you're starting the install process as opposed to having to copy a repo, paste it

42:51.920 --> 42:54.240
into the software repository.

42:54.240 --> 42:57.040
In one click you get the repo added and the software installed.

42:57.040 --> 43:01.000
I can activate a dev file, open one click, and that's the same thing.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.640
Well, let's not take it literally.

43:04.640 --> 43:08.840
Well, they could just not use that term, and it would just be so much better.

43:08.840 --> 43:10.120
It's all marketing, man.

43:10.120 --> 43:11.120
Yeah, it is.

43:11.120 --> 43:13.200
It crossed my mind during the review.

43:13.200 --> 43:17.040
During the review, when you first set it up, it's like when you run that the most.

43:17.040 --> 43:21.740
When you combine that with the media manager trying to check my thumb drive, which also

43:21.740 --> 43:25.360
brings up two prompts, and then you combine that with the fact that I enter my password,

43:25.360 --> 43:28.440
and then to kind of make it a little worse, and it's not really their fault.

43:28.440 --> 43:34.120
This is kind of the way GTK theming works a lot of times, is you start the first process

43:34.120 --> 43:37.520
as yourself, as in my case, my ChrisF user.

43:37.520 --> 43:43.200
Then once I entered my password, those following dialog boxes are now running as root, so they

43:43.200 --> 43:45.320
drop all of my GTK theme.

43:45.320 --> 43:49.200
They look completely different, so not only is there three or four windows that come up,

43:49.200 --> 43:52.220
several prompts that come up, but half of the windows don't look like the other half

43:52.220 --> 43:53.220
of the windows.

43:53.220 --> 43:54.220
It's not a very...

43:54.220 --> 43:55.220
Yeah, it's not their fault.

43:55.220 --> 43:56.680
KDE does the same thing.

43:56.680 --> 44:01.680
It's not a very elegant transition or process, but after I went through it a few times, it's

44:01.680 --> 44:06.560
like, yeah, this could definitely be tightened up, but I also just appreciate the ease at

44:06.560 --> 44:11.220
which I am getting a subscribe to the repo, which is really, for me, the most valuable

44:11.220 --> 44:15.280
thing, because at the end of the day, I could go to any website and download an RPM and

44:15.280 --> 44:19.160
install it, and just do that, and that's fine.

44:19.160 --> 44:22.880
But for me, the true value of the one-click install is not only am I installing it, but

44:22.880 --> 44:27.600
I'm also getting that repo, so I'm getting those future updates.

44:27.600 --> 44:28.880
That's more than just installing software.

44:28.880 --> 44:31.920
That's also sort of, quote-unquote, subscribing to that software, and to me, that's worth

44:31.920 --> 44:32.920
a little extra hassle.

44:32.920 --> 44:36.160
I think it could be rebranded, too, though, but you know.

44:36.160 --> 44:41.560
What's also cool about that is once you subscribe to that repo, say you find another package

44:41.560 --> 44:45.240
that you want to use with the one-click install on, you don't remember if you're subscribed

44:45.240 --> 44:47.840
to that repo or not, it's not going to double up the repo.

44:47.840 --> 44:48.840
It's going to use the same one.

44:48.840 --> 44:50.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that is nice, too.

44:50.720 --> 44:54.240
All right, Eric, is there anything else we want to cover in our open SUSE follow-up?

44:54.240 --> 44:58.040
Oh, Plasma 5, didn't you want to mention Plasma 5?

44:58.040 --> 45:02.920
Yeah, Plasma 5 is a separate repo you have to subscribe to if you want it.

45:02.920 --> 45:07.880
There are instructions from the KDE portal on how to do that, but yeah, as far as Plasma

45:07.880 --> 45:15.760
5 goes, it is the best Plasma 5 experience I've ever had on any KDE distro at all.

45:15.760 --> 45:16.760
That includes Kubuntu.

45:16.760 --> 45:26.320
I mean, all of the breeze theme, instead of having the, what is it, the cute curve theme,

45:26.320 --> 45:30.240
actually there is a dedicated breeze theme now, and I was only able to find it in open

45:30.240 --> 45:31.240
SUSE.

45:31.240 --> 45:33.320
That's nice.

45:33.320 --> 45:34.320
So that's something to look forward to.

45:34.320 --> 45:35.320
Yeah, and it looks really nice.

45:35.320 --> 45:36.640
Something definitely to look forward to.

45:36.640 --> 45:41.920
I have reason to believe that if Kubuntu is doing this in the next version with Plasma

45:41.920 --> 45:46.880
5, I have reason to believe that 13.3 will also be Plasma 5.

45:46.880 --> 45:47.880
That makes sense.

45:47.880 --> 45:51.760
Yeah, so there you go, and the beat goes on, I agree, Rotten, that it does sound like a

45:51.760 --> 45:52.760
better way to do PPAs.

45:52.760 --> 45:54.660
That's kind of what my impression was.

45:54.660 --> 45:58.160
It's a centralized way, sort of like the AUR is a centralized way to find stuff.

45:58.160 --> 46:00.480
You get to subscribe to the repo.

46:00.480 --> 46:03.640
It is more clicks than it needs to be, and yes, I realize you can also do app colon slash

46:03.640 --> 46:08.200
slash and a lot of browsers on Ubuntu will recognize that.

46:08.200 --> 46:10.160
It's not a totally unique system, but it works well.

46:10.160 --> 46:12.520
But that doesn't subscribe you to the PPA.

46:12.520 --> 46:17.840
Well I suppose, I suppose, it depends, like if you, there are some debians, like the Chrome

46:17.840 --> 46:21.200
deb file, when you install that, it also installs a repo.

46:21.200 --> 46:25.760
So some of them do, kind of depends, but it doesn't matter.

46:25.760 --> 46:28.200
Like it doesn't matter if they're the only ones that can do it.

46:28.200 --> 46:32.240
What matters is that it works, and that there's a nice interface in terms of the website to

46:32.240 --> 46:33.240
find stuff.

46:33.240 --> 46:34.560
And that part I give them all high marks on.

46:34.560 --> 46:37.240
Yeah, consolidating the efforts is much better.

46:37.240 --> 46:40.760
Yeah, it's better than in Fedora where you essentially have three repos.

46:40.760 --> 46:45.520
You have Fedora's repos, you have Copper, and then you have the community RPM fusion,

46:45.520 --> 46:51.040
so it makes it a bit of a pain to determine where you're getting that from.

46:51.040 --> 46:52.040
I agree, I agree.

46:52.040 --> 46:55.960
And Derrick Devlin, you had a comment on, you ran into a problem with network settings?

46:55.960 --> 47:02.480
Yes, there's only one major problem, which is, if you don't read the page when you're

47:02.480 --> 47:08.040
going to install, and you, for some reason, you're still not on IPv6, you need to go manually

47:08.040 --> 47:11.200
on the settings and enable that.

47:11.200 --> 47:17.280
Right, yeah, what was interesting is the installer uses YAS to configure the network interface,

47:17.280 --> 47:20.000
but the desktop uses Network Manager.

47:20.000 --> 47:23.600
So once you get through the installation, those two things don't communicate.

47:23.600 --> 47:28.560
So if you had to join Wi-Fi in the installation and it has a password, when you reboot the

47:28.560 --> 47:30.560
box after installation, you have no connection.

47:30.560 --> 47:35.440
And it took me a second to think, wait a minute, I was just on Wi-Fi, oh, right, one was YAS'd,

47:35.440 --> 47:36.440
one was Network Manager.

47:36.440 --> 47:40.840
Now, how would a regular non-Linux person know that?

47:40.840 --> 47:48.800
Like someone just thinking about IPv6 and IPv4 difference, someone that's not a computer

47:48.800 --> 47:49.800
geek.

47:49.800 --> 47:54.840
And what kind of tipped me off is once my desktop was booted up and installed, I was

47:54.840 --> 47:58.960
just looking at YAS, and I brought up the network management utilities to see what options

47:58.960 --> 47:59.960
were available in there.

47:59.960 --> 48:02.760
And I got an error message saying, no, you're now using Network Manager, you can't use this

48:02.760 --> 48:03.760
tool.

48:03.760 --> 48:04.760
And I was like, oh, yeah, of course.

48:04.760 --> 48:05.760
You can disable Network Manager and use that tool.

48:05.760 --> 48:07.480
Right, but I don't want to, I don't want to.

48:07.480 --> 48:08.480
You don't have to.

48:08.480 --> 48:09.480
I want to use Network Manager.

48:09.480 --> 48:10.480
I know I want to, so that's fine.

48:10.480 --> 48:11.480
Network Manager's fine.

48:11.480 --> 48:16.520
It was just kind of a thud when I logged in, and I went to go, I didn't even realize at

48:16.520 --> 48:22.380
first that I wasn't connected because so many times, when I build an arch box, during that

48:22.380 --> 48:26.400
installation process, the network is established before pretty much anything else.

48:26.400 --> 48:31.800
And when I install Ubuntu, if I join the network during installation, that holds over.

48:31.800 --> 48:35.880
All distributions really, for the most part, do that, because a lot of distributions now,

48:35.880 --> 48:39.120
you boot up into a live environment, and in that live environment, you use Network Manager

48:39.120 --> 48:41.280
to configure, and they must just move those settings over.

48:41.280 --> 48:42.280
It's fine.

48:42.280 --> 48:46.080
Right, and that's what they do in terms of Ubuntu.

48:46.080 --> 48:51.320
If you want to use that network's settings in Yast, you can.

48:51.320 --> 48:54.640
It's just that one tab is disabled for you if you're using Network Manager.

48:54.640 --> 48:58.000
In fact, that's the only way you can change your host name.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.320
It's just funny, it bit both Matt and I, so it must be common enough.

49:01.320 --> 49:02.320
Exactly.

49:02.320 --> 49:03.320
Yeah.

49:03.320 --> 49:07.120
All right, so, but Eric, great follow-up and great links in the show notes, which we'll

49:07.120 --> 49:09.280
have, especially if you want to work on your fonts and stuff like that.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.520
He's got all that in there, so check that out.

49:11.520 --> 49:14.960
And if you've been rolling OpenSUSE, let us know how it's going in the feedback thread

49:14.960 --> 49:16.680
in the Linux Action Show subreddit.

49:16.680 --> 49:17.680
Hello, Jack.

49:17.680 --> 49:18.680
How you doing, Jack?

49:18.680 --> 49:19.680
All right.

49:19.680 --> 49:24.880
Well, why don't we take a... I want to talk about something kind of neat, and, oh, you

49:24.880 --> 49:25.880
know what?

49:25.880 --> 49:26.880
Actually, let's reverse the order.

49:26.880 --> 49:30.480
I was going to talk about a new piece of hardware, but that's a little bit more of a positive

49:30.480 --> 49:31.480
note.

49:31.480 --> 49:32.480
I want to end on a positive note.

49:32.480 --> 49:36.840
So, next, I want to talk about our brothers in arms over at Linux Outlaws calling it a

49:36.840 --> 49:37.840
day.

49:37.840 --> 49:40.120
Before we do that, I want to thank our friends at DigitalOcean.

49:40.120 --> 49:44.080
Head over to DigitalOcean.com right now, DigitalOcean.com.

49:44.080 --> 49:46.000
And save this promo code in the back of your mind.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.480
Like channel it to yourself.

49:47.480 --> 49:48.480
Say future self.

49:48.480 --> 49:52.720
It's a critical piece of information that I have collected from the past, and I want

49:52.720 --> 49:53.720
to put this forward.

49:53.720 --> 49:55.920
So just think about it hard right now.

49:55.920 --> 49:56.920
Unplug November.

49:56.920 --> 49:57.920
That's your promo code.

49:57.920 --> 49:58.920
Unplug November when you check out.

49:58.920 --> 49:59.920
At least it should be.

49:59.920 --> 50:01.240
I actually haven't checked my inbox this morning.

50:01.240 --> 50:02.240
I apologize.

50:02.240 --> 50:04.520
Unplugged October will probably work for a while, too.

50:04.520 --> 50:07.600
Now to get you a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean.

50:07.600 --> 50:11.520
We love DigitalOcean, and so many of you have tried it out, but yet so many of you have

50:11.520 --> 50:12.800
yet to try it out.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.920
So you're really in a perfect position to go over there and play with something.

50:15.920 --> 50:19.040
And then later, I think you'll be surprised at how easy it is to put that in production

50:19.040 --> 50:20.120
and how well it'll work for you.

50:20.120 --> 50:21.440
So what is DigitalOcean?

50:21.440 --> 50:22.440
You're not familiar?

50:22.440 --> 50:25.720
Well, DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive

50:25.720 --> 50:27.680
and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

50:27.680 --> 50:32.960
I was playing around with some of my droplets just the other night, and I turned one off.

50:32.960 --> 50:36.800
Just to move, you know, I was experimenting actually with taking snapshots and resetting

50:36.800 --> 50:38.240
passwords and all this.

50:38.240 --> 50:41.960
Just trying different things out, because I love the interface over at DigitalOcean.

50:41.960 --> 50:44.680
And I've been adding more machines, and I thought, okay, let's try a few things.

50:44.680 --> 50:45.680
So I turned off a box.

50:45.680 --> 50:48.760
I didn't know Reekai was using it for development at the time.

50:48.760 --> 50:49.760
Oh, no.

50:49.760 --> 50:54.300
You know, the thing is, is like we spin these droplets up, and they're just so useful.

50:54.300 --> 50:58.520
We keep finding more and more uses for them, and they make it so easier over at DigitalOcean.

50:58.520 --> 51:03.120
You can get started in less than 55 seconds, and pricing plans start only $5 per month.

51:03.120 --> 51:09.100
They get you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

51:09.100 --> 51:12.320
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

51:12.320 --> 51:13.320
and London.

51:13.320 --> 51:15.600
So you could build a global distributed network if you want.

51:15.600 --> 51:21.040
And their interface, their interface is simple and intuitive, but yet very powerful.

51:21.040 --> 51:24.480
And the best part is, is you can replicate it on a larger scale with their straightforward

51:24.480 --> 51:25.480
API.

51:25.480 --> 51:30.920
And you're already seeing a lot of great apps out there that integrate in with Puppet, Unity.

51:30.920 --> 51:34.000
There's some great command line tools, Python scripts.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.800
There's so many things you can use that API for that the community has already created

51:36.800 --> 51:38.080
for you too.

51:38.080 --> 51:40.560
That's just the great thing about that API is it doesn't mean you got to do the work.

51:40.560 --> 51:41.560
Other people are doing it as well.

51:41.560 --> 51:42.560
But you could too.

51:42.560 --> 51:43.560
You can snap it right in.

51:43.560 --> 51:46.600
And then if you need to scale on demand, if you've got a busy day, you need to make sure

51:46.600 --> 51:51.880
your web front end is still responsive, you could integrate that API and deploy right

51:51.880 --> 51:52.880
up there.

51:52.880 --> 51:56.000
You can scale right up to DigitalOcean, use their droplets, spin them up when you need

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
them, spin them down when you don't.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.600
They have hourly pricing if you want them.

51:58.600 --> 52:02.520
And if you use our promo code, unplugged October, or probably unplugged November, depending

52:02.520 --> 52:06.760
on the timing, you can try it out for two months for absolutely free.

52:06.760 --> 52:09.040
And DigitalOcean's taking the tutorials up to the next level.

52:09.040 --> 52:11.640
They're offering up to $200 if you'll write a tutorial for them.

52:11.640 --> 52:17.040
And if you go to their Instagram feed today, they posted one of their tutorial editors.

52:17.040 --> 52:18.960
I think he might have broken his leg.

52:18.960 --> 52:22.560
I'm not sure what was going on, but he was sitting there editing one of the tutorials.

52:22.560 --> 52:23.760
It was a pretty funny shot.

52:23.760 --> 52:25.520
It was on DigitalOcean's Instagram feed.

52:25.520 --> 52:30.200
They also got some DigitalOcean data center porn up there, which is, I'm a big fan of

52:30.200 --> 52:31.200
that.

52:31.200 --> 52:33.800
So I think it's just Instagram.com slash DigitalOcean, but you'll probably be able to find them.

52:33.800 --> 52:35.320
Go over to DigitalOcean.com.

52:35.320 --> 52:38.760
Run up your own free droplet, try out Core OS for a couple of months.

52:38.760 --> 52:39.760
It's pretty innovative.

52:39.760 --> 52:40.760
It's pretty exciting.

52:40.760 --> 52:43.480
I think it's going to be a big deal in the server space, and you can go play with it

52:43.480 --> 52:47.440
right now on a server that's got tier one bandwidth and a data center anywhere you want

52:47.440 --> 52:48.440
it.

52:48.440 --> 52:49.880
It's an awesome opportunity to do it for absolutely free.

52:49.880 --> 52:53.320
You just add the promo code, unplugged October, to your account.

52:53.320 --> 52:57.320
It credits your account to $10, and you just run it as long as it lasts.

52:57.320 --> 52:58.320
DigitalOcean.com.

52:58.320 --> 53:03.760
And a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for being so damn awesome and sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

53:03.760 --> 53:08.880
Okay, so let's talk about the Linux Outlaw guys.

53:08.880 --> 53:13.920
They announced, I think it was yesterday or the day before, let's see, where is the date?

53:13.920 --> 53:16.320
November 3rd, so yesterday.

53:16.320 --> 53:22.320
They announced that in five episodes, they'll be calling it an end after seven years of

53:22.320 --> 53:24.480
producing Linux Outlaws.

53:24.480 --> 53:27.840
It sounds like kind of for both the guys, for both Dan and Fab, that maybe their interests

53:27.840 --> 53:30.360
have diverged over the time.

53:30.360 --> 53:32.620
They're not done necessarily podcasting, but they're probably going to take a break and

53:32.620 --> 53:33.620
come back and do something.

53:33.620 --> 53:34.620
They're super passionate about.

53:34.620 --> 53:38.160
It definitely sounds like maybe the production just came a bit of a chore and definitely

53:38.160 --> 53:39.440
understandable after seven years.

53:39.440 --> 53:42.080
I mean, that can become a lot of work.

53:42.080 --> 53:48.880
And so I wanted to take a minute to kind of talk about how sometimes there's certain pillars

53:48.880 --> 53:52.740
in the community that go away because maybe they're not as involved anymore or they're

53:52.740 --> 53:53.880
not as interested anymore.

53:53.880 --> 53:57.400
And is this something that is concerning?

53:57.400 --> 53:58.400
Is this a general trend?

53:58.400 --> 54:00.680
I mean, I think, Eric, when you and I were talking about it on the pre-show, you're like,

54:00.680 --> 54:05.600
I'm worried that this suggests maybe something that just happens to enthusiasts over time.

54:05.600 --> 54:10.360
And I started thinking about that when you mentioned that and I thought, well, we've

54:10.360 --> 54:11.360
all been in this a while.

54:11.360 --> 54:15.720
Like Matt and I specifically have been following this particular scene for a long time.

54:15.720 --> 54:18.800
Burnout is a big problem and people move on.

54:18.800 --> 54:21.760
I mean, Matt, when you hear about things like this, when you hear about somebody or a group

54:21.760 --> 54:25.040
of people who've been working at something for so long, what crosses your mind when they

54:25.040 --> 54:26.520
call it an end?

54:26.520 --> 54:30.400
Well, usually sometimes it ends up just being an extended hiatus.

54:30.400 --> 54:35.080
I mean, for myself with podcasting, I mean, before I joined Jupiter Broadcasting, that

54:35.080 --> 54:38.280
was actually what had happened from another popular podcast.

54:38.280 --> 54:42.420
So they may come back with something even cooler.

54:42.420 --> 54:47.600
So yes, burnout is a thing and sometimes people just have to kind of keep trucking and find

54:47.600 --> 54:48.820
out what works for them.

54:48.820 --> 54:50.560
But I don't think it's necessarily a problem.

54:50.560 --> 54:51.560
I think it's evolution.

54:51.560 --> 54:52.880
I think people just evolve.

54:52.880 --> 54:53.880
Yeah.

54:53.880 --> 54:55.240
It's sad to see something go.

54:55.240 --> 54:56.640
Yeah, right.

54:56.640 --> 54:57.640
Things change.

54:57.640 --> 55:00.600
What would be, you say, missing friends?

55:00.600 --> 55:01.600
What do you mean?

55:01.600 --> 55:02.600
Yeah, this reminds me.

55:02.600 --> 55:07.760
I mean, I know Dan and Fab quite well, on the Ubuntu UK podcast with Linux Outlaws,

55:07.760 --> 55:11.720
we organized a bunch of live events in the UK called Ogg Camp.

55:11.720 --> 55:16.800
So we worked quite closely with them on those and I'll be interested to know what happens

55:16.800 --> 55:17.800
in the future.

55:17.800 --> 55:23.400
But it's reminded me of, I was doing a presentation recently and I used some photos from previous

55:23.400 --> 55:29.120
Ubuntu developer summits and the kind of collective photo of everyone who was there and I was

55:29.120 --> 55:33.480
looking through picking out faces of people who used to contribute to various projects,

55:33.480 --> 55:40.280
Ubuntu and other stuff, who no longer do or whose careers have moved on or they've just

55:40.280 --> 55:41.280
stopped contributing.

55:41.280 --> 55:43.760
They still use the software, but they stopped contributing.

55:43.760 --> 55:48.600
And I got a little bit sad because these are friendships that we've built over the years

55:48.600 --> 55:53.360
and they've people who've moved on to something else.

55:53.360 --> 55:58.240
See, when Eric said this, what I started thinking is maybe what we're really worried about is

55:58.240 --> 56:02.200
in open source, we're so dependent on so many people volunteering their time based on their

56:02.200 --> 56:05.440
passion, but sometimes passion has its limits.

56:05.440 --> 56:06.720
It runs out after a while.

56:06.720 --> 56:11.000
And is it maybe what we're actually afraid of is so much of what we depend on, it's created

56:11.000 --> 56:13.680
by amazing people, those people eventually go away.

56:13.680 --> 56:14.680
And so-

56:14.680 --> 56:15.680
Right.

56:15.680 --> 56:18.040
And you've got to have coping mechanisms and time off.

56:18.040 --> 56:23.320
That's one reason why on the Ubuntu podcast, we finish at Christmas every year and take

56:23.320 --> 56:24.320
a break for two months.

56:24.320 --> 56:25.320
So we don't-

56:25.320 --> 56:26.320
It's a good idea.

56:26.320 --> 56:27.320
We don't solidly go-

56:27.320 --> 56:28.920
You lose all your listeners, but it's a good idea.

56:28.920 --> 56:29.920
No, we don't.

56:29.920 --> 56:30.920
I can't.

56:30.920 --> 56:31.920
We don't.

56:31.920 --> 56:32.920
No, it's good.

56:32.920 --> 56:33.920
It's like...

56:33.920 --> 56:37.760
And Linux Outlaws has taken a lot of breaks over the years, but at a certain point, it

56:37.760 --> 56:38.760
still becomes a chore.

56:38.760 --> 56:39.760
And that's totally understandable.

56:39.760 --> 56:43.400
I guess, Eric, I didn't want to speak for you too much, but did I kind of summarize

56:43.400 --> 56:47.080
your thoughts or when you heard this news, what crossed your mind?

56:47.080 --> 56:48.360
That's exactly what crossed my mind, actually.

56:48.360 --> 56:50.380
You did summarize my thoughts very well.

56:50.380 --> 56:54.900
The thing is, if you get at something for a long amount of time, you don't take a break

56:54.900 --> 56:56.760
every now and then, you don't pace yourself.

56:56.760 --> 56:58.840
I've seen this time and time again.

56:58.840 --> 57:00.840
You will burn out.

57:00.840 --> 57:04.360
It's just the way the human body is designed.

57:04.360 --> 57:05.360
Yeah, I wonder-

57:05.360 --> 57:06.360
It is designed to take rest.

57:06.360 --> 57:07.920
I wonder if I didn't do this full time.

57:07.920 --> 57:09.520
I couldn't imagine.

57:09.520 --> 57:11.800
Definitely obviously not this many shows.

57:11.800 --> 57:15.840
Well, there's a difference though, because you create content and you have a whole team

57:15.840 --> 57:17.200
of people around you.

57:17.200 --> 57:20.000
With Dan and Fab, it's just the two of them.

57:20.000 --> 57:24.720
As I understand it, Fab does all of the editing.

57:24.720 --> 57:29.040
To be fair, he's a bit precious about it and doesn't like anyone else.

57:29.040 --> 57:32.400
Other people have offered to take on the job and he's quite a perfectionist and wouldn't

57:32.400 --> 57:33.600
let anyone touch it.

57:33.600 --> 57:34.600
Yeah.

57:34.600 --> 57:39.880
In fact, I think if you don't build a team, that's exactly what happens, right?

57:39.880 --> 57:40.880
Right.

57:40.880 --> 57:46.760
People like you who have a team of people, whether you pay them or not, or whether they're

57:46.760 --> 57:50.080
community people who are volunteering their time, is largely irrelevant.

57:50.080 --> 57:53.600
They're people who are helping you get the thing out.

57:53.600 --> 57:57.960
If you don't have that crutch to lean on, you're screwed.

57:57.960 --> 58:08.280
I think too, I look at it and what I don't like is I don't want it to represent a decline

58:08.280 --> 58:10.400
in the interest, because I don't sense that.

58:10.400 --> 58:14.920
I think a lot of people have associated with, oh, there's less of an interest in the market.

58:14.920 --> 58:16.360
I don't think that's actually true.

58:16.360 --> 58:20.720
I think it's just sometimes the people, like in their case, Dan and Fab, sometimes their

58:20.720 --> 58:23.240
interests change.

58:23.240 --> 58:24.320
It becomes harder and harder.

58:24.320 --> 58:27.200
You could see in the evolution of the show, they start covering more generalized technology

58:27.200 --> 58:32.440
and topics and security in the NSA, diverging more and more from Linux as a topic itself.

58:32.440 --> 58:38.120
Arguably, Linux is more popular now than it has ever been in the past.

58:38.120 --> 58:41.800
It can't possibly be that it's not popular, it's just popular to different people for

58:41.800 --> 58:42.800
different reasons.

58:42.800 --> 58:43.800
Exactly.

58:43.800 --> 58:49.760
Yeah, and I think it's natural that as that changes, it might not be as appealing to some

58:49.760 --> 58:50.760
people.

58:50.760 --> 58:54.320
But yeah, Wizard, go ahead, jump in, that's kind of all the thoughts I had.

58:54.320 --> 58:58.080
I just wanted to make a mention to it and tip of the hat to him too for all the hard

58:58.080 --> 58:59.080
work for so long.

58:59.080 --> 59:00.080
But Wizard, go ahead.

59:00.080 --> 59:06.840
Yeah, so it is sad when you see good people leave and all, but I tend to find that a lot

59:06.840 --> 59:09.120
of times, it's not so much that they're leaving.

59:09.120 --> 59:15.040
It's just whatever they're making, it kind of comes to summation or it stabilizes or

59:15.040 --> 59:18.120
whatever they're doing, it just seems to slow down.

59:18.120 --> 59:23.960
And as whatever they're doing slows down, they just quit putting as much effort in,

59:23.960 --> 59:29.120
not because it doesn't need it or anything, not because it's totally imperfect.

59:29.120 --> 59:33.880
It's just they've got what they needed done and now they want to go and use the product

59:33.880 --> 59:37.200
because whatever they're doing, it's because they're passionate about it.

59:37.200 --> 59:38.720
They want to see it work.

59:38.720 --> 59:41.480
And when it works, it's like, okay, I'm done.

59:41.480 --> 59:44.960
I'm going to sit back, be happy for a little while and then maybe move on to something

59:44.960 --> 59:45.960
different.

59:45.960 --> 59:48.400
Very true.

59:48.400 --> 59:52.920
And so we wish them the best of luck and we'll stay tuned to see what they come up with

59:52.920 --> 59:58.160
next because I have a feeling we haven't heard the last of them because I think Six Guns

59:58.160 --> 01:00:03.440
itself is sticking around and Ogg Camp itself as far as they have plans, they aren't changing

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.440
anywhere.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.800
Hey, I have something fun to talk about.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:08.760
Something that will sort of lift our spirits before we run, maybe get a good debate going

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:09.760
first though.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.280
I want to tell you about something that lifts my spirits every single month.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.280
Oh, who was it?

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.280
I got an email.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.280
I think it was Tony.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.280
I'm sorry.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.280
It was Tony or Terry.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.280
It was a T name.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.280
I'm sorry if I'm getting your name wrong.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.280
Matt.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.600
So you know how we always talk about the savings calculator over at Ting?

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.600
Oh yes.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:28.320
Tony went over there and plugged his actual usage in and he's going to save like 177 something

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.320
a month.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.960
In two years, it's almost going to be four grand or it's over four grand is what he's

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.280
going to save by switching to Ting.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280
Holy cow.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.280
That's like a liquid powered computer.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.280
Yeah, I know, right?

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:42.400
That's a serious gaming rig every couple of years and it's really simple.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.160
It's because Ting is on a mission to make mobile make sense.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.440
You only pay for what you use.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:50.320
It's a flat six dollars for the line and then it's just your minutes, your messages and

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.440
your megabytes.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.840
There's no special plan you have to be in to turn on tethering.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.920
If you want to use it, you just check the box and it's just your data usage and Ting

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.740
has an awesome dashboard that lets you manage your account, see exactly where each line

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:04.080
is at, nickname them so I've got funny names for each line.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.360
I can set individual limits, alerts, disable lines when I don't need them and then I don't

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:10.360
have to pay for them.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:13.800
And to top it all off, Ting has tier one tech support.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:18.840
Like you immediately go to the top level person when you call them at 1-855-TING-FTW anytime

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:24.620
between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. and a real human answers the phone and they are set up to solve

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:25.620
the problem.

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.240
Like they have the power to do it.

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.480
They don't have to talk to their manager.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.480
They are the boss.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.480
It's great.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.920
They also have an incredible website that you can help yourself over at help.ting.com

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:34.920
I believe or ting.com.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.400
Here's what you do though.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.300
Go to linux.ting.com.

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.300
That's where you get started.

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.720
That's your home base, linux.ting.com.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.920
That will take $25 off your first device.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:48.120
If you have a Ting compatible device, they will give you a $25 credit but even more important,

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:52.000
you're going to tell them you appreciate them supporting Linux Unplugged by going to linux.ting.com

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.520
and you get to put Linux in the URL which is always fun.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.920
Go over to their blog too because they just announced that they've rolled out tri-band

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.240
LTE to 17 new markets.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:04.560
They've been working on this a lot over the last year, tons of new markets.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:10.960
They now have tri-band LTE in over 400 markets across the, I'm sorry, 500 markets across

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:11.960
the United States.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.960
Wow.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.960
Yeah.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.180
Tri-band, if you're not familiar, is a superior method of LTE where there's three different

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.480
frequencies that you can get on and so if one of them is working, you get a good connection.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.160
If you get all three, it's amazing.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:27.200
I've got tri-band LTE here at the studio, 1820 megabits on my speedtest.net.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:28.520
Not uncommon at all.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:32.200
It's really awesome and now that they just rolled it out to 17 new markets, Ting is constantly

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.200
getting better.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.840
If you haven't checked them out in a little while, it's worth revisiting.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:40.000
They've invested millions of dollars into rolling out this tri-band LTE infrastructure.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.220
Now 500 markets across the United States have it.

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:48.920
Go to linux.ting.com, take $25 off your first device, try out that savings calculator, start

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:55.000
saving money right now, own your phone, don't get screwed over by the mobile carriers, get

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.400
decent support, use tethering when you need it and only pay for your usage, linux.ting.com,

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:08.160
linux.ting.com and a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged and thanks

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.360
to everybody who checks them out.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.880
I think you'll be pretty impressed and you'll save lots of money.

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.320
Okay, so here it is, you guys.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:23.080
Finally, someone has invented the multi-pass or multi-pass from, if you remember, 5th Element.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:26.120
It's called multi-pass, an open source offline password keeper.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.840
It's a hardware based password device.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.000
I'm gonna play a little bit of the video so you get a little introduction.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.060
It's on IndieGoGo.

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.120
They're trying to raise funds.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:41.680
They're trying to get to $110,000 roughly and they're at $18,000 right now.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.060
So I don't know if they're gonna make it but I'll play a little bit of the video for you

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:47.800
guys and then you tell me if you'd back it and what the problems could be and what security

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:48.800
problems you might see.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.800
So here we go.

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.800
I'll let this go.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.880
Open and passwords are an integral part of our daily lives.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.880
I know it.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:04:00.360
They're what prevent malicious users from doing harmful things with our personal data.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.800
People tend to use the same credentials for the different websites they visit.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:10.700
However, recent news has taught us that credentials stored by websites are compromised on a daily

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:16.160
basis, which means that once an attacker gets your credential set, he can use it on other

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.760
websites.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:29.320
This is why using different passwords for different websites is important.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:34.920
Remembering many different passwords is difficult and one option is software-based password

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:35.920
keepers.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:41.600
Essentially, they store an encrypted credentials database on your computer.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:46.800
To unlock this database, you would enter a passphrase, which means that at some point,

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:52.000
both your passphrase and database must be stored in your computer or smartphone's memory.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.640
Therefore, a malicious program could gain access to both and compromise all your passwords

01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:02.000
at once without you knowing it.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.400
To solve this problem, we introduce the multi-pass, an offline password keeper aimed at saving

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.400
and encrypting your passwords in a more secure manner.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:17.920
The main device contains your encrypted passwords, while a secure smart card and a PIN code allows

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.480
their decryption.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:24.960
Even if an attacker gets hold of your encrypted database or smart card, it is completely useless

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.100
without your personal code.

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:32.040
And don't worry, we implemented the possibility to make backup copies of your credential database

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:37.580
and smart card without compromising your system's security.

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:43.800
As opposed to software-based solutions, the multi-pass only runs our tested code independently

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.520
of your computer.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:51.000
This means viruses or malicious programs cannot compromise your credential database or PIN,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.440
neither of which are directly accessible from the computer.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:59.980
Furthermore, our product is open source, allowing you to make sure that your credentials are

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:04.540
only kept inside the device and not leaked to the outside.

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:08.640
And with multi-pass, you can be sure that your credentials are only in the computer's

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:14.040
memory when needed, and when you explicitly permit the multi-pass to send them.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:17.740
Okay, so let's talk about this.

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:21.800
Part of me likes the idea of a hardware-based security device, I'm not going to lie.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:27.120
I like the smart card with the key codes, that's nice.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:33.680
But there's a lot of good software-based solutions like LastPass and KeyPass already existing.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.680
Anybody seen this already in the Mumba room?

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.600
Anybody sort of like ready to go jump on this?

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:42.240
I've actually, I was looking at this earlier today, actually.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.960
What do you think?

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:50.580
It's interesting in and of itself, but what I'm going to just say that it comes down to

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:53.920
is that it's going to require you to carry things around.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:07:00.560
And not that that makes it bad, but it's something that's going to stop me because I'm so forgetful

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:06.080
and I can't keep that thing on me all the time whenever I need to go and just shove

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.080
a password at something.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:13.480
So there's another option, like LastPass has a thing called Open Sesame.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:17.080
And basically you could put this on, it's kind of the same thing but software-wise,

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:22.560
put it on a flash drive, put the flash drive on your keychain, and then you always have

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.560
it.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:26.560
Yeah, and you could also with LastPass use things like YubiKey as well.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:32.280
And with KeyPass you can store the database on a flash drive and that way you keep it

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.280
with you.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.280
It's always with you.

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:36.960
Yeah, to me there's too many drawbacks.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:40.320
Losing of the physical item because I'm mobile, so that means I'd have to bring this with

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.320
me.

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:44.600
I'd have to bring it to my office, to the studio, and to home.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.360
Which is just not a good idea.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.960
So that's why I'm kind of down on it.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:51.760
But if I was super worried about security, for some reason this does feel better.

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:55.780
Okay, here's what it is, I think, is you've got to understand the guys behind it.

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:59.520
They come from an InfoSec background and I think a lot of them are operating under the

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:02.480
assumption that the computer is compromised by default.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.360
So you go into the situation assuming the computer is untrustworthy, therefore it's

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.800
a bad place to store your passwords, it's a bad place to copy them to memory, it's a

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:13.560
bad place to input your passcode, all of that, because you're supposed to assume the computer

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.800
is already compromised.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:18.680
This removes it from that, they say it only runs their quote-unquote trusted code, even

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.320
though it's open source, I don't know exactly what that means.

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:27.080
It's not for me, but I thought it was interesting enough that maybe the audience might be into

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.080
it.

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:32.080
I kind of like it for some reason, something about it I like.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:35.920
What I thought was really interesting about it was it kind of combined the smart card

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:41.560
reader with something as simple as something you can plug in and just have it automatically

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.880
fill in passwords.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:51.200
That certainly is something in and of itself that is really interesting for what it does.

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:56.440
It combines what we already have had with smart cards for so long and combines it with

01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:02.760
something that we've typically only ever seen in software and it kind of makes it very interesting.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.360
However though, it still has a few fundamental limitations.

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:12.100
First of all, with bad USB, we now can't fully trust USB if we're super paranoid, which this

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:14.600
device seems like a device for the super paranoid.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:20.520
And number two, if it's inputting the password, it's probably using a human interface driver

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:25.560
and sending keystrokes with the password because what you do is you go to your Gmail page,

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:30.160
you click on the login box, then you enter your PIN code and it sends in the password.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.160
That's exactly what it does.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.680
It emulates a keyboard.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:33.680
But that could still be captured.

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:37.520
If you have something that's reading the memory on a Windows box, for example, that could

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.800
still capture that stuff.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:39.800
Oh yeah.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.440
And Linux has got very good software capture options.

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:50.120
Yeah, and that target breach, that huge ass target breach, that malware was just scraping

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.120
the RAM.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.720
It wasn't doing key captures, it wasn't doing screen dumps, it was just scraping the RAM

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.280
and sending the details straight out of RAM.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:01.560
And so this device doesn't really get around that if you still have to enter it in.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:06.360
I don't know exactly, but I guess maybe it's harder to monitor something at the human interface

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.920
driver level, but I doubt it.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:12.840
Derek Devlin, I know you wanted to get a chance to chime in and then I think we'll jump on.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:17.520
Yeah, I think this is a good initial step.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:25.400
And in the next generation of these kind of devices, the way I see is better browser integration

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:31.800
or better website integration as well, to the point that you can generate a cookie that

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:37.960
has your key and you never actually send any data, so your password is not sent to the

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:38.960
computer.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:39.960
Right, right.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:40.960
That kind of thing.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:41.960
Like a token or something.

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:42.960
Yeah, something like that.

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:47.420
I think that's kind of the future for that kind of product, and they have a place.

01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:51.680
And as Ken Seko points out in the IRC, something else I like a lot about it is they've put

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.040
all their code up on GitHub.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.120
The code that runs this thing is open.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.440
It's available now.

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.840
And the other thing about this project is they've got real units.

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.600
They've already had it in testing.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:06.280
People are already using, quote unquote, production units today, and have been for months.

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.540
They've got a field of beta testers.

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:12.520
So this isn't necessarily like a pie in the sky project either.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.680
This is something that's already a physical device that they've made.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:19.720
There's already existing open-sourced code, so you're kind of backing a sure bet.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:22.680
But their funding is a little short right now.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.680
So I don't know.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:24.680
I'll put a link in the show notes.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.680
It's neat.

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:29.620
I love open-source hardware, or at least software that runs on it.

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:34.200
So yeah, they've got 30 days left, 18,000 of 110,000.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.920
For this release?

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.440
Go ahead.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.440
No?

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.440
Okay.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.440
All right.

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:48.040
Well, something that strikes me as I'm looking into this is that they did a nice job of showing

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.760
what it's capable of doing.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:50.760
What they're not really...

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.000
And again, this is only from the fundraising point of view.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.680
What they failed to do is to show what happens when your current methods, methodology, local

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.060
access, local software tools fail.

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:04.360
Show that, then the money might start kicking in a little faster for them.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.080
I don't feel like they did a very good job showing that.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.960
Right, because people already know that using the same password in too many places is bad.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:09.960
That's not making them stop.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:10.960
Yeah.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.800
They stopped using one, two, three, four, five, six a long time ago.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.800
It's been a week.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.800
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.800
I mean, it's not a week.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.360
Yeah, now use four, five, six, seven.

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.360
Let's get real.

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.360
Obviously, right?

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.360
Yeah.

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.360
Or just numbers backwards.

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.360
That's all good.

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.540
Well, it's an Indiegogo.

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.000
It's called MultiPass.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Great name.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Got to love the name, if nothing else.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.560
It actually kind of saddens me that they don't have a cow as their logo.

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.560
Oh, yeah.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.560
That would be good too.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.560
MultiPass.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.560
MultiPass.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.240
Or what's your face from Fifth Element?

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.240
Yeah.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.240
What's?

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.240
Me and Joe.

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:45.240
Yeah.

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.240
MultiPass.

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.240
Yeah.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.240
All right.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.240
I think we're all done.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.240
I think we've done our damage.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.240
I think we'll wrap it up right there.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.960
I just wanted to give you guys that.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.720
Hardware is always fun and something you can get on early, and it's a neat idea too.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:57.720
So that'd be neat.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.320
We'll have links to everything we've talked about today in the show notes.

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.000
If you'd like to give us some feedback, some comments on anything we've talked about, go

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.400

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:09.100
That's also a great place to submit stories, topic ideas, or discussions, or just comment

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:11.600
on the existing stories to give us your take, your insights.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.200
We integrate all of that into our shows.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:17.980
You can also check us out every single week live over jblive.tv.

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:18.980

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.760
I got some cool projects I'm working on for this week's episode of Linux Action Show,

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:29.760
Matt.

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.720
So buckle up, and I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:32.720
All right.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.720
Sounds good.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.720
All right, everyone.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.760
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.960
I'm just going to mention it again, because it's a great place for you to get involved.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.880
And if you want more show, there's another spot.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.800
You can get just a lot more content, stuff that doesn't even make it in there, pics.

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.680
Oh, and we want you to run to Linux.

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:48.680
You can also submit them there.

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.040
Videos would be great.

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.120
Okay, everybody.

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:03.760
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:06.600
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:58.160
Don't mind me, I'm just going to go ahead and install Ubuntu Mate Edition 14.04 here.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.000
When is that going to be out, guys?

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Hopefully Saturday at the latest Sunday.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Very cool.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Very cool.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
All right.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000
JBtitles.com.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Everybody vote.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Got to get a title.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Got to have a title.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.640
Thanks for all the show notes, Eric.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.320
I just put all that in the official doc.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.320
So that's great.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.320
Awesome.

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.320
You're welcome.

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.200
Isn't it weird that I do like air piano every time we get the outro going?

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.200
No, I love it.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.200
You guys, it's great.

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:22.200
It's great.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.200
Blast just slow danced with himself.

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.200
I think that's sweet.

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:25.200
There you go.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:26.200
That's real dope.

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.200
Actually, I think I slow danced with Josh because he was slow dancing with me.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.200
Hell yeah.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.200
Yeah.

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:32.200
I did the Stevie Wonder dance.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.200
Wow.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.200
Oh, boy.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.720
And it just got weird.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:39.680
Angie and I have decided we're going to go see a concert in a few weeks for her birthday.

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.720
We're going to go see Fleetwood Mac.

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.720
Good choice.

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.720
It's going to be crazy, I think.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:44.720
It's going to be crazy.

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:45.720
Don't know.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:46.720
Yeah, I was following the two options.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.720
I was rooting for that.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:48.720
Right.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:49.720
Yeah.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.720
One's on Thursday.

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:51.720
One was on a Saturday.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:52.720
And the Saturday one would have been easier.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:53.720
But the Fleetwood Mac's on Thursday.

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:54.720
Yeah.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.720
Yes.

01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:56.720
JBtitles.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.720
JBtitles.com.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.720
Everybody, let's vote.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.240
Can I ask for some help?

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:02.240
Yeah.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.240
Do it.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:09.960
So, I've had an audio failure, and I've heard some of you and the other guys talking about

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.160
USB sound cards and what have you, and I'd like some advice on what should I get that's

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:20.720
relatively inexpensive and reliable for plugging in headphones and mic.

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:21.720
I got this.

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:22.720
Good.

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:23.720
Good.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.720
Anything with a cMedia chipset is going to do perfectly.

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.440
Honestly, the cheapest one.

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.680
The cheapest one that does that is actually it's called the Daffodil.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:38.600
I know it's absolutely ridiculous, but if you go on Amazon, it's called the Daffodil

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:39.600
USB sound card.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.360
It's like $8.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.400
It's the most wonderful little thing that you'll ever buy.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.240
I was going to mention that one actually.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.280
It uses a cMedia chipset.

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.280
Yeah.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.280
Yeah.

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.280
And then it's super simple.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.280
Yeah.

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.280
They almost all do.

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.280
That then has mic and headphone jacks, does it?

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:55.280
Or do you...

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.280
It does.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.280
Yes.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.280
It is.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.280
Right.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.440
It's a USB headset and mic integrated thingy.

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.440
Is that a good idea?

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:03.440
Yes or no?

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.440
Yeah.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:05.440
Those are good too.

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.960
That could do the trick, especially if your main sound chip is blown.

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:08.960
Yeah.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.360
That's what I use right now.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:15.960
My microphone that I'm using right now is a cMedia chipset and it's a USB microphone.

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:16.960
Yeah.

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:17.960
A lot of the headset ones are cMedia too.

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:22.400
The nice thing about the headset is then you've got headphones and mic in one, so that's nice

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.520
for mumble.

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:31.120
I literally have three or four, five of those really, so let's see, one, two, three in my

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.040
view right now of those cMedia sound cards.

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:39.000
We just use them around the studio because they work so well under every OS and when

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.960
I need audio out of a box, I just go there and plug one in.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:41.960
I don't have...

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:42.960
This is it.

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.360
I've got two workstations here, both of which have let me down this evening.

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:50.760
My laptop, I couldn't get on last week when I was traveling because my laptop mic input

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.160
has died.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:56.280
So I'm trying to find something that I can plug into whichever machine I'm on and rely

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:57.280
on.

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:58.280
Plug and go, really, the headset's super easy.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.280
Right?

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.680
The headset's going to be the most dependable in my experience.

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.600
Platronics, I buy them by the gross.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:08.320
I get them at thrift stores and just stick them in a box and I'm overflowing with them.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.760
The biggest variance is going to be mic quality on the headsets and you just look at the different

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.560
reviews and stuff and you'll probably find it.

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.560
Yeah.

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.880
There's not too much difference between the actual USB sound device at all.

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:18.880
So a RAM, one, two, three.

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.200
Is there any hardware compatibility issues there?

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:25.320
Well, like Ram's pointing out, and I have run into this too, in fact, it bit me during

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.320
the pre-show.

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:31.680
Sometimes, I don't know if it's the cMedia driver or what, but sometimes I go to shave

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.560
off like just a little bit of volume towards the low end and it just totally silences it.

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.800
Like there's a really, like it just drops off at the end really fast.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.800
Yes.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:46.120
And that's more than cMedia because I have an Audio Technica USB cardioid microphone

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:51.560
and it has a built-in sound card so that the whole thing can just be plugged in via USB

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:56.320
and it's the same thing and it's not a cMedia chipset at all.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.200
I have no idea what it is.

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:02.720
I don't know if it's a USB thing or...

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.160
I can speak for the Gamecom 780.

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:11.040
I actually submitted a patch into the Linux kernel for it.

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.320
And is it causing you problems?

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.320
Nope.

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.320
Oh, okay.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.320
They took it?

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.320
Good.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.320
Okay.

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.960
Any Platronics headset will work.

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:22.920
I've had minimal problems with them over the years and I've used like 15 of them.

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.920
I've never had compatibility issues ever.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:29.560
I agree exactly with that because I had one when I first started doing this and it worked

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:30.560
brilliantly.

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:34.480
Did we ever figure anything out about the tearing issue that our emailer was having?

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.480
Yeah, sorry.

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.120
I pasted it in the chat room earlier.

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.120
Okay.

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:39.120
Oh, okay.

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.120
Would you mind pasting it again?

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.120
Let me find it.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.120
Yeah, let me find it.

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:43.120
Thank you.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.120
And I'll add that to the post-show notes.

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.120
Cool.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.120
Thank you.

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:49.920
I'm sure somebody listening at home will probably put in a comment too.

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.960
And whatever headset you choose, really the big test is that if it can take being run

01:19:53.960 --> 01:20:00.160
over, dropped, stepped on, lost, basically abused, that's my... Exactly.

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.360
And never be afraid.

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:02.960
If you find one that works, buy a couple.

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:03.960
Trust me.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:04.960
You'll thank me later.

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:05.960
Yeah, because they go out.

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:09.320
They just... Plantronics had a really, really good one for a long time and they just... They

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.820
still have good ones, but they quit making the one I really like.

01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:12.820
They just quit making it.

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:13.820
It's like, oh no.

01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:14.820
I got the old school one.

01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:18.360
I got the one I have on the other computer and it's got the actual adapter attached to

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.360
the cord midway.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.360
I mean, it's like the best one I own.

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:25.360
So the other headset after they stopped making the one I really liked is I got the Logitech

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:28.320
Gaming Series, the G-something.

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:33.480
One thing I like about that one is it has a light on the mic itself so you know when

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:37.760
your mic is live because it actually lights up the end of the microphone and then you

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.920
just flip it up and it auto-mutes the mic, which is kind of nice.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.120
You know your mic's muted if the headpiece is up.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.120
Oh, I like that.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.480
You can turn it down and it un-mutes, which is kind of cool.

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:49.640
And then if you have it on a Windows box, it supports... I don't think it... I've

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:53.240
never tried it on Linux, but it supports 7-point surround sound, quote, unquote.

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:55.040
I don't... It's kind of a thing.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:21:01.040
And with any USB anything with audio, again, don't ever depend on the default sound chooser.

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.140
You're just going to frustrate yourself.

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:19.400
Get yourself the Pulse Audio, a PavDev chooser or whatever the hell they call it.
