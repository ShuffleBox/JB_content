00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
I was just getting nostalgic about modems this morning and that sound that they make and

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,920
I don't know if it was just serendipity or what but you found the perfect

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,280
Perfect open source tool this week. It's pretty cool. West. It's called wave share wave share. It's serverless

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,040
It's peer-to-peer. It's local file sharing

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,320
Through sound I like all of those words. Yeah, it's using WebRTC. Oh

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,720
Signaling is performed through sound no server side is required

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,080
You just unplug headphones turn on a microphone and get another computer to listen and you can transmit data

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,640
So I'm going to send about this is about a 40 megabyte file and I'm going to send it at the fast speed

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,880
They have normal fast fastest and ultrasonic

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,080
I'll do fast so that way we can actually hear it

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,820
And if you were on the receiving side if you'd gone and we'd set up a session

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,580
This would actually be transferring a file to you. You ready? This is what it sounds like. It's it's pretty neat. Oh

13
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,980
That's it. Oh, it's transmitted. Isn't that cool? That's fascinating. I love that. It's so you can find it

14
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,460
We'll have a link in the show notes. It's actually kind of hard to search for

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,480
Wave dash share is what you would Google but just go to

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:23,000
Linux unplug calm slash 248. We'll have it there at the top of the links. It's so neat. It's like bringing the modem back

17
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,600
This is Linux unplugged episode 248 for May 8th 2018

18
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,080
Whoa, welcome to Linux unplug your weekly Linux talk show

19
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:51,000
That's watching all of the keynotes from Microsoft Google and Red Hat all at once and putting it all into something

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,520
That's actually interesting. At least we hope my name is Chris. My name is Wes. That's right Wes

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:03,240
It is a packed Tuesday Google Microsoft and Red Hat are all up on stage as we record and they're all talking about

22
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,040
Linux not entirely but it's a lot of Linux

23
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:12,440
We'll cover a couple of moments from Red Hat summit and from Google I owe that I think matter to our listeners

24
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:19,040
Plus we got a bunch of community news. We've already got speculation on the next version of Ubuntu and I I

25
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:26,160
Got really deep into Fedora this weekend, and I did some things. I want to hear about them. I made some changes

26
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,040
Oh, no, so I'm gonna tell you all about it. I did. I'm a maniac when it comes to that

27
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,400
I don't know. I I am officially a Linux nomad

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,120
I just hop around a lot, but I think I have the perfect setup this weekend is sitting for Mike Ubuntu workstation

29
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,840
SSH into Fedora 28 cloud instances. I

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,680
Consolidated three servers down into one

31
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,280
I'll tell you why I did it and what really made it click for me and why I think I'm going all-in on Fedora

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
28 on my servers for these jobs

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,840
Wow, I never thought okay. I'm going LTS on the desktop and for door 20. You're a bad man

34
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,160
I got a good reason though, and I'll tell you all about that coming up in the show plus we always have those folks

35
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,200
In that virtual look time appropriate greetings mumble room. Hey, yo, what's up, Jedi? Oh

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,720
Oh

37
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,160
Come on. We got more than that. Come on. There's more than that. I've got it. Come on guys. You gotta be food

38
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Yeah, I'm hiding

39
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,080
Well, I'm glad to have you on there Jen

40
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,880
It's nice to have you sneaking in today because I know you got one of those I think people call them day jobs

41
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,740
So that's it's really much appreciated welcome. Yeah, especially on a day like today. Most people are burned out good thing

42
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,880
I'm working from home. Oh good move good move. I'm glad I'm glad you're able to make that work today

43
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,080
Most people are burned out because of everything going on

44
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,560
But the big news item like if you're gonna pull one thing out of Google IO

45
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:49,600
It's the story that we've been slowly building towards on Linux action news and on this program and that is Chrome OS getting full-fledged

46
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,720
real Linux apps

47
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,240
Coming all together in one place. You got Android Chrome apps and now Linux desktop apps on Chrome OS

48
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,800
It's it's a big announcement. We've seen it coming and it's released on the pixel book today

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,940
It'll be rolling out to other models later

50
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:15,160
Seems like a pretty big deal and we know that underneath this it's probably some sort of container eyes Linux environment where

51
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Yeah, looks like they've got a sandbox and then a virtual machine the inside and then where it's like in the past

52
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,400
There's been other methods to get sort of Linux side loaded on Chromebooks

53
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,080
This is something when you go into the settings you'll check a box and now you have it

54
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Yeah, it seems like maybe Google leveraging some of the the security things they've learned from the cloud here on their desktop platform

55
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,920
Whoo, this seems like it could make Chrome OS the largest

56
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:44,200
Desktop Linux operating system like we've it's always been Linux based, but it didn't have Linux apps now. It's got a

57
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:52,480
Multi-billion dollar corporate sponsor. It's running a Linux stack. It's got access to desktop Linux applications

58
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,920
oh, and if you need it, it's got Chrome and

59
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,520
features like power wash and

60
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,240
reasonable prices and while we'll throw in a few Google cloud services to which everybody's using those these days anyway

61
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,960
So why not?

62
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:12,120
I mean it takes the Chromebook to a new level in a way suddenly a major bump in utility at least for me

63
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,500
I mean you can install Android studio on it

64
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,320
Developers have been messing around with getting entire development stacks running inside the Chrome OS container for Linux

65
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,920
There is even people that have gotten wine loaded for different Windows

66
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:32,720
applications, it's I think it's hard to overstate how this could change desktop Linux this really could make

67
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,000
Chrome OS like the number one desktop Linux system

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,840
And I I want to just spend I just want to spend a moment with that because that's a good

69
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,800
This is Linux to the masses here. This is the success

70
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,560
That so many of us wanted for so many decades for so long now. I mean really since

71
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,520
multiple decades

72
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,760
and

73
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,360
It's arriving Linux. It's available to

74
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,920
Anybody that goes into like a average electronic store

75
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,000
They'll be able to buy a Chromebook that can run Linux applications seems like a pretty big deal to me

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah, it does and it's not even right. Yeah, it's not you don't have to flash it yourself. You're not doing anything complicated

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,240
It's in a safe sandbox environment

78
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,640
It's got a warranty and they're cheap, but it's it's deeply tied into proprietary services that spy on you

79
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,120
And so this is what our success ends up looking like and is it success? Is it a is it a clean win?

80
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,720
I don't know if it is

81
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,960
I'm not sure. It's a clean win. I don't think it

82
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,760
I don't think it feels like we thought this might feel like no, I don't think it does

83
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,080
I think I always pictured a Red Hat or a canonical being there

84
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,880
But something more traditional something like we're used to or what we choose for ourselves

85
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,640
Yeah

86
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,440
It can be interesting to see you like five years from now if this really changes the landscape much if maybe people are creating more

87
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,880
Desktop Linux applications so they could people can have richer application experiences on Chromebooks. I

88
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,760
certainly if I was if I had a if I had a fleet of salespeople or

89
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,220
People that worked in a warehouse or on a on a manufacturing line that I needed to buy a fleet of machines to go with

90
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,240
This would be pretty tempting

91
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,560
there is some seriously robust centralized management capabilities with Chrome OS that make it very appealing to businesses and schools and

92
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,520
It's really comparable to what you would get if you were to roll out Windows with Active Directory

93
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,240
And yeah all of that and they have it built into Chrome OS

94
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,520
Apple really can't compete with that

95
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,240
You could custom write that one or two one-off applications that you need that for some reason aren't web apps

96
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,040
Why would you buy a standard full Linux workstation or laptop or even a Windows workstation or laptop?

97
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,160
When you could do this now developers could use it too, right?

98
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,080
I mean they probably already could but even more so where does I wonder where does that leave?

99
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,720
Where does that leave Apple as well?

100
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,900
If you you know Windows has the subsystem for Linux Chromebooks can run Linux apps now

101
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,120
Yeah, I guess if you it's just where are you more locked into Microsoft Apple or Google and that's the one for you

102
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,920
I would like to ask Noah like are you would you consider selling this to clients?

103
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:08,760
Yeah, and I would like to ask the audience Linux unplug calm slash contact. Is this a win for us if this becomes

104
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,600
Overnight, I mean, I don't know obviously cuz I don't have the numbers in front of me

105
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,400
but it seems like there's some potential here that if they turn this on for the pixel book and say

106
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,200
half a dozen other Chromebook models

107
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,400
it would seem like the install base would all of a sudden at least be in the hundreds of thousands of maybe not millions and

108
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:36,720
That seems like that would outflank just about every distro but Ubuntu at that point for desktop penetration pretty much

109
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,960
So it could be within a couple of weeks the number two desktop Linux distribution in a way

110
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,640
Am I wrong? Am I overstating that and is this a way you say in a way?

111
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,960
That's the key right like it's still it's still very but when I say in a way

112
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,680
I mean in a way that it's in a way that's gonna be a big deal for end users

113
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,480
I think it makes the argument for a Sputnik for say mom or

114
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,600
So do you see you see it hurt hurt?

115
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,640
No, because it's not gonna it's not gonna change like you and I and our audience's preference

116
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,520
yeah, but for I think it's more like it's gonna go after Windows and Macs and they're gonna do it using Linux and I think

117
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,280
It's just gonna be sort of like how Android is far and beyond the largest deployment of Linux in

118
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,920
Average consumers hands. Yeah, this is gonna be the second largest

119
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:30,580
And so this in a way is going to be the face of Linux to the majority of people using desktop Linux

120
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,900
That's what I say in a way right because it's the Wi-Fi work the hard

121
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:44,180
The hard numbers are gonna be such that the gravity of desktop Linux will be here and so that has a way of influencing

122
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,700
application design

123
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,780
consumer purchases

124
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,900
I mean it just has a way of causing incidental factors in the marketplace

125
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:57,340
What apps will it be that this you know that actually get you so this this new weird hybrid?

126
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,860
I don't know. I mean I I would be really tempted to load Libre off as funny as it sounds

127
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,460
But I just the other night I had a spreadsheet

128
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,980
I uploaded it to sheets on Google didn't really like what it did with it. Open it up in Libre. It was great

129
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
You know Calc just handled it fine

130
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:18,540
I don't know man. I think I if I was if I was advising like friends and family

131
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,180
I think I'm gonna start saying get a Chromebook and I think I'm gonna just like then

132
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,020
I'll just load the couple of side applications that they need with this functionality

133
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,020
We just had a friend

134
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,540
this week her she had an old like

135
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,460
2011 2012 MacBook and the video card finally went out on her and

136
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,060
She's and the Mac repair shops like well if you buy your next MacBook through us

137
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,980
We'll transfer your data at a reduced rate, you know, so they get her like

138
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,540
So we'll save you 60 bucks if you buy a $2,000 laptop through us and I'm like, what do you need the laptop for?

139
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,220
you know like those questions you always ask and she's like well, I got to check my gmail and

140
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,980
I I do, you know online social networking stuff and there's this exercise group that we're going on a bike trip

141
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,860
I want you know, it's Etc. She just goes into the all of its browser based and she's got an Android phone already

142
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,980
She's already got all the Google account stuff. She's had it for years

143
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,980
She's been in the Google ecosystem for years

144
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,140
And I couldn't come up with a compelling reason for her not to get a Chromebook and you add this on there

145
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,220
The maintenance burden is less. It's designed for that type of user

146
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,060
So there I think there are actually a lot of advantages there Wow Wow Jed

147
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,180
You see you're seeing in Chromebooks for as low as 60 bucks. That's remarkable

148
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,400
That's a that's a Lenovo. It's the C grade. I don't know what the grades mean, but yeah

149
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,820
60.99

150
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:40,820
It's amazing four gigs of memory. Yeah, many Mac. There's other aspects of Chrome OS besides price that are appealing to end-users

151
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,580
I don't know how many uses you I've already converted to Linux, but often they have

152
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:53,220
Problems with updates. They don't doing it. They are scared because they know Microsoft and the problem is you you just do a reboot

153
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,700
You're done. So it's very easy for the user

154
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,260
Yeah

155
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,420
Not even getting to the power wash aspect just the just the self updating aspect and and really the fact that they don't have to

156
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,740
Worry about data backups if they do go in on cloud stuff

157
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,420
The thing is once you start putting local applications on these Chromebooks

158
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,020
You're gonna start running into the hard memory limits and storage limits

159
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,780
So then the next shoe that has to drop here is maybe this is a 2019 2020 thing

160
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:22,520
But they've got to start putting larger disk and more ramming these are Chromebooks. Yeah, I mean the pixel books pretty nice, right?

161
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:29,920
Yeah, but maybe a slightly different more options. Yeah. Yeah. So JJ. What do you think not necessarily cheap Chromebooks for Linux apps?

162
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,660
It might be limited to the more

163
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,140
Premium products seems like that could happen. Yeah

164
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:40,260
Possibly and also I know I know that the plate currently though you can get the place for a Chrome OS

165
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,960
but only on a certain yep certain hardware type of devices only certain Chromebooks that have the

166
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,980
That have been approved to run the play store

167
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,100
So maybe it'll be the same maybe limited to the to the same exact Chromebooks

168
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
But if you happen to have one of those Chromebooks

169
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,500
Like I said at the top of this thing you're getting and all the Android apps

170
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,020
It's possible to run on that thing plus all the Linux apps is possible to run on that thing and all the Chrome apps

171
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,820
It's possible to run on that thing. That's actually kind of slick. That's a lot of that's a lot of choice

172
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,340
I don't know how good any of them are gonna look or function on that device

173
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,380
I mean

174
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:20,580
Could this be employed to replace the Chrome web store that I've been hearing for the last few years that Google wants to get rid of?

175
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,420
Oh, I don't know about that

176
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:29,540
My suspicion my suspicion is that it's really about hedging as they transition Android off of Linux

177
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,660
But that's for a future episode. Yeah, let's talk about you there

178
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,340
I can't even this is the story that neither West and I wanted to do this week

179
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,060
But we got to talk about it because I know you guys are gonna be hearing about it

180
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,040
So Jonathan over at LWN has a subscriber only post right now

181
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,060
It'll be out in a little bit and it covers some drama around a G lib C

182
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:53,980
and it's about the removal of an old joke from the man page from the from the C library manual and

183
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:01,100
I'm amazed but yet not surprised that it can spiral into such a shitstorm. Let me give you the background here

184
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,020
So think about think about this, you know

185
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:10,300
You're coming across the manual and you see some old kind of off-color joke in there and you read then you go

186
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,860
There's no reason for this to be in here. Let's remove it and you submit a patch to pull that out and

187
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:22,700
from there it spirals into a confrontation with RMS because the author of the joke was RMS and I'll read you the joke

188
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:29,500
It's not even funny that's the worst part so it literally says in the comments put in by RMS

189
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Don't remove

190
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,260
Says future change warnings and this is about the abort function in lib C

191
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:43,380
Proposed federal censorship regulations may prohibit us from giving you information about the possibility of calling this abort function

192
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:49,380
We would be required to say that this is not an acceptable way of terminating a program. That's the joke

193
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:56,220
It's an abortion joke that if they make abortion illegal, then they can't talk about the abort function in G lib C and

194
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,460
People come across this the people who actually are responsible for developing the software

195
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,420
RMS is not actively involved in the development of G lib C and they come across this like oh, let's pull this

196
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,140
Let's let's remove this and the developers have this

197
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,620
consensus based community driven development model and

198
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,540
They come to a consensus that people who are responsible for developing G lib C and if everybody agrees and there's consensus reach then they take

199
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,540
Action and they reach consensus

200
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,940
however

201
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,820
They didn't reach out to Stallman now Stallman is not directly involved in the development of G lib C

202
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,460
But of course, it is a good new project and that's where Stallman gets involved

203
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:36,620
He writes back after seeing on the mailing list. My decision is to keep the joke store just short and sweet

204
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,700
People respond respond back. He says nope. I stand by my decision to keep the joke

205
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:48,380
They apologize to RMS for not involving him in the conversation, but they say look, you know, we're the maintainers. We've reached consensus

206
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,460
We would like to remove this joke. We're not gonna we're not gonna put the joke back in

207
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,220
It's already been removed at this point. We're not putting the joke back in that's

208
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,980
When you might say Stallman got unimpressed with the situation and went for the authority play

209
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,860
He says this is a direct quote as the head of the GNU project

210
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,580
I am in charge of what we publish in the GNU manuals. I

211
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:17,980
Decided the criteria to decide by to he later adds I exercise my authority over G lib C

212
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,100
Very rarely and when I have done, so I have talked with the official maintainers

213
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,100
So rarely that some of you thought that you were entirely autonomous, but that is not the case

214
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,740
on this particular question

215
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,620
I made my decision long ago and it started where all of you could see it

216
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:42,380
What I love about RMS a statement here besides the pure authority play that just says I'm in charge of the manuals

217
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,260
And I've made my decision is the is like the sly

218
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,540
I have been pulling the strings behind the scenes the entire time, but you fools never knew it

219
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,820
He literally writes in his response. I

220
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,500
I've gotten involved so rarely that some of you thought you were entirely autonomous, but this is not the case

221
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,140
Like like he's sitting there stroking his beard with one hand while he writes this

222
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:11,180
So the maintainer who really is leading this O'Donnell they start the discussion back up, but somebody else who?

223
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,940
Alexander Olivia who? Apparently was on RMS aside just decided to on May 7th

224
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,340
Slip it back in the first change to G lib C in 2018 slipped the joke back in

225
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,740
He didn't post anything on the mailing list didn't ask any didn't say anything until he was directly

226
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,820
Questioned on it. And he says well we were waiting for a return to consensus. So I wanted to put it back in there

227
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,540
Which has now spun into?

228
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:40,940
this massive fight over who actually controls the project calling RMS an authoritarian leader and

229
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:47,420
I believe I haven't checked for the last couple of hours. I believe the thread is still spinning out of control right now on the mailing list

230
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,900
And it's all about this stupid joke in the manual at some level

231
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,020
It does just feel like an unfortunate waste of time. I'm not saying there's not legitimate things to be discussed, etc

232
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,860
Right, but if this all could have just been sidestepped and right. I mean the joke

233
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:08,380
Is really a proxy for a more significant question one which is relevant to both the developers and really the users of the project

234
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,220
the question is

235
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,900
How is a project governed and who makes decisions about which patches are applied?

236
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,900
Is it is it the overall founder of the GNU project and the person in control of the manuals?

237
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,260
Or is it the core developers who are the ones that actually have been doing the work for a long time?

238
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:32,060
And have made dissent consensus-based decisions on everything else really, but if you ask RMS, well, I've been pulling the strings all along

239
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,620
So they really haven't been doing their own thing, right?

240
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,060
It makes you question like is this the best governance model or what are the you know?

241
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,380
What are the limitations of our governance model and it's really when the dictator has bad taste?

242
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,260
Yeah, and RMS is sort of abrasive

243
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,620
Hardline no compromise style

244
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,020
Takes the conversation to an 11th and it's not a good idea to talk about it

245
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,820
But I guess it's really not about the joke. I just

246
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,540
It just comes across as he has a big ego and he puts himself first

247
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,540
And I wish that wasn't the case because I don't actually think that's usually his intention

248
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:11,660
But the abrasive nature in which he communicates and conveys himself often leaves one with that impression

249
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,980
And I think it harms the message to a degree

250
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,380
But I think it's a good idea to talk about it. I think it's a good idea to talk about it

251
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:24,220
But the abrasive nature in which he communicates and conveys himself often leaves one with that impression

252
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,460
And I think it harms the message to a degree

253
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:34,060
It sometimes would be a good sign to show that some lines are not worth fighting

254
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,020
It's not a good joke. It's old

255
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,900
Why not remove it?

256
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,900
Why not why not take the high ground here and go? Yeah, let's why not come up with a new joke?

257
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,340
Put something else in there. I think that's kind of what disappoints me, too

258
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,780
Uh swamp, uh had a couple of great interviews with rms up on his youtube channel

259
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,820
So look around for those. My next guess is rms. You can go youtube search that

260
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,580
Where he talks about what happens after he passes on

261
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,580
Like who's going to take over who's going to lead the who's going to lead the charge

262
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,980
and uh, I would i'll leave it to you I won't spoil it but uh,

263
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,260
I was surprised by his answer. I'll just leave it

264
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:22,380
I'll leave it as an exercise to go check that out because I think swap deserves the uh, the views so microsoft's most popular

265
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,980
product

266
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,860
Of all time their most popular big, you know, their big thing really is sequel these days

267
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,860
Where it's for software that they sell and stuff

268
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,500
And the most popular version is the one that runs on linux

269
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,220
coming out of build today

270
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,700
microsoft confirmed

271
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:46,140
That their most successful server product ever is the sequel server that runs on top of linux

272
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,700
This is the general manager of azure data in an interview with the register

273
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,940
He says it is this is a direct quote the most successful server product. We have ever released in terms of downloads

274
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,380
Our typical volumes are in the hundreds of thousands

275
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:07,580
We're looking at seven million downloads talking about cosmos db, which was introduced a year ago

276
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:13,740
It's a distributed multi-model database. So it supports um, sequel apis javascript gremlin mongo db

277
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:21,180
Azure table storage all of those to query data as you'd expect and it can be scaled to multiple azure regions or locally

278
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:27,980
Which turns out it's handy when dealing with regional data centers and it's become a big hit because people can mix and match the components

279
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,660
But the takeaway headline here is it's their most successful server product ever in terms of downloads

280
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:39,500
And it's the one based on linux and I think that just plays a little bit into the backstory of why they're getting so

281
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,740
So deep into all of open source and linux

282
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,380
Now wes I was all proud of myself

283
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,820
But uh, see we're sprinkling in app picks through this whole episode

284
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,380
We really are there's app picks sprinkled in all over the place

285
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,260
And we're going to start with our first one while we're talking about something microsoft related

286
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,780
I was like wes check this out check what check out what I found and you're like, oh, no

287
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:01,420
No, you don't need this. So with a disclaimer wes is going to tell you how you could do this without this tool

288
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,660
But if you've ever been like in a situation where a year ago

289
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,020
I needed to install windows 10 and I hadn't done it since windows 10 had come out

290
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,740
And I didn't I didn't know what the hell I was doing. I assumed you could just download the iso

291
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,780
And dd it to a flash drive or use etcher

292
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,580
And you're off to the races. No big deal

293
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
Nope. Nope doesn't work

294
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:29,020
The only way I could ever successfully write a windows installer iso that would actually boot into the windows installer

295
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,020
Was from another windows box

296
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,380
You can only do it from another windows box which totally defeated the purpose of what I was trying to do

297
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:41,660
Which was install a windows box to test something and so I found this tool called windows to usb

298
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,580
It's a bash script which writes windows 7 8 8 1 and 10 dvd images

299
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,820
To your usb flash drive or an external hard drive on linux

300
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,860
And it's really great because it's really fully automatic. You don't have to prep the thumb drive

301
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,800
It supports bios uefi fat32 and ntfs

302
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:07,420
It works with certain custom windows isos that are like corporate specials like smaller isos. It'll use stock windows bootloaders

303
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:13,980
It does not break efi secure boot chain and it's available as an app image. So you just download it market is executable

304
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:19,500
so it's a mod plus x and run it in your terminal and you're good to go and it'll start flashing a

305
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,740
windows iso that you already have

306
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,740
to a usb drive which

307
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,860
Is awesome for the next time in a year when I have to test out windows, but after I told wes about this

308
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,940
He was like, oh man. Yeah, I already got this figured out. You actually had to do this the hard way though

309
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,140
Yeah, that's true. Sometimes I like to do things the hard way

310
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,700
But it all starts with a little ntfs magic. I didn't know that yeah if you do it on on uh

311
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,180
Mbr you can just if you set it up, right?

312
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:49,580
You can just format it ntfs set the bootable bit and the ntfs partition headers have enough magic to

313
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,460
To get boot manager going and then the rest is an unfortunate operating system

314
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,020
So they have that all just built into ntfs. Yeah

315
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,620
That it's pretty slick actually. Yeah makes it very easy, uh to just to go from the iso

316
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,860
To having a fully functional thing

317
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,380
Efi also makes it easy because they're just booting with standard efi

318
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:14,700
So gpt formatted right set up all those standard efi file systems copy the rest from the iso and again away you go

319
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,220
Okay, so you so you get it formatted and then you just do like a like an rsync from the actually

320
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,540
Hmm. All right, that's not too bad

321
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,620
That's that's not actually as bad as I thought it was because I didn't realize ntfs had the boot magic

322
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,620
So that's there's a format option

323
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,380
I now that you say that I remember like a bootable option when you format something as ntfs

324
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,620
And when you do that, that's when you get that stuff that's cheating. That's cheating

325
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,220
I know it's just too it's just too slick, but we all have it now. Efi has uh saved us for better or worse

326
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,420
Yeah, yeah, but not everyone wants to do that or remember how to do that or look up the documentation to do that

327
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
So if there's just a handy app image

328
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,580
When it's already unfortunate that you have to install windows you might as well make it easy

329
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,580
I just pictured like a younger west pain like a year or two ago like

330
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,500
Rifling around the windows file system and the isos trying to figure out how the hell to get this thing to boot

331
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,940
Being frustrated that he couldn't just dd the iso image to the thumb drive

332
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:13,740
Like you had you had to do some uh, sherlock there some sherlock work many wasted hours attempting to administer windows from linux

333
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:19,660
That's right. Yeah. Yeah, you know what? Uh, you know what rms would say about that. I think that we should all

334
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,820
Make those businesses fail. Yeah, that's what he would probably say that about it. He takes a hard line on stuff

335
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,580
He takes a hard line on stuff. I take a hard line on my mobile service provider

336
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,460
They got to be great

337
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:37,500
And that's why I recommend ting go to linux.ting.com where the average ting bill is just 23 dollars per phone per month

338
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:43,260
It's six dollars a month for the line and then just what you use in minutes messages megabots whatever you use

339
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,780
That's what you pay. There's no contract. There's no really termination fee

340
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:52,940
They have nationwide coverage cdma and gsm and as you would expect from any jupiter broadcasting sponsor

341
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,020
They got a great control panel an excellent dashboard that gives you full control

342
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:03,340
Over your account your minutes your messages and your megabytes. You can get instant snapshots of what you used

343
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,380
Exactly what you can expect to pay at any given moment

344
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,100
They have an app on the android or the iphones that allows you to manage all of that and speaking of devices

345
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,420
They got a bunch that you can buy directly from ting or a whole bunch that they support

346
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,380
ting offers cdma and gsm networks

347
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:25,260
Which means they support a lot of devices and they have incredible customer service when I signed up for ting

348
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:32,060
I didn't realize I could activate my phone through their website because that seemed impossible back then but now it seems obvious really

349
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,820
I should have known better

350
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,300
Noob, but I called their customer service. Have you ever had to deal with ting's customer service? They're pretty great

351
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:44,700
They are great. Actually, I have it myself, but like not everyone some people I've recommended ting to have and I'm you know

352
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,500
I was like, okay. Well, how did it go? Never surprised it goes great. It does they're just so they're so friendly

353
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,940
I actually got a postcard once from one of the reps I talked to oh, see there you go

354
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,420
That's the extra mile. I left an impression. What can I say?

355
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,420
And it's just it's pretty great people love ting and when you switch over you get great customer service

356
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:04,700
So anyways, I called up the first time and uh, I was I was blown away by how how simple how straightforward

357
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,540
They will communicate with you. And uh, then yeah, I did get a postcard afterwards

358
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,380
So that really happened

359
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,100
It's smarter than unlimited because you just pay for what you use if you use less you pay less

360
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,460
And that's why the average ting bill is just 23 per month. I was paying

361
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:23,840
120 dollars for a couple of lines back in the day for three lines before I switched to ting

362
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,080
And now i'm paying usually around 40 something a month

363
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
linux.ting.com

364
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,320
That's linux.ting.com to support the show and get 25 off a device or 25 in service credit

365
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:41,200
If you bring a device linux.ting.com now that 1804 is out. We've got to start talking about 1810 obviously

366
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,000
Uh, that's what everybody does right and you can blame mark shovelworth for this actually because he just posted

367
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,880
Queue the cosmic cuttlefish

368
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,040
That's adorable

369
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,280
Super adorable. I'm in love already

370
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:00,480
I like that. Uh, he says it's time to start talking about 1810 because really it's really it's time to start laying the groundwork for

371
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,500
The next lts thing's got to keep happening 2004 2004

372
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,640
Oh, man, it's right around the corner

373
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,200
but in the meantime

374
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,600
We focus on 1810 and so he says he wants to take this early opportunity in the lts cycle to talk about

375
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,280
Things that he's starting to care more about and what a particular feature he'd love to see

376
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,480
People focus on is security. I like the way mark phrases

377
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,200
Like you guys are all going to work on whatever you're passionate about in ubuntu

378
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:29,760
But if we had one thing i'd really love to see everybody that everybody could incorporate into whatever project they're working on. It's security

379
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,560
Um, he says i'd feel great about that if we could systematically for everyone who uses ubuntu

380
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,760
Improve their confidence in the security of their systems and their data. It's one of the very true

381
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,160
true few unifying themes across every use case

382
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,360
That is that is so true that you know

383
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,040
It is it's something that the cloud people care about it's something the desktop people care about

384
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,640
It's it's something that all of the different uh aspects of ubuntu care about

385
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,800
I mean we need it to be to keep being a serious operating system, right? Especially yeah

386
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,840
Yeah, especially when it's uh, the core of so many services now and then uh mark

387
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,080
not putting the keyboard down for a moment wrote on the uh,

388
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:15,600
Ubuntu mailing list for development that it's time to start considering the new installer ubiquity next generation or ng

389
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,080
He says now let's start with a trip down memory lane

390
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,120
MDZ and I were shooting the shooting to the moon on a saturday afternoon in my apartment in london when the idea for ubiquity formed

391
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,640
It seemed crazy a live cd that would let people try out ubuntu and then drive straight into the install

392
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,000
Seemed like that was science fiction, but it quickly took shape on a piece of paper that i'd rather wish i'd kept

393
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Now 14 years later

394
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,800
We have new kinds of magic to draw on and perhaps ubiquity ng could take advantage of them first

395
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,000
We have curtain which knows how to take a description of a machine and do the right thing partitioning

396
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
installing and cleaning up

397
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:57,920
In fact curtain is neat and efficient and it's super fast. So we have the beginnings of what also could be an html5 installer

398
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:04,800
Third we have electron which is an html5 app framework used by the world of world-class developers like skype

399
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,920
Spotify and a ton of great apps on ubuntu fourth

400
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,480
We have snaps which are just amazing

401
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,760
Amazingly tasty ways to get the latest bits in the hands of your community

402
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:22,000
So who is game to sketch this further? So we may be seeing a new installer in the works

403
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,400
Wow seems to be uh in the in the cards in the air. What's the phrase there? Everybody's got new installer ideas

404
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,800
I i'd say it's probably time

405
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,120
I i'd say anybody in the mumble room have thoughts on ubuntu replacing their installer good or bad

406
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,000
As long as it can be customized to what the individual flavors need then yeah, i'm all for it

407
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,400
Yeah, definitely something that keeps the flavors in mind

408
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,640
I mean

409
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,240
I guess if there's momentum right if people want to do it if there's enough momentum and energy

410
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,680
Uh to see the process through what do you think about it being based on electron?

411
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,640
Well if it's easy, I I guess I I will as long as it doesn't have a drawbacks

412
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
Right as long as it works if they can make it

413
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,360
Reliable enough for all types of devices that would need to be installed on then if the end product's good

414
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,040
I'm, all right with it. I would love it to have a um

415
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:11,200
Anchor's back end interface that I could use on the command line when i'm installing it on a server somewhere or something like that

416
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,080
Or make sure you know like the bootstrap still works cleanly and all those things. I'm sure that won't change but

417
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,000
All right, wes i'm going to install so it's another app pick i'm installing it right now on the show

418
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,400
I'm going to see if I can't break my computer live on the air

419
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,520
So this one's a snap that I saw going across the twitters and it's called stress

420
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,720
Ng and it's a tool to load stress on a computer. So if you have for some reason

421
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,480
The desire to punish the subsystems of a computer like the cpu cache disk memory

422
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,520
Your socket connections io the scheduler stress ng is a rewrite of an old stress tool

423
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,420
That has many additional features such as specifying different operations your bogo operations

424
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:56,740
And uh executions of metrics stress verification on memory compute operations that are more stressful things like that

425
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,140
So I just went installed it here on my machine

426
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,620
And i'm gonna go ahead and give it a go stress ng we're gonna kick it off to the uh-oh

427
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,020
Oh, no, this is no good. Some

428
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,060
It says here that some io tests may fail

429
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,700
Uh, I don't know now i'm thinking maybe this isn't a good idea dangerously chris. Come on now

430
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,820
I don't know wes

431
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,900
I don't know. It seems like this might be a bad idea to do to my production system during the show

432
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,780
I'm starting to get cold feet, but it's a pretty cool

433
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,620
App, I love punishing systems when they're in here for review or seeing what a new droplet can do and things like that

434
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,540
So stress ng. Wow, it's got a lot of options. Holy smokes

435
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,780
I I here's a here's a flag for you though. Maybe this is the one to run with

436
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,780
So you run stress ng and then tack tack aggressive

437
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:46,580
Yeah aggressive. I like the sounds of it. Also. There is an option called dash-dash ignite cpu

438
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,620
Which will try to make your cpu run as hot as possible

439
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:56,180
That actually could be useful for other things as well. There's also things in here about just smashing the ios for instance

440
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,900
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it reminds me of that. Uh, you can smash your your disk ios

441
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,420
Uh, you can try to make your system timeout dash-dash thrash

442
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:12,020
Amazing. Oh, yeah force all pages and cause a swap thrash. That's amazing. That's

443
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,420
Have at this. I think this is going to be good. Oh some crypt some cryptograph stuff in here, too

444
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,460
Yeah, I could play with this for a while. All right. I'll play more with it. It's so easy

445
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:26,020
It is it's pretty cool. Don't break anything please this come on now just snap install the shows to do. I know right?

446
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,740
I know that's what I was just thinking. Maybe I shouldn't and then one more pick. I told you we're putting a bunch of insane

447
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,020
How did you find so many good things? You did it? It was really you that found this one

448
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:40,500
I found that last one, but you found this one castro. We've mentioned it once before way back in

449
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:46,660
The past maybe like six months ago. I'm not quite sure but it's castro is a command line podcast client

450
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,380
Those are all the words that we love right here on linux unplugged. Mm-hmm

451
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:51,860
Mm-hmm

452
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:57,140
So you can subscribe to all of your favorite jupiter broadcasting shows which is obviously all of them from the command line

453
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,380
And i'm actually using something similar to this. Although I think i'm going to switch to castro

454
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,960
for

455
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,220
Downloading reruns and things like that for like our automated idea. Mm-hmm

456
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,980
Just subscribe to the rss feed get it automatically and it just drops it in a directory

457
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
And then I got a player that reads that directory

458
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:18,260
And if you've got python already loaded on your system pip install and I sure do castaro castaro

459
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,300
That's probably not castro. It's probably castaro c-a-s-t-e-r-o

460
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,460
I don't know man. All I know is the command line podcast clients are the win. You're already on the command line

461
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:34,740
Command line music players are already great. Like this is just the perfect thing. Mm-hmm

462
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:40,340
I thought about I've thought about trying to get as many things like back into the command line as possible not because it's retro

463
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,900
But just because it's really convenient to have them running like persistently on a droplet

464
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,700
Yeah, right. I just did a tmux session. Yeah done. Yeah a tmux session, huh?

465
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,300
That's cool. That's fancier than what I was doing. That's good idea actually

466
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,460
I hadn't I don't know why I hadn't even I haven't even made that connection

467
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,100
I like having uh, I like also having the drop down terminal so the stuff I can put in the drop down terminal

468
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:05,700
I'm always about that. Oh, yeah, right got the ua going on the plasma desktop. Boom. So yeah, go check out castaro

469
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,700
Uh don't come to me for pronunciation folks come to me for the pics but not for the pronunciations of them for that

470
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:17,220
You gotta go to west pain. He is a pronunciation expert. That's right. That's what I say official official people come in town

471
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,260
I say go if you go if you want to if you want to know where to go in seattle get good food

472
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,700
Talk to wes and if you want to know how to pronounce something you got to talk to wes

473
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,460
It's a lot of work, but i'm happy to do it

474
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:30,100
Somebody's got to right maybe you'll just butcher it for everyone. I'm gonna have to bring you along with me

475
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,700
Because i'm going down to texas linux fest in a couple of weeks and if you're in the austin area

476
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,580
on the weekend of june at uh, uh, eighth and ninth

477
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,620
Come down and say hi to me at texas linux fest i'm going i'm going to be in austin texas

478
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:51,540
June 8th and 9th hanging out. It's the first time i've ever been i'm making it official right now on the show

479
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:56,260
I haven't even really made it. This is like the first official time. I've even said anything about it. What a commitment

480
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:00,020
Look at you all the way to texas. I know it's gonna be great

481
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:04,180
Which probably means the shows are gonna be crazy for a few weeks while i'm on the road, but time for adventure

482
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,500
Mm-hmm. It is it's that time of year and i've always wanted to go down to texas linux fest

483
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,340
And I had such a good time in texas last year. I was just looking for a good reason to go down

484
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,500
I'm, also going to go down and see our buddies from linux academy

485
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,620
And work with them on some of their production stuff. I have a suspicion that they're going to be

486
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:24,420
Some of their production stuff. I have a suspicion that you're just going to get all that all that tasty barbecue

487
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:28,500
Is am I right in this real the real motivator is to get levi back down to texas

488
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,820
Oh his homeland. Yeah, levi loves the sun

489
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,980
But yeah, once the dog gets to texas then barbecue then hang out with linux academy

490
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,340
And then hang out with the audience at texas linux fest. That's what is up

491
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:43,220
So if you're gonna be in the austin area june 8th or 9th, come have some barbecue with me

492
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,940
Maybe some brewskis. That sounds amazing. Come hang out with me and the linux fest guys

493
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,660
Is give noah a hard time for going to self instead. Yeah, I assume he's going to self instead because that's the

494
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,020
That's the really unfortunate thing is that it's at the same time self is so self in texas linux fest

495
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,620
That's the shape. I know what's going on

496
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:03,700
You got too much good linux in the world. Wow google io and redhat somewhat on the same day

497
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:08,100
And you got self and texas linux fest on the same day. Yeah, I could go i'll go say hi to alex jones

498
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,180
That seems like a great idea token run. That seems like uh, that seems like a really great idea

499
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:19,780
I've never installed gnu slash linux digital ocean do dot co slash unplugged go there to sign up and get a

500
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,700
100 credit when you create a new account and that'll last for 60 days when you go to do dot co

501
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,900
Slash unplugged its simplicity at scale spin up an entire linux rig in seconds

502
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:37,140
They've already got fedora 28 and ubuntu 1804 images good to go. They're updating their documentation

503
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:43,300
So everything reflects the absolute latest releases and with one click you can deploy an entire application stack

504
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:47,220
Or just the base rig and the real ninja combo with digital ocean

505
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:51,140
Is to take advantage of some of the built-in features of their excellent dashboard

506
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:56,660
For example, you can have dns and ssh keys already set up to go when that machine turns on

507
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,180
So within seconds of launching a new digital ocean droplet

508
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:07,540
I'm ssh-ing in with my key and my domain is already forwarding to digital ocean's name servers and bam digital ocean gets

509
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:12,180
It was assigned within seconds to my droplet. I'm up and running i'm using the real domain

510
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,340
I'm using something i'm going to have in production and as soon as I need to add more resources

511
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,940
It's easy to do so I added another 250 gigs to a droplet that i've been consolidating to in seconds

512
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:27,220
It's wonderful and they even cleverly name the device as do block storage

513
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,900
Uh, and so when I when i'm looking at it in in on the command line

514
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:36,100
And i'm looking at all the names of my devices. It's really easy to see. Oh, that's that's the 250 gigs

515
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,100
I just attached it just shows up right there and they've even labeled it for me and within seconds

516
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,540
I've added it to fstab and now it's mounted and it's it's brilliant because that's how I prefer to work

517
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,100
Digital ocean is my enterprise now

518
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:54,580
That's my data center with 12 locations all over the world 40 gigabit connections coming to the hypervisors ssds for every single rig

519
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,860
Linux runs the virtualizer kvm is the virtualizer

520
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,600
It's an ideal setup and go check them out because they're always adding new features new documentation

521
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:08,180
And new pricing like flexible droplets that are mix and match for the resources depending on your application

522
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,340
They also have cpu optimized droplets

523
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:15,860
If you've got some large compute workload and rigs with tons and tons and tons and tons of ram

524
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:21,140
Or you can just build something for five dollars a month. I just got done setting up a next cloud box

525
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:25,380
I'll tell you a little bit about oh, it's really nice. It's really nice. It runs so great

526
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:31,460
And it's just nice to know that it's under my control and I I really thought I really thought I would I would sort of

527
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,180
Scale back on some of that stuff as time went on and these things got easier to just go get some hosted service

528
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:41,220
No more than ever i'm building my own solutions and i'm using digital ocean to host it because

529
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,500
That part of it is so low friction that I can just get right to the work that I actually want to do

530
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:51,540
So get that $100 credit by going to do.co slash unplugged. It'll last for 60 days

531
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:55,940
Once you apply it to a new account, that's do.co slash unplugged

532
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,340
Now let's talk about the change coming to fedora atomic workstation

533
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,300
And this is going to lead us into some of the red hat summit news that we have

534
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:11,380
And it's uh, it's a rebranding. I suppose they're going from fedora atomic workstation to team silver blue

535
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:17,060
They're calling it a new initiative and they think it's a better realignment for the long-term goal

536
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:25,140
Of fedora workstation where they feel like workstation is terrible branding to begin with and they want to call it team silver blue

537
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:30,020
You can check out. Um, um, joe rezington did an interview with matt miller

538
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:36,500
From the fedora project in his new show late night linux extra where he goes into some detail about team silver blue rebranding

539
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:43,300
But that's sort of uh, that's sort of just a just a side note because there also is a lot of other things coming out

540
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,300
Of red hat summit that maybe are

541
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,900
Are bigger breaking news. So red hat summit is kicking off

542
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,940
It's 25th year if you can believe it and they're doing so with a big announcement with ibm

543
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:59,300
A big expansion between ibm and red hat's partnership and they announced it today. They're very excited about that

544
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:05,380
and ibm is going all in with containers on red hat enterprise linux and

545
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:12,040
And ibm is using red hat technology for their new ai and blockchain and internet of things solutions

546
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,100
One of those is probably gonna make a lot of money

547
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,580
And so red hat is probably pretty excited to be at the core of it

548
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,900
But the story that I am the most interested to share with you guys out of red hat summit

549
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,780
And this is the one that I think has some

550
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:29,060
Longer term ramifications and we've been wondering what was going to happen after the core os acquisition

551
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:34,660
Core os technologies are being moved into red hat container native products

552
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,780
And it looks like they're kind of doing a merger

553
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:45,780
They they write on core os.com with the acquisition of container linux. It'll be reborn as red hat core os

554
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:53,380
A new entry into the red hat ecosystem red hat core os will be based on fedora and red hat enterprise linux sources

555
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:57,860
And is expected to ultimately supersede atomic host

556
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:02,260
As red hat's immutable container centric operating system. Wow

557
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,020
I'm slightly disappointed. They didn't call it fedora core os

558
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,300
Yeah, okay, that's fun

559
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,380
I don't know what it means. I don't know what it means for um atomic

560
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,700
I don't I don't understand what it means for core os either

561
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,220
It sounds like core os and atomic are going away and we're getting red hat

562
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,540
core os

563
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:26,660
Is that the base then container linux is rpm os tree staying around what's happening?

564
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:32,660
Red hat core os will provide the foundation for red hat's open shift container platform red hat open shift online

565
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:39,480
And red hat open shift dedicated red hat open shift container platform will also of course continue to support red hat enterprise linux

566
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:45,300
For those that prefer its life cycle and packaging as the foundation for foundations to their kubernetes deployments

567
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,700
That's pretty thick and it seems like a huge huge development coming out of red hat summit

568
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,460
And I I don't know container linux will continue to provide a

569
00:42:53,460 --> 00:43:00,260
container linux will continue to provide a fast free moving and automated container host and is expected to provide the basis for new operating system

570
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,260
projects from red hat

571
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,460
Seems like there is some something big happening between core os and atomic

572
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,580
So I don't feel any less confused than I did when they bought them. Yeah, I'm just gonna say they've got a lot of different

573
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,620
Initiatives coming out uh from red hat and that's kind of why I wanted to go down to the summit if it could have worked

574
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,620
off 25 years of summits

575
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:24,500
That's really they're in san francisco this year red hat surpassed 150 million customers. That seems like a big number, too

576
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:29,380
So big big developments coming out of red hat this week. You got red hat also, uh

577
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,460
Sharing like uh the success stories

578
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,740
They have an ai all of these all of these events are talking about ai so much machine learning

579
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:42,100
So, I mean I will say all of it is is confusion aside like it's great

580
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:47,940
There's a lot of really good technology here and it's cool. It it is exciting to see a lot of it continuing and good things

581
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,780
Will come hmm. Yeah when we were watching the build stuff yesterday

582
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,940
Uh, they had uh somebody up on stage that was deploying on a red hat enterprise server

583
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,260
So that was you know seeing that on microsoft stage

584
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:04,500
Yeah, and then uh, jj you just dropped a link in the chat room about uh, microsoft and red hat working together on a project

585
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,500
What's this is about? What is this about?

586
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,980
They co-developed the first red hat open shift

587
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:14,340
Uh jointly managed service. Oh, they say by extending our partnership with microsoft

588
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:21,620
We're able to offer the industry's most comprehensive kubernetes platform on leading public cloud providing the ability for customers to more easily harness

589
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:28,180
Innovation across the hybrid cloud without produce without sacrificing production stability

590
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:34,900
Open shift on azure will be a jointly engineered and designed to reduce complexity of container management

591
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,800
Red hat open shift on azure will bring flexibility speed and productivity

592
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:46,020
Huh, so that's the actual product is red hat open shift on azure. I see. Okay. All right

593
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:52,580
It's getting very incestuous in a way. It's so weird. It's so it's such a it's such a it's such a strange thud

594
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:59,780
It's like a re-bloom of all these different branded technologies that are intermixed right and red hat and microsoft getting all friendly

595
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:03,300
Yeah, and I know we got to get over it. I know we got to get over it, but it's still it's still

596
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:09,460
I guess everyone's just making that paper. Yeah, I suppose so i've i've been following, um, some of the red hat stuff

597
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:15,700
But not the traditional red hat angle i've been i've been getting really into fedora 28 since last week's release

598
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:22,020
So I decided to play around with it to just give it a brief review on linux action news

599
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:30,100
And in that process it sort of snowballed into me setting up a fedora atomic system and a fedora cloud system

600
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:35,060
And experimenting with what and how fedora atomic works, which is fascinating. Everything

601
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:41,940
Is is containerized if you want to install some management tools you install a container which might have another container that needs to pull down

602
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,580
Uh, and that's not necessarily a bad thing

603
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:48,980
It's just it's a different way of it's a different way of working and sometimes those containers have had issues

604
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,660
So it felt a little still fedora atomic still felt a little raw to me

605
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,860
So I started playing around more seriously with fedora 28 cloud because that felt like it was uh,

606
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,860
further along

607
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:05,700
And one of the things that is very very different from the last time I really messed around with uh,

608
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:12,260
Fedora or really red hat on the server is there is so much documentation now for how to do stuff. Really?

609
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:18,260
Yeah, there wasn't really a there literally was not a singular thing that I got stuck on that I couldn't within

610
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:25,140
Usually my first google attempt find the answer in the first link or two. That is impressive. Yeah, and I think that's

611
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,260
Especially as you're coming back to it, right? Like that is a very welcoming position

612
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:33,460
It was and it I think it felt like I was benefiting from the fact that

613
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:39,460
centos reddit enterprise linux and fedora are all sort of sharing similar command

614
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,740
Syntaxes like they're all using dnf. They basically all have the same stuff in the same place in etsy

615
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,940
It's really all kind of the same now now that they're all kind of caught up with each other and all using system d

616
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,740
Consistent base of yeah, just say what you want to say

617
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:57,620
So I you know every now and then would find a one-off guide to how to do it on centos and it just happened to work

618
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:02,180
On fedora, but for the most part I was finding guides on fedora and a lot of it was actually official

619
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,380
Project documentation. I really should give credit to the project here

620
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,700
A lot of it was on like official cockpit project websites or fedora project websites

621
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:16,820
It has really they've really upped their game. It has really improved the situation with documentation around fedora

622
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,300
Has really really improved and if you're somebody who

623
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:24,980
You can get pretty far but you forget like what what what do I need to go to do this or what's this command in fedora?

624
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:30,820
What how do what's even like what is the name of this package if you're capable of like searching on that stuff and getting answers?

625
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:36,420
I I think you'd be impressed with how manageable fedora 28 is and um

626
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,860
That extends into

627
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:46,260
A couple of other aspects of fedora and i've had a real ab comparison this week with free nas

628
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:54,180
And cockpit now, they're not initially comparable, but i'll explain so you might be familiar with when i've raved about cockpit on this show before

629
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:59,380
Cockpit dash project.org got a link in the show notes cockpit is server management

630
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:04,900
That makes it easy to manage fedora boxes red hat boxes. They say it's for all linux machines

631
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:10,180
I've only ever used it on fedora systems. Yeah, i'd like to kind of i'm going to try it on some

632
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:15,860
I will that would be fascinating. I will give you a tour of it after the show, right? It is

633
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,100
It's first of all, it's simple and easy to use

634
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,900
And and it makes it just you know makes it if you're not familiar with like um

635
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:28,180
Setting up docker or managing se linux. It makes those things very very approachable

636
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:35,460
One of the things that I super super super appreciate about cockpit is that it has a brilliant

637
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:40,100
Se linux troubleshooter. So you you know, for example, I went to go launch a next cloud container

638
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:45,220
And I wanted my next cloud container to store its data on block storage on digital ocean

639
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:50,180
So that way I could blow away the container deploy a new container and all of my data would be there

640
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,920
The container is ephemeral. The data is persistent

641
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:59,220
And se linux wasn't having this it was blocking it because that container wasn't supposed to be accessing that file system

642
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,540
And se linux caught that and it blocked it

643
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:06,660
But that was preventing my next cloud instance from starting and it I wasn't sure. Well, yeah, what the hell's going on?

644
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,220
Why isn't my why isn't my container starting? Oh, you know

645
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:15,620
Damn docker blah blah blah blah. Well, you know i'm looking around on cockpit, which uh was just me sort of just uh

646
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,700
I'm just gonna take a look around for a bit because I don't know why this container isn't starting and I look over and I see

647
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,260
se linux

648
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,080
So I click on the se linux thing and it's got categorized

649
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:31,560
Uh of the recent types of se linux alerts that it's discovered much like the gooey tools do on the fedora desktop

650
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,680
and it's got

651
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,600
Solutions on how to solve it with actual commands that I could run

652
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,800
To flag that stuff as okay in se linux and and mark it as okay in se linux

653
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,560
It gives me the actual commands to run to fix the problem

654
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,320
And when that doesn't work for some reason it doesn't work for me

655
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:57,160
To fix the problem and when that doesn't work for some reason it's got another brilliant feature

656
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:03,880
That is is great. It's got an off switch for se linux that disables it until the next realist restart

657
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,160
So you can be in the web interface you can hit this button

658
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:12,200
You can have that process execute on it's it's our sync job. It needs on the file system

659
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,720
and

660
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:18,360
You don't have to worry that you forget to ever turn se linux back on because worst case scenario you forget to flip that

661
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,600
Switch back on the next time you reboot it's back on

662
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,960
And you could disable it permanently, but I just think that was really really nice

663
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,000
But the other thing that really made using fedora as a server approachable to me

664
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,400
And this is where I make the comparison to free nose

665
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,480
There's no interference with cockpit when you're managing a fedora system

666
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,200
There's no interference between you

667
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,640
And what you do on the command line and what happens in cockpit?

668
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,520
If you start a service via cockpit

669
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,840
It can be stopped via the terminal

670
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,840
If an error occurs in the terminal

671
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,400
You can see it in the cockpit journal interface

672
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,420
If you make a tweak on the command line, like you add a user it's represented

673
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,800
In cockpit, they don't step on each other like it does in free nas like in free nas

674
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,200
You can ssh into a free nas box

675
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:10,120
And it's it's bsd, but it's not bsd. Like you know it. It's it's like a it's like a small

676
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,600
Strip down bsd

677
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,000
You could say optimized but yeah, you could different

678
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,360
Yeah optimize and the reality is you could make config changes in there that will be persistent while the system is running

679
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:25,240
But they lose and they're overwritten as soon as the system restarts or you change something in the gooey

680
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,880
They override each other constantly

681
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,320
And for me, it's got to be something where I can really lean heavily on the command line

682
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,660
And then if I want a gooey for remote administration or to look at your resource utilization

683
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,800
I can use cockpit

684
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,400
And uh using cockpit too

685
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,320
It makes it really really easy to deploy docker containers or start virtual machines

686
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:48,760
And it can search docker hub and so you can put in next cloud it can pull down the official next cloud docker image

687
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,320
And get it started for you and before it starts it'll ask you

688
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,400
Well, how do you want to do the network forwarding? What parts of your file system? Do you want it to get to?

689
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,400
What would you like me to do?

690
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,960
If this instance crashes, would you like me to restart it?

691
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,960
Would you like me to always restart it or only restart it if you haven't stopped it previously?

692
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,160
And you can go in there and set tunables like that as well

693
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,480
Like don't use too much cpu don't use too much memory and then you hit the play button

694
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,360
It starts up the container you decide you no longer want that

695
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,880
It's one click you destroy the container you pull down a new one you reattach it to your data

696
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,880
And you got a fresh system again

697
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,960
And that's what I started playing with this weekend

698
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:30,360
And through this process I ended up moving over a whole bunch of rigs that were running. Uh, one was an arch system

699
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,600
maybe two actually

700
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,320
and uh

701
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:40,520
Ubuntu 14.04 so I don't think there was a six there may be a 16.04 system in there that hasn't been moved yet. So

702
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:46,440
It was a smattering of arch smattering of uh older ubuntu systems that I needed to do something with that

703
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,600
They're just been getting neglected. So while you were talking about this I spun up a

704
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,880
1804 droplet and now cockpit's running. It's it's in the repository. You just apt install and yeah

705
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:56,440
There we go

706
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,400
That was easy that I wonder about and i'd be curious to see the ui is the way it works with cockpit on fedora

707
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,960
Is that like parts of cockpit are modular?

708
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,840
So if you want to manage the disks then you install that aspect of cockpit if you want to manage

709
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:15,160
Docker then you install that aspect of cockpit. So like there's individual components of cockpit. I see you can load or not load

710
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,960
I wonder is that is that true? Do you see multiple cockpit packages on ubuntu or do you see?

711
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,960
That's let me look do a little search there. I'd be curious to know that because shit

712
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:29,800
I'm gonna i'm gonna put that on my systems because the nice thing about cockpit is you can manage multiple systems cockpit bridge

713
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,680
Docker machines network manager. Yeah, that's it. That's it. Yep. Oh shoot. That's great. Well then

714
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,880
Then everybody should do this. So one of the things that I decided to do was consolidate down

715
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:45,500
To a single fedora 28 instance and you might be wondering why fedora why not centos?

716
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:52,040
Or reda enterprise linux or maybe 1804 with right? Why not that right? So I want I want to address that because

717
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:00,840
That was I think the linchpin decision that I made and it's based on a multi-year project that i've been testing behind the scenes

718
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:06,440
To sort of sort out where I wanted to go in the future and uh, I don't have a lot of these

719
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:12,040
But every now and then i've got like these three-year long projects that i've been brewing behind the scenes so that we can come

720
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:17,960
On the air and say i've been i've been skunk working this for a long time and this is what I found and so

721
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,160
That's one of these situations. That's what we're going to talk about next

722
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,980
So let's mention linux academy go to linuxacademy.com

723
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:30,460
Linuxacademy.com slash unplug to sign up for a free seven-day trial of a linux training platform you sign up

724
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,580
And you get access to everything it's nice and easy like that

725
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:40,220
It's a full feature training library with everything you need to learn about things that run linux and run it and linux runs on

726
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:44,140
Everything you need to learn and get hands-on experience self-paced in-depth video courses

727
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:50,460
Hands-on scenario based labs that spin up when you need them ushn learning paths, which are series of courses and content

728
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:55,580
Planned by instructors and speaking of instructors. They have few full-time human beings

729
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,180
Topic matter experts that are available to help

730
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,900
That's huge. Wow, that's huge

731
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,900
That really is that is a unique advantage

732
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:08,300
And they also have something that I think is brilliant for those of you who are busy a course scheduler system

733
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:13,100
You can pick a course time you set your time frame your learning goals and they'll help you stick to it

734
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,220
They also have practice exams and quizzes to help get you ready

735
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:21,840
Certification training which are courses created specifically to prepare you for exams to get the big certs

736
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:28,720
Of course, they've got mobile apps and study guides like lesson audio personal notebooks and other tools that help you study while on the go

737
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,360
They're always adding new features, too

738
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:36,720
They added 70 plus new courseware challenges and all other kinds of content to linux academy

739
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,080
Just last month and they're rolling out new stuff all the time and you can try it out seven days for free

740
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:48,880
When you go to linux academy.com slash unplugged linux academy.com slash unplugged to support the show and sign up for a free

741
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:56,400
Seven-day trial big. Thank you linux academy for sponsoring the unplugged program go try out those hands-on labs take advantage of that platform

742
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,760
So fedora cloud has been kicking around in this in the back

743
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:06,880
Well really on digital ocean droplets, but I was going to come up with some some great story

744
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,320
But no really just on digital ocean droplets fedora cloud, uh, I think since they announced it in fedora 24

745
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,520
I don't remember when it came out, but it started as a fedora

746
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:23,520
23 22 system kind of got refactored around fedora 24 and since then

747
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:32,640
I've been running mb and nextcloud on and off on this system in production on and off for years now since really around fedora 22

748
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,960
Fedora 24 kind of did a big revamp and now with fedora 28

749
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:44,480
I can report that I have successfully been able to upgrade that box to every single release of fedora

750
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:50,160
I have drugged that box from the 22 days all the way up now to 28

751
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,880
and in that time

752
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,880
Nothing is broken

753
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,880
Not a single failure to update

754
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,560
Never has my nextcloud instance gone down. Never has my mb instance been broken. Wow, that's

755
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:08,320
That's some uptime. And I the reason why I wanted to do this is I said to myself I cannot use fedora

756
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,520
in production if I have to

757
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,760
roll the dice

758
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,240
And worry that every nine or ten months or so

759
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,040
I'm gonna break my system

760
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,880
And I thought well what i'll do is i'll put a couple of things that

761
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,680
That would be a pain in my butt if they go down but aren't going to wreck my day, right?

762
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,760
Doesn't stop shows from going on air. It's not right, but you still need yes, exactly

763
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:36,000
And so that was sort of the sweet spot for this job and I thought it's enough where i'll use it

764
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:40,320
But not enough where I will swear off the door if it breaks and um

765
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:47,040
I when I don't know when I when I did the update to 28 on that son of a bitch and it still didn't break

766
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,920
I sat back and went what the hell am I so worried about i've got snapshots. I've got backups

767
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,880
I'm putting all of this stuff in containers anyways, and all of the data is living on block storage

768
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,800
What do I care? And so um, that's when I started playing with fedora atomic and 28 cloud

769
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,320
I did a fresh cloud install of fedora 28 after I played around with atomic and I did just that I

770
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:13,920
I detached the block storage from the old 22 that had been brought all the way up to 28

771
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,720
Moved it over to the new 28 instance

772
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,680
installed cockpit

773
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,680
Loaded up docker

774
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,480
Set up a fresh next cloud instance connected to the old next cloud data

775
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,400
Same thing with mb and now I think I think i'm actually going to go even further

776
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,680
Uh and that when that worked that's when I went well then

777
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:39,520
Why don't I just add more ram and cpu to this system and just shut down these three other droplets?

778
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,120
Yeah, and move them all over if I put it all in containers. I have the data on block storage. I've got backups enabled

779
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,360
Uh, I mean it was just like this is really really great

780
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,680
And I thought I would just mess around with one or two things by the end of the night

781
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:00,240
I had everything moved over and i've also ended up setting up qo notes again where it's sinking back to my next cloud instance

782
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,200
Which is amazing. It's just been great

783
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:11,760
And that is slick. So i've moved i've moved over. Uh, my quosel backend is now, uh living in a uh, is living in a container

784
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:18,560
There is some usenet programs that are now living in a container. There is an audio stream process that is living in a container

785
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:25,920
There's an mp4 backup process that's living in the container you container hipster you i'm going crazy with these things on this fedora 28 system

786
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:31,360
It really seems like you uh, you're empowered to to maintain and to like set up your systems now

787
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,640
It seems like you kind of you came to a lot of systems that have been running for a long time

788
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:39,040
Not documented not easy to figure out what was happening. Yep. Yeah now it's clear and easy

789
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:44,400
It is really nice because using fedora. It feels very um professional grade

790
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,640
Not that and i'm not taking away anything from any other distribution just you know going into it

791
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,600
Sometimes I have bad experiences and it's like oh man, this is amateur hour

792
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:57,600
I tend not to share those sometimes but you know, I get very critical like this is ridiculous. I can't believe they ship this

793
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,200
This is embarrassing

794
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,720
I think we had a conversation about that earlier today when it came to yes

795
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:07,680
We did the other thing I was comparing it to recently anyways, uh fedora cloud is something a little different though

796
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:13,200
It's it's images that are really not meant to be ever installed on bare metal

797
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,160
They're really designed to run in a virtualizer

798
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,440
Um, they also make docker and vagrant images available

799
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,480
But you don't really just go get the image and dd the iso to a thumb drive

800
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:32,400
It's really something that is deployable by your cloud provider and it's a very bare minimal install fedora cloud

801
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,400
It doesn't really have much of anything, but everything's just dnf install away

802
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,880
You have your basic tools, you know, you can get nano in seconds. So everything will be all right

803
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,640
Right everything that you need is there or if not, it's it's right there you bastard

804
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:50,240
And so it's it's really simple to just dnf the couple of things you might need to get off the ground

805
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,240
and because the web services and the I set up also, um,

806
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:00,240
A mariah db server, uh, these are all in containers. So i'm not even using dnf

807
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,240
so the the core fedora 28 cloud install is

808
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,640
Is super minimal. It's the base fedora 28 cloud

809
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:16,400
With a couple of modifications to the ssh config and a couple of additional packages for cockpit and docker

810
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,120
And the rest is all running in these containers

811
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,600
which are destroyable

812
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,600
and um have their data stored outside the docker image

813
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,320
and that really was the

814
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:34,640
uh, just perfect for me because I I I can manage every once a year upgrading this fedora box

815
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,600
It works fine. And as long as my applications stay fresh i'm happy there, too

816
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:44,800
It was surprisingly pro. I think it might even be a sweet spot for you where it's it's not rolling

817
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,440
It's not arch, right?

818
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,680
You don't have to update it every week to stay safe

819
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,080
But it's also not a four-year lts where by the time you've come back to it your needs have changed

820
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:56,240
You've forgotten what you did or there's been a lot of different changes in like available software

821
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,280
One year might just be the nice cadence where you stay fresh

822
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,080
Yeah

823
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:04,160
Also, it does a lot of small defaults that I just don't really care to fiddle with anymore

824
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:09,040
like the ssh config is uh root login is turned off by default and

825
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,520
It only accepts key logins

826
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,480
Se linux policy is not intensely, um too stringent, but it's it's a

827
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:22,000
It's a reasonable default that I probably wouldn't have set up myself. The base package selection is just right

828
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,880
Um, which I wouldn't have had the expertise to respin a fedora. I could have done an archer ubuntu

829
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:33,440
Sure, but not a fedora one and um, the thing that put it over the top was the combination of the super clear

830
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,560
easy to find documentation and the

831
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,200
Totally solid implementation of cockpit. I really put it over the top for me

832
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,200
I hope you're not allergic to bees west. You're not allergic to bees. Are you? No, I am not

833
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:50,400
Hey, we got a visitor in the studio. Yeah, we do. Hey, buddy. We got a really big wasp in the studio right now

834
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,120
I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do about that. We'll just keep going on. Hopefully no one's ready

835
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:01,040
Yeah, right. He is allergic to him. Anyways, I wanted to share that with you and I also wanted to share if you um,

836
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,520
Are considering trying out some nextcloud

837
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:09,760
Which if you have q own nodes and you do that nextcloud back end it is some sweet evernote killing magic

838
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:14,160
Check out uh flockus f l o c c u s

839
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:20,640
Which syncs your firefox bookmarks to nextcloud bookmarks and what's really kind of nice about it

840
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,040
Is you can sync just one folder of your firefox bookmarks if you want

841
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,200
That's nice, which is actually exactly what I do

842
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,320
I have like a current weeks bookmarks that are just for things for this week

843
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,200
And that's what i'd love to sync to nextcloud. So that's what i'm doing

844
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:39,120
Um, you do have to have firefox 57 and you can't be using I think the built-in firefox sync

845
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:42,720
So that is the downside to it, but it was kind of cool and i'll have a link to it in the show notes

846
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,800
It's uh f l o c c u s

847
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,680
all in all, um

848
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,800
I guess what I what I wanted to convey is

849
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,040
If you've been skeptical about using fedora in production

850
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:59,040
I'd say give it a go for a while do like I did do a little test do a skunk works

851
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,960
See if it works for you

852
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,920
Obviously, there's so many great choices that i'm not trying to switch anybody

853
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,000
But I was really impressed and I did think it was kind of funny to be sitting there like

854
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:15,280
I'm loving kubuntu on my workstations and i'm loving fedora on my servers. Yeah, I had a fedora server

855
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,920
I think it started at 17. It went to maybe 21 then it you know ended up switching things up

856
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,920
But yeah, it was it was really stable. Yeah, I remember when uh

857
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,040
When I was really stuck like in a position

858
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,560
I felt stuck at least of trying to support reddit enterprise systems really before they even incorporated yum

859
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:39,840
Um, but around that time it I really I really grew to sort of dislike me managing redhat systems and I and I thought

860
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:48,080
Apt and debian were so and then later ubuntu were so much simpler. So saner defaults easier to update easier to maintain

861
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,080
That I went into it with I think that's why it took me

862
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:57,680
Years of really trying this out before I would accept that it was possible to do it because I kind of had a bad taste

863
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,520
from my sysadmin days

864
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,080
You know just sitting there having to man. I mean, do you feel that way with the systems you manage in your day job?

865
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,360
do you feel like the redhat systems are more of a pain in the arse to manage than the

866
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:12,960
especially if you don't have like a enterprise subscription where you get the nice fancy centralized management, it's just

867
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:17,600
You know, I think it's gotten a lot better. I think I think these days it is quite reasonable

868
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,480
I like the security story a lot on redhat style systems

869
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,800
Yeah, I felt that too. I felt that way too. I felt like oh, okay

870
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:32,320
Yeah, especially now right especially if you're if you're running containers or or any of the other solutions

871
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:39,760
Application availability like I I don't necessarily have to install it with with dnf if I can get you know

872
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:44,160
If it's crucial it apt or dnf doesn't really matter if you're doing it all through containers

873
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,880
And then most of it's still there right like 90 is in the repository. It's just those last 10 miles and that's

874
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:56,160
That that 10 that's well covered. I think what you just nailed it is having all this stuff moved into containers is

875
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,480
Is really kind of making the underlying os a lot less relevant to me

876
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:06,080
And so then it's like well who's getting that little implementation right that that minimal shim that I need who's getting that right?

877
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:12,560
And uh, that's that's a competitive space for distributions to to try to figure that out right now. I think it's very competitive

878
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:18,160
Yeah, right, especially that's like it's the container os or it's some tiny vm os that lives in a droplet or ec2 instance

879
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,400
You want it to be tuned well and just work?

880
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:26,420
So this minimal layer is something that I think is going to be like the big area of growth for distributions

881
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:33,040
Google I don't really think as part of io, but they just announced their own kind of container runtime

882
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:37,200
I think you saw this. Uh, we were chatting a little bit about it, uh in slack the other night

883
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:43,440
Um the g visor remember this yeah g visor g visor is sort of along these same lines

884
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:50,640
It's an open source sandbox container runtime. And again, it's about kind of making the underlying linux os

885
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,040
irrelevant

886
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,720
I think that's worth thinking about for a minute

887
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,320
Like what does that really mean?

888
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:00,240
If all of a sudden the distribution you're using doesn't really matter anymore

889
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:06,880
And maybe the fact that it doesn't even need to be linux anymore. So this is from google's uh,

890
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:14,480
Uh, uh, um, what do they call this google blog.com I guess and they're open sourcing g visor a new kind of sandbox that helps

891
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:19,760
Provide secure isolation for containers while being more lightweight than a virtual machine

892
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:26,720
G visor integrates with docker and kubernetes making it simple to run sandbox containers in production, but it's not a container

893
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:34,880
Applications that run in traditional linux containers access system resources in the same way that a regular application does by making system calls

894
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,840
Directly to the host kernel the kernel runs in a privileged mode that allows it to interact with necessary hardware

895
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,040
And then returns the results to the application with traditional containers

896
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:49,060
The kernel imposes some limits on the resources that the application can access these limits are implemented

897
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:56,160
Through the use of linux c groups and namespaces, but not all resources can be controlled via these mechanisms furthermore

898
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:03,920
Even with these limits the kernel still exposes a large surface area that a malicious application could attack directly

899
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:09,600
Of course vms are too much overhead too much bulk to emulate the entire hardware stack

900
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:14,640
So enter g visor a lightweight container slimmer than a vm

901
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,880
That maintains similar levels of isolation as a vm

902
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:24,640
The core of g visor is a kernel that runs as a normal unprivileged process

903
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,240
And is capable of supporting most linux system calls

904
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:33,600
I like the one way that described it think about it as implementing linux by way of linux

905
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,320
So it's just a use a regular user space process

906
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:41,360
That is an implement acting as a kernel and implementing a subset of the all of the kernel apis

907
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:47,760
So they've they've put a kernel in my kernel, you know, I mean not I mean so why I guess for isolation purposes

908
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:53,120
I guess they just answered that but their kernel inside this g visor environment is written in go

909
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:57,200
Which they say was chosen for its memory and type safety

910
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:04,240
And just like within a vm the application running within g visor sandbox gets its own kernel and its own set of virtualized devices

911
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:10,320
Distinct from the host and other sandbox. Yeah, it's like a very minimalized set of what a vm might do

912
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:15,840
But without all the hardware aspects and it provides the kernel. So from the application side, you're still just doing software

913
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,200
You're not worrying about running your own kernel

914
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:23,040
It provides the kernel but it implements a very minimal set because that's that's been one of the biggest flaws with containers

915
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:28,560
Right is that even though they are contained in many ways a lot of vulnerability showed up because there's a huge amount of sys

916
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,840
Calls that we have to defend against if you can instead implement safe minimal set. That's the aim here

917
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:37,440
Then you have a lot a lot less surface area. Yeah

918
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,160
and it also sort of

919
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:47,120
Prevents you from writing directly to that dirty linux, you know now you can target the g visor environment

920
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:54,400
And they could make g visor available for fuchsia in the future. They can they can make g visor run on free bsd if they wanted

921
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:02,160
Uh g visor can be thought of as an extremely para virtualized operating system with flexible resource footprint and lower fixed cost than a full vm

922
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:08,720
Comes at a higher price per system call overhead and some application compatibility though. So those are the downsides

923
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,440
see this this this

924
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:18,640
Idea of running your applications in containers is the future like there is when we talk about like is that in the distros repo?

925
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,720
I love the aur

926
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,200
Drop in the bucket compared to what's on docker hub drop in the bucket. Everything's on docker hub

927
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,160
And so here's how it works

928
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,400
Now when I spin up a next cloud container

929
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,600
I'm also spinning up a mariah db and i'm connecting the next cloud container to the mariah db container

930
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:39,520
So that way my database is in one container my next clouds in another container my qualsal cores in another container

931
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:44,480
And uh, they can all talk to the database container if I if I choose right? That's one thing that they have an advantage

932
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,600
I was right they're thinking about and are used to construct systems, right?

933
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:52,080
It turns out oftentimes you need those and it's not just a command line tool that sits by itself

934
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:58,580
Yeah, and so now I don't think about getting the packages. I don't think about dependencies

935
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:05,280
I think about well, what containers do I need and a lot of times they'll pull down dependent containers, too. So it's um,

936
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:11,620
I don't know. It's a totally different way of managing software and it makes linux a bit less relevant

937
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,440
Which is sort of the creepy thing about it

938
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,520
You know, I mean like it really does linux is kind of just an implementation detail

939
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,680
Yeah, because you can put docker on mac os you could put gvisor potentially on mac os

940
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:26,880
I don't know how much of linux kernel is dependent on but it seems like that might be possible

941
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:32,000
Especially if at the application layer they're isolating that stuff out. So in the future they could yeah

942
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,400
How much does this become a platform? Yeah, I don't know. It seems like it is a platform in itself

943
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:44,400
It is a busy week for the enterprise with microsoft and red hat and google announcing a bunch of this services stuff

944
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,480
Um and linux is playing a surprisingly large role in all of it

945
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,000
It seems like a weird time though because there's a lot there's a lot of these efforts that are

946
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,520
that are open source that are fit a lot with our fundamentals but

947
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,280
Feel somewhat separate like it's its own special subset of open source

948
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,800
That's like enterprise open source and two giant teams somewhere use it

949
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,040
Yeah, it also feels like we have several things going in slightly different directions in this regard

950
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,880
You know, you got what red hat's doing with core os you got g visor out there

951
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,800
You got what microsoft's doing with hyper-v and and special hyper-v environments

952
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,120
and um

953
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:22,080
You still got rocket out there doing its thing. Mm-hmm. And of course that you've have you heard the word about zones, Chris?

954
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,200
Zones are the word

955
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:33,520
Uh zones and jails haven't you heard about the have you heard the good news about jails free bsd at first west

956
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,520
Don't never forget

957
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,800
All right, well, uh

958
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,800
One more tease there for texas linux vest if you're going to be in the austin area towards the end of june

959
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,600
Or no towards the beginning of june june 9th and 10th or whatever it is

960
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:52,480
Come say hi. Come say hi eat copious amounts of barbecue. Hang out with me. Come say hi to the folks at linux academy

961
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,520
He'll be the guy covered in barbecue sauce. Just look for that all the time

962
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,720
Like just in in if i'm not actively eating barbecue

963
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:02,560
So you can't tell if it's me look at my shirt if there's barbecue sauce on my shirt 90 chance

964
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,720
It's me plus the little barbecue covered dog, too

965
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:11,120
Oh, that would be adorable. Uh, mr. West. Why don't they go get more review? Where can they find a little more? Uh, wes

966
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:15,040
Oh, maybe you should check out tech snap data systems

967
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,960
I hear it's a weekly podcast that covers systems network and administration topics. It absolutely does

968
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:25,440
Hmm check that out tech snap dot systems. I'll give a plug ski for tech talk today

969
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,600
We've been staying on top of all of the news this week at tech talk dot today

970
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:34,960
Ange and I busting through the headlines. We've got one more coming up later this week if you want to check that out

971
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,960
And then why not join us live on tuesdays hang out here with the virtual love and then you stick around

972
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:46,080
Get the ask nor program extra special bonus and call him up ask him what's going on

973
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:50,320
See what he's up to see how he's feeling see if he watched unplugged just ask him that

974
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,440
Yeah, you see what see what he says just talk to him. Just ask him how he's feeling

975
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,080
Yeah

976
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:59,280
And uh, you get a linux you get a whole linux experience when you come here on tuesdays go to jblive.tv for that

977
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:04,020
And jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for those lifetimes our website's linux unplugged.com

978
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:10,660
Linux unplugged.com slash 248 for links to everything we talked about and linux unplugged.com slash subscribe

979
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:20,280
For all the ways to get new episodes. Thanks for being here. See you right back here next tuesday

980
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:42,820
So

981
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:59,060
Man next week's gonna seem so low-key when all these events aren't going on. No kidding

982
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:00,420
It'll be a harder show

983
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:06,500
It was well this week I felt like was kind of hard because there's like so many things that aren't really interesting to talk about

984
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:11,940
But are important to the overall ecosystem. I feel like it was a rough episode really to be honest with you

985
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:19,540
Not not particularly happy with this one. Not particularly happy not not because you know anything we did well, I mean maybe but mostly just because

986
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:24,420
Uh, there's so much enterprise-y stuff and I feel like when we start talking dirty

987
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:28,740
Yeah, I feel like I feel like when we talk too much about containers people's eyes start to gloss over because

988
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:32,260
If you're not living and breathing this stuff, it's hard to connect with it

989
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:35,300
And yeah, we just want to talk about plasma. Come on. Yeah

990
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:37,300
Yeah, why are you stopping us?

991
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:39,220
I don't agree with that

992
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:45,540
Yeah, because you give the lots of views of the chance to try some things out and never heard of it because it's easy

993
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:47,380
I hope that's true

994
01:15:47,380 --> 01:15:49,220
Uh, you know, I hope that's true

995
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:55,060
I I don't know. My sense is that most people find it to be sort of the least interesting aspect of the stuff we cover

996
01:15:55,700 --> 01:16:02,180
But it is but it has so much momentum in that one space and it is so relevant to the marketplace like when you go to

997
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:08,660
To any trade event or you talk to anybody in the industry. It's only thing they're really thinking about. That's all they're talking about

998
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:31,700
It really has taken over the world
