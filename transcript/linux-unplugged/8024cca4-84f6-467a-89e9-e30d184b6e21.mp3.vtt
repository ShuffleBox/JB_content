00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
I'm on the podcast at social,

00:03.360 --> 00:05.440
so I actually do have a Mastodon account.

00:05.440 --> 00:06.600
It's funny, because I was asking people

00:06.600 --> 00:08.120
if they had a Mastodon account,

00:08.120 --> 00:09.440
and they were like, are you gonna set one up?

00:09.440 --> 00:11.120
And I was like, no, I don't think so.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.200
I don't think I'm gonna,

00:12.200 --> 00:13.400
I don't really wanna do any social media.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.080
I'm pretty burned out on social media.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.120
And then I realized I actually already

00:16.120 --> 00:17.320
had a Mastodon account set up,

00:17.320 --> 00:18.640
and that I was using it actively.

00:18.640 --> 00:19.960
But I just didn't think of it as Mastodon,

00:19.960 --> 00:21.160
because I'm just using it to interact

00:21.160 --> 00:25.520
with the Podcasting 2.0 folks in the community over there.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.640
And so I didn't even really consider it Mastodon.

00:27.640 --> 00:31.400
But it totes my goats is, so I am,

00:31.400 --> 00:32.440
see, if you wanna come follow,

00:32.440 --> 00:35.000
I'm really not tweeting much for public consumption.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.120
It's mostly for people that are interested in podcasting,

00:37.120 --> 00:39.200
but I'll put a link to my profile.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.880
It's podcastindex.social, and guess what?

00:41.880 --> 00:43.200
I'm Chris Lass on there.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.680
Oh, hey, I like podcasting.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.640
Yeah, you might wanna, have I sent you an invite?

00:47.640 --> 00:49.980
I don't think so. I wonder if I could.

00:49.980 --> 00:51.080
I'll have to figure that out.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.760
But I got a little picture of Levi on my profile.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.040
I think Brent took that picture, too, I think.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.400
Do you remember when it was taken?

00:58.400 --> 00:59.520
Probably the sprint,

00:59.520 --> 01:02.360
because it's Levi laying on the couch, I think.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.600
I mean, when does Levi not lay on the couch?

01:04.600 --> 01:05.440
That's the thing,

01:05.440 --> 01:08.120
that doesn't really narrow it down, I realize.

01:08.120 --> 01:13.120
Hello, friends, and welcome back

01:18.080 --> 01:20.060
to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:20.060 --> 01:20.900
My name is Chris.

01:20.900 --> 01:21.720
My name is Wes.

01:21.720 --> 01:22.760
And my name is Brent.

01:22.760 --> 01:26.080
Hello, gentlemen, both looking very sharp today, and I-

01:26.080 --> 01:28.080
We had to trade outfits at the last minute, can you tell?

01:28.080 --> 01:30.360
I can, but I like that you guys make the effort.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.400
You know, it's a show day, it's special.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.840
Well, coming up today, if we had a Linux time machine,

01:35.840 --> 01:38.440
what would we change in our Linux past

01:38.440 --> 01:41.400
if we could go back and make one tweak or correction?

01:41.400 --> 01:43.720
Do we have any regrets, something we would do differently,

01:43.720 --> 01:46.840
maybe put us on a better Linux path?

01:46.840 --> 01:48.160
Each one of us will share a bit

01:48.160 --> 01:50.520
of a retrospective lesson today.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.400
Then, of course, we'll round it up with some great boosts

01:52.400 --> 01:56.280
and emails and a lot more, like we always do.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.840
So before we go any further,

01:57.840 --> 02:00.760
let's say a big, hearty welcome to the people

02:00.760 --> 02:03.220
who decided to make it live, to make it special,

02:03.220 --> 02:05.120
time-appropriate greetings, virtual log.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.080
Hello, Mumble Room.

02:06.080 --> 02:06.920
Hello.

02:06.920 --> 02:07.740
Hello, hello, hello.

02:07.740 --> 02:08.580
Hello, Chris.

02:08.580 --> 02:10.080
Hello, Wes, and hello, Brent.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.200
Aw.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.200
Who invited Zoidberg?

02:12.200 --> 02:14.080
Nice of Zoidberg to make it, yeah.

02:14.080 --> 02:17.760
I apologize, you have a sleepy crew here today.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.000
Like, none of us got any sleep last night.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.120
So I don't know how today's show

02:22.120 --> 02:23.000
was even gonna go.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.080
Whatever happens, don't hold us accountable, please.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.880
I wasn't even supposed to be here.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.880
I was gonna be in a small, little beach town in Oregon.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.920
I'm nothing fancy, but a little beach town

02:33.920 --> 02:36.840
celebrating my son's 13th birthday,

02:36.840 --> 02:38.880
which if you've been listening since I started having kids,

02:38.880 --> 02:40.480
how crazy is that?

02:40.480 --> 02:41.700
Because people have been.

02:41.700 --> 02:42.540
I know.

02:42.540 --> 02:44.740
People have been listening since before I had kids.

02:44.740 --> 02:45.900
That's crazy.

02:45.900 --> 02:49.120
And as we were getting ready to head out,

02:49.120 --> 02:51.760
and you know, of course,

02:51.760 --> 02:54.000
I've arranged the entire last week

02:54.000 --> 02:55.120
of all of our recordings

02:55.120 --> 02:56.920
to make sure I could take Friday and Saturday off.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.360
Yeah, you've been planning this for a while,

02:58.360 --> 02:59.620
getting jupe-ship shape.

02:59.620 --> 03:01.600
You know, like a lot of pre-planning to make this happen.

03:01.600 --> 03:02.800
Yep, trying to get parts in,

03:02.800 --> 03:04.200
trying to get her into the shop,

03:04.200 --> 03:05.160
all that kind of stuff.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.320
And of course, Friday morning,

03:06.320 --> 03:07.400
as we were supposed to set out,

03:07.400 --> 03:09.720
we realized Dylan's sick.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.320
And it's the kind of sick, like,

03:12.280 --> 03:13.840
maybe this gets better,

03:13.840 --> 03:15.520
maybe this gets a lot worse.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.460
And the last time we went to this town,

03:17.460 --> 03:19.920
it turned out it was like early January 2020.

03:19.920 --> 03:21.640
It turned out we think D and I had COVID,

03:21.640 --> 03:23.120
but we didn't know it at the time.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.640
And so we were horrendously sick,

03:24.640 --> 03:26.240
and we had locked ourselves into the RV,

03:26.240 --> 03:28.280
and that's how we spent our time in this town.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.120
And we just didn't want the-

03:29.120 --> 03:30.440
You didn't want to do that again.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.720
No, and we didn't want to have Dylan sick on the road.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.060
Fair, yeah.

03:34.060 --> 03:34.980
But canceling this road trip,

03:34.980 --> 03:36.300
he was just totally crushed, right?

03:36.300 --> 03:38.280
And I was super bummed and all of that.

03:38.280 --> 03:41.360
So we decided to kind of do something a little simpler

03:41.360 --> 03:43.000
and just head out to our favorite spot in the woods,

03:43.000 --> 03:44.300
which is only like two hours out, right?

03:44.300 --> 03:45.640
So if anything goes wrong, we're not far away.

03:45.640 --> 03:46.840
You're still near home base.

03:46.840 --> 03:47.680
Yeah.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.040
So we decided, okay, let's do that.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.160
And plus we got a later start in the day and all that.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.440
So this is a better route to go.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.880
And I call up the place we're going to stay and I cancel.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.900
And we start heading out.

03:59.240 --> 04:02.200
And my wife, Hadia, she's chasing the RV in her car.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.440
So she's behind me, right?

04:03.440 --> 04:05.280
She's following us.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.580
And as we hit highway 20, heading east,

04:07.580 --> 04:08.600
heading towards the mountains,

04:08.600 --> 04:10.720
we're doing about 60 miles per hour.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.560
And my wife pings me on the two-way radio.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.720
And she says,

04:13.720 --> 04:17.160
we have some kind of major water leak going on right now.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.560
And I'm like, what, what, what?

04:18.560 --> 04:20.440
She's like, there's water pouring out of the RV.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.960
It's covering my windshield.

04:21.960 --> 04:23.160
I'm running my windshield wipers.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.520
There's so much water coming out right now.

04:24.520 --> 04:25.360
That's insane.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.700
And I'm like, oh my God, right?

04:27.700 --> 04:28.920
I just think, oh no,

04:28.920 --> 04:31.120
if we have another major water leak happen,

04:31.120 --> 04:32.800
this place is wrecked.

04:32.800 --> 04:33.620
We've already had a major spill once.

04:33.620 --> 04:34.460
That's pretty much it.

04:34.460 --> 04:35.300
Yeah, right?

04:35.300 --> 04:36.320
How much more can you withstand?

04:36.320 --> 04:37.280
Game over, man.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.360
Game over, right?

04:38.360 --> 04:41.080
So I go into total disaster mode.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.480
At 60 miles an hour.

04:42.480 --> 04:43.840
Right, and I'm like, Dylan,

04:43.840 --> 04:45.000
help me find a spot to pull over

04:45.000 --> 04:46.120
because he's riding passenger, right?

04:46.120 --> 04:46.960
And he's like, I think that's up there.

04:46.960 --> 04:47.800
I'm like, yeah, okay, we're gonna do it.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.400
And I pull over like super quick.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.560
I don't even know how the RV stopped like that.

04:51.560 --> 04:53.080
And unfortunately, like it was so quick

04:53.080 --> 04:53.960
and it was such a small space,

04:53.960 --> 04:54.840
Adia had to keep going

04:54.840 --> 04:56.800
because there's a whole line of cars behind her.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.920
So she keeps on going down the road.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.240
I pull over and I start the troubleshooting, right?

05:01.240 --> 05:02.560
I head outside and these vehicles,

05:02.560 --> 05:03.840
boom, boom, boom.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.860
They're blasting past me 65, 70 miles per hour.

05:06.860 --> 05:08.140
There's no room on the shoulder,

05:08.140 --> 05:10.480
but of course that's the side,

05:10.480 --> 05:12.400
the driver's side where I was pulled over

05:12.400 --> 05:13.240
that was next to the road.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.720
That's the side where the water bay is at.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.400
And I can just see water pouring out of the water bay.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.520
And I go, God.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.640
So I have to open up the storage bay,

05:20.640 --> 05:21.960
which is like in the road.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.200
It's in the highway.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.640
Cause there's just no room here.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.340
And my phone starts blowing up and I think,

05:26.340 --> 05:27.700
okay, this is Adia.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.000
So I tap on the notification.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
I opened up, no, no, of course not.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.800
It was a super nasty telegram.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.200
Something got somebody upset

05:37.200 --> 05:39.840
that someone else said on another JB show.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.140
And I of course had enabled this comment

05:42.140 --> 05:43.840
because they were on the JB airwaves.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.320
And so I was an awful person.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.360
And here I'm just getting like this really nasty message

05:48.360 --> 05:50.380
and I'm standing on the side of the road,

05:50.380 --> 05:52.140
water's pouring out of my RV.

05:52.140 --> 05:53.360
I got a sick kid.

05:53.360 --> 05:54.720
It's his birthday, right?

05:54.720 --> 05:55.880
I'm in full dad mode,

05:55.880 --> 05:57.940
just trying to save a birthday road trip.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.340
I'm getting chewed out for something

05:59.340 --> 06:02.040
someone else said on another show.

06:02.040 --> 06:05.280
And I realized I've screwed up here.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.060
I've made some bad choices.

06:07.060 --> 06:10.720
Like this didn't come in via like the contact form.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.760
It didn't come in like via boost,

06:12.760 --> 06:14.680
not using any of the systems that we've built

06:14.680 --> 06:16.800
to let us manage how and when

06:16.800 --> 06:19.600
like super emotionally charged criticism comes in.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.800
Because the way you do this over the longterm

06:21.800 --> 06:23.860
is you realize I'm not in the head space

06:23.860 --> 06:25.400
to be really criticized right now,

06:25.400 --> 06:27.240
to be told I'm the worst person on the planet.

06:27.240 --> 06:28.680
Maybe I'll put that off, right?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.400
Cause this wasn't the right time.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.760
Yeah, I mean like, you know,

06:31.760 --> 06:33.760
before you go look at one of our videos on YouTube,

06:33.760 --> 06:35.160
like you prepare yourself for that.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.000
Right, yeah.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.320
Yeah, or like I sit down when I'm in the right space

06:38.320 --> 06:40.200
and I read the feedback and I prepare it

06:40.200 --> 06:43.360
and I bring it into the shows and it's a task that I do.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.320
But I way overshot on my availability.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.140
And this moment really brings it in, right?

06:47.140 --> 06:50.320
Cause there's a super emotionally charged message.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.520
There's no way for me to choose

06:51.520 --> 06:53.240
if this is the right time for this or not.

06:53.240 --> 06:56.400
So I gotta make some significant changes in that regard.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.760
I hate to do it.

06:57.760 --> 06:58.760
After 15 years though,

06:58.760 --> 07:00.840
I think I've got to restructure how this is gonna work,

07:00.840 --> 07:02.820
but I'll figure that out later.

07:02.820 --> 07:04.000
I had a problem to solve, right?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.660
I'm on the side of the road.

07:05.660 --> 07:07.040
Vehicles are blasting by me.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.280
I'm like opening up the bay.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.480
I'm looking at what's going wrong.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.120
I'm like trying to troubleshoot it

07:11.120 --> 07:13.280
and radioing my wife to see if I can get her to turn around.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.120
She's already coming on her way back.

07:15.120 --> 07:17.280
And I realized I'm looking at it.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.800
And like what's happening is my water bay,

07:19.800 --> 07:21.440
which is a storage bay in my RV,

07:21.440 --> 07:23.400
is like turning into a bathtub.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.480
And with my pump,

07:24.480 --> 07:26.720
the water pump that takes it from our fresh tank

07:26.720 --> 07:28.520
and supplies it to all the faucets,

07:28.520 --> 07:32.320
the water pump is just like pouring water out of the pump.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.960
And it's like cracked wide open.

07:33.960 --> 07:37.280
And we had just filled up like 75 gallons of water.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.600
So there's a lot of water to go.

07:38.600 --> 07:42.600
And I'm like, oh man, this is a big waste of water.

07:42.600 --> 07:43.440
That's no good.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.160
That really matters to us.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.480
But of course the other big problem was

07:46.480 --> 07:48.480
is we were heading to an off-grid spot.

07:48.480 --> 07:49.440
So we needed this water.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.200
There's no water out there for us to drink.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.760
We wouldn't last a day out there.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.080
A functioning water system was kind of part of the plan.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.020
So I try to get my big ass 40 foot RV

07:57.020 --> 07:58.860
back onto the highway from a dead stop.

07:58.860 --> 08:01.120
I do a quick turnaround in a driveway,

08:01.120 --> 08:03.560
like whipping this thing around like it's a sedan.

08:03.560 --> 08:04.940
And I head back to a friend's house

08:04.940 --> 08:07.260
where they had a driveway I knew we could work in.

08:07.260 --> 08:10.480
And Hadi and I just sort of sat down and decided,

08:10.480 --> 08:12.880
we got to solve this ourselves.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.480
Because every shop is closed.

08:14.480 --> 08:15.160
It's a Saturday.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.440
They won't let us in for months.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.080
We've already tried to, we knew this thing

08:18.080 --> 08:18.840
was starting to have problems.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.240
We tried to get it replaced weeks ago.

08:20.240 --> 08:20.920
Oh, wow.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.960
Everybody's like, well, we could see a mid-June,

08:22.960 --> 08:24.160
early September.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.160
I'm like, no.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.880
No, so we just thought, you know what?

08:27.880 --> 08:30.680
We have got to do the work to replace this thing.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.240
So that's what we did in a driveway.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.200
Thankfully, we already had a spare pump.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.240
It was just a matter of getting it installed.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.840
Come on.

08:38.840 --> 08:39.720
Yeah, there you go.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.220
You got it.

08:40.220 --> 08:40.720
You got it.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.220
Yeah.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.920
Oh, that's good.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.080
Nicely done.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.320
That'll be a lot easier.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.240
Now, we've got to get back in that same spot.

08:53.240 --> 08:54.400
Yeah.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.240
And then somehow fit the drill back in there.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.520
Oh, god.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.240
It's a tight fit.

09:01.240 --> 09:04.400
So we're trying to get a new pump installed

09:04.400 --> 09:08.840
that we thankfully already had, but didn't exactly

09:08.840 --> 09:10.620
plan to do it right now.

09:10.620 --> 09:13.640
And we're trying to improvise and get it installed,

09:13.640 --> 09:14.640
but it doesn't fit.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.160
Like, it's not the same size.

09:17.160 --> 09:20.480
And so, well, we're coming up with solutions on the fly,

09:20.480 --> 09:22.560
as they say.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.120
No time like the present.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.880
We did, ultimately, we got it installed.

09:25.880 --> 09:26.440
What?

09:26.440 --> 09:27.640
Nicely done.

09:27.640 --> 09:30.720
I think the best moment was we had all the tools,

09:30.720 --> 09:32.840
and we'd already owned the pump, so we had that.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.040
So we really, it was just a matter of finding a way

09:35.040 --> 09:37.720
to plug up the tank, so that way the tank didn't completely

09:37.720 --> 09:39.800
drain the remainder all over us while we were swapping.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.840
And so you could actually do the work?

09:40.840 --> 09:41.960
Yeah, right.

09:41.960 --> 09:47.080
And we had just the right sized cap that just perfectly

09:47.080 --> 09:48.360
plugged that hose.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.120
So it was for something else, like a random cap

09:50.120 --> 09:51.200
that was just around the RV?

09:51.200 --> 09:51.720
Yeah.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.640
So it held the water back while we did the work,

09:53.640 --> 09:56.560
so it was way less messy than we were expecting it.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.400
And so, ultimately, we got it all put together.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.360
And I think we got back on the road

10:00.360 --> 10:03.360
and ended up at the campsite in the woods

10:03.360 --> 10:06.520
probably earlier than if we would have made it to Oregon,

10:06.520 --> 10:06.920
you know what I mean?

10:06.920 --> 10:08.040
Like if we'd stuck to the original plan.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.120
So even with everything that went wrong, wow.

10:11.120 --> 10:11.640
Yeah.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.600
And it's been a great time.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.560
I didn't realize, like, oh, I miss

10:15.560 --> 10:17.640
going out to my favorite spot in the woods.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.520
We got a good cell signal, so we can still stay connected.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.040
And it's springtime.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.680
It's fantastic.

10:23.680 --> 10:24.720
There's bears.

10:24.720 --> 10:25.440
There's elk.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.200
There's cows.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.200
There's bunnies.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.720
There's a river.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.920
And the water right now is crystal clear, crystal clear

10:31.920 --> 10:32.720
river water, Wes.

10:32.720 --> 10:33.920
You can see the bottom of the river.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.320
And just the right kind of temperatures, too.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.400
It's not too hot, but you can get a little warm in the sun,

10:37.400 --> 10:38.680
but it's crisp outside.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.920
We probably spent three, four hours outside yesterday.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.400
Got a new grill that we set up.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.280
It turned out to be really, really nice.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.280
So I'm glad we did it.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.680
And it always is a great opportunity

10:49.680 --> 10:51.160
to think about things.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.920
And one of the things that's on our minds right now

10:53.920 --> 10:58.840
is we are rebuilding the Jupiter Broadcasting website.

10:58.840 --> 11:02.520
And we have begun a conversation with the community

11:02.520 --> 11:04.640
in the new Office Hours podcast.

11:04.640 --> 11:07.040
OfficeHours.hair, if you haven't checked that out yet,

11:07.040 --> 11:09.560
that's what was available, OfficeHours.hair.

11:09.560 --> 11:13.360
The episode where we kick this off is New Website Energy.

11:13.360 --> 11:16.240
Myself, Wes, Alex, and Brent sit down,

11:16.240 --> 11:18.640
and we kick around our goals for the new website.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.000
But the great thing that happened,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.400
this is exactly what I was hoping would happen with Office

11:22.400 --> 11:24.320
Hours, is once we opened up to the community,

11:24.320 --> 11:28.320
we started getting new ideas of stuff we never even considered,

11:28.320 --> 11:30.400
which could open up our production and some

11:30.400 --> 11:31.960
of our back end stuff to the community

11:31.960 --> 11:35.400
and help in a way I never even thought about until somebody

11:35.400 --> 11:36.280
suggested something.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.360
So that conversation is just kicking off

11:38.360 --> 11:40.800
on how we're going to rebuild the JB website, what features

11:40.800 --> 11:42.120
it's going to have.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.880
If you want to participate in that,

11:43.880 --> 11:46.640
go check out episode three of OfficeHours.hair,

11:46.640 --> 11:48.380
and then join us for the next live stream.

11:48.380 --> 11:50.880
I'm doing these on Tuesdays as an opportunity

11:50.880 --> 11:52.880
for the community to get together and hang out,

11:52.880 --> 11:54.400
ask questions, and suggest stuff.

11:54.400 --> 11:58.880
So join us on Tuesday the 10th at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

11:58.880 --> 12:02.120
And we'll cover some of the feedback on that.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.400
See you in the office.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.280
See you in my office.

12:04.280 --> 12:07.120
Yeah, and there is a GitHub that Brent has set up

12:07.120 --> 12:09.400
that has conversations and threads going.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.680
Is there anything we need to let people know about that,

12:11.680 --> 12:13.240
like where to go and stuff, Brent?

12:13.240 --> 12:15.000
Well, I think the best place to go

12:15.000 --> 12:17.160
would just be the Jupyter Broadcasting GitHub,

12:17.160 --> 12:20.160
and we have a little like jupyterbroadcasting.com.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.560
What do you call them, projects?

12:21.560 --> 12:22.480
I'm still new to this.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.100
Yeah, there's a repo, there's a project,

12:24.100 --> 12:26.220
and there's a discussion focused specifically

12:26.220 --> 12:28.080
around OfficeHours episode three.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.120
Oh, thanks, Wes.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.120
Yeah, and there's some great ideas being bounced around

12:31.120 --> 12:31.600
there.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.040
I've been, it's way better than Reddit.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.240
Go there instead.

12:35.240 --> 12:36.520
It's really great stuff.

12:36.520 --> 12:51.640
I want to talk about this new gaming snap that Canonical is

12:51.640 --> 12:54.680
going all in on the gaming experience on Ubuntu.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.920
And we've started building out a team dedicated

12:56.920 --> 12:59.280
to working on just that.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.560
They have a call out for testing on a new Steam

13:01.560 --> 13:04.120
snap, which brings along everything

13:04.120 --> 13:05.920
you need to run Steam games via Proton,

13:05.920 --> 13:08.800
they write, or of course, native Linux games.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.360
You and I both noticed, too, that at the Linux App Summit

13:11.360 --> 13:13.760
that was going on this weekend, Canonical

13:13.760 --> 13:15.640
was definitely mentioning the fact

13:15.640 --> 13:17.000
that they had open positions.

13:17.000 --> 13:17.920
They mentioned it.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.360
Yes, very much so.

13:19.360 --> 13:23.160
Big QR codes up on their slides, go apply here.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.600
I guess it's very exciting to see, right?

13:25.600 --> 13:27.760
It is a great idea.

13:27.760 --> 13:31.280
I am thrilled to see Canonical working on the desktop.

13:31.280 --> 13:34.360
At the same time, I'm just shaking my head.

13:34.360 --> 13:37.320
Like they just had a round of really embarrassing

13:37.320 --> 13:41.920
social media coverage of their archaic hiring process.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.880
And then, of course, this announcement

13:44.880 --> 13:48.400
comes on the heels of everyone being really pissed off

13:48.400 --> 13:50.800
about the Firefox snap.

13:50.800 --> 13:55.320
And it just kind of kills all of the momentum and shine,

13:55.320 --> 13:57.000
in my opinion, of this announcement.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.040
Yeah, it's really a complicated time to try to announce this

14:00.040 --> 14:02.040
and get the kind of response from the community

14:02.040 --> 14:03.880
that I'm sure they were hoping for that I'd like to see.

14:03.880 --> 14:07.560
Because yeah, I mean, Ubuntu is the most popular Linux desktop,

14:07.560 --> 14:10.040
especially around people who might eventually

14:10.040 --> 14:11.240
want to try gaming on there.

14:11.240 --> 14:14.240
So it matters if we can make this default experience really

14:14.240 --> 14:15.280
good.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.600
It's just complicated.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.720
And our chat room is talking about it right now.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.040
They're aware of these things.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.080
So here's what I think happens.

14:22.080 --> 14:26.400
I think Canonical lives within their own little echo chamber.

14:26.400 --> 14:31.160
And I think they tell themselves something kind of like this.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.600
Well, Ubuntu has more desktop market share

14:33.600 --> 14:35.480
than all of the other distributions combined.

14:35.480 --> 14:38.200
So if we just ship something as default on Ubuntu,

14:38.200 --> 14:40.720
then by its very nature, it'll have millions of users.

14:40.720 --> 14:44.480
And it doesn't really matter if the chattering class online

14:44.480 --> 14:46.120
and in social media and on YouTube

14:46.120 --> 14:49.600
don't like it because these millions of, quote unquote,

14:49.600 --> 14:52.600
average users will just use the default, quote unquote.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.000
And you see this pattern of thinking

14:55.000 --> 14:56.320
from Canonical frequently.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.080
Sometimes it serves them.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.320
Sometimes it doesn't.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.760
I think in the case of the Firefox snap,

15:01.760 --> 15:04.360
yeah, that's probably an accurate statement.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.840
I think in the case of gaming, they're kidding themselves.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.080
And it really shows how out of touch they are.

15:10.080 --> 15:14.720
First of all, Linux gamers are the exact type

15:14.720 --> 15:18.400
of user who's willing to use some crappy script to optimize

15:18.400 --> 15:20.000
their system for better games.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.680
And if that script maybe replaces

15:21.680 --> 15:23.440
a snap with a flat pack or a deb,

15:23.440 --> 15:25.400
so that way their launch times are faster,

15:25.400 --> 15:26.880
they're going to do it.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.000
This is the enthusiast market.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.120
This is the kind of market where these things matter.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.760
And I think the other thing that shows

15:33.760 --> 15:36.080
how out of touch Canonical is, especially

15:36.080 --> 15:38.720
with this particular crowd, is they

15:38.720 --> 15:41.280
did this out of the wrong order.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.120
They did this out of order.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.960
I think what they should have done

15:44.960 --> 15:48.320
is they should have got these positions filled first.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.720
Get these people hired.

15:49.720 --> 15:53.720
Imagine applying for a job where the company is already

15:53.720 --> 15:55.300
two miles down the road on the project

15:55.300 --> 15:56.160
you're going to be working on.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.860
And so you just come on board, and you're basically

15:57.860 --> 15:59.160
inheriting whatever they've already started,

15:59.160 --> 16:00.280
even if they don't have any insights

16:00.280 --> 16:01.800
or they aren't doing it right.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.560
And here's an example.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.280
Not only did they launch this snap

16:05.280 --> 16:08.320
without everything complete for it to actually work properly,

16:08.320 --> 16:11.600
but they clearly are not thinking beyond Steam.

16:11.600 --> 16:15.240
There's no accounting for things like Lutris or bottles,

16:15.240 --> 16:18.720
which is another big part of the Linux gaming ecosystem.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.280
But they don't have any plans for that.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.560
They maybe don't even know what those things are.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.640
It's hard to tell.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.520
It does kind of make me wonder, like, yes,

16:25.520 --> 16:28.600
purely on how do we address making gaming the best

16:28.600 --> 16:30.640
in whatever ways are possible for our users?

16:30.640 --> 16:32.040
Or, you know, is it complicated

16:32.040 --> 16:33.440
by some of their own internal directives

16:33.440 --> 16:34.840
and things they're trying to accomplish?

16:34.840 --> 16:36.200
It's like, wait for these hires,

16:36.200 --> 16:38.480
so that way these experts can give you

16:38.480 --> 16:40.680
an informed guidance on how to do this.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.200
But also, get a W, bro.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.120
Get, like, a single W.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.580
Get a single win for snaps in this community's eyes.

16:49.560 --> 16:53.360
Get, you know, we don't care if a snap of one package

16:53.360 --> 16:56.760
has 10X the users of a flat pack.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.520
None of us care.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.840
Get a W, bro.

16:59.840 --> 17:00.800
Get a win.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.040
Fix the launch times.

17:03.040 --> 17:05.240
Fix the launch times.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.480
It's something you need to do anyways.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.280
Show us you're listening.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.480
Get a win.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.200
You get these people hired,

17:12.200 --> 17:14.320
you help them inform the roadmap,

17:14.320 --> 17:15.760
and you get a snap win.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.040
And then you say, by the way, everybody,

17:18.040 --> 17:19.560
we're now launching a gaming snap.

17:19.560 --> 17:23.440
Instead, what they did is they've got this cart

17:23.440 --> 17:26.120
before the horse, before they've even made their hires.

17:26.120 --> 17:27.360
They've made this gaming snap

17:27.360 --> 17:30.080
that wasn't even functional when it first launched,

17:30.080 --> 17:33.560
but thankfully, a former employee of theirs

17:33.560 --> 17:35.640
that was familiar with how snaps work

17:35.640 --> 17:37.600
helped them realize the bits it was missing

17:37.600 --> 17:38.840
to actually function correctly.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.720
You can find a link to that in our show notes.

17:40.720 --> 17:41.680
I think you can probably guess

17:41.680 --> 17:43.280
who one of those employees was.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.400
So they launched this incomplete product.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.160
They don't even have the staff on board.

17:48.160 --> 17:51.280
And then the other question is, why now?

17:51.280 --> 17:54.400
Why in 2022 when these things aren't in place?

17:54.400 --> 17:56.680
Why not three years ago before SteamOS 3 was created

17:56.680 --> 17:59.240
and they pivoted to Arch?

17:59.240 --> 18:00.640
Why do you care now?

18:00.640 --> 18:02.640
Do you care now because all of a sudden Valve

18:02.640 --> 18:04.520
has made something that's not based on Ubuntu

18:04.520 --> 18:06.800
and so this is a reactionary thing?

18:06.800 --> 18:08.200
Help me understand these things.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.920
And this is my last point.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.520
I think Canonical doesn't have the way

18:12.520 --> 18:14.400
to properly advocate for this anymore.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.320
These questions I'm asking,

18:17.320 --> 18:20.480
somebody savvy should have been out ahead of this,

18:20.480 --> 18:22.800
laying the groundwork in the community.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.760
That's how it used to happen.

18:24.760 --> 18:27.320
Strong community interaction.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.600
And because snaps face such a massive headwind

18:31.600 --> 18:34.040
from the community, they gotta get out there

18:34.040 --> 18:36.920
because what's gonna happen is there will be guides,

18:36.920 --> 18:39.080
there will be YouTubes, there will be forum posts,

18:39.080 --> 18:42.480
there will be links on Twitter that tell you

18:42.480 --> 18:45.000
how to undo all of this work

18:45.000 --> 18:48.200
that they are going to invest multiple staff hours into.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.280
Lots of development time.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.400
And by the way, it's not Valve packaging this,

18:53.400 --> 18:54.280
so it's not like they're building

18:54.280 --> 18:55.680
some great relationship with Valve either.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.400
They're packaging it outside of Valve.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.240
It's questionable if we even want that.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.200
So they're gonna do all of this

19:01.200 --> 19:02.800
and they're gonna put it out there

19:02.800 --> 19:05.400
and then because the community hates what they create,

19:05.400 --> 19:07.840
in 35 seconds there will be scripts to replace

19:07.840 --> 19:10.400
and undo all of the work they've done.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.960
So I ask again, why are they doing it now this way?

19:12.960 --> 19:15.000
If this was something that they shoved down

19:15.000 --> 19:16.800
average quote unquote user's throats

19:16.800 --> 19:18.640
and they didn't have any choice like Firefox,

19:18.640 --> 19:19.840
yeah, it would work.

19:19.840 --> 19:22.720
But again, I argue the Linux gaming market

19:22.720 --> 19:24.320
is a little bit different.

19:24.320 --> 19:25.960
They're willing to install extensions

19:25.960 --> 19:28.360
that help set the performance governor on their PC.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.720
They understand what a performance governor is.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.360
Not all of them.

19:33.360 --> 19:34.200
But let's look at the people

19:34.200 --> 19:36.360
that are likely to game on Linux.

19:36.360 --> 19:40.480
If they can grok what Proton is and why they need Proton,

19:40.480 --> 19:42.600
then they can grok what a Bash script is.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.560
Is there a version of this where maybe that's not

19:44.560 --> 19:46.720
who Canonical thinks they're trying to target?

19:46.720 --> 19:48.240
Is it aimed more at the folks

19:48.240 --> 19:51.160
who know that Linux gaming is complicated,

19:51.160 --> 19:52.160
kind of have heard of Proton

19:52.160 --> 19:53.280
but don't wanna figure that out

19:53.280 --> 19:56.280
and are willing to just hit,

19:56.280 --> 19:57.520
I want steam from the snore

19:57.520 --> 19:59.640
and then I'm gonna try to play my games?

19:59.640 --> 20:01.480
Yeah, it's definitely probably gonna be the majority

20:01.480 --> 20:02.840
of who ends up using it, right?

20:02.840 --> 20:04.720
Sort of a stem the tide of those folks

20:04.720 --> 20:06.280
who might otherwise see themselves

20:06.280 --> 20:09.160
as being forced to go to something like Pop or Garuda.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.840
Here's what I think you end up with though,

20:10.840 --> 20:13.960
is the worst of both worlds in that scenario.

20:13.960 --> 20:17.520
You end up for Canonical with just enough users

20:17.520 --> 20:19.360
where now you're forced to maintain this thing,

20:19.360 --> 20:20.280
but not enough users

20:20.280 --> 20:22.600
where you can exert any kind of influence.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.440
There's no influence they can exert over Valve

20:24.440 --> 20:26.640
or the direction of any way this goes.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.200
And now that Valve has their own platform to develop on,

20:29.200 --> 20:30.960
they don't even need anything from Canonical.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.120
So Canonical is always going to be chasing the developments

20:33.120 --> 20:35.800
on SteamOS now to try to bundle it up in a snap.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.280
And again, it just doesn't seem like

20:38.280 --> 20:39.520
they have the insights into the market.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.760
Like what are they gonna do about Lutris here?

20:41.760 --> 20:43.200
It's not a complete gaming picture.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.480
It's not a solution right now.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.160
Are they going to include AMD drivers

20:46.160 --> 20:47.640
and the GUIs to manage AMD cards?

20:47.640 --> 20:48.560
What about Nvidia stuff?

20:48.560 --> 20:49.880
Like where does this go?

20:53.120 --> 20:55.000
I suppose I love the idea

20:55.000 --> 20:59.400
if snaps were better received and launched faster.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.360
Then I'm like, this is a pretty solid idea.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.880
Like at least there is a real good solution

21:03.880 --> 21:06.120
for users of the Ubuntu desktop.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.600
However, I'd also feel a lot better

21:08.600 --> 21:11.600
if it was being created and packaged and maintained by Valve.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.600
Wouldn't this be the great solution?

21:12.600 --> 21:14.600
Like here's a solution for Ubuntu users.

21:14.600 --> 21:18.240
It's like the blessed SteamOS environment all in a snap.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.480
Or at least we felt like there was some involvement,

21:20.480 --> 21:24.920
some handshake or some co-press release,

21:24.920 --> 21:25.760
something to say like,

21:25.760 --> 21:27.800
oh, we're excited to see better support on Ubuntu

21:27.800 --> 21:29.360
or something that made you feel like

21:29.360 --> 21:33.000
it wasn't just a total Canonical move in a vacuum.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.440
Yeah.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.440
I hope that this turns out

21:36.440 --> 21:37.800
at least somewhat positive for them

21:37.800 --> 21:40.480
because like I said at the start of this,

21:40.480 --> 21:43.320
it is exciting to see them put any effort like this

21:43.320 --> 21:45.920
and hire like this for a desktop project.

21:45.920 --> 21:49.120
Yeah, I mean, hiring, head count, that means money.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.000
So you're right, it is exciting.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.120
It's just interesting that this is where

21:53.120 --> 21:54.640
they're doing that investment

21:54.640 --> 21:58.200
and not investing to where the puck is skating, right?

21:58.200 --> 21:59.760
This is now a solved problem

22:01.120 --> 22:03.400
in part because some opportunity was missed

22:03.400 --> 22:05.440
and Valve switched to Arch.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.520
It's not really the problem we need solved now.

22:08.520 --> 22:11.280
I mean, gaming on Linux could always be better,

22:11.280 --> 22:13.000
but it's better than it ever has been.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.080
Wouldn't it be great if they were launching a strike team

22:17.080 --> 22:19.800
to solve another problem on the Linux desktop

22:19.800 --> 22:22.480
that wasn't as well off as gaming was right now?

22:22.480 --> 22:23.800
That seems like there's other problems

22:23.800 --> 22:25.080
that maybe they could address in a way

22:25.080 --> 22:27.560
that they would have some particular leverage in.

22:27.560 --> 22:28.800
Yeah.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.440
And I could come up with a list right off the top of my head.

22:31.440 --> 22:34.520
Things from like pipe wire to fonts to printing,

22:34.520 --> 22:37.000
there's so many areas that we could just really nail

22:37.000 --> 22:38.400
for the end user.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.680
But what we're gonna solve is Linux gaming,

22:41.680 --> 22:44.800
which is already a small niche of the Linux market

22:44.800 --> 22:46.640
and has already been directly addressed

22:46.640 --> 22:48.680
by the primary vendor in the ecosystem.

22:48.680 --> 22:51.560
And then you just add something like Lutris and bottles

22:51.560 --> 22:53.920
and you're pretty much good to go.

22:53.920 --> 22:57.400
I struggle with it, but I'm open to feedback on this.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.320
Send us a boost or go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.480
I do feel like we should probably give it a try.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.680
Maybe it's not quite yet ready,

23:03.680 --> 23:05.120
but a little bit down the line

23:05.120 --> 23:07.360
when it's made a little more generally available.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.200
I'll be curious.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.680
You know, I do end up gaming on Pop

23:09.680 --> 23:10.640
at the moment in a fair bit.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.520
And while I still think I would, you know,

23:12.520 --> 23:14.360
kind of like what Pop's been doing lately,

23:14.360 --> 23:17.120
so I might be inclined to install it anyway.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.840
If I could go, you know, just install the latest Ubuntu,

23:19.840 --> 23:22.440
couple of clicks in the store and have steam up and going,

23:22.440 --> 23:23.640
there is something valuable that,

23:23.640 --> 23:25.280
or if I'm trying to convince, save my brother

23:25.280 --> 23:28.280
to finally get off his Windows desktop for gaming.

23:28.280 --> 23:29.640
Maybe, but I don't know.

23:29.640 --> 23:33.920
That's a long road and it needs to launch decently.

23:33.920 --> 23:37.240
Linode.com slash unplugged.

23:37.240 --> 23:40.080
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.640
And you go there to support the show.

23:42.640 --> 23:43.480
That's right.

23:43.480 --> 23:44.320
That's how it works.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.000
Linode started in 2003 because they saw that

23:47.000 --> 23:49.600
Linux had this great thing coming called virtualization.

23:49.600 --> 23:50.520
What a concept.

23:50.520 --> 23:51.760
And now 19 years later,

23:51.760 --> 23:55.120
they have built one of the absolute best platforms

23:55.120 --> 23:58.600
for developers, Linux enthusiasts, businesses,

23:58.600 --> 23:59.560
and your everyday users.

23:59.560 --> 24:00.920
And I make that qualification

24:00.920 --> 24:02.840
because if you just want to run a personal portfolio,

24:02.840 --> 24:04.600
they have $5 a month systems.

24:04.600 --> 24:05.760
You want to run your own MumbleBox

24:05.760 --> 24:08.440
or maybe your own Jitsi or GitLab now,

24:08.440 --> 24:11.240
especially with GitLab making some pricing changes.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.760
In fact, Linode has one click GitLab deployments,

24:13.760 --> 24:16.080
which are really, really handy.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.360
But really at the end of the day,

24:17.360 --> 24:19.080
Linode is just about making things simple

24:19.080 --> 24:20.160
and straightforward and accessible.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.520
So if you want to do a one click, you can,

24:22.520 --> 24:24.640
or if you want to deploy some just absolutely

24:24.640 --> 24:26.400
bananas infrastructure that can scale up

24:26.400 --> 24:30.000
to millions of users or at least one busy Synapse server,

24:30.000 --> 24:31.960
you absolutely can do that too.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.240
They just have the best in class experience

24:34.240 --> 24:36.960
and performance and customer support.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.920
There's a lot of places that offer hosting,

24:38.920 --> 24:42.240
but nobody gets the mix right like Linode does.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.920
And then you add that $100 offer,

24:43.920 --> 24:46.880
it's just a great way to try it out and support the show.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.520
They got all the distributions you're going to want to try.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.720
Like they've already got 2204 up there

24:50.720 --> 24:51.960
if you want to give that a go.

24:51.960 --> 24:53.440
They're always rolling out the new Alma's

24:53.440 --> 24:55.480
when those are ready to go.

24:55.480 --> 24:58.520
We run Nextcloud up there like a fricking champ, dude.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.920
It's excellent.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.680
It is the best, most reliable implementation

25:03.680 --> 25:05.120
I've ever had of Nextcloud.

25:05.120 --> 25:07.040
And I'm going to admit part of that is we're using

25:07.040 --> 25:10.480
the object storage that Linode has as our backend storage.

25:10.480 --> 25:12.520
And that's been a game changer for us.

25:12.520 --> 25:14.440
But now we're looking at like all kinds of things

25:14.440 --> 25:15.920
that we might want to use for internal tools,

25:15.920 --> 25:19.040
like a Mattermost server, a Jitsi replacement,

25:19.040 --> 25:20.440
and we can just run it all in the same box

25:20.440 --> 25:21.480
because these things are so fast.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.520
They got MVME storage, they got Epic processors

25:24.520 --> 25:26.400
when you go to the high-end CPU ones,

25:26.400 --> 25:29.640
but they also do have high-end GPU systems.

25:29.640 --> 25:30.520
It's like great, man.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.680
And the interface is so slick that you

25:32.680 --> 25:33.640
can work with any of it.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.000
And then once you've been using it for a while,

25:35.000 --> 25:36.680
you start using things like the command line

25:36.680 --> 25:39.280
tool and the API, and it's just total fire.

25:39.280 --> 25:40.720
I absolutely love it.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.320
And it's so nice to just get in, get out,

25:42.320 --> 25:44.720
get things done super quick, spin things up and try it out,

25:44.720 --> 25:46.760
decide if we want to use it or not, then destroy the box.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.520
I use it for that kind of thing all the time.

25:48.520 --> 25:49.240
Go try it.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.480
Go learn something.

25:50.480 --> 25:51.600
Support the show.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.600
It's super quick to get started, so do it right now

25:53.600 --> 25:55.760
by going to linode.com slash unplugged.

25:55.760 --> 25:58.240
Get that $100 credit, and you support the show.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.640
It's linode.com slash unplugged.

26:03.680 --> 26:06.920
I thought it'd be fun if we busted out that old Linux time

26:06.920 --> 26:07.960
machine.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.560
Is there something you might change

26:09.560 --> 26:11.080
in how you got introduced to Linux,

26:11.080 --> 26:14.360
the things you've played with, the mistakes you've made?

26:14.360 --> 26:16.920
Now, do be careful, though, because it's

26:16.920 --> 26:19.600
powered by a Raspberry Pi, first generation.

26:19.600 --> 26:26.480
Oh, well, here we are back in the late 90s.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.960
So if I had a Linux time machine, which, of course,

26:28.960 --> 26:31.040
I do, obviously.

26:31.040 --> 26:31.720
We just used it.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.640
It's called ZFS.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.280
Yeah, it's a time snapshot.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.000
I like that.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.640
That's what we should have gone with.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.600
I was thinking about this.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.800
Like, if I was to look back, like,

26:40.800 --> 26:42.960
did I ever make a choice that kind of sent me off

26:42.960 --> 26:45.360
on a tangent for the wrong time or something like that?

26:45.360 --> 26:51.640
And I think maybe I probably focused too much on the desktop.

26:51.640 --> 26:54.480
And I know that sounds weird because I love the desktop.

26:54.480 --> 26:59.280
But the server side of Linux is like infinitely,

26:59.280 --> 27:00.560
it's like infinite jobs.

27:00.560 --> 27:02.720
There's so many jobs if you learn the Linux side.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.920
There's so many things you can build.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.400
It's like the equivalent of learning

27:06.400 --> 27:07.440
how to develop software.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.080
You can really build and create things

27:09.080 --> 27:10.380
when you learn the server side.

27:10.380 --> 27:12.920
And not that I haven't, but I think

27:12.920 --> 27:16.000
maybe that would have made me more inclined to look

27:16.000 --> 27:19.040
at things like Nix sooner and stuff like that.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.880
It's been around for a decade.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.680
And I'm just now getting to it.

27:22.680 --> 27:23.920
And so I was looking at that.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.600
Like, why did it take me so long?

27:25.600 --> 27:28.080
But you have tried pretty much every desktop environment

27:28.080 --> 27:29.640
known to humankind.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.640
Exactly.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.880
So I think I did a lot of jumping around with the desktop,

27:32.880 --> 27:35.280
fooling around with my desktop.

27:35.280 --> 27:38.480
When I look back at it, it sort of feels like wasted time.

27:38.480 --> 27:39.840
But I don't really know for sure.

27:39.840 --> 27:41.760
Maybe it was necessary.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.080
I mean, I sure managed to turn it into a lot of content.

27:44.080 --> 27:47.120
But I think overall, it probably wasn't the most efficient use

27:47.120 --> 27:47.640
of my time.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.080
I had a lot of fun, though, so I could still

27:49.080 --> 27:50.280
make an argument for it.

27:50.280 --> 27:53.480
But I would tweak that.

27:53.480 --> 27:54.480
Yeah, I think that's probably it.

27:54.480 --> 27:56.060
I was going to say less distro hopping,

27:56.060 --> 27:58.440
but that was also kind of essential for the show.

27:58.440 --> 28:01.240
So for me, it would have been fine to sit.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.360
I would like sit down with my younger self.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.920
And I'd say, here's the state of affairs, man.

28:05.920 --> 28:07.760
I know this is all looking really good.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.440
But then in a few years, there's going

28:09.440 --> 28:12.240
to be this fork in the road, where this thing called

28:12.240 --> 28:13.640
Unity comes out.

28:13.640 --> 28:17.000
And this KDE goes to KDE 4.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.320
And that's going to be real rough.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.080
And then GNOME, you're not even going

28:20.080 --> 28:21.400
to believe what the GNOME folks do.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.240
And I'm going to say, GNOME, you mean Gnome?

28:23.240 --> 28:24.640
No, no, we call it GNOME now.

28:24.640 --> 28:25.920
Oh, I'm going to say it's weird.

28:25.920 --> 28:27.760
But you're going to just brace yourself,

28:27.760 --> 28:29.420
because that's just the very beginning.

28:29.420 --> 28:31.680
And just keep your head down and build.

28:31.680 --> 28:33.560
And don't get distracted by all that.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.400
I'm imagining you trying to explain also

28:35.400 --> 28:38.200
the rise of mobile and being like,

28:38.200 --> 28:40.080
well, OK, so Linux is on the phone,

28:40.080 --> 28:42.000
but not in a way that your future self is

28:42.000 --> 28:43.680
going to like at all.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.880
It's a complicated future.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.960
And the desktop isn't as relevant as you really

28:46.960 --> 28:47.920
think it's going to be.

28:47.920 --> 28:50.160
That is, I think, the key piece to this.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.480
And I'm really glad you just put words to that is,

28:52.480 --> 28:54.400
that's the other bit I'd have to say to myself.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.520
It's like, the worst part is it's not

28:56.520 --> 28:58.000
going to really matter.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.780
By the time you get to the 2020s,

29:00.780 --> 29:03.840
you could use any distro or really any operating system.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.560
And all of your tools pretty much work,

29:05.560 --> 29:07.800
because everything's going to be in the web.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.000
And I'm going to be like, what?

29:09.000 --> 29:09.800
I hate web apps.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.280
I'm like, no, you still will.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.880
Absolutely, that will not change.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.720
Yes, you still hate web apps, but everything's

29:14.720 --> 29:15.880
in a web browser now.

29:15.880 --> 29:16.920
Pluses and minuses, right?

29:16.920 --> 29:18.600
It's really kind of weird.

29:18.600 --> 29:22.760
But I would also like, I know, to tell myself

29:22.760 --> 29:28.520
about things like process namespaces and containers.

29:28.520 --> 29:32.100
And just honestly, the thing that still blows my mind

29:32.100 --> 29:36.200
the most from back then to today is just

29:36.200 --> 29:38.920
how radically available server resources are.

29:38.920 --> 29:44.480
And if you weren't around in the early 90s and the early aughts

29:44.480 --> 29:45.960
and deploying servers, you really

29:45.960 --> 29:50.000
don't understand, to even get a server going,

29:50.000 --> 29:51.560
well, there was an approval process.

29:51.560 --> 29:53.200
There's a hardware purchase that has to happen,

29:53.200 --> 29:55.560
which means you have to work with a vendor and a sales rep.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.480
And then they spec you something.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.960
You go back and forth on that for a couple of days.

29:59.960 --> 30:00.840
And then you order it.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.260
And then weeks go by.

30:02.260 --> 30:04.840
And depending on the vendor, sometimes the machine back then

30:04.840 --> 30:06.360
didn't even show up assembled.

30:06.360 --> 30:07.960
The parts would arrive separately.

30:07.960 --> 30:10.760
And then you still had to assemble it all together

30:10.760 --> 30:11.600
back then.

30:11.600 --> 30:14.120
And then you had to install rails.

30:14.120 --> 30:15.560
And you had to go put it into a rack.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.000
And these things are heavy.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.600
It's like they made them out of cement.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.440
And then you had to wire it all up and manage the wiring

30:21.440 --> 30:23.320
and provision the switch port.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.880
Do you get where I'm going with this?

30:24.880 --> 30:27.200
It's like a multi-month process.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.760
And then if you were in somebody else's data center,

30:29.760 --> 30:31.840
you not only paid for your bandwidth, the actual amount

30:31.840 --> 30:33.200
of bandwidth that you used, but you actually

30:33.200 --> 30:34.640
paid for the power, all of it.

30:34.640 --> 30:38.000
Like, oh, yeah, screw you if you accidentally

30:38.000 --> 30:40.040
messed up the backup system and all the systems

30:40.040 --> 30:41.680
do an extra backup that night.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.160
You just totally killed your budget.

30:43.160 --> 30:44.400
It was ridiculous.

30:44.400 --> 30:49.220
And now I can spin up servers via an API on the command line.

30:49.220 --> 30:51.000
And it's up on this infrastructure

30:51.000 --> 30:52.960
that's way more powerful than anything

30:52.960 --> 30:54.000
I'd ever have access to.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.360
Right, and we can customize it to run around kernels,

30:56.360 --> 30:57.600
switch it over to NixOS.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.280
It's not like the old days of shared hosting either.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.880
Yeah, and I don't know how I'd even

31:02.880 --> 31:06.360
relay it to my younger self, but you know.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.680
Can you give yourself an SSH session

31:08.680 --> 31:10.440
that goes forward in time?

31:10.440 --> 31:12.120
Yeah, a tunnel through time.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.000
That would be pretty rad, actually.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
If I ever figure that out, I'll let you know.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.680
Just go check out, have your past self check out

31:17.680 --> 31:19.080
our matrix box.

31:19.080 --> 31:21.480
You'd be very impressed by the matrix server.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.200
That would be.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.000
All right, let's bring it back to the present.

31:24.000 --> 31:31.280
So it was actually Brent who discovered the Linux time

31:31.280 --> 31:32.880
machine and dusted it off and said,

31:32.880 --> 31:35.040
guys, we've got to go back in time

31:35.040 --> 31:36.240
and save our former selves.

31:36.240 --> 31:39.160
And I said, Brent, if we go back in time,

31:39.160 --> 31:41.000
we're going to undo the shows, right?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.680
Because you never know what could happen.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.280
And Brent, you were the one that was explaining,

31:44.280 --> 31:46.160
we're actually just forking the universe.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.880
So it's just alternate reality that's getting all messed up.

31:48.880 --> 31:49.480
Yeah, it's fine.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.760
There are infinite possibilities anyways, right, guys?

31:51.760 --> 31:54.280
Yeah, so we're just altering one of those infinite possibilities.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.560
Are you ready to go back in time to your former Linux self,

31:56.560 --> 31:57.120
Brent?

31:57.120 --> 31:57.640
Sure.

31:57.640 --> 32:04.520
You know, my younger Linux self didn't actually

32:04.520 --> 32:09.520
grasp onto Linux as soon as I would hope I would have.

32:09.520 --> 32:14.520
So me, the me Linux guy now, I think

32:14.520 --> 32:17.640
sees that I dabbled in Linux quite a lot

32:17.640 --> 32:20.640
before really grabbing onto it.

32:20.640 --> 32:23.200
Many years before I switched my entire business

32:23.200 --> 32:26.640
to open source stuff, I was playing with this stuff

32:26.640 --> 32:34.040
and just as kind of a curiosity, but never really latched on.

32:34.040 --> 32:38.640
And I wish, I think, that I would have said, no, no,

32:38.640 --> 32:39.760
grab this right now.

32:39.760 --> 32:42.520
If you do, it'll really change things for you.

32:42.520 --> 32:45.680
Don't wait the, I don't know, eight or seven years

32:45.680 --> 32:46.880
down the road to do it.

32:46.880 --> 32:47.880
Do it right away.

32:47.880 --> 32:52.360
And who knows where that could have led a Brent these days?

32:52.360 --> 32:54.560
I mean, I think I'm fine with who I am now.

32:54.560 --> 32:58.920
But just imagine you could grasp some of those technologies

32:58.920 --> 33:01.000
maybe eight years sooner.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.480
Maybe, Chris, I'd be almost as experienced or as you

33:05.480 --> 33:07.600
or Wes, perhaps.

33:07.600 --> 33:11.000
And so that being said, I wish that I also

33:11.000 --> 33:13.880
latched onto those communities a little sooner at the same time.

33:13.880 --> 33:19.400
So just thinking going to Linux Fest Northwest

33:19.400 --> 33:22.040
really made things flourish for me

33:22.040 --> 33:24.840
in terms of meeting people, like-minded people.

33:24.840 --> 33:26.440
And so I think the theme for me is just

33:26.440 --> 33:27.680
doing it a little bit sooner.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.720
Do you think there's anything that might have some hurdles

33:29.720 --> 33:31.680
you might have to help your old self overcome?

33:31.680 --> 33:35.080
I'm just thinking maybe if you were starting more

33:35.080 --> 33:36.880
of your photography journey back then,

33:36.880 --> 33:38.760
the tooling probably wasn't quite as good as it is

33:38.760 --> 33:41.480
on modern desktop Linux, amongst a ton of other things.

33:41.480 --> 33:43.680
And I imagine there are probably reasons for the time

33:43.680 --> 33:45.800
that maybe you didn't dive in right away.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.640
I think part of it was complexity, actually,

33:47.640 --> 33:48.680
now that I think about it.

33:48.680 --> 33:51.040
Back then with dependency issues,

33:51.040 --> 33:53.000
I ran into those almost immediately

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
when I was trying to install some software

33:56.000 --> 34:00.760
and even installing it the way that was intended.

34:00.760 --> 34:05.880
Do you remember those days of the so-called dependency hell?

34:05.880 --> 34:09.000
It made me hate RPM back in the day.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.600
I feel like you're looking back at your younger self.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.760
Thanks for bringing us along in the time machine.

34:14.760 --> 34:17.240
You know what I'm seeing as I look around your room here,

34:17.240 --> 34:18.480
Brent?

34:18.480 --> 34:19.880
I'm seeing a lot going on.

34:19.880 --> 34:22.800
And I'm not seeing a particular problem

34:22.800 --> 34:24.800
you had to solve with Linux.

34:24.800 --> 34:29.640
And I think that's something you can't be so hard on yourself

34:29.640 --> 34:30.560
about.

34:30.560 --> 34:33.560
You didn't really have something you needed Linux to fix

34:33.560 --> 34:35.640
until it was time and then you switched.

34:35.640 --> 34:38.200
And when we as a community think about advocacy

34:38.200 --> 34:40.320
and we think about trying to get other people to switch

34:40.320 --> 34:43.120
to Linux, I think we have to understand and realize

34:43.120 --> 34:46.840
that a lot of times people don't necessarily feel a need

34:46.840 --> 34:51.200
and they don't see a reason because everything's working fine.

34:51.200 --> 34:54.480
They sort of have it good.

34:54.480 --> 34:59.280
And for me, the problems I needed solving

34:59.280 --> 35:02.720
dealt directly with server scaling in the late 90s that

35:02.720 --> 35:06.560
was just a limit of the Windows technology stack back then.

35:06.560 --> 35:10.200
And so I went looking somewhere else to handle the user load

35:10.200 --> 35:11.520
that I was trying to deal with.

35:11.520 --> 35:14.400
And so I discovered Linux that way.

35:14.400 --> 35:17.000
And so a similar thing, like my very, very first use

35:17.000 --> 35:19.880
with Linux, besides the time I deleted my file system,

35:19.880 --> 35:26.040
so my second use with Linux was Microsoft had my school,

35:26.040 --> 35:28.480
I was in high school at the time, they had us pinned down

35:28.480 --> 35:30.120
and they were bullying my school.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.360
And I've shared this story before.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.960
And they didn't have a product that

35:33.960 --> 35:37.000
would solve the really serious networking issues

35:37.000 --> 35:40.320
that we were having and Squid Proxy did.

35:40.320 --> 35:44.380
And so I set up a Debian box and I set up Squid Proxy.

35:44.380 --> 35:45.640
And it was incredible.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.840
And I remember thinking, wow, they can't even do this.

35:47.840 --> 35:50.320
And so Microsoft, sort of a short aside,

35:50.320 --> 35:52.520
Microsoft came while we're back in time,

35:52.520 --> 35:56.040
they came at us because we had a special program with them.

35:56.040 --> 35:59.600
And they said, you basically have an ultimate,

35:59.600 --> 36:01.480
they gave us an ultimatum and they said,

36:01.480 --> 36:04.600
you either try out this Windows NT5 beta thing

36:04.600 --> 36:06.800
and see if you can use the new proxy server

36:06.800 --> 36:08.200
that we have in that.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.240
They hadn't even named it Windows 2000 at this point.

36:10.240 --> 36:13.080
That's how far, that's how long ago this was.

36:13.080 --> 36:15.520
So we want you to try out this new NT5 beta

36:15.520 --> 36:17.920
and see if that doesn't solve the problem for you.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.240
And of course, it didn't.

36:19.240 --> 36:23.480
And so also we weren't going to deploy beta software

36:23.480 --> 36:26.200
for our whole network, for your whole production network.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.360
It was crazy.

36:27.360 --> 36:29.800
So Brent, I had a problem to solve.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.360
And I had a serious emergency problem to solve.

36:32.360 --> 36:35.040
And Windows, we took it to as far as we could

36:35.040 --> 36:37.280
before we ended up looking for somewhere else.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.440
For me, that was like, you know, 98, 99.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.120
But for you, it was just a different time

36:41.120 --> 36:42.240
where you had a problem to solve, right?

36:42.240 --> 36:43.080
I mean, I'm looking around.

36:43.080 --> 36:44.400
I don't think you should be so hard on yourself.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.760
I can understand.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.400
I think that's actually a really good point.

36:47.400 --> 36:48.560
When I did have a problem to solve

36:48.560 --> 36:49.800
and it was the clear solution,

36:49.800 --> 36:53.560
it was very easy to just dive right in.

36:53.560 --> 36:58.040
So I wonder then if we could turn the time machine dial

36:58.040 --> 37:00.800
a little more, maybe closer to the present

37:00.800 --> 37:03.240
and I can present just a little something else.

37:03.240 --> 37:08.240
Oh, was that a hand?

37:09.800 --> 37:11.080
That felt like a hand.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.680
It's close quarters in this time machine.

37:12.680 --> 37:13.920
It's only meant for one.

37:13.920 --> 37:15.440
Oh, I love this thing anyways, though.

37:15.440 --> 37:16.440
It's great.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.360
You know, one thing I've been thinking about lately

37:18.360 --> 37:21.680
is I wonder if my slightly younger self

37:21.680 --> 37:24.080
would want to learn different things.

37:24.080 --> 37:26.840
It feels to me like my self-learning journey,

37:26.840 --> 37:31.200
at least around sort of like sysadmini topics,

37:31.200 --> 37:34.720
you know, like SSHing and doing key pairs

37:34.720 --> 37:37.640
and trying to run a jellyfin server

37:37.640 --> 37:39.080
and all of these things.

37:39.080 --> 37:43.600
It has been at least very easy for me to find the sort of,

37:43.600 --> 37:44.680
don't be insulted anyone,

37:44.680 --> 37:48.080
but I'll call them the old Linux way of setting these up,

37:48.080 --> 37:50.160
you know, like not containers.

37:50.160 --> 37:51.360
Like installing a package

37:51.360 --> 37:53.320
or maybe even running an install script.

37:53.320 --> 37:55.000
App2Get or something.

37:55.000 --> 37:55.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.080
You see like tons of tutorials,

37:58.080 --> 38:00.880
tons of them with how to do things that way.

38:00.880 --> 38:03.480
And I wish maybe,

38:03.480 --> 38:07.000
and I'm willing to, you know, discuss this as well.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.400
I wish that maybe someone would have said,

38:09.400 --> 38:10.840
hey, by the way,

38:10.840 --> 38:12.920
there are these new ways of doing this stuff

38:12.920 --> 38:15.280
that maybe is a better way to go.

38:15.280 --> 38:18.600
Cause perhaps that's a better investment of your time.

38:18.600 --> 38:21.640
You know, containers and infrastructure as code

38:21.640 --> 38:23.040
and all these great, you know,

38:23.040 --> 38:25.920
the Nixie kind of stuff we're playing with.

38:25.920 --> 38:29.000
I kind of wish I had been introduced to that way sooner.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.280
I think that's probably a common feeling,

38:31.280 --> 38:32.880
but on the flip side,

38:32.880 --> 38:35.480
have you been pretty well served by the existing resources?

38:35.480 --> 38:37.160
I'm just thinking, you know, it's kind of amazing

38:37.160 --> 38:40.680
these days, especially you got a reliable VPS,

38:40.680 --> 38:42.000
your App2Get install a couple,

38:42.000 --> 38:43.520
you know, you got your NGINX web server,

38:43.520 --> 38:45.760
you got your program running,

38:45.760 --> 38:47.480
as many things as you might want to do differently.

38:47.480 --> 38:49.880
And there are many additional patterns like that.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.200
It sure does just work,

38:51.200 --> 38:53.160
especially if you only got a couple of things to manage.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.600
It's certainly well-tested, right?

38:54.600 --> 38:56.000
Yeah, you could build a career out of it.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.560
I think it's served me well,

38:57.560 --> 39:00.720
but only in that I don't know what I've been missing out on.

39:00.720 --> 39:02.600
Well, I mean, you're still young, Brentley, really,

39:02.600 --> 39:04.440
if you think about it, you know,

39:04.440 --> 39:06.160
if you think about it on that timescale,

39:06.160 --> 39:07.400
when you're 50 years old,

39:07.400 --> 39:10.000
you're going to have this stuff under your belt for decades.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.440
I assume Alex has got you setting up

39:11.440 --> 39:12.800
OpenShift clusters already.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.840
Oh, man, we better get him out of there.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.560
We better get him out of there.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.960
It's going to be bad.

39:17.960 --> 39:19.280
Thank you, Alex.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.960
So are you ready?

39:20.960 --> 39:22.760
Do you want to take the wheel on the time machine?

39:22.760 --> 39:23.600
Just be careful.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.880
When Brent drives, he adjusts the seat.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.840
Oh, I've driven with Brent before.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.600
Ah, where are we, Wes?

39:33.600 --> 39:35.840
I'm noticing kind of a different style of clothing,

39:35.840 --> 39:36.680
so it's far enough back.

39:36.680 --> 39:37.520
Well, you might notice, yeah,

39:37.520 --> 39:38.840
different animals around here, too.

39:38.840 --> 39:39.800
It's been a long time.

39:39.800 --> 39:40.640
Yeah, yeah.

39:40.640 --> 39:41.680
All right, tell us where we're at.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.960
Well, I figured we'd go back into a world

39:43.960 --> 39:46.520
where Wes had free time.

39:46.520 --> 39:47.360
Oh, yes.

39:47.360 --> 39:48.440
You know, remember those days?

39:48.440 --> 39:50.280
Yeah, back when I used to play with Gentoo.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.880
So that's what I want to talk,

39:51.880 --> 39:52.800
you said something earlier,

39:52.800 --> 39:54.760
you said something about distro hopping.

39:54.760 --> 39:55.600
Yeah.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.600
You know, I kind of wish I distro hopped less.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.160
I think the opposite.

39:59.160 --> 40:02.440
I wish that I had spent more time distro hopping,

40:02.440 --> 40:04.480
because thinking back on it, like some of the late nights

40:04.480 --> 40:06.600
where I was, you know, first figured out

40:06.600 --> 40:08.040
how to install Arch Linux,

40:08.040 --> 40:10.120
and before I had like, you know,

40:10.120 --> 40:11.600
I had like one netbook and not, you know,

40:11.600 --> 40:13.960
not a lot of fancy computer peripherals or networks

40:13.960 --> 40:16.920
or options besides the instructions I'd written down

40:16.920 --> 40:19.240
from my working installation to get this going.

40:19.240 --> 40:21.200
And just for also a little bit of context,

40:21.200 --> 40:22.400
what kind of internet speeds would you say

40:22.400 --> 40:23.280
we're looking at back then?

40:23.280 --> 40:24.480
Yeah, not great.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.160
Yeah, early DSL, maybe, or yeah.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.400
And I learned so much,

40:29.400 --> 40:32.120
and that was the right time when I was really,

40:32.120 --> 40:33.880
first kind of getting all the ways

40:33.880 --> 40:36.000
you could put a Linux system together.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.720
But I think that would have been a good time

40:37.720 --> 40:39.480
to really go deep into Gentoo

40:39.480 --> 40:42.080
or bother to do Linux from scratch.

40:42.080 --> 40:44.160
Not that you have to, not that I feel like I'm missing out

40:44.160 --> 40:45.040
by not having done it.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.160
And you know, there's a lot going on about a Linux system,

40:47.160 --> 40:49.400
and I don't need to be an expert in.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.000
But I'd like to do those things now.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.560
And that's one reason I've really enjoyed

40:53.560 --> 40:54.480
this NixOS challenge,

40:54.480 --> 40:56.560
is it felt like an excuse to kind of dabble a bit more,

40:56.560 --> 40:58.480
but there's just too many things to learn

40:58.480 --> 41:00.760
besides technology we want to deploy for, you know,

41:00.760 --> 41:03.680
to improve the shows, for work, for my own hobbies.

41:03.680 --> 41:05.720
Like, there's just not that much room.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.480
And because I'm so used to like, you know,

41:07.480 --> 41:09.600
I know my way around enough distros now,

41:09.600 --> 41:11.200
that's just never on the top of my thing to try,

41:11.200 --> 41:12.040
unfortunately.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.720
So you'd go over there and you'd tap yourself,

41:14.720 --> 41:15.800
your former self on the shoulder,

41:15.800 --> 41:17.840
and you'd go, go try out Gentoo for a while,

41:17.840 --> 41:18.880
go distro hop a bit.

41:18.880 --> 41:20.600
You know, it's time, it's slack wear.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.480
Right, you go, you know,

41:22.480 --> 41:25.280
go spread your distro hopping days out

41:25.280 --> 41:26.120
while you can now,

41:26.120 --> 41:28.480
because your time's going to be limited down the road.

41:28.480 --> 41:30.000
I definitely get where you're coming from

41:30.000 --> 41:33.560
because I had years of experience

41:33.560 --> 41:36.240
with Red Hat based systems and Debian based,

41:36.240 --> 41:39.920
well, Debian, before I tried Gentoo.

41:39.920 --> 41:42.320
And I felt like I finally learned Linux

41:42.320 --> 41:43.960
when I started building my Gentoo systems,

41:43.960 --> 41:47.640
because of the way I had to do the partitioning,

41:47.640 --> 41:49.480
the way I had to do the formatting,

41:49.480 --> 41:51.360
the way I had to bless the bootloader

41:51.360 --> 41:52.200
and install the bootloader,

41:52.200 --> 41:54.200
all the stuff that the installers

41:54.200 --> 41:57.120
had always been doing for me since day one.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.480
And including back then,

41:58.480 --> 42:00.000
you had to configure Xorg files.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.160
Oh yeah, right.

42:01.160 --> 42:03.680
And you know, a lot of distributions

42:03.680 --> 42:06.000
where they added value was in the installer

42:06.000 --> 42:08.160
and maybe walking you through setting up X

42:08.160 --> 42:11.120
and walking you through setting up your hardware interfaces

42:11.120 --> 42:12.360
and stuff like that.

42:12.360 --> 42:14.600
Whereas in Gentoo, depending on what stage you did,

42:14.600 --> 42:17.120
and I normally did a stage two install,

42:17.120 --> 42:18.880
you had to learn all that.

42:18.880 --> 42:22.680
And that's really when I started to get it, I think.

42:22.680 --> 42:24.280
And so I agree, you know.

42:24.280 --> 42:26.600
Maybe you're suddenly seeing like the config options

42:26.600 --> 42:27.760
for the kernel for the first time,

42:27.760 --> 42:29.800
and you're like, oh yeah, I can tweak these.

42:29.800 --> 42:32.440
Yeah, you know, that is a great point,

42:32.440 --> 42:34.200
is you really,

42:34.200 --> 42:36.240
learning how you put the whole kernel together

42:36.240 --> 42:39.320
and how you move that, you create that image

42:39.320 --> 42:41.880
and you move things around and like just-

42:41.880 --> 42:43.480
Picking new modules you want built in

42:43.480 --> 42:44.920
or just available on the side.

42:44.920 --> 42:46.400
Even understanding what the difference

42:46.400 --> 42:49.040
between having it built in and having it as a module

42:49.040 --> 42:50.320
was like a huge thing for me.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.800
Like, oh right, that's okay.

42:51.800 --> 42:53.080
I mean, I knew about kernel modules,

42:53.080 --> 42:54.720
but you really got your,

42:54.720 --> 42:56.960
you know, the great thing is you still could do that.

42:56.960 --> 42:57.960
You still could, you know.

42:57.960 --> 42:59.840
So I say, you know, what we ought to do.

42:59.840 --> 43:01.200
Well, here, let's go forward.

43:01.200 --> 43:02.200
Oh, good, indoor plumbing once again.

43:02.200 --> 43:03.200
Wow, we really went back.

43:03.200 --> 43:04.200
I got to say though, I mean, it's not like you,

43:04.200 --> 43:05.200
we don't sit down and get to work and we never go,

43:05.200 --> 43:06.200
geez, I sure wish Wes knew how to use Linux better.

43:06.200 --> 43:07.200
I don't think that's ever been a problem.

43:07.200 --> 43:08.200
So you've managed, you managed just fine.

43:08.200 --> 43:09.200
I suppose so.

43:09.200 --> 43:10.200
Yeah, you did fine.

43:10.200 --> 43:11.200
And there's, you know,

43:11.200 --> 43:12.200
I'm sure there'll be future challenges.

43:12.200 --> 43:32.440
On the show, we'll see what weird distros we can cook up.

43:32.440 --> 43:34.980
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.100
Get started with a free trial of teams or enterprise plan

43:37.100 --> 43:38.760
at bitwarden.com slash Linux,

43:38.760 --> 43:41.640
or try it for free as an individual user.

43:41.640 --> 43:43.520
You are talking to some Bitwarden users right here

43:43.520 --> 43:44.520
on the show.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.700
I love it as an individual user,

43:46.700 --> 43:48.240
but then it really took it to the next level

43:48.240 --> 43:50.300
and we started using it as a business for JB.

43:50.300 --> 43:52.560
You can use it to share and sync your sensitive data.

43:52.560 --> 43:53.960
It's not just passwords.

43:53.960 --> 43:55.920
I have other information in there,

43:55.920 --> 43:57.940
including things like some of the different shipping endpoints

43:57.940 --> 44:01.680
for sending stuff to the hosts or authentication,

44:01.680 --> 44:04.800
two factor codes, phrases, like some,

44:04.800 --> 44:08.360
some of my software requires recovery phrases like element.

44:08.360 --> 44:09.880
I'll store that in there.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.300
It's just a nice spot to have all of that.

44:11.300 --> 44:13.600
And you have peace of mind knowing that Bitwarden

44:13.600 --> 44:14.780
is open source.

44:14.780 --> 44:17.760
It's already trusted by millions of individuals.

44:17.760 --> 44:19.460
There's teams out there using it.

44:19.460 --> 44:22.040
There is a large community that's also practicing

44:22.040 --> 44:23.720
self-hosting the Bitwarden stuff.

44:23.720 --> 44:25.580
So you always have that as an option.

44:25.580 --> 44:27.360
I've opted to go for Bitwarden Cloud.

44:27.360 --> 44:28.900
I don't know if it, I must've asked you,

44:28.900 --> 44:29.900
but I've forgotten.

44:29.900 --> 44:31.400
Wes, do you use a Bitwarden Cloud

44:31.400 --> 44:33.280
or are you using local hosting?

44:33.280 --> 44:34.340
You know, I've done both.

44:34.340 --> 44:35.760
Right now I'm using the cloud as well.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.740
I love that there's the self-hosted option,

44:37.740 --> 44:39.000
but I also like that, you know,

44:39.000 --> 44:41.080
I felt the price is super reasonable.

44:41.080 --> 44:43.480
So it's sort of like it's a way that I can fund development

44:43.480 --> 44:45.040
and I don't have, you know, just one less thing

44:45.040 --> 44:45.920
I have to personally host.

44:45.920 --> 44:49.520
But I know if I want to do, I have the option.

44:49.520 --> 44:50.720
Well, check this out.

44:50.720 --> 44:52.440
New feature landing right now.

44:52.440 --> 44:55.640
I think you're gonna love this.

44:55.640 --> 44:58.240
And I can't believe I never thought about this.

44:58.240 --> 45:00.680
They're now adding a username generator.

45:00.680 --> 45:02.280
Oh, that's clever.

45:02.280 --> 45:03.120
Right?

45:03.120 --> 45:04.680
I mean, they've already got that handy password generator,

45:04.680 --> 45:05.520
so why not?

45:05.520 --> 45:06.760
Take it to the next level.

45:06.760 --> 45:08.320
And I don't need the same username.

45:08.320 --> 45:12.120
I out of habit use like the same two usernames everywhere.

45:12.120 --> 45:13.480
But do you care, especially on like, you know,

45:13.480 --> 45:16.120
just the random accounts that you have to have?

45:16.120 --> 45:20.240
Like for like banking stuff or like health site login stuff

45:20.240 --> 45:21.880
for like the health plan for wash.

45:21.880 --> 45:24.840
Like why am I using my NICs that I use

45:24.840 --> 45:26.080
on like public places there?

45:26.080 --> 45:27.700
That's ridiculous.

45:27.700 --> 45:29.080
Because I don't want to have to think of a username

45:29.080 --> 45:29.920
all the time.

45:29.920 --> 45:31.160
It's like what we used to do with passwords.

45:31.160 --> 45:32.120
I never even thought about it.

45:32.120 --> 45:33.120
And like, you think about it now,

45:33.120 --> 45:34.600
like isn't that way better,

45:34.600 --> 45:36.680
say if some service does get compromised

45:36.680 --> 45:38.680
and their username and password database leaks,

45:38.680 --> 45:40.760
if you're using a random password

45:40.760 --> 45:42.640
and a random username stored in Bitwarden for that,

45:42.640 --> 45:43.580
like you're fine.

45:43.580 --> 45:44.420
Yeah, that seems.

45:44.420 --> 45:45.280
It's a total non-issue.

45:45.280 --> 45:48.240
Even you decide, I love that they're adding that.

45:48.240 --> 45:50.660
And if you, this is also really cool.

45:50.660 --> 45:52.140
The generator offers an option

45:52.140 --> 45:54.840
for creating a random plus email address

45:54.840 --> 45:56.020
if your service supports that.

45:56.020 --> 45:58.900
So like Gmail, you know, like username plus

45:58.900 --> 46:00.760
your actual email at gmail.com.

46:00.760 --> 46:01.600
That's super handy.

46:01.600 --> 46:03.220
Yeah, they'll fill that in for the, what?

46:03.220 --> 46:05.320
I know they must have some logic in there that figures out.

46:05.320 --> 46:06.640
It's so great.

46:06.640 --> 46:08.280
They're adding stuff all the time too.

46:08.280 --> 46:10.120
And it's nice just knowing that you have

46:10.120 --> 46:12.800
that kind of security hygiene.

46:12.800 --> 46:14.560
So go try it out and support the show.

46:14.560 --> 46:18.540
It's easy to get started by going to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

46:18.540 --> 46:20.100
Use it for yourself, use it for your business,

46:20.100 --> 46:22.680
or maybe the open source project you're working with.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.280
So go try it out and support the show.

46:24.280 --> 46:26.920
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

46:26.920 --> 46:31.520
Many of you wrote in this week with feedback.

46:31.520 --> 46:32.960
Thank you very much.

46:32.960 --> 46:35.760
We got a few on the topic of the generic

46:35.760 --> 46:39.520
ARM Linux images that we had, I say talk about,

46:39.520 --> 46:41.320
but it was a micro rant I think that Chris

46:41.320 --> 46:43.040
might have slipped into.

46:43.040 --> 46:45.380
Michael wrote in and suggests,

46:45.380 --> 46:47.800
the problem is that there's no such thing

46:47.800 --> 46:52.800
as a generic ARM system, at least in the same sense as x86.

46:53.200 --> 46:55.380
Every ARM device has its own bootloader system,

46:55.380 --> 46:58.720
device tree, and proprietary drivers and blobs.

46:58.720 --> 47:02.320
As an example of how crazy and nonstandard things are in ARM,

47:02.320 --> 47:04.620
the Raspberry Pi actually uses the GPU

47:04.620 --> 47:06.480
to run the bootloader.

47:06.480 --> 47:09.360
This is why all you can find are images for the Pi

47:09.360 --> 47:13.320
or for individual SOCs like the Pine 64.

47:13.320 --> 47:16.200
Among ARM devices, there's no such thing

47:16.200 --> 47:19.600
as standardized UEFI boot systems, for example,

47:19.600 --> 47:23.000
and no standard way to boot from a USB stick.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.240
In my mind, these are the reasons ARM

47:25.240 --> 47:27.560
has really not made much progress in the desktop

47:27.560 --> 47:30.840
and laptop computer space outside of Apple.

47:30.840 --> 47:33.720
I want to love ARM and I want it to succeed

47:33.720 --> 47:35.240
and be everywhere, I really do,

47:35.240 --> 47:38.560
but not until some basic standardization occurs

47:38.560 --> 47:42.520
and we can get generic Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, et cetera,

47:42.520 --> 47:46.440
for ARM that can boot on all laptops and desktops.

47:46.440 --> 47:50.560
This is a grade A email, grade A.

47:50.560 --> 47:54.740
Michael nails the problem, but Michael overlooks one thing.

47:54.740 --> 47:57.280
There is a standard generic ARM system

47:57.280 --> 48:00.880
and it's virtualized ARM and it's becoming super common

48:00.880 --> 48:03.200
because more and more ARM boards are capable

48:03.200 --> 48:05.920
of virtualization and additionally,

48:05.920 --> 48:10.920
every MacBook M1 or iMac M1 user out there

48:10.920 --> 48:14.000
now has access to creating generic ARM machines

48:14.000 --> 48:16.960
and it is super common to virtualize Linux

48:16.960 --> 48:19.200
on the Mac OS desktop for all kinds

48:19.200 --> 48:21.200
of development reasons and other reasons.

48:21.200 --> 48:25.240
And when these projects only release Raspberry Pi images

48:25.240 --> 48:27.680
like our friends at Ubuntu MATE

48:27.680 --> 48:29.340
or our friends at Home Assistant,

48:29.340 --> 48:33.240
then these new M1 virtualization platforms,

48:33.240 --> 48:35.880
which are fantastic virtualization machines,

48:35.880 --> 48:40.320
for example, Parallels 17 on Mac OS on the M1

48:40.320 --> 48:42.640
supports vert GPU pass-through.

48:42.640 --> 48:44.920
So you get a full OpenGL accelerated

48:44.920 --> 48:46.360
virtualization experience.

48:46.360 --> 48:49.120
So it's using that vert IO pass-through driver

48:49.120 --> 48:51.680
with Parallels 17 to talk to Metal.

48:51.680 --> 48:54.080
So the actual Linux desktop is rendered

48:54.080 --> 48:57.560
on the Mac client side using the local Metal API,

48:57.560 --> 48:59.800
but on the back side is passing through

48:59.800 --> 49:03.360
the virtual card GPU acceleration stuff.

49:03.360 --> 49:04.720
It's a great experience.

49:04.720 --> 49:08.280
And the fact that we're not releasing ARM images

49:08.280 --> 49:11.160
for general ARM virtualization means that

49:12.160 --> 49:16.240
a bunch of like CI test flows are not possible

49:16.240 --> 49:17.760
and everyone who's on one of these M1 chips

49:17.760 --> 49:19.680
can't virtualize that project.

49:19.680 --> 49:22.320
And I would love to just see projects just target that,

49:22.320 --> 49:25.560
like OpenSUSE has one of these, Fedora has one of these.

49:25.560 --> 49:27.920
You can, there are projects out there

49:27.920 --> 49:30.440
that just release these generic ARM ISOs

49:30.440 --> 49:31.920
and they're not image files.

49:31.920 --> 49:35.280
We're not flashing to an SD card like a child's toy, right?

49:35.280 --> 49:37.640
They're ISO files and we're installing them

49:37.640 --> 49:39.600
like a desktop operating system.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.880
And it makes a difference that it is a micro RAM,

49:42.880 --> 49:43.920
but it matters.

49:43.920 --> 49:46.000
And the ARM platform is becoming more and more prevalent

49:46.000 --> 49:49.160
now thanks to in part Chrome OS and Apple.

49:49.160 --> 49:52.520
But ultimately what Michael is touching on here

49:52.520 --> 49:54.320
where there's like all these different

49:54.320 --> 49:56.640
ARM boards and systems,

49:56.640 --> 49:59.400
and you require all these special kernel drivers and stuff.

49:59.400 --> 50:00.360
It is a mess.

50:00.360 --> 50:01.200
Yeah, right.

50:01.200 --> 50:02.760
And now, so suddenly now this more generic

50:02.760 --> 50:04.360
virtualized one is just one more.

50:04.360 --> 50:05.440
Yeah, it totally is.

50:05.440 --> 50:08.320
And this is why we have followed RISC-V with interest

50:08.320 --> 50:11.560
because it would be so nice to solve this problem.

50:11.560 --> 50:14.200
ARM is not the hero we have been looking for,

50:14.200 --> 50:16.680
but it may be the hero we end up getting stuck with

50:16.680 --> 50:19.160
because of just the industry support around it.

50:19.160 --> 50:20.680
Because you got to understand like that scale

50:20.680 --> 50:23.200
of manufacturing means that there is just

50:23.200 --> 50:24.880
a ton of ARM boards out there,

50:24.880 --> 50:26.640
a ton of ARM code out there.

50:26.640 --> 50:29.320
It's kind of like got momentum as they say.

50:31.200 --> 50:34.360
And now it is time for the boost.

50:34.360 --> 50:37.080
Marcel boosted in with a thousand sats

50:37.080 --> 50:38.360
with a great question.

50:38.360 --> 50:40.160
If Firefox is open source,

50:40.160 --> 50:43.200
how can Mozilla oblige anyone to distribute it

50:43.200 --> 50:44.680
in a particular way?

50:44.680 --> 50:45.840
It's a great question.

50:45.840 --> 50:47.360
Probably something we should have talked about.

50:47.360 --> 50:50.680
So last episode, it came up that Firefox is a snap

50:50.680 --> 50:54.200
and it is something that was worked out

50:54.200 --> 50:57.240
between Mozilla and Canonical at Mozilla's request.

50:57.240 --> 50:59.160
And people were just kind of discovering this as a thing

50:59.160 --> 51:00.920
as they upgraded to the new LTS,

51:00.920 --> 51:02.680
even though it's been a thing for a minute.

51:02.680 --> 51:04.480
Does anybody here know why that is the case?

51:04.480 --> 51:06.400
I have a guess, I don't know for sure,

51:06.400 --> 51:08.280
but I have a pretty strong guess.

51:08.280 --> 51:11.160
Something about redistributing trademarks, et cetera?

51:11.160 --> 51:12.920
Copyright and trademark, right?

51:12.920 --> 51:16.400
And if Canonical wants to put the Firefox name on there

51:16.400 --> 51:18.520
and the Firefox logo, which they would

51:18.520 --> 51:21.680
because they wanna look like a legitimate desktop,

51:21.680 --> 51:24.040
then they need to follow the wishes

51:24.040 --> 51:26.000
of the trademark and copyright owner.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.720
And this is just how sometimes US law is enforced

51:29.720 --> 51:33.400
to maintain the rights of free software for better or worse.

51:33.400 --> 51:36.160
Sometimes we use it to our advantage, right?

51:36.160 --> 51:38.480
The GPL is copyleft.

51:38.480 --> 51:41.880
It's Richard Stallman's troll of copyright law, basically.

51:41.880 --> 51:45.280
He's using copyright law to protect free software.

51:45.280 --> 51:47.720
It's actually very brilliant.

51:47.720 --> 51:51.080
But the other side is you can also use it to dictate terms.

51:51.080 --> 51:53.240
That's why some distros ship things like Iceweasel

51:53.240 --> 51:54.760
and stuff like that.

51:55.640 --> 51:58.440
Neville, you boosts in with a hundred sets.

51:58.440 --> 52:00.560
Imagine if Valve chose to use NixOS

52:00.560 --> 52:03.400
for the Steam Deck instead of Arch.

52:03.400 --> 52:05.520
I'm curious about the rabbit hole of discussion

52:05.520 --> 52:08.880
we could truly go down when pondering this question.

52:08.880 --> 52:10.080
Will Valve gain some benefits

52:10.080 --> 52:11.840
from using NixOS instead of Arch?

52:11.840 --> 52:13.200
Or is Arch a better option

52:13.200 --> 52:15.680
just due to how familiar the community is with it?

52:15.680 --> 52:17.200
This is a great question.

52:17.200 --> 52:19.560
Nev, that is, I wonder, right?

52:19.560 --> 52:21.760
Part of you wonders, did they just not know?

52:21.760 --> 52:23.680
Is there just not enough people out there

52:23.680 --> 52:25.720
talking about how they use Nix?

52:25.720 --> 52:28.720
But I think ultimately from Valve,

52:28.720 --> 52:29.560
tell me what you think, Wes,

52:29.560 --> 52:33.280
but I think it all came from we want upstream drivers

52:33.280 --> 52:35.160
and code as fast as possible.

52:35.160 --> 52:37.040
And when you ask that question to the Linux community,

52:37.040 --> 52:38.640
the answer's Arch, right?

52:38.640 --> 52:41.040
Yeah, and I mean, I guess it kind of depends

52:41.040 --> 52:41.960
on what they're comfortable with,

52:41.960 --> 52:43.680
what their engineers want to work with.

52:43.680 --> 52:45.840
And then, I mean, I could see,

52:45.840 --> 52:47.400
obviously there's a lot of benefits to NixOS,

52:47.400 --> 52:49.320
especially for the system aspect,

52:49.320 --> 52:53.040
but once you get to the Steam piece, less so, right?

52:53.040 --> 52:55.160
Like that's all gonna be outside of the build system

52:55.160 --> 52:57.000
and any of that anyway.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.040
You could, they could totally have a repo.

52:59.040 --> 53:00.840
I mean, like they could totally make it work with Nix,

53:00.840 --> 53:01.680
but you're right.

53:01.680 --> 53:03.240
Like once you get to the Steam client,

53:03.240 --> 53:05.520
the desktop stuff, Proton.

53:05.520 --> 53:06.840
And maybe, I mean, you know,

53:06.840 --> 53:08.680
I'm not saying that if you did go full Nix

53:08.680 --> 53:09.960
with that stuff that there wouldn't be benefits.

53:09.960 --> 53:10.800
I'm sure there would be,

53:10.800 --> 53:13.520
but just is that a realistic goal to add on

53:13.520 --> 53:15.000
or would it be sort of a hodgepodge?

53:15.000 --> 53:16.280
And then if they're not doing that much

53:16.280 --> 53:18.440
with the base system to start with,

53:18.440 --> 53:20.480
maybe there's not, that wasn't the biggest concern.

53:20.480 --> 53:21.960
Well, and here's a wild idea.

53:23.480 --> 53:25.160
What about developers, right?

53:25.160 --> 53:27.560
You want a system that is approachable by developers.

53:27.560 --> 53:29.080
And I think we all remember

53:29.080 --> 53:31.920
that during the Steam Deck developer period,

53:31.920 --> 53:33.320
Valve said, well, if you can't get your hands

53:33.320 --> 53:35.800
on a Steam Deck, here is a machine that specs similar,

53:35.800 --> 53:37.760
just install Manjaro.

53:37.760 --> 53:39.600
Like that's not as easy with NixOS.

53:39.600 --> 53:42.080
There's no Manjaro for NixOS.

53:42.080 --> 53:43.200
And that might play a role as well

53:43.200 --> 53:44.520
as the developer story here.

53:44.520 --> 53:46.120
But it would have meant that Valve didn't have

53:46.120 --> 53:49.120
to concoct their whole imaging read-only file system

53:49.120 --> 53:52.240
solution that they've kind of bolted on top of Arch, right?

53:52.240 --> 53:53.840
That whole, all of that would you just get

53:53.840 --> 53:55.640
that kind of reliability with Nix.

53:55.640 --> 53:58.280
It does maybe, and I suppose perhaps the Flatpak setup

53:58.280 --> 53:59.440
could work in a similar way.

53:59.440 --> 54:02.800
It does maybe make it a little more friendly for tinkering.

54:02.800 --> 54:06.160
Our next boost came in from exception or something like that.

54:06.160 --> 54:08.880
That's a pretty clever username.

54:08.880 --> 54:11.360
Just my two cents about real-time patches for Linux,

54:11.360 --> 54:14.840
because we talked about Ubuntu 22.04, including

54:14.840 --> 54:19.440
real-time patches of Linux with their Ubuntu Advantage service.

54:19.440 --> 54:21.680
But exception writes, it turns out

54:21.680 --> 54:25.520
that Linux is not really a real-time OS.

54:25.520 --> 54:28.880
We can make the OS OK for real-time operations

54:28.880 --> 54:31.320
with the ability of certain latency deadlines

54:31.320 --> 54:33.000
with these real-time patches.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.680
You see, I'm from a generation where

54:34.680 --> 54:38.240
we were told that an OS must be designed from the ground up

54:38.240 --> 54:38.960
for real-time.

54:38.960 --> 54:40.560
I remember that thinking too, actually.

54:40.560 --> 54:42.440
In fact, I until recently thought

54:42.440 --> 54:43.840
that was how it still was.

54:43.840 --> 54:47.200
But exception goes on to say, but we built Linux

54:47.200 --> 54:50.880
so that it was flexible, so that it could be adapted like no OS

54:50.880 --> 54:53.080
before it for all sorts of purposes,

54:53.080 --> 54:55.840
embedded Android server, and we found a way

54:55.840 --> 54:57.280
to make it work with Linux.

54:57.280 --> 55:00.720
Truly open source is the way.

55:00.720 --> 55:02.320
That's great.

55:02.320 --> 55:06.960
That's a great point, that now because of Linux's open nature,

55:06.960 --> 55:09.400
a company could come along and create these real-time patches

55:09.400 --> 55:11.440
who was just recently acquired by Intel

55:11.440 --> 55:15.640
and essentially create these latency deadlines.

55:15.640 --> 55:18.280
Wes, you had a really good explanation recently

55:18.280 --> 55:21.120
of how Linux is real-time or isn't real-time.

55:21.120 --> 55:22.400
Do you recall what it was?

55:22.400 --> 55:23.920
Well, I mean, I think there is still some points here

55:23.920 --> 55:25.960
that you might not use it for all tasks, right?

55:25.960 --> 55:28.320
But it is adding this ability to the kernel

55:28.320 --> 55:30.960
to approach stuff with more deterministic deadlines

55:30.960 --> 55:33.280
so that you do have a little more guarantees

55:33.280 --> 55:35.440
that the tasks that you need to have happen

55:35.440 --> 55:37.640
can happen within a set boundary.

55:37.640 --> 55:39.360
And that is kind of the key of it, right?

55:39.360 --> 55:41.680
Is that this task will execute

55:41.680 --> 55:43.360
within this guaranteed window of time.

55:43.360 --> 55:45.000
Yeah, because on a non-real-time system,

55:45.000 --> 55:46.920
you might have some unpredictable latency

55:46.920 --> 55:50.320
that even if it only happens a tiny percentage of the time,

55:50.320 --> 55:52.080
it could mean that your safety check

55:52.080 --> 55:53.640
for some industrial machine

55:53.640 --> 55:55.320
didn't happen within those tight timeframes.

55:55.320 --> 55:57.280
And so you can, with a real-time kernel,

55:57.280 --> 55:59.880
you're often trading some kind of overall throughput

55:59.880 --> 56:02.200
for the system to keep things within that boundary

56:02.200 --> 56:05.200
so you know the system will predictably keep ticking on.

56:05.200 --> 56:06.920
And this conversation really came up on this show

56:06.920 --> 56:10.240
when we had Tim on from JPL and he was talking about

56:10.240 --> 56:12.680
how the Linux Copter is a real-time kernel

56:12.680 --> 56:14.640
because of these reasons that you just outlined.

56:14.640 --> 56:15.920
And so Exception wanted to write in

56:15.920 --> 56:17.040
and just kind of point out that like,

56:17.040 --> 56:18.320
when we talk about real-time,

56:18.320 --> 56:20.200
that's actually what we're talking about.

56:20.200 --> 56:21.040
That's how it works.

56:21.040 --> 56:22.960
It's sort of these guarantees

56:22.960 --> 56:25.360
that within a certain window of latency of time,

56:25.360 --> 56:26.680
this task will execute.

56:26.680 --> 56:29.080
And when you're in an industrial application,

56:29.080 --> 56:30.360
that's absolutely necessary.

56:30.360 --> 56:31.840
And it's neat because like, I think there, you know,

56:31.840 --> 56:34.680
there's still our specific real-time operating systems

56:34.680 --> 56:36.000
for stuff where that's really important

56:36.000 --> 56:37.400
or you need to build on that base.

56:37.400 --> 56:40.640
This just opens up, you know, for maybe the, you know,

56:40.640 --> 56:42.080
the top tier of those things.

56:42.080 --> 56:44.800
Well, that's a category Linux can play in now.

56:44.800 --> 56:47.480
We got a double boost from Nev this week.

56:47.480 --> 56:50.400
Nev wrote in, I would like to interject for a moment

56:50.400 --> 56:52.720
and comment that this podcast does not contain

56:52.720 --> 56:54.640
any mention of Gen2 nor Emacs.

56:54.640 --> 56:56.640
Ah, we fixed that this week at least.

56:56.640 --> 56:59.320
As such, I publicly challenge the next person

56:59.320 --> 57:02.360
who sends stats to JB to install Gen2 Linux

57:02.360 --> 57:04.400
and daily drive it for one week.

57:04.400 --> 57:08.120
If they can prove, I will directly send them 5,000 stats

57:08.120 --> 57:11.080
with JB getting an additional 5,000 stats

57:11.080 --> 57:13.000
and giving them the right to declare

57:13.000 --> 57:14.440
the next boost challenge.

57:14.440 --> 57:15.520
A boost challenge.

57:15.520 --> 57:16.720
Boost challenge, wow.

57:16.720 --> 57:18.480
Boost challenge declared by Nev.

57:19.480 --> 57:22.240
So, you gotta run Gen2 for a week.

57:22.240 --> 57:24.960
And I think to make this work, you probably have to have,

57:24.960 --> 57:26.880
it has to be a new install of Gen2.

57:26.880 --> 57:27.720
You can't like, cause you know, people.

57:27.720 --> 57:29.520
Yeah, if you're already using it, that doesn't count.

57:29.520 --> 57:31.040
You know, there's like five guys listening right now.

57:31.040 --> 57:31.880
They're like, crap.

57:31.880 --> 57:35.800
But, you gotta have a new install.

57:35.800 --> 57:37.800
And if you can prove it, I don't know,

57:37.800 --> 57:38.920
will you take a picture of your computer

57:38.920 --> 57:39.760
with the newspaper?

57:39.760 --> 57:41.400
I don't know how you prove it.

57:41.400 --> 57:42.400
You come up with something.

57:42.400 --> 57:44.520
You start it with a screenshot with the New York Times up

57:44.520 --> 57:46.520
and you end it with a screenshot with the New York Times up.

57:46.520 --> 57:47.760
I don't know, I don't know.

57:47.760 --> 57:48.880
It's, you know, it's like a,

57:48.880 --> 57:50.560
you got your terminal going with a.

57:50.560 --> 57:52.400
Yeah, like something.

57:52.400 --> 57:53.720
OS release, and then you got like

57:53.720 --> 57:54.960
the front page of Hacker News.

57:54.960 --> 57:56.480
Yeah, okay.

57:56.480 --> 57:58.160
You do it for a week.

57:58.160 --> 58:00.640
You send, and you send us some boosts proving it

58:00.640 --> 58:02.920
and then Neve will send you 5,000 SATs

58:02.920 --> 58:04.080
and send us 5,000 SATs

58:04.080 --> 58:06.640
and then we get to declare a boost challenge.

58:06.640 --> 58:08.480
Which that's what I'm looking forward to.

58:08.480 --> 58:09.320
I got all kinds of ideas.

58:09.320 --> 58:10.520
I like, I like, it's a weird mix

58:10.520 --> 58:12.480
of like an NPR style fundraiser,

58:12.480 --> 58:15.600
but also like the ice bucket challenge from years back.

58:15.600 --> 58:17.680
So I don't know what's going on, but I support it.

58:17.680 --> 58:19.160
Boost to Graham.

58:19.160 --> 58:20.960
Also just want to mention

58:20.960 --> 58:23.200
that you can essentially send me a PM via boost

58:23.200 --> 58:25.240
like a NorCal Linux dad did.

58:25.240 --> 58:27.080
He sent me just a little FYI

58:27.080 --> 58:30.120
so I know about something going on with an upcoming event.

58:30.120 --> 58:31.440
And he knew it would be right in front of my face.

58:31.440 --> 58:35.680
And as I start rethinking how I want to have myself available

58:35.680 --> 58:37.560
I think it's going to be the contact form

58:37.560 --> 58:40.080
and boosts are going to be like the top two ways

58:40.080 --> 58:41.480
to get messages in.

58:41.480 --> 58:43.720
So you can send a direct message to me

58:43.720 --> 58:45.360
who has a boost as well.

58:45.360 --> 58:46.600
And you can actually use,

58:46.600 --> 58:48.520
there's these URLs you can use now.

58:48.520 --> 58:49.360
It's pretty cool.

58:49.360 --> 58:50.200
We're going to go into,

58:50.200 --> 58:51.320
there's all kinds of stuff going on in podcasting

58:51.320 --> 58:54.040
including some new standards that are rolling out.

58:54.040 --> 58:57.560
Ooh, a new cool backend technology that's happening.

58:57.560 --> 59:00.280
Also a super awesome way to,

59:00.280 --> 59:01.320
something I want to talk about after the show,

59:01.320 --> 59:04.040
a super awesome way to generate RSS feeds.

59:04.040 --> 59:04.880
All of that.

59:04.880 --> 59:06.480
So we're covering some of those podcasting developments

59:06.480 --> 59:09.080
in office hours now to kind of keep it out of this show.

59:09.080 --> 59:11.040
So we can stay focused on the Linux here.

59:11.040 --> 59:11.960
There's enough going on.

59:11.960 --> 59:14.760
But it is such an interesting time.

59:14.760 --> 59:17.240
There is some really awesome new stuff being developed.

59:17.240 --> 59:18.920
And when you hear it, you're like, wow,

59:18.920 --> 59:22.000
how have we not had this stuff in podcasting before?

59:22.000 --> 59:24.960
Like podcasting just sort of sat around for a decade

59:24.960 --> 59:26.760
and really did nothing new.

59:26.760 --> 59:30.320
But podcasting 2.0 has a lot of really cool new features.

59:30.320 --> 59:31.960
And I've been playing around with systems

59:31.960 --> 59:33.320
to help us generate transcripts.

59:33.320 --> 59:34.160
Cause that's one of them.

59:34.160 --> 59:35.160
Oh yeah.

59:35.160 --> 59:36.320
Yeah. See, I can just get going forever.

59:36.320 --> 59:38.240
Anyways, we'll put it in office hours from time to time.

59:38.240 --> 59:40.840
So go check that out at officehours.hair.

59:40.840 --> 59:43.000
But if you want more of this show,

59:43.000 --> 59:45.680
you can become a member either with the whole network

59:45.680 --> 59:47.480
and all of the shows and all of their bonus features

59:47.480 --> 59:48.960
at jupyter.party,

59:48.960 --> 59:50.680
or you can become an unplugged core contributor

59:50.680 --> 59:53.520
at unpluggedcore.com and sign up as a member.

59:53.520 --> 59:56.040
And you get access to two different options,

59:56.040 --> 59:57.320
two different perks,

59:57.320 --> 01:00:01.320
but by far by like a huge margin,

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.560
like by 90%, the preference is the live stream.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.200
I could basically stop even mentioning

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.280
that we have a ad free version.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.160
People do not care.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.280
They want the live stream version.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.920
That's the one everybody wants.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.760
And that's, you know,

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.240
we try to make a lot of extra content

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.280
in the pre and post show.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.240
And you get to hear, like,

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:18.960
if we stopped for a pee break and Wes and Brent just,

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.160
you know, chew up the, you know, the chat.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.320
So that's unpluggedcore.com

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.280
or you can support the entire network at jupyter.party.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.920
The whole thing is if you get a little value

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.600
from the show from time to time or frequently,

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.920
that's another way you can contribute back.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.840
But another way is to join us live.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.200
We do the show on Sundays at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.080
Send us an email.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.920
That's also a great way to contribute some value

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.120
is give us some feedback,

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.760
maybe give us an idea, make a contact,

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.520
or we really appreciate it

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.200
when you spread the word about the show.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.280
That's a great way to really contribute some value back

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.600
because who wants to listen to a podcast just cold?

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.560
The podcasts you want to listen to

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.760
are the ones you get told about.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.320
Yeah, you know, put it on a speaker

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.440
outside your house all day.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.400
Maybe you get driving someone in the car

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.480
for an unrelated reason.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.040
Throw Linux Unplugged on.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.360
See you next week.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.880
Same bad time, same bad station.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.000
Oh yeah, of course.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.840
Of course, we should mention, too,

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.640
the companion show, linuxactionnews.com.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.000
Lots going on every single week.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.640
Wes and I break it down to linuxactionnews.com.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.560
Links to what we talked about today in this here show

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:22.240
at linuxunplugged.com, slash 456.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.080
You know, we should mention,

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.400
Linux Action News is gonna be out

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.720
a little bit late this week.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.560
You're right.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.400
Just a little bit, so.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.680
Little bit of a delay.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.520
Just wait.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.360
Yeah, just subscribe.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.360
There's always the all shows feed.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.200
You just get everything.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.960
Like Office Hours, like Linux Action News, and this show.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.080
Anyways, that wraps it up for us.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:37.920
Thanks so much for joining us

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.360
on this week's episode of The Unplugged Program.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.840
See you right back here next week.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:53.840
This week's episode of The Unplugged Program is brought to you

01:01:53.840 --> 01:02:15.840
by Tiny.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.280
Tiny made a good point in the mumble room, too.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.400
Another perk for Valve going with, say, Arch over Nix

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.320
is the community has just built a lot of tooling already.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.000
There's a lot there for them to just leverage immediately.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:28.840
That's a solid point.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.560
And of course, Valve would want to take advantage of that.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:34.840
Although, I suppose, as Kukuf mentioned in the IRC.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:35.680
What was that?

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:36.520
I'm sorry?

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.360
You heard me.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.560
That, I mean, Nix would probably be pretty great

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.160
at generating that read-only image.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.400
That's what, that was my point.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.920
It's like a lot of the work they did

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:47.360
to make Arch consumable by consumers,

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.160
they would have just inherited with Nix.

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.480
And then they could just set up a few repos

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.840
and add a couple of lines to the config and good to go.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:57.240
And they basically have their own custom OS.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.000
That's what's so slick about it.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.120
We got some other really good feedback on the ARM stuff.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.440
We just didn't have a chance to fit it in the main show.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.240
But Paul wrote in, I think it was Paul, right?

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.920
We hit a nerve in the arm, I could say.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:10.800
You're right.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.960
You could say that.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.960
He writes, when ARM-based platforms became

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.840
a thing in the Linux world, nothing

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.680
told the OS what processor it ran on

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.240
or which peripherals were connected.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.840
And he goes on to talk about how it was just such a mess

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.720
early on.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.880
And it got old.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.600
And we needed device reconfigurations.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.240
We had to create that.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.880
There had to be all of this work.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.720
And he says, now, these days, we've sort of figured it out.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.920
And we don't need separate kernels.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.000
But back then, one of the ways they were doing this

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.400
was different kernels for different ARM devices.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.280
And we forget it wasn't really that long ago.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.560
It is getting a lot better now.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.640
And we are seeing a lot more support for at least

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.600
the Raspberry Pi side.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.200
Paul makes a good point there.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.160
And we've seen all the trouble in Project Treble

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.680
over in the Android world.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.080
And he says it's still not great.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.960
He's like, you know, you look at it today,

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.000
it's still pretty difficult to support the different boards

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:00.880
with the same kernel.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.680
Because often, there are patches that

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:04.680
can kind of conflict with each other to enable.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.480
Yeah.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.200
You can see that, too, if they have custom video cards or USB

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.640
buses or network adapters.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.920
I feel like it's especially painful because we're always

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.800
following up on what's coming out in the latest kernel.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.120
And then on those devices, you're

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:17.640
stuck with probably a LTS kernel or something

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.000
that they've chosen to, hopefully,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.380
that they've chosen to build for you.

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:20.880
Yeah.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.280
This is why, ultimately, you just

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.640
hear us talk more about the Pi on here.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.400
Because that all works now.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.760
That's all upstream in the kernel.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.060
It all works now in the kernel.

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.560
And that's a big deal.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:34.000
When I say ecosystem, that's kind

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.120
of what I'm talking about.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:52.400
It's going to be PIs and Mac Minis.
