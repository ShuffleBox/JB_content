00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 29 for February 25th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that just put it all out there this week.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
My name is Chris.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
My name is Matt.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
Hey there, Matt. I'm totally pumped up. We've got a special guest in studio right now. Hey there, Chase.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Hey, guys.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Hey, Chase.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Hey, how's it going?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
I'm glad you're here today.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Hey, you know it's a beautiful day.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
It really is.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
And the best time to be doing a show is inside when it's a nice day.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah. Well, at least we have the window cracked so we can get like some sort of fresh air.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Have I told you how much I love this effin' jam?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
This song is Mr. Jankies.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Ronald Jankies is the man.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I know. That's why I have him on my boobs today.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
That's not the only reason. I mean, we're going to be talking about how to Linux and brainstorming with our mumble room.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
You know, I figured if we're doing a show about Linux, why not have some of the preparation and some of the thought that goes into it

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
and some of the logic and reasoning that goes into making a show out in the open too.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
So essentially...

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Wait, no. Chris.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Our source is going to be out there.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Chris, not a good idea.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
No?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
No, because then you're going to be spreading the secrets of the secret sauce.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
That's true.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
And then what's going to happen, Chris, is you're going to get these copycats.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
They're going to try to do...

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Chase, Chase, I've got to stop you right there.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I don't know. I don't know.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
The secret sauce isn't in the mechanics.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Wait, what?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
It's in the content.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Oh, yeah. That's right.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
I know. I know.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
I forgot about that.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Sometimes I forget that too.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
What, content?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah. Like this week.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Content's king.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
Actually, I'm really actually kind of excited because we just got our first test challenge coin in.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Oh, my God. I felt it in my hands by the way.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I touched it.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I touched it.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
How did it feel, Chase?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
How did it feel?

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
It was hard, yet smooth, and it felt good to the touch.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
No, I'm talking about the coin.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
How did the coin feel?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Oh, the coin was great.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Yeah.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Okay.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Thank you very much.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
So, if you guys didn't know, I don't know, maybe you live under a rock.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
That's okay.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
I won't hold it against you.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
I just...

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Just a little judgey.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
No, I mean this coin, by the way, the picture doesn't...

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
The coin comes with every last shirt.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
It does.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Every last 300 shirts.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
By the way, there's one thing that you're not seeing in this picture.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
What's that?

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
The other side.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
The other side.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Well, we're still perfecting the other side, but we're planning right now to have the Jupiter

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
broadcasting logo on the other side.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
It's cooler than the other side of the pillow.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Wow.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
That's true though.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
I do agree with you.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
So, if you've gone over to teespring.com slash last 300 and ordered a shirt, you'll have

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
one of those there coins very soon.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Each shirt comes with a coin until we get to too many shirts.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
How much time is left on those shirts, Chris?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Like two weeks.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I'll go check right now.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
I was going to say, this is one of those things, you guys.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Like 13 days, I think.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
Remember, there's not going to be another one of these shirts.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Nope.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
This is it right here.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
This is a limited edition.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
One week, five days.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
We've sold 673.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
We have a goal of 754 to unlock them.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Now, here's the thing.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
The goal will be reached.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
You don't want to be left out.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
You think it will?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Oh, yeah.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah, I think so at this point.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
You don't want to be left out because if you're left out...

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
You're not going to get a coin for one thing.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
You won't get a coin.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Or a shirt.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Or a shirt.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
And not only that, you don't want to be that guy at Linux Fest Northwest.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Oh.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
If you're coming out.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Because here's the thing.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Or maybe just in public.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Here's what a challenge...

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Do you guys know what a challenge coin is all about?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I'm going to...

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Tell me right now.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Go ahead.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
All right.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
So let's say, for example, you're at a nice establishment to have some drinks.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Let's say like a swanky beer joint where I walk in.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
There's wood paneling everywhere pictured.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Sicily, 1982.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
You've got dark mood lights, smoke in the atmosphere.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
I sit down with a gruff look on my face.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
You have former baristas that are now working the bar.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Right.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Okay.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
All right.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
I'm picturing it right now.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
All right.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
You got a nice picture in your head?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Yeah, it's great.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Looks comfy.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
All right.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
So some of your Linux buddies, they come in from the show.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Right.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
You know, hey, they had a long day walking the floor.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
But how do they know it's really me?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Well, they know the beard.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Well, I mean, what if I shaved?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Well, you're wearing the shirt.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
And my hair is messed up.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
You're wearing the shirt first off.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Okay.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
That'd be a clue.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
So they walk over to you.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
They say, hey, Chris.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
And you're like, hey, guys.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Hey.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
And you reach into your pocket.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.320
And then you pull it out, the coin, and then you put it down and you slap it on the table.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.240
What if you're that one guy that doesn't have the coin?

04:25.240 --> 04:26.240
You know what happens to you?

04:26.240 --> 04:27.240
Oh, it's embarrassing.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.240
Do you know what happens to you?

04:28.240 --> 04:29.240
No.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.480
You're buying the drinks for the whole group.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.560
That's what the challenge is.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.320
The challenge is you need to have the coin.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.320
I see.

04:35.320 --> 04:39.560
So if I get a Jupiter broadcasting last 300 shirt and a challenge card, I'm actually saving

04:39.560 --> 04:40.560
money.

04:40.560 --> 04:41.560
You're saving money.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.560
Gotcha.

04:42.560 --> 04:43.560
It is a benefit.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.560
It is one of those things.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.560
Forget the healthcare.

04:45.560 --> 04:46.560
We're going to start marketing, Chase.

04:46.560 --> 04:47.560
That'd been great.

04:47.560 --> 04:48.680
You're welcome.

04:48.680 --> 04:53.840
So coming up on the show today, not only are we going to talk about how to Linux, but I

04:53.840 --> 04:59.840
did an interview yesterday with Brendan, who is working on a new distro called Clementine

04:59.840 --> 05:01.240
OS.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.240
It's based on PerOS.

05:02.240 --> 05:06.880
And if you might remember, PerOS was shut down after it was bought by another company,

05:06.880 --> 05:07.880
shut down.

05:07.880 --> 05:12.280
And then Clementine OS was sort of like the phoenix rising out of the ashes of PerOS.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.440
And then it got into some legal trouble.

05:14.440 --> 05:18.200
A lot of speculation, including was Apple behind it, was floating around the web.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.120
We didn't cover it because we didn't know the whole story, but we got a chance to talk

05:21.120 --> 05:24.920
with one of the guys behind that whole thing, so we're going to talk about that.

05:24.920 --> 05:29.460
What I got from the interview, when I walked away from it, was like, oh, this is a warning

05:29.460 --> 05:33.020
now that if you're thinking about getting into making your own distribution, there's

05:33.020 --> 05:37.440
a whole new class of stuff you have to think about because of the size of the overall Linux

05:37.440 --> 05:38.440
ecosystem.

05:38.440 --> 05:42.160
I think, if nothing else, walking away from this interview, that's what I took with me,

05:42.160 --> 05:43.680
so we'll play that in a little bit.

05:43.680 --> 05:48.440
Now, as is perdition, gentlemen, we should start with our feedback.

05:48.440 --> 05:52.680
There is a great clip that was sent into the show by Jacob.

05:52.680 --> 05:58.540
We were recently talking on last and on Unplugged about the high amount of commercial development

05:58.540 --> 06:04.580
that is now behind the Linux kernel, and that only 20% of Linux kernel development is done

06:04.580 --> 06:06.120
by quote-unquote volunteers.

06:06.120 --> 06:10.680
Well, Jacob linked us to a great talk held by Greg Kh.

06:10.680 --> 06:14.160
Now, if you're not familiar with Greg Kh, not only does his last name initial sound

06:14.160 --> 06:18.440
like Colonel Hacker, but he's a long-time Colonel Hacker, so it works out really well.

06:18.440 --> 06:22.480
He was holding a talk recently, and he talked about this phenomenon where a lot of commercial

06:22.480 --> 06:27.000
companies are behind Linux development, and I'll play it because Jacob linked us right

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
to it.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.760
Who's doing the work?

06:29.760 --> 06:34.360
Other people reported 80% of the work done on the Linux kernel is done by companies,

06:34.360 --> 06:35.960
paid contributions.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.120
Some people think it's a bad thing.

06:37.120 --> 06:41.000
I think it's really good that 20% is done by people who aren't paid.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
This is their hobby.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.240
The problem with that 20% is if you start doing patches, you will get hired, and that

06:46.240 --> 06:47.240
will be your job.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.240
Hey-oh.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.200
This used to be my hobby.

06:50.200 --> 06:53.480
Now I have no hobby.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.800
Other kernel developers have known to burn out and start other hobbies, and then they

06:56.800 --> 06:59.400
turn that into a company, and then they go back to kernel development.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.520
It's happened a lot.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.520
I think that's a great point.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.800
That's essentially the point he makes there is if you are a hobbyist and you're doing

07:05.800 --> 07:09.960
this and you're actually good at it and you're working at that level, at the Linux kernel

07:09.960 --> 07:14.560
level with guys like Greg and Linus Torvalds, it's likely not going to be a hobby for very

07:14.560 --> 07:15.560
long.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.560
True.

07:16.560 --> 07:21.760
That's a big part of why there is a small amount of hobby developers on there because,

07:21.760 --> 07:23.560
like he said, it makes sense too.

07:23.560 --> 07:24.560
You see it in a lot of things.

07:24.560 --> 07:28.960
Whenever somebody starts as a hobby, I started podcasting as a hobby, and now I do it as

07:28.960 --> 07:30.560
my day job.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.840
It is true in a sense too that I don't really have much of a hobby anymore.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.080
That happens to you though.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.080
Yeah.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.480
It's just the way of things.

07:38.480 --> 07:42.800
But great point, and a big thank you to Jacob for not only finding that talk but for linking

07:42.800 --> 07:46.040
us right to that time so we could share that with the rest of the audience.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.040
Okay.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.040
So Roy writes in.

07:48.040 --> 07:52.680
He says, I've got some ideas on why Linux is having troubles in the enterprise, which

07:52.680 --> 07:56.240
I didn't really feel like this is a big problem, but he's talking about specifically on the

07:56.240 --> 07:57.240
desktop.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.400
He's not talking about on the server.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.400
He says, hey Chris and Matt assembled a steam mumble room attendees and of course Chase.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.400
Oh yeah.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.400
Yeah.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.400
I see that he said that.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.400
Yeah.

08:06.400 --> 08:10.360
I wanted to comment about a topic you guys discussed in last week's Linux Unplugged about

08:10.360 --> 08:14.040
what could possibly be the reason that the Linux desktop did not get into the enterprise

08:14.040 --> 08:15.260
yet.

08:15.260 --> 08:19.480
So the obvious reason is the business application support, but web-based applications tend to

08:19.480 --> 08:23.200
allow enterprises to provide the business applications via all the browsers.

08:23.200 --> 08:28.320
However, the most critical business applications that business enterprise use, Linux has failed

08:28.320 --> 08:33.920
to deliver is a decent mail client, quote unquote, that works with exchange.

08:33.920 --> 08:36.040
This is the first entry point to the enterprise.

08:36.040 --> 08:39.760
We need a mail client that will be able to sync with exchange.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.120
Let's take mobile mail apps.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.220
The only reason mobile mail is getting into the enterprise is that the mail client is

08:44.220 --> 08:45.680
able to sync up with exchange.

08:45.680 --> 08:48.720
And I would agree that was a critical feature for Android and iOS.

08:48.720 --> 08:53.800
He goes on to say for any other business application, even a native one, there's a decent solution

08:53.800 --> 08:59.000
like Zen desktop, but if I can't get my own mail client to run natively on my Linux desktop,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
what's the point of the Linux desktop at all?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.280
Keep up the good work.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.280
Roy.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.160
Boy, well, you know, there's two things to consider here.

09:06.160 --> 09:10.360
First of all, no one's, you know, the business you're working with using exchange, you can

09:10.360 --> 09:11.360
use the web client.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.360
Actually, if you use it within Firefox, it's actually, even under Linux, it's actually

09:14.360 --> 09:15.360
quite usable.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.360
And the later versions, too.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.360
That's true.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.360
Yeah, that's true.

09:18.360 --> 09:19.360
Yeah, exactly.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.360
The later versions.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.540
Now, older versions of exchange, it's not pretty, but it does work.

09:22.540 --> 09:28.440
And that is to use evolution and the exchange connector, and really emphasizing it's not

09:28.440 --> 09:32.260
pretty and really emphasizing older versions because it's definitely pretty hit and miss.

09:32.260 --> 09:36.160
Not really a great solution, which brings me back to going back to the web client.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.640
Honestly, you know, if you're going to be in an exchange area, I mean, I don't know.

09:39.640 --> 09:42.360
I mean, I guess you could run Outlook in like a VM or something.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.360
It's just, it's messy.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.360
Yeah, or crossover or something.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.360
Yeah.

09:45.360 --> 09:47.960
Because I mean, I work for Microsoft shop and I use exchange all the time in a browser.

09:47.960 --> 09:48.960
It's not really that bad.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.520
Chase, have you, when you worked at Nielsen, did they use exchange there?

09:51.520 --> 09:53.000
Were you an Outlook user?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah, yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.920
It was heavily embedded and we also had to use them.

09:56.920 --> 10:00.560
It was so embedded that we used it on our BlackBerrys and then onto the iPhone.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.560
Yeah.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.240
I mean, it's just like, it's so, so ugly.

10:03.240 --> 10:09.720
And I wonder, is that going to be the case for, you look at like Google apps and Zimbra

10:09.720 --> 10:12.000
Mail and a lot of these things.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.240
To me, exchange seems to be the solution for a lot of people that want a local mail system.

10:17.240 --> 10:21.360
But as a lot of people go with a hosted mail system, exchange just seems like one of the

10:21.360 --> 10:22.360
many options.

10:22.360 --> 10:26.040
But when you abstract away the actual hardware and you're not managing the software and you're

10:26.040 --> 10:29.560
only interfacing it with some sort of remote sync protocol, it doesn't have to be exchange

10:29.560 --> 10:30.560
anymore.

10:30.560 --> 10:31.560
No, it doesn't.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.560
No, there's many different options out there now.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.320
So it might not be something that in the long run matters as much, but it definitely exists

10:35.320 --> 10:36.320
today.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.440
And I could see like, if you have to emulate one of the programs you use the most, it is

10:39.440 --> 10:42.440
kind of silly to then use Linux if you're stuck with that.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.440
So I see what Roy's saying.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.440
I don't know.

10:44.440 --> 10:48.400
I think what we can identify, especially through all the feedback that we've gotten is there's

10:48.400 --> 10:52.200
a lot of little things, or in some cases they're not so little, but it's not one thing.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.320
It's not Outlook.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.600
It's not AutoCAD.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.440
It's not any one particular thing that's holding it back.

10:58.440 --> 11:01.880
Everybody has something that they've built around the Windows platform that they just

11:01.880 --> 11:04.360
now have as an expectation of doing business.

11:04.360 --> 11:08.080
But all of those things eventually in technology sunset.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.640
And so Linux will be there.

11:10.640 --> 11:11.640
That's true.

11:11.640 --> 11:14.640
Although it's really tough to get through to a Microsoft shop, I found that it's very

11:14.640 --> 11:18.480
challenging to try and actually get through that, because it's like, well, we could go

11:18.480 --> 11:24.040
that way, but we know what to expect if we go ahead and suck it up and pay the licensing.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.040
That's the problem.

11:25.040 --> 11:28.240
Well, and we've got these guys here, and they know how to do it already.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.920
If we ever want to fire them because we don't want to pay them enough, we can just hire

11:30.920 --> 11:33.640
some other Microsoft guy to come in here and run this for us.

11:33.640 --> 11:37.360
And it's cheaper to pay the licensing and the retraining, our existing folks.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.000
I think that's a lot of it too.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Yeah.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
I think that's part of the momentum equation that Windows has on the desktop and server

11:46.000 --> 11:48.160
and enterprise is that staff momentum.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.160
You have staff training.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.160
Yeah.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.160
But you know what?

11:51.160 --> 11:54.160
But to be fair here, here I am going to be doing a how-to Linux show.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.160
I don't know.

11:55.160 --> 11:59.760
Maybe I'm the one of the minority who has a freaking open mind about becoming retrained

11:59.760 --> 12:03.800
and becoming cross-trained and learning more about more operating systems.

12:03.800 --> 12:08.240
There are a lot of Windows guys out there who are just so focused in on Windows, it's

12:08.240 --> 12:10.320
like, you know, F everything else on the Windows guy.

12:10.320 --> 12:14.200
I'm like, whatever happened to being educated and learning about everything else?

12:14.200 --> 12:18.040
And not to offend everybody in the audience, but I also see the same thing happen with

12:18.040 --> 12:22.760
Cisco guys where they get Cisco trained and then they're so focused on Cisco they can't

12:22.760 --> 12:25.480
see outside of the Cisco product space.

12:25.480 --> 12:29.800
And so everything's a Cisco brand, everything's a Cisco solution, a Cisco implementation.

12:29.800 --> 12:36.600
And there is something to becoming an expert at one thing and really deeply understanding

12:36.600 --> 12:38.800
it.

12:38.800 --> 12:42.520
But at the same time, I feel like it's a little better if you can zoom out a little bit and

12:42.520 --> 12:47.000
generalize a little more and sort of see new trends and sort of take advantage of new technologies.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.440
It should be, honestly, about using the best tool for the job.

12:50.440 --> 12:51.440
Right.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.440
There you go.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.360
Regardless of operating system and software package.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.640
I completely agree.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.960
Speaking of the best tool for the job, this would be a great spot to mention our sponsor

12:58.960 --> 13:01.000
this week, DigitalOcean.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.200
Go over to DigitalOcean.com and take advantage of our promo code LINUXUNPLUGEDFEBRUARY.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.720
It's only going to be working for a little bit longer.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.720
February is almost over.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.720
Actually, it's over Friday.

13:08.720 --> 13:09.720
Yeah.

13:09.720 --> 13:10.720
That's not true.

13:10.720 --> 13:11.720
They'll keep it working for you.

13:11.720 --> 13:12.720
DigitalOcean loves you guys.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.560
But seriously, if you don't know about DigitalOcean, they're a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated

13:15.560 --> 13:19.200
to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

13:19.200 --> 13:23.040
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds, although our community has gotten that down

13:23.040 --> 13:24.120
to 44 seconds.

13:24.120 --> 13:28.600
And pricing plans start at only $5 a month for, get ready for this Chase, 512 megabytes

13:28.600 --> 13:29.600
of RAM.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.600
What?

13:30.600 --> 13:31.600
A 20 gigabyte SSD.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.600
No.

13:32.600 --> 13:33.600
A CPU.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
And this is the part I love.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.600
This is the transfer.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.600
Jeez, man.

13:36.600 --> 13:37.600
I know.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.600
It's just a fixed cost.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.600
You know exactly what you're going to get.

13:39.600 --> 13:40.600
You know exactly what your bill's going to be.

13:40.600 --> 13:41.600
The value is right there.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.600
It's super simple.

13:42.600 --> 13:46.280
And by the way, DigitalOcean also has hourly rates if you want to test an application.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.240
I recently put up a Pastebin competitor on there.

13:48.240 --> 13:51.080
I've got a BitTorrent sync for all our unfiltered supporter shows.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.200
I got a calendar I'm throwing up on there.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.600
And I've been getting emails from folks in the audience telling me what they're using

13:56.600 --> 13:57.600
it for.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.080
I'm getting all kinds of great ideas.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.960
People are throwing up their XMPP server on there.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.640
Another guy's got his personal resume up there.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.560
It's kind of like an interactive website.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.080
There's tons of great things you can do at DigitalOcean because they have this droplet

14:07.080 --> 14:11.120
system where you can deploy a droplet of, like, you can take an Ubuntu 1204 machine

14:11.120 --> 14:17.040
with Apache and MySQL ready to go or an Archbox or a Centbox or a Fedora box with Docker pre-installed

14:17.040 --> 14:20.440
and you can load up your own Docker images that you've built locally on your own machine.

14:20.440 --> 14:21.440
It's really great.

14:21.440 --> 14:24.880
And if you use that promo code Linux Unplugged February, they'll give you a $10 credit so

14:24.880 --> 14:27.400
you can try out that $5 rig for two months.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.520
DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and Singapore.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.080
Their interface is simple.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.820
Their control panel is intuitive.

14:34.820 --> 14:39.440
And power users can replicate that control panel with their straightforward API.

14:39.440 --> 14:42.960
So go use the promo code Linux Unplugged February over at DigitalOcean.com.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.400
See what I've been talking about.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.720
It's so cool to see Linux technologies be utilized by a company like this.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.440
They pair it with tier one bandwidth.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.640
They put it on top of some SSDs and they really let KVM rip.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.040
They got them super tuned in.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.040
It's really great.

14:55.040 --> 14:58.520
It's an awesome experience and a super great forward, super easy to manage.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.920
DigitalOcean.com, Linux Unplugged February.

15:00.920 --> 15:01.920
Go try them out.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.040
Get a $5 rig for two months.

15:04.040 --> 15:08.720
It's a great training experience too because this imaging system lets you back it up and

15:08.720 --> 15:11.080
if you screw something up, you can restore right back to it just like you could with

15:11.080 --> 15:12.680
like VirtualBox or something.

15:12.680 --> 15:17.120
Only this is a real machine up in the cloud that you can throw things at, test in production.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.120
It's awesome.

15:18.120 --> 15:22.880
DigitalOcean.com, Linux Unplugged February and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

15:22.880 --> 15:25.320
Linux Unplugged.

15:25.320 --> 15:30.400
So speaking of transitionary technologies, Dwayne wrote in with a response to something

15:30.400 --> 15:36.400
our guest last week, Michael Hall said, where he wrote and he says, hi Chris, Matt and Chase.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.400
I really enjoyed episode 20.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.400
What's that say right there?

15:38.400 --> 15:39.400
Wait, it does say Chase.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
It does say Chase.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.400
It does say Chase.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.400
Yes.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.400
It's there.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.280
He says, he said he really enjoyed episode 28.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.840
It was eye-opening.

15:47.840 --> 15:53.200
Michael made a point about the major players not having identical versions of their operating

15:53.200 --> 15:59.080
systems on both tablet, mobile or the desktop except for what Ubuntu is trying to do.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.720
This is about to change quickly for Android.

16:01.720 --> 16:06.360
I recently downloaded Android x86 and it runs well on my laptop, which is a Dell Inspiron

16:06.360 --> 16:13.160
M5010 with an AMD 2 gigahertz triple core processor, 4 gigabytes of RAM and a 500 gigabyte

16:13.160 --> 16:15.440
hard drive and an AMD 4200 graphics.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.800
He says, with more work, I can see it as a real quick OS to go to for anybody with an

16:18.800 --> 16:23.660
Intel or AMD class processor with an NVIDIA ATI or Intel graphics.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.760
As long as you have a Gmail account, you're good to go.

16:25.760 --> 16:29.320
And it's at, we've talked about it before on last, but you can find it at android-x86.org.

16:29.320 --> 16:36.120
Matt or Chase, have either one of you played with the Android x86 project where you can

16:36.120 --> 16:37.120
actually download like an ISO?

16:37.120 --> 16:38.120
No, I have not.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.120
No.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.120
Very interesting.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.000
I've downloaded it, but I never actually installed it because I was toying with the idea, but

16:42.000 --> 16:45.840
I found that there's certain limitations to it as far as what you can do with it.

16:45.840 --> 16:46.840
Yeah.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.840
It's something I want to dive into.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.840
Yeah.

16:48.840 --> 16:54.040
I've played with it a little bit and you know, Android is just really not meant for a desktop.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.040
I could see it maybe with like a skin.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.040
Well, it was tried before.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.040
It wasn't, didn't like Motorola have their, what was it, Atrix, right?

17:00.040 --> 17:01.040
Yep, yep.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.760
Where you could dock it and it becomes a computer and a phone all in one.

17:04.760 --> 17:07.040
They heavily modified the UI in that use case.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.160
Yes, they did.

17:08.160 --> 17:12.620
And so, you know, and this is the sort of the secret sauce to the Ubuntu Touch approach

17:12.620 --> 17:17.600
is this UI transmogrification when you switch into the different use cases.

17:17.600 --> 17:18.600
Look it up, kids.

17:18.600 --> 17:22.680
You got the transmogrifier that sits in there, it's a kernel extension.

17:22.680 --> 17:27.640
You got to compile it or use DKMS if you just want to, you know, just be able to update

17:27.640 --> 17:28.640
your kernel on the go.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.180
It'll just rebuild your module for you automatically.

17:31.180 --> 17:34.880
And then when you plug it into your TV or your laptop or your whatever it is, it just

17:34.880 --> 17:35.880
transmogrifies.

17:35.880 --> 17:36.880
Right?

17:36.880 --> 17:37.880
Do I have that right?

17:37.880 --> 17:38.880
Transmogrify.

17:38.880 --> 17:39.880
Yeah.

17:39.880 --> 17:40.880
I got that right.

17:40.880 --> 17:41.880
Yeah.

17:41.880 --> 17:42.880
And I think that's a little bit better of a solution, but we'll see how far they can

17:42.880 --> 17:43.880
close that gap.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.960
If they could, what the question will be is our desktop, this is my main concern and we'll

17:46.960 --> 17:52.560
see, our desktop applications in that perfect world going to live in this uncanny valley.

17:52.560 --> 17:56.640
Where they're not quite a desktop app, but they're not quite a mobile app and they're

17:56.640 --> 17:59.280
just not quite there yet and it's kind of hard to really put your finger on what's not

17:59.280 --> 18:02.080
quite there about it yet, but you can just kind of feel it.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.200
We'll see if that ends up happening.

18:03.200 --> 18:06.600
If they can avoid that scenario, I'm looking forward to it.

18:06.600 --> 18:11.440
But Android X86, I think for that to take off, Google's not going to make it happen.

18:11.440 --> 18:16.280
It's going to take a company that could really own that and unfortunately have to put some

18:16.280 --> 18:17.920
kind of UI on top of it.

18:17.920 --> 18:22.760
And then would you even get Google to stamp it with their Google mobile services?

18:22.760 --> 18:23.760
Never going to happen.

18:23.760 --> 18:24.760
Yeah.

18:24.760 --> 18:25.760
I wouldn't think so.

18:25.760 --> 18:26.760
No.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.600
Not unless they got some really big player who is really like buddy-buddy with Google.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.600
Yeah.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.600
All right.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.920
Well, why don't we do a little valve update?

18:32.920 --> 18:34.540
Oh, yes.

18:34.540 --> 18:36.760
First thing is not that the Unfilter Show.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.560
Chase, look what you're making me say now.

18:38.560 --> 18:41.160
See, this is what happens when you only have me here for Unfilter.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.160
Oh, now look, I'm getting crap.

18:43.160 --> 18:44.160
I'm getting crap.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.160
No.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.800
I was going to say we don't try to break news on Unplugged, but we are going to break a

18:47.800 --> 18:50.960
little news today because Portal 2 has just come out.

18:50.960 --> 18:54.040
Portal 2 beta for Linux was released today.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.300
You can go check it out.

18:55.300 --> 19:01.800
And on that whole valve vein, Anno wrote in, he said, I'd like to comment on the VAC topic

19:01.800 --> 19:02.800
from last week's show.

19:02.800 --> 19:06.600
Now, we covered this last week, this little DNS hashing, scanning that Valve was doing,

19:06.600 --> 19:08.880
trying to catch people cheating Valve games.

19:08.880 --> 19:13.480
He says, I manage a medium-sized game server and we have been fighting hackers and cheaters

19:13.480 --> 19:15.760
for years with a VAC-like system.

19:15.760 --> 19:19.520
These cheats usually work at a low level by injecting their code into the game memory

19:19.520 --> 19:24.200
so you either have to combat them at this level or detect them higher up and target

19:24.200 --> 19:25.840
their specific behavior.

19:25.840 --> 19:28.360
In this case, it was DNS entries.

19:28.360 --> 19:34.480
The inherent problem of all the anti-cheat systems is you can't open source them or disclose

19:34.480 --> 19:38.760
too much information about them and what they actually do because hackers would use this

19:38.760 --> 19:41.360
information to implement a workaround.

19:41.360 --> 19:45.440
If Valve said they'd check your DNS cache loud and clear, hackers would only need a

19:45.440 --> 19:48.040
few days to change their cheats and not two weeks.

19:48.040 --> 19:51.960
Instead, you'd probably agreed to this in the fine print you signed up when you agreed

19:51.960 --> 19:55.160
to the Steam Terms of Service.

19:55.160 --> 19:59.960
At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself whether you'd rather play games with cheaters

19:59.960 --> 20:03.400
or allow Valve to scan your computer in questionable ways.

20:03.400 --> 20:07.080
Personally, I'm completely fine with this because playing against cheaters frustrates

20:07.080 --> 20:08.080
me to no end.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.080
Best regards, Anno.

20:09.080 --> 20:12.960
Yeah, I don't quite know where to fall down.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.720
I'm not comfortable with Valve scanning my DNS cache.

20:15.720 --> 20:16.720
I'm not either.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.680
I mean, but at the same time, if you're doing anything kind of weird, you should probably

20:19.680 --> 20:20.680
use a different computer.

20:20.680 --> 20:21.680
Just put that out there.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.440
Yeah, I mean, I'm not worried about so much that.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.920
I just don't like the principle of it.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.520
It feels like an invasion of privacy.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.400
But what is the solution here, though?

20:28.400 --> 20:29.400
I mean, what is it?

20:29.400 --> 20:30.400
A dedicated computer for Valve.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.400
I mean, really.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.400
I mean, I think that's...

20:32.400 --> 20:33.400
Sandboxing?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.080
Yeah, sandboxing would be okay.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.080
I don't know.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.080
Maybe.

20:38.080 --> 20:43.280
I mean, it feels like this is actually a limitation in the underlying operating systems privilege

20:43.280 --> 20:46.400
model and not maybe necessarily...

20:46.400 --> 20:52.880
And the only solution for companies like Valve is to come up with their own ways to sort

20:52.880 --> 20:54.480
of circumvent those limitations.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.080
I don't know.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.920
I understand this is what they have to do.

20:57.920 --> 21:03.400
And maybe this is just the trade-off gamers have to make is, okay, my games are going

21:03.400 --> 21:04.680
to be wrapped up in DRM.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.680
Okay, I can't.

21:05.680 --> 21:06.760
I don't quite own them.

21:06.760 --> 21:10.160
They're actually stored in some sort of cloud storage that lets me install them when I want

21:10.160 --> 21:12.240
to, assuming my account hasn't been closed.

21:12.240 --> 21:15.920
Okay, I'll buy off on those things.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.600
I can accept those limitations.

21:17.600 --> 21:23.200
And now you're asking me to also accept the idea that, well, this last week it was DNS

21:23.200 --> 21:26.880
cache scanning, but how long until it's all the processes running on my box?

21:26.880 --> 21:31.480
Or, well, now we need to watch your network packets because now they're being really tricky.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.400
And yeah, where did we draw the line?

21:33.400 --> 21:37.260
Because it seems like reading DNS cache, I realized they were just hashing it and then

21:37.260 --> 21:38.800
sending a hash to Valve.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.040
I get that.

21:40.040 --> 21:43.600
But where do we start saying, okay, that's too far?

21:43.600 --> 21:47.800
If we're okay with the DNS hashing, what are we not okay with?

21:47.800 --> 21:48.800
Screen grabs?

21:48.800 --> 21:50.120
Just straight up screen grabs on my machine?

21:50.120 --> 21:53.160
Do you need to monitor my machine when I'm not playing games so that way you can catch

21:53.160 --> 21:55.240
me installing the cheat before I ever run the game?

21:55.240 --> 21:56.240
Is that what we're going to come to?

21:56.240 --> 22:00.360
Well, you know, like Punk Buster, a great example is that actually takes screenshots

22:00.360 --> 22:01.360
of gameplay.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.360
Yeah.

22:02.360 --> 22:06.040
Yeah, so that kind of situation has already been happening to gamers for a long period

22:06.040 --> 22:07.040
of time.

22:07.040 --> 22:10.000
Well, okay, so at what point do they need to analyze every setup.exe that runs on a

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Windows box?

22:11.000 --> 22:12.280
Well, they do that.

22:12.280 --> 22:15.800
They actually, Punk Buster actually does monitor what you're running in the background.

22:15.800 --> 22:16.800
How?

22:16.800 --> 22:17.800
Ah, it's so creepy.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.840
Yeah, I think it's been doing that for a long time, hasn't it?

22:19.840 --> 22:20.840
It's been doing it a long time.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.840
You know what I say to that?

22:21.840 --> 22:22.840
It's a comeback.

22:22.840 --> 22:23.840
Go ahead.

22:23.840 --> 22:24.840
Get it out of here.

22:24.840 --> 22:25.840
That's what I say to that.

22:25.840 --> 22:26.840
Yeah.

22:26.840 --> 22:27.840
That is, that is no good.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.140
You know, and see, it's for myself, it's the same way.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.040
It's like, okay, TSA kind of thing.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.040
I don't like TSA.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.040
I don't fly.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.040
I mean, there's nothing I can do about it at this point.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.040
I think it's the same thing here.

22:36.040 --> 22:40.040
I can either not use the game or, you know, or I can set up a dedicated box.

22:40.040 --> 22:41.040
Do what I do, Matt.

22:41.040 --> 22:45.360
I just get the $50 fast pass and TSA does not refuse.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.040
Does Valve offer a $50 fast pass?

22:47.040 --> 22:48.040
No, unfortunately, they don't.

22:48.040 --> 22:49.040
Right.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.040
Yeah, there you go.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.040
Enhanced driver's license.

22:51.040 --> 22:54.120
I just wish they could be, I realize they can't because of the nature of what they're

22:54.120 --> 22:55.120
trying to combat.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.360
I just wish they could be more transparent about what they're doing.

22:57.360 --> 23:01.560
But yeah, the transparency is the key that, you know, people need to know exactly what

23:01.560 --> 23:02.560
they're doing.

23:02.560 --> 23:03.960
But then again, it goes back to the whole thing.

23:03.960 --> 23:07.040
If you give out too much information, then the hackers know what to do.

23:07.040 --> 23:08.040
Right.

23:08.040 --> 23:09.280
And it is kind of a marketing buzzkill.

23:09.280 --> 23:13.040
Say, hey, this is great, by the way, we're totally scanning your stuff.

23:13.040 --> 23:15.160
Yeah, that's not a great bullet point, is it?

23:15.160 --> 23:16.160
No.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.160
No, it really isn't.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.560
I mean, from a marketer's point of view, that would just suck.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.480
You know, the other thing, like Danny Tech is saying, is this is why things like the

23:21.480 --> 23:25.480
Humble Bundle and this is why it's really important that Valve doesn't own this entire

23:25.480 --> 23:30.720
thing because even though we like them today, when they have SteamOS, they can go even further

23:30.720 --> 23:32.200
than they have in the past.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.200
And you know, it's good to have alternative options.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.200
Yeah.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.200
Yeah, this is true.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.200
This is true.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.200
All right.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.200
Well, that concludes our Valve update.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.200
Yes.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.200
I just wanted to know.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.200
I got to go.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.200
I got to go play some Half-Life real quick.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.200
Yeah.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.200
I'll be back later.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.200
Yeah, it does kind of make me want to play a game when I hear it.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.200
All right.

23:48.200 --> 23:52.520
Well, before we get to the how-to Linux discussion, why don't we play my interview with Brendan,

23:52.520 --> 23:56.720
who is working on ClementineOS, which is kind of on pause right now.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.800
So we'll play that and then we'll come back.

23:58.800 --> 24:02.120
So I'll have links to this too in the show notes if you guys didn't catch all of the

24:02.120 --> 24:03.120
drama that went on.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.000
But if you guys remember, this happened about 30 days ago.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.440
The developer of PairOS posted on Google Plus that the Mac-like distribution had been sold

24:09.440 --> 24:14.340
to another company and as part of that sale could no longer be downloaded.

24:14.340 --> 24:17.160
So then from that, the ClementineOS project was started.

24:17.160 --> 24:20.080
Brendan was an enthusiast and an advocate for the distribution.

24:20.080 --> 24:25.220
He wanted to sort of continue it in his own way with some modifications to make it better.

24:25.220 --> 24:30.840
And he received a letter from an American company that forced him to abandon the project.

24:30.840 --> 24:34.560
He did later say it wasn't Apple, but there were still some people that thought it might

24:34.560 --> 24:35.560
have been.

24:35.560 --> 24:38.680
So he joined me yesterday to get the details on that.

24:38.680 --> 24:42.520
I wanted to get you on because, you know, a little while back there was a few stories

24:42.520 --> 24:45.760
going around on the net that I didn't really feel like we got a good picture on what was

24:45.760 --> 24:47.700
actually going on.

24:47.700 --> 24:50.240
And I thought maybe we could start there and then kind of work our way out.

24:50.240 --> 24:54.560
So were you one of the guys that worked on PairOS or worked with the PairOS project?

24:54.560 --> 25:00.400
No, I just was using it like the OS and got discontinued.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.200
So I wanted to continue the project.

25:02.200 --> 25:07.400
So what you were creating was sort of, you took the, you essentially cloned a lot of

25:07.400 --> 25:10.200
that project and started your own OS based on that?

25:10.200 --> 25:11.200
Yes.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.200
Okay.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.040
And that was called or is called ClementineOS, right?

25:14.040 --> 25:15.040
Yeah.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.300
I mean, it was Clementine and then we had trouble.

25:17.300 --> 25:24.520
So then, well, now when I say Clementine, I replaced the C with the K now for ClementineOS.

25:24.520 --> 25:25.520
ClementineMusicPlayer.

25:25.520 --> 25:29.000
So this is still around and it's still alive?

25:29.000 --> 25:37.480
It's right now, it's just a private thing for just me because the site, I had some apparently

25:37.480 --> 25:43.040
copyrighted files and stuff of PairOS and got into some legal issues.

25:43.040 --> 25:45.960
So can you tell me a little, what happened with those legal issues?

25:45.960 --> 25:46.960
Was it?

25:46.960 --> 25:47.960
Okay.

25:47.960 --> 25:53.120
Well, we had, if you went to our download page in PairOS, we had the same exact download

25:53.120 --> 25:58.240
CD cover and everything, we just replaced it with our images and everything.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.240
That was fine.

25:59.240 --> 26:03.360
But then when we went and we're trying to replace the other images, when we saw pictures

26:03.360 --> 26:07.880
of like the laptops running the OS, we tried cropping out the screenshot built in and cropping

26:07.880 --> 26:09.680
one of ours over it and it didn't really work.

26:09.680 --> 26:14.160
So we just posted it with their screenshot and it had the Pair logo and kind of gotten

26:14.160 --> 26:16.760
the legal issues there.

26:16.760 --> 26:21.880
To clarify though, were legal issues brought to you from the PairOS project or by the company

26:21.880 --> 26:23.200
that bought PairOS?

26:23.200 --> 26:24.200
The company that bought it.

26:24.200 --> 26:25.200
But you can't say who they are, right?

26:25.200 --> 26:26.200
No, I can't.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.680
Is it a company I'm familiar with?

26:28.680 --> 26:30.240
Yeah.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.880
If you're in the Linux world, yes.

26:31.880 --> 26:32.880
Yeah.

26:32.880 --> 26:33.880
Okay.

26:33.880 --> 26:34.880
Interesting.

26:34.880 --> 26:38.280
And I don't think it's been made public who bought PairOS, but so that company contacted

26:38.280 --> 26:40.920
you and said, you need to stop using our branding.

26:40.920 --> 26:41.920
Yeah.

26:41.920 --> 26:49.320
They got an email and it was from a lawyer, all legal issues and terms.

26:49.320 --> 26:51.000
So I just immediately took it down.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.240
I didn't want to get in any trouble.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.240
I see.

26:53.240 --> 26:56.280
So they're not necessarily taking up issue with Clementine OS, they're more taking up

26:56.280 --> 26:57.680
issue with uses of their assets.

26:57.680 --> 27:01.200
So does that mean the project might not be dead?

27:01.200 --> 27:07.200
It's actually trying, working on trying to get more, some coders into it.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.000
So yeah, I'm trying to bring it back.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Okay.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
All right.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
It's about 100% dead.

27:12.000 --> 27:19.440
So I think a lot of people might remember PairOS, it looks a lot like, I guess, OS X.

27:19.440 --> 27:20.440
Yeah.

27:20.440 --> 27:24.840
Is Clementine OS or Clementine going to, with a K, going to be essentially continuing that

27:24.840 --> 27:25.840
transit, tradition?

27:25.840 --> 27:32.040
Yes, but we're probably going to go with a different look than what Pair did.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.040
Yeah.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.040
Give me a hint.

27:34.040 --> 27:42.800
Well, it's going to use the latest GNOME and 14.04 based, but it's going to have the same

27:42.800 --> 27:48.040
window style and everything, but it's going to have kind of like an elementary OS bar

27:48.040 --> 27:54.760
clear, but it's going to have the, our Clementine logo and stuff where the pair used to be.

27:54.760 --> 27:59.440
So what is it that like current distros on the market today lack that you feel like,

27:59.440 --> 28:01.760
you know, so when I think of something like this, I think of, for example, elementary

28:01.760 --> 28:06.560
OS, what would you say those types of distributions lack that inspire you to go out and create

28:06.560 --> 28:08.120
your own distribution?

28:08.120 --> 28:13.880
Well, what I think it lacks is, when I try installing elementary OS, everyone said it's

28:13.880 --> 28:14.880
stable.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.840
When I try installing on any of my systems, I always have issues.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.200
It just, it does not work.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.760
I have tons of issues with it.

28:20.760 --> 28:21.760
So is that all?

28:21.760 --> 28:23.720
I got an itch and I need to scratch a problem.

28:23.720 --> 28:24.720
Yeah.

28:24.720 --> 28:27.340
So it takes a bunch of configuration to get it working.

28:27.340 --> 28:34.720
And a lot of people I think it's from, and my grandpa on my dad's side, he's into Linux

28:34.720 --> 28:37.280
and he thinks it's because it uses an older kernel.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.280
Yeah.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.360
So that's where a lot of people thinks it's at.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.360
Yeah.

28:42.360 --> 28:46.480
So I want to try to have the latest kernel on this.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.480
Always have the latest.

28:47.480 --> 28:49.920
Do you still have, would it be built on top of Ubuntu?

28:49.920 --> 28:53.480
Yes, but I will update the kernels myself.

28:53.480 --> 28:54.480
Yeah.

28:54.480 --> 28:55.480
Yeah.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.480
Well, that sounds pretty interesting.

28:56.480 --> 28:59.480
And it's been a story that hasn't quite exactly faded away.

28:59.480 --> 29:03.160
So it's good to get a little idea of what happened around the whole pair OS situation.

29:03.160 --> 29:08.120
And the one thing I think all those distrusts lack is where pair OS filled it in was like,

29:08.120 --> 29:09.640
all of it's easy to use programs.

29:09.640 --> 29:13.120
Like a lot of people have issues with PPAs, adding those in terminal.

29:13.120 --> 29:18.320
The interest of the program called PPA manager and added or removed and installed programs

29:18.320 --> 29:19.320
with ease and-

29:19.320 --> 29:20.880
And all that's GPL code, right?

29:20.880 --> 29:21.880
Yeah.

29:21.880 --> 29:22.880
That's all GPL.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.760
So yeah, we are going to recreate those programs.

29:24.760 --> 29:25.760
Yeah.

29:25.760 --> 29:26.760
Good.

29:26.760 --> 29:27.760
Our own image.

29:27.760 --> 29:28.760
That was an interesting idea.

29:28.760 --> 29:31.360
That's a great example of something that the pair OS brought to the table, aside from the

29:31.360 --> 29:35.880
aesthetics that look a lot like the Mac is that it was solving some of these gaps and

29:35.880 --> 29:39.400
other distributions have attempted, like Mint has attempted to solve these problems too.

29:39.400 --> 29:42.880
But so it sounds like, one of the things I really wanted to get the bottom of in this

29:42.880 --> 29:47.480
conversation, it doesn't sound like they were necessarily going after you for having a clone

29:47.480 --> 29:49.720
of the distribution, but just for art assets that are being used.

29:49.720 --> 29:52.560
So it sounds like if you guys get everything in place, you're in the clear to continue

29:52.560 --> 29:53.560
development.

29:53.560 --> 29:54.560
Yes.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.560
And that's why we changed the name.

29:55.560 --> 29:59.520
We just put a K in front of it because we also got legal notice from the Clementine

29:59.520 --> 30:01.280
project for the music players.

30:01.280 --> 30:04.720
So we kind of changed the name real quick and they're okay with it.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.880
We emailed them with the name change and they said, you can keep the Clementine name.

30:07.880 --> 30:09.880
Yeah, just replace it with a K. We're okay with that.

30:09.880 --> 30:10.880
So that worked out.

30:10.880 --> 30:11.880
Oh, good.

30:11.880 --> 30:15.360
Is there a fair warning to anybody thinking about launching into this kind of stuff?

30:15.360 --> 30:20.200
You got to go, you have to think about everything before you name it and all this.

30:20.200 --> 30:24.200
You have to Google if there's any names out there that you're eating.

30:24.200 --> 30:25.200
Exactly.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.200
Yeah, you really do.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.200
You got to be careful.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.200
Well, good.

30:28.200 --> 30:29.720
I just wanted to kind of get the story straight.

30:29.720 --> 30:32.320
Is there anything else you want to touch on before I run?

30:32.320 --> 30:38.440
No, I don't think that's the one thing is I want to say is everyone keeps saying Apple

30:38.440 --> 30:40.360
bought it and they did not buy it.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.560
Just to say that, not Apple bought it.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.320
Now did you feed that a little bit by making a joke online?

30:45.320 --> 30:47.960
Did you crack some jokes that people kind of took too seriously?

30:47.960 --> 30:53.280
People on the Paralyze community were, oh, Apple bought it and then posting things to

30:53.280 --> 30:58.240
articles like Apple bought Paralyze and I'm sitting there like, it has nothing to do with

30:58.240 --> 30:59.240
Apple.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.240
They're not big enough.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.720
They would have to be bigger than Ubuntu.

31:01.720 --> 31:02.720
They're not.

31:02.720 --> 31:03.720
Yeah.

31:03.720 --> 31:07.440
Well, I thought that might be the case, but that was pretty funny the way that kind of

31:07.440 --> 31:08.520
lit up online.

31:08.520 --> 31:10.440
So it's good to get that clarification too.

31:10.440 --> 31:11.440
Just rumors.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.440
Yeah.

31:12.440 --> 31:13.440
Very good, sir.

31:13.440 --> 31:14.840
Well, thanks for coming on and clearing things up for us.

31:14.840 --> 31:15.840
All right.

31:15.840 --> 31:20.540
So I wanted to, I thought the sort of the takeaway I had from that chat was, holy crap,

31:20.540 --> 31:25.000
it's harder to make a distro these days than, you know, than it used to be.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.760
And you see, he stepped into an art landmine and then he got contacted by another project

31:29.760 --> 31:33.400
in their name and none of it's all that surprising in retrospect, but it's something you definitely

31:33.400 --> 31:34.600
got to think about.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.800
And I think a lot of people, they sit down to make a Linux distro, they don't really,

31:37.800 --> 31:39.800
they don't consider this kind of stuff.

31:39.800 --> 31:40.800
I don't know.

31:40.800 --> 31:44.600
I think the main thing to really consider here too is that it's a little bit like ripping

31:44.600 --> 31:45.600
DVDs.

31:45.600 --> 31:50.040
If you're doing it in the quiet, quiet realm of your own home or your own home office or

31:50.040 --> 31:52.480
even your own office, you probably are fine.

31:52.480 --> 31:57.120
But as soon as you put that out on the internet for the masses, trademarks, copyrights, various

31:57.120 --> 32:01.200
registered stuff, you really do have to do your homework and Google is not going to cut

32:01.200 --> 32:02.200
it.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.800
You actually need to really do a proper search.

32:03.800 --> 32:04.800
So yeah.

32:04.800 --> 32:05.800
Yeah.

32:05.800 --> 32:06.800
Yeah.

32:06.800 --> 32:07.800
Good point.

32:07.800 --> 32:08.800
All right.

32:08.800 --> 32:13.560
Well, before we get to the discussion about how to Linux, I want to thank Ting.com for

32:13.560 --> 32:16.140
sponsoring this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

32:16.140 --> 32:17.440
What is Ting.com?

32:17.440 --> 32:19.080
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

32:19.080 --> 32:22.280
My mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider.

32:22.280 --> 32:23.280
Oh yes.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.280
Rockin' Ting for a while now.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.280
Here's how you get started.

32:25.280 --> 32:26.280
Go to Linux.ting.com.

32:26.280 --> 32:30.360
It could be like Mr. Chase who was just over here experimenting with the Ting Sim just

32:30.360 --> 32:31.360
a few minutes ago.

32:31.360 --> 32:32.360
Yes.

32:32.360 --> 32:35.120
Pulling the Ting Sim out of my Nexus 5 and putting it into his HTC One.

32:35.120 --> 32:40.700
So Linux.ting.com will take $25 off your first device or $25 off your first month if you

32:40.700 --> 32:42.240
bring your own device.

32:42.240 --> 32:45.460
But let me tell you a little bit about what makes Ting so awesome.

32:45.460 --> 32:46.660
You know they have no contract.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.320
You know they have no early termination fee.

32:48.320 --> 32:49.320
What?

32:49.320 --> 32:50.320
It's true, Chase.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.320
It's true.

32:51.320 --> 32:52.320
And you only pay for what you use.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.440
Six dollars, a flat rate, plus taxes.

32:53.440 --> 32:58.400
But what's so awesome is that Ting dashboard gives you your usage, you can manage multiple

32:58.400 --> 33:02.120
devices under a single account, you can get a snapshot of where each device is at.

33:02.120 --> 33:05.600
Even if you have a whole bunch of devices for like a company, they really make the billing

33:05.600 --> 33:08.800
super straightforward and easy to understand for one phone or for multiple phones.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.560
I have two phones on my Ting line.

33:10.560 --> 33:11.560
It's so easy.

33:11.560 --> 33:12.560
So straightforward.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.160
So you only pay for what you use.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.800
Only pay six dollars flat rate and it's just my usage on top of that.

33:16.800 --> 33:19.080
Every plan includes tethering and hotspot.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.200
I can set up device nicknames in the dashboard.

33:21.200 --> 33:25.800
I can set up voicemail, caller ID, hiding the caller ID when I call somebody, where

33:25.800 --> 33:27.680
it forwards to when a phone number is busy.

33:27.680 --> 33:31.320
All through their very simple dashboard including setting up like alerts.

33:31.320 --> 33:35.080
Like you know when I give my son Dylan a phone, I want to know, hey if Dylan uses more than

33:35.080 --> 33:39.520
a gigabyte in a billing period, send a push notification to my Ting app.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.520
Yeah, what's he doing on that phone?

33:40.520 --> 33:41.520
What's he doing exactly?

33:41.520 --> 33:42.520
Yeah.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.520
What's he doing?

33:43.520 --> 33:47.480
And this is a great example of why it's so nice to have the Ting dashboard paired with

33:47.480 --> 33:49.280
the awesome Ting customer service.

33:49.280 --> 33:58.720
You can call Ting at 1-855-846-4389 between 8am and 8pm eastern time and a real human.

33:58.720 --> 34:02.600
Not a robot, not a called tree, answers the phone.

34:02.600 --> 34:07.800
And here's a novel idea, that human that answers the phone, he's actually empowered to solve

34:07.800 --> 34:08.800
your problem.

34:08.800 --> 34:09.800
I know, it's crazy.

34:09.800 --> 34:10.800
Nice.

34:10.800 --> 34:14.040
And as a long time Ting customer now for over a year, what I really appreciate is the Ting

34:14.040 --> 34:19.240
blog over at Ting.com slash blog where they have videos posted frequently with Ting staff

34:19.240 --> 34:20.920
members today.

34:20.920 --> 34:25.240
They put up an interview with one of their executives, Brad, what he thinks about making

34:25.240 --> 34:28.760
prepaid Ting accounts where you pre-fill a Ting account and then you just kind of run

34:28.760 --> 34:29.760
through that.

34:29.760 --> 34:32.600
And he talks, he ends a little bit about some cool stuff Ting has coming up too.

34:32.600 --> 34:37.480
And I love staying informed in the loop about the companies that I'm voting with with my

34:37.480 --> 34:38.480
dollar.

34:38.480 --> 34:42.360
I like to know what they're actually up to and this is a great example of how Ting keeps

34:42.360 --> 34:46.920
really keeps you informed on what they have coming up.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.720
You're not sort of left up to a mystery.

34:48.720 --> 34:52.540
I actually feel like I kind of understand like their rationale, what their focus is,

34:52.540 --> 34:58.280
what their reasoning is and that is empowering to me as the person making the decision to

34:58.280 --> 35:00.840
spend my money there every single month.

35:00.840 --> 35:02.800
That's empowering to me and I appreciate that.

35:02.800 --> 35:05.240
You can go over to linux.ting.com to get started.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.600
That lets them know you heard about it right here on the Linux Unplugged show.

35:07.600 --> 35:09.640
You appreciate them supporting Linux Unplugged.

35:09.640 --> 35:13.880
It also gets you that $25 discount and while you're over there, click that how much would

35:13.880 --> 35:14.880
you save button.

35:14.880 --> 35:19.160
It's going to take you to a magical billing calculator and they will estimate what your

35:19.160 --> 35:23.160
bill would be on Ting and let me tell you with those new reduced data rates, it's a

35:23.160 --> 35:24.640
better deal than ever.

35:24.640 --> 35:29.720
No contracts, no early terminations, early termination relief program and much more.

35:29.720 --> 35:35.800
Get started by going to linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux

35:35.800 --> 35:36.800
Unplugged.

35:36.800 --> 35:40.040
You know, once I'm out of my contract, because right now I'm stuck in a contract.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.040
Once I'm out, I'm jumping.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.040
You should.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.200
I mean, I want to make it happen.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.720
If you get the itch beforehand, they have that early termination relief, look $75 per

35:46.720 --> 35:49.440
line and they'll apply it right to you.

35:49.440 --> 35:50.960
That'll pay for Ting for like months.

35:50.960 --> 35:54.840
Once I get to that threshold where I don't have to, you know, I think it's like six or

35:54.840 --> 35:57.640
twelve months out, because you know they knock ten bucks off every month.

35:57.640 --> 36:00.680
They try to get you to stick with them for a little while.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.680
And Ting just is like, you know, we're not doing any of that.

36:02.680 --> 36:03.680
We're going to get rid of that.

36:03.680 --> 36:04.680
That's awesome.

36:04.680 --> 36:10.200
All right, so let's bring in our virtual lug here and let's start a little around the horn

36:10.200 --> 36:12.400
about the how-to Linux show we have coming.

36:12.400 --> 36:17.240
We announced it in the last 300 and we've got some work, we're working on like several

36:17.240 --> 36:18.800
things at once with the show.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.880
Yes, a lot of work.

36:20.880 --> 36:26.000
I mean more work that is being done in the pre-planning of this show than probably any

36:26.000 --> 36:28.600
other show that I've ever done, ever.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.280
Every new show I launch, it's more and more every time.

36:31.280 --> 36:36.480
And what's crazy about this, so this is kind of serving as like we're just going to put

36:36.480 --> 36:42.400
essentially a lot of our ideas and concepts behind making the show on the record that

36:42.400 --> 36:45.640
way down the road when the show has been out there for a while, people can go back to this

36:45.640 --> 36:47.760
and sort of get an understanding of its roots.

36:47.760 --> 36:53.440
And the reason I want to do this is I would be really thrilled if eventually how-to Linux

36:53.440 --> 36:59.640
could be looked upon as another source of living Linux documentation in a sense.

36:59.640 --> 37:05.240
So we have a lot of options and outlets out there, you know, how-to forge, there's stack

37:05.240 --> 37:10.920
exchange websites, there's the Linux documentation project, there's Linux questions, there's

37:10.920 --> 37:13.440
all these sites and they're all really good and they all serve a purpose.

37:13.440 --> 37:18.720
I would like to not replace any of those but add to those another medium, another way for

37:18.720 --> 37:23.880
people who are sitting down at the computer and they want to solve something, I want everybody

37:23.880 --> 37:27.160
who has no idea what Linux is to everybody who knows what Linux is and knows they can

37:27.160 --> 37:30.360
accomplish that task and they just want to get it done.

37:30.360 --> 37:38.880
So to really understand how to solve that particular problem, what I realized is discoverability

37:38.880 --> 37:43.780
is going to be a huge, huge, huge aspect of the show because it's got to be people are

37:43.780 --> 37:46.680
like sitting down at YouTube and they're looking for a guide on how to do something, they're

37:46.680 --> 37:51.120
sitting down at Google and I think part of that, I think a key part of that is going

37:51.120 --> 37:53.740
to be keeping it to a short length.

37:53.740 --> 37:57.560
Like I'm talking 15 minutes, no more than 30 minutes per episode.

37:57.560 --> 38:00.000
We're going to get to the point, we're going to show you how.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.680
Yeah, because you want somebody who's like browsing a list of results, if they see an

38:03.680 --> 38:07.640
hour long show, they're going to look at that and go, oh, I can't, I got to get this problem

38:07.640 --> 38:08.640
solved.

38:08.640 --> 38:12.160
I can't burn an hour watching these guys jerk off in front of the camera.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.040
I want my problem solved, right?

38:14.040 --> 38:18.840
And I think, you know, just mentally that's a blocker where if you see 15 minutes on that

38:18.840 --> 38:22.840
video and this is a problem you want to solve, that's 15 minutes of time well spent.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.360
It's a totally different value equation in my opinion.

38:25.360 --> 38:30.440
Yep, and every question that we bring to the table for the show, we're going to give it

38:30.440 --> 38:35.840
the same care and same quality as the next question, meaning we're not going to short

38:35.840 --> 38:38.960
change a question just because it could be a little bit more difficult or a little bit

38:38.960 --> 38:39.960
easier.

38:39.960 --> 38:40.960
We're going to give it the same care.

38:40.960 --> 38:45.540
And that's, that's the kind of envision that I have in my head for this show where it's

38:45.540 --> 38:47.320
going to be solid.

38:47.320 --> 38:49.760
It's going to be good where you're not going to have to think about the production.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.440
If it's in the title, that's what you're getting, right?

38:51.440 --> 38:52.440
That's what you're going to get.

38:52.440 --> 38:57.680
You're not going to have to search maybe halfway through the video to find the real topic.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.720
It's going to be boom right in your face.

38:59.720 --> 39:05.360
Yeah, and the other thing I think combined with that though is I like the idea of, I

39:05.360 --> 39:08.520
don't know if these two things are conflicts, so I'd love to hear what the Mumble Room thinks

39:08.520 --> 39:09.520
about this.

39:09.520 --> 39:13.040
I also like the idea of a multi-part series.

39:13.040 --> 39:18.100
So part one, you take a topic and then you break it down into chunks and you say, here's

39:18.100 --> 39:24.480
the introduction, here's starting at, at ground zero, like, you know, set up, pour your foundation.

39:24.480 --> 39:27.300
Here's the next part where you're now building on top of that foundation.

39:27.300 --> 39:30.280
Now here in part three, we're actually putting it in production.

39:30.280 --> 39:33.640
And then in part four, here's how you secure it, lock it down.

39:33.640 --> 39:37.300
And if you have an internet facing, you're not going to, you know, expose your home network

39:37.300 --> 39:38.300
to attack.

39:38.300 --> 39:40.760
And this way you don't have to worry about, all right, all right.

39:40.760 --> 39:43.000
You could watch one piece if you're only interested in that one piece.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.600
Well, and you don't have to worry about, all right, well, I'm, I'm about what, 15 minutes

39:46.600 --> 39:47.600
in.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.120
I know where I was.

39:49.120 --> 39:52.080
And then when I come back and watch it, you don't have to worry about that.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.620
Or if you decide, okay, I'm going to watch the building part and then in a month I'll

39:54.620 --> 39:57.160
come back and watch the securing part.

39:57.160 --> 40:00.120
And so I don't know though, and I'd like to hear the mumble room here.

40:00.120 --> 40:04.720
I don't know if, if these two things are a conflict, is a super short show, but then

40:04.720 --> 40:07.160
also broken out into multi-parts.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.560
Do those things go together?

40:09.560 --> 40:16.720
Conflict if you do it in a situation where the multi-part series is not on like the continuous

40:16.720 --> 40:17.720
basis.

40:17.720 --> 40:21.280
So like say you have a, let's say the show's weekly.

40:21.280 --> 40:24.520
One week comes out with an episode that starts a series.

40:24.520 --> 40:27.040
The next week is not the continuation of that series.

40:27.040 --> 40:32.160
Instead, there's a separate section on the website where you get the, each video separated.

40:32.160 --> 40:35.800
So it's not like someone goes in and says, Hey, I want to watch this.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.860
But then they see that that's not something I want to watch.

40:37.860 --> 40:42.220
They're not going to just skip a whole month of videos that apply to that series.

40:42.220 --> 40:43.260
I'm trying to track back.

40:43.260 --> 40:48.160
So what you're saying is, so a one week comes out, that episode is the introduction video

40:48.160 --> 40:51.240
and all the other videos associated with it are released at the same time?

40:51.240 --> 40:55.300
No, they don't necessarily have to be the rest of the time, but they should be all like

40:55.300 --> 40:58.600
on the same, the same page or the same section.

40:58.600 --> 41:01.000
So the next week it's not, it's a different topic.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
So if someone's not interested in that topic, they won't just skip the continuous weeks

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
until the series over.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Okay.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.720
So how do you think YouTube playlists could play into this?

41:08.720 --> 41:13.040
Well, I think like if you have a multi-part series, then you could go ahead and throw

41:13.040 --> 41:17.040
those into a playlist and have that playlist a part of the account.

41:17.040 --> 41:18.040
You know what I'm saying?

41:18.040 --> 41:21.640
Where people can go, if they want to watch the whole thing, they can, if they just want

41:21.640 --> 41:26.040
to watch a certain part of it, like the 15 minute segments you're talking about, then

41:26.040 --> 41:28.080
yes, they could, they have that option.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.840
They could do it both ways.

41:29.840 --> 41:32.680
And Faye, you wanted to kind of mention it from a new user perspective.

41:32.680 --> 41:37.280
Well, when I was a new user, I didn't even know about the resources that exist in order

41:37.280 --> 41:39.280
to find how to solve my problems.

41:39.280 --> 41:43.280
And you kind of get directed towards the forums and you may or may not get responses.

41:43.280 --> 41:46.640
And then you have to read documentation that contains a whole lot of jargon you're not

41:46.640 --> 41:47.640
familiar with.

41:47.640 --> 41:52.040
But just having a video in the first place is, was, when I started using links a few

41:52.040 --> 41:54.320
years ago, that was the best option for me.

41:54.320 --> 41:57.440
But most of these videos, they weren't very professional and they were scattered.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.320
It's not like they did them for, as a job.

41:59.320 --> 42:02.820
They just did them when they wanted to show somebody how to do something.

42:02.820 --> 42:06.800
So even if, I mean, having a concise video is a wise choice, but even if they were a

42:06.800 --> 42:10.240
little bit longer, I think a lot of people would get benefit from it just because it

42:10.240 --> 42:13.280
shows them how to do something the right way the first time.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.280
Yeah.

42:14.280 --> 42:18.280
The thing is, I think part of the reason why we've been looking at the particular timeframe

42:18.280 --> 42:25.920
of 50 to 30 minutes is we're very conscious of the audience and how people have busy lives

42:25.920 --> 42:30.480
and they don't want to have to sit in front of their computer for an hour to watch a video

42:30.480 --> 42:32.000
or a how-to video.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.640
You want to get to the point.

42:33.640 --> 42:39.400
And also, attention spans sometimes can drift off after 30 minutes or so.

42:39.400 --> 42:45.640
So we want to quick hit you and we're trying to figure out how do you do a large project

42:45.640 --> 42:46.640
and spread that out.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.400
I mean, obviously, we're going to be shooting these.

42:48.400 --> 42:49.400
Yeah.

42:49.400 --> 42:55.180
We don't want to have to skimp and gloss over certain details because if we're only going

42:55.180 --> 42:59.360
to give an entire topic 30 minutes, we could probably fit that into an episode of last.

42:59.360 --> 43:04.160
But we want to be able to feature something that, just as a total random example, but

43:04.160 --> 43:09.840
let's say it was setting up a lamp stack, which I don't think would be top on our list,

43:09.840 --> 43:11.400
but let's just say that's one of them.

43:11.400 --> 43:14.720
Wouldn't it be great to actually start at the very beginning?

43:14.720 --> 43:15.840
Get that system loaded up.

43:15.840 --> 43:17.000
Get those packages installed.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Get those dependencies.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Get all that figured out.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Get your web server set up.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
Get your modules figured out.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.400
And that's separate episodes.

43:22.400 --> 43:25.240
And then at the end of it, you secure that thing down.

43:25.240 --> 43:30.600
And then maybe, okay, this is more work, but the other thought that crossed our mind was

43:30.600 --> 43:34.320
when it airs, because really what we're trying to build up is a back catalog.

43:34.320 --> 43:37.480
So we're looking at this from the perspective of people are coming across this for years

43:37.480 --> 43:40.160
down the road, not just that week.

43:40.160 --> 43:44.800
But so it would air in a weekly basis and at the end of that set, so maybe it's a three

43:44.800 --> 43:51.420
episode set or a four episode set of how to do something, then one single video in a master

43:51.420 --> 43:57.360
RSS feed of completed episodes where everything is just in one long connected video could

43:57.360 --> 43:58.400
be published separately.

43:58.400 --> 44:02.440
So people would have an option to watch the individual stages as they come out, or they

44:02.440 --> 44:06.120
could wait till the end of the whole run and watch one contiguous video.

44:06.120 --> 44:10.600
You could say episodes five through nine is about doing X, things like that.

44:10.600 --> 44:15.060
And at the end of that run, they're all available as one single download or individually.

44:15.060 --> 44:18.120
But if there's someone who doesn't have an interest in that particular topic, that means

44:18.120 --> 44:20.560
four episodes that they're not going to watch.

44:20.560 --> 44:21.560
Right.

44:21.560 --> 44:22.560
Well, and that's the thing, though.

44:22.560 --> 44:25.840
I mean, we're going to be doing a how to Linux show, and that's one of those things where

44:25.840 --> 44:29.600
we're going to run into, I think, regardless of what it is.

44:29.600 --> 44:30.600
Right.

44:30.600 --> 44:33.800
But instead of having the four episodes where people are that one topic that people are

44:33.800 --> 44:37.680
not going to watch, you could have different episodes that they would have different topics

44:37.680 --> 44:39.320
that would get more people watching it.

44:39.320 --> 44:40.320
But how do you do that?

44:40.320 --> 44:41.320
That's the nature of the show.

44:41.320 --> 44:45.680
I mean, you just have to do stuff and people aren't going to be interested in a lot of

44:45.680 --> 44:46.680
it.

44:46.680 --> 44:47.680
That's true.

44:47.680 --> 44:52.860
But if you do a series in the sense of episode five, part one, part two, and part three,

44:52.860 --> 44:59.280
you still get the series separation, the part separation, but you don't have to have a train

44:59.280 --> 45:03.320
of a month of people not being interested in the show, and they might forget it at that

45:03.320 --> 45:04.320
point.

45:04.320 --> 45:05.960
But at that point, why even slice it up?

45:05.960 --> 45:12.600
I mean, if you're going to do it in that route, say 5A, 5B, and 5C, there's really no point

45:12.600 --> 45:13.600
in slicing it up.

45:13.600 --> 45:17.760
It just causes more work to be done in the production side and more work to be done in

45:17.760 --> 45:19.560
the actual shooting side.

45:19.560 --> 45:20.560
Right.

45:20.560 --> 45:21.560
So two things.

45:21.560 --> 45:28.440
I think the number one thing, which is just based on just experience, is if we were developing

45:28.440 --> 45:31.760
an application and you could list out all of the features of that application, the number

45:31.760 --> 45:38.640
one feature has to be short length, I think, just because you're not getting a lot of people

45:38.640 --> 45:40.720
in the door unless it's short.

45:40.720 --> 45:42.840
So I think that's the number one hard point we're up against.

45:42.840 --> 45:46.840
And that's just based on discoverability data that I've just watched over the years.

45:46.840 --> 45:53.560
And the second thing to that end is I kind of feel like there is definitely that scenario

45:53.560 --> 45:58.480
where people are not going to be interested in the how to run for that period.

45:58.480 --> 46:03.560
But at the same time, I don't really see a great solution to that problem.

46:03.560 --> 46:06.200
It kind of seems like this is just going to be the nature of this kind of show.

46:06.200 --> 46:10.960
Because if you break it out like we're talking about, you're not going to get around that.

46:10.960 --> 46:16.160
And the problem is the benefit of sort of taking it slow is we can incorporate people's

46:16.160 --> 46:18.760
questions into the set as we're going.

46:18.760 --> 46:24.160
So that way if we miss something in one set, by the time we're recording the next set,

46:24.160 --> 46:26.800
so say we record episode one and two back to back.

46:26.800 --> 46:29.620
And then by the time we sit down to record episode three and four, to continue that,

46:29.620 --> 46:33.600
we can incorporate people's questions and sort of make the how to even better.

46:33.600 --> 46:40.080
But the other thing it lets us do is it really lets us give air to the topic.

46:40.080 --> 46:41.080
If we had to cram...

46:41.080 --> 46:45.920
I guess what I'm trying to say is if we could take one topic and really just serve that

46:45.920 --> 46:50.560
topic for four episodes in a stretch, we're going to get to all the nooks and crannies

46:50.560 --> 46:51.560
of that topic.

46:51.560 --> 46:56.540
Whereas if we have to do a completely new set every single week, just the production

46:56.540 --> 47:03.200
demands of pumping that out will mandate that not as much time is spent on that topic.

47:03.200 --> 47:05.200
Chris, I would...

47:05.200 --> 47:09.400
I know you thought about doing it with another show at some point, but ever thought maybe

47:09.400 --> 47:12.240
doing two parts per week.

47:12.240 --> 47:14.520
Maybe like one on Tuesday and one on Thursday or something.

47:14.520 --> 47:16.840
Yeah, we are kind of considering that too.

47:16.840 --> 47:20.360
The production is harder there, but it's something we're kind of kicking around is that might

47:20.360 --> 47:22.840
be a way to sort of speed the process up.

47:22.840 --> 47:23.840
Yeah.

47:23.840 --> 47:29.320
Also, you got to keep in mind too, you might want to do very like distro-specific things

47:29.320 --> 47:34.580
to like make an entire series about one specific distro, so like you can have an entire like

47:34.580 --> 47:42.520
OpenSUSE-related show, like doing like build service stuff, like things like that and then...

47:42.520 --> 47:48.880
Now, I got to ask a question here and obviously, here's a noob of me coming into play.

47:48.880 --> 47:52.840
Would that be because you have a preference to that particular version of Linux or is

47:52.840 --> 47:57.960
that because you think that would be a more generalization for the viewer?

47:57.960 --> 48:03.300
Because the one thing I want to be very, very careful about is saying, well, I think this

48:03.300 --> 48:06.320
particular version of Linux is better than this particular version of Linux and then

48:06.320 --> 48:10.880
you have infighting for people who will have their own favorite versions and distros.

48:10.880 --> 48:12.800
I've always kind of pictured rotating around.

48:12.800 --> 48:14.800
That's what I pictured too.

48:14.800 --> 48:18.360
Wait, let Poby get a chance because he's going to say something.

48:18.360 --> 48:19.360
Go ahead, Poby.

48:19.360 --> 48:20.360
Oh, sorry.

48:20.360 --> 48:22.640
Let me just interrupt playing Portal 2 on Linux.

48:22.640 --> 48:25.360
No, hold on a second.

48:25.360 --> 48:26.360
That gets in.

48:26.360 --> 48:27.360
There we go.

48:27.360 --> 48:28.360
Yeah, yeah.

48:28.360 --> 48:29.360
Very good.

48:29.360 --> 48:37.600
I'm inclined to agree with Rob, actually, I like the idea that you, episode one starts

48:37.600 --> 48:46.860
a series on a particular topic and you could do what a lot of, I've seen Unity 3D, introduction

48:46.860 --> 48:53.800
videos and Minecraft videos do where they record for a significant chunk of time to

48:53.800 --> 49:00.320
give the topic plenty of detail and go into real depth, but you break it up and you just

49:00.320 --> 49:05.120
break it up into 10 minute slots and you cut it and put it out as a playlist.

49:05.120 --> 49:11.880
Now, the first episode goes out as episode one and then as you've said, 1A, 1B, 1C, and

49:11.880 --> 49:15.120
then the following week there's some completely different topic.

49:15.120 --> 49:17.640
It's not related to the previous week.

49:17.640 --> 49:19.760
It's not a continuation from the previous week.

49:19.760 --> 49:23.240
There's no dependency on you having watched any of the previous episodes.

49:23.240 --> 49:30.080
It's something new and fresh and that way you fulfill the being able to go in depth

49:30.080 --> 49:31.160
on a topic.

49:31.160 --> 49:36.400
You can punch out lots of episodes because you record it all in one long one hour stint,

49:36.400 --> 49:42.580
but chop it up into pieces so you get the continuation of a playlist and the thread

49:42.580 --> 49:48.440
of one topic, but you also get the benefit that you don't have to keep recording lots

49:48.440 --> 49:52.560
of different episodes that nobody is going to watch because they're all on a theme that

49:52.560 --> 49:54.640
nobody's interested in.

49:54.640 --> 50:00.220
So question here, playlists are very YouTube friendly, of course, but remember this is

50:00.220 --> 50:06.280
also going to be a downloadable show and so if I, for example, my podcatching feed had

50:06.280 --> 50:16.200
1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D, that's four things that are in my feed instead of one episode.

50:16.200 --> 50:17.840
So how would that be handled?

50:17.840 --> 50:21.480
I would like to kind of go against Popey's idea.

50:21.480 --> 50:26.320
I would say if we're going to stick to one topic a week, do two parts, one on one day

50:26.320 --> 50:30.360
and then another day of the week to still get that community feedback and questions

50:30.360 --> 50:32.360
that you can answer as Chris wanted to do.

50:32.360 --> 50:37.360
The problem is I don't want to have to wait a week to find out part two.

50:37.360 --> 50:45.280
If this is an in-depth thing, I want the immediacy of being able to go into plenty of detail

50:45.280 --> 50:48.880
about the entire topic if I have time to do it.

50:48.880 --> 50:55.160
I don't want to have to have a ten minute topic and then wait a week for the next ten

50:55.160 --> 50:56.160
minutes.

50:56.160 --> 50:57.880
I'm going to zone out.

50:57.880 --> 51:01.080
So Ick, why don't you chime in with sort of, you had a comment about the nature of

51:01.080 --> 51:02.080
podcasting.

51:02.080 --> 51:04.160
Yes, it's basically an on-demand medium.

51:04.160 --> 51:10.480
So what you're going to have is people picking and choosing what they want anyhow, whether

51:10.480 --> 51:15.280
they're going to want to watch this whole series on a particular topic or they're going

51:15.280 --> 51:19.400
to want to skip over that and just wait for the next one.

51:19.400 --> 51:23.320
Sadly, you know, you're not going to be able to please all the people all the time with

51:23.320 --> 51:24.320
that.

51:24.320 --> 51:25.320
That's true.

51:25.320 --> 51:27.960
Q5, you had a comment about the distro.

51:27.960 --> 51:33.000
Yeah, I think if you use a distro, like let's say we're talking about how to set up NGINX

51:33.000 --> 51:37.440
and own cloud on a box somewhere where we're using Debian as our example.

51:37.440 --> 51:42.680
We can run the whole how to with using say Debian as the example and then at the very

51:42.680 --> 51:47.640
end have a short blurb that says, okay, now if you're using Arch, you may have to change,

51:47.640 --> 51:51.600
you know, things here, here, here, or if you're using Slackware, you know, you might need

51:51.600 --> 51:53.680
to find Slack build scripts or other things.

51:53.680 --> 51:58.520
That way you can focus on one distro, get the information out there and then also touch

51:58.520 --> 52:02.520
on if you're using another distro, here are some things you might want to take a note

52:02.520 --> 52:04.560
of before you go down the road.

52:04.560 --> 52:06.960
And Fate, you wanted to also comment about distros.

52:06.960 --> 52:09.420
Yeah, I was actually going to suggest the same thing.

52:09.420 --> 52:14.160
If you focus on one particular distro from start to finish and exclude acknowledging

52:14.160 --> 52:18.480
other distros, then you're targeting a subset of a subset and I don't think that'd be as

52:18.480 --> 52:24.040
beneficial to people as trying to be as all inclusive as possible.

52:24.040 --> 52:28.720
So I kind of, you know, I love the idea of maybe like a sort of like a middle ground

52:28.720 --> 52:32.360
where it's you split it up, but it's two releases in a one week.

52:32.360 --> 52:36.800
The problem with that is right now resources, that might be something we do, you know, maybe

52:36.800 --> 52:38.080
a couple of months down the road.

52:38.080 --> 52:44.240
I don't know, because that would require probably that we have our editor in place.

52:44.240 --> 52:48.320
On Popi's point, instead of 10 minute segments, when you're structuring the show and you're

52:48.320 --> 52:52.800
writing the notes, you could write them as different segments, like you currently segment

52:52.800 --> 52:55.000
last right now, right?

52:55.000 --> 52:59.520
And then choose, you know, depending on how many segments are available for that particular

52:59.520 --> 53:01.880
show, how you're going to do the release structure.

53:01.880 --> 53:07.160
I mean, it's one of those things that maybe the show, I mean, this is right now, it's

53:07.160 --> 53:11.960
all very fluid, but maybe the show needs to be a full length show, not small.

53:11.960 --> 53:12.960
And I know-

53:12.960 --> 53:13.960
I think that's a problem.

53:13.960 --> 53:18.880
It is a problem, but it's, I guess it all comes down to the topic at hand, right?

53:18.880 --> 53:19.880
Yeah.

53:19.880 --> 53:23.080
I was just thinking like, even the segment idea is kind of hard because like sometimes

53:23.080 --> 53:26.880
that part takes five minutes and sometimes that part will take a half hour.

53:26.880 --> 53:27.880
Right.

53:27.880 --> 53:28.880
Yeah.

53:28.880 --> 53:29.880
That's challenging.

53:29.880 --> 53:30.880
Right.

53:30.880 --> 53:34.520
I mean, I think obviously at the beginning of the show, you know, I say episodes one

53:34.520 --> 53:39.600
through five, I doubt that we're going to get into anything that requires multiple parts

53:39.600 --> 53:42.400
because remember, this is a how to Linux show.

53:42.400 --> 53:49.000
We're taking baby steps or we're taking baby steps with me and I don't see us getting into

53:49.000 --> 53:54.520
something that's going to require a baby step approach, at least in the beginning, because

53:54.520 --> 53:57.100
you know, remember, we're trying to appeal to a general audience.

53:57.100 --> 54:01.060
It's not just the advanced audiences, but also the people who are wanting to learn more

54:01.060 --> 54:02.060
about Linux.

54:02.060 --> 54:06.680
If you're going to give somebody a five step process for someone to learn more about Linux,

54:06.680 --> 54:09.320
you might lose them already because they'll be like, wow, really?

54:09.320 --> 54:13.340
I need to go through a five step course to learn about this particular thing that I want

54:13.340 --> 54:14.340
to do?

54:14.340 --> 54:15.340
I don't know.

54:15.340 --> 54:17.000
I see, I think that's looking at it from the wrong angle.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.560
I think it's more going back to like what Iq was saying of the on demand nature of it

54:20.560 --> 54:24.080
where a lot of people look at it and say, well, I don't need to know how to install

54:24.080 --> 54:25.080
a package.

54:25.080 --> 54:29.400
I know how to install a package, but I need to know is how to set up this part of it.

54:29.400 --> 54:30.400
Right.

54:30.400 --> 54:33.880
And I think that's the advantage of having it broken up a little bit is people can pick

54:33.880 --> 54:36.280
and choose the components that meet their skill set.

54:36.280 --> 54:37.280
Yeah, that's true.

54:37.280 --> 54:40.840
Well, like when I'm looking at something for Kdenlive, for example, that's actually something

54:40.840 --> 54:41.840
I've run into.

54:41.840 --> 54:45.200
I can use video editors and Linux six ways from Sunday, but there's always like that.

54:45.200 --> 54:48.240
It's always forget like the process of compositing that I always forget that.

54:48.240 --> 54:50.860
So I have to like look for that piece of it to remember how to do it.

54:50.860 --> 54:52.360
And I don't want to watch an entire show on it.

54:52.360 --> 54:54.120
So I think having the segment definitely helps.

54:54.120 --> 54:55.120
Okay.

54:55.120 --> 54:59.840
I kind of want to bring up this concern is, okay, playlists are very YouTube friendly,

54:59.840 --> 55:03.120
but what are we going to do when we put it on, let's say, the Jupiter Broadcasting website?

55:03.120 --> 55:04.120
Right.

55:04.120 --> 55:07.360
That's the yeah, I think I think basing around playlists is only get you so far.

55:07.360 --> 55:11.160
I think that is a problem as SM, SMA, SSA.

55:11.160 --> 55:12.160
What did you want to say?

55:12.160 --> 55:13.160
SMASA.

55:13.160 --> 55:14.160
SMASA.

55:14.160 --> 55:15.160
Yeah, SMASA.

55:15.160 --> 55:18.400
I just wanted to say that you want this to be an archive of how to do different things

55:18.400 --> 55:19.400
in Linux.

55:19.400 --> 55:23.520
So I don't think you should really be that strict about how long each individual show

55:23.520 --> 55:24.520
is.

55:24.520 --> 55:25.520
Yeah.

55:25.520 --> 55:27.900
You should try to do whatever it is as fast as possible, but still be effective and leave

55:27.900 --> 55:28.900
that up to the topic.

55:28.900 --> 55:29.900
Yeah.

55:29.900 --> 55:30.900
Yeah.

55:30.900 --> 55:31.900
I think that's going to have to happen either way.

55:31.900 --> 55:35.400
I mean, I don't think like we could just cut it off if something was going long because

55:35.400 --> 55:37.240
the content will always sort of drive that.

55:37.240 --> 55:38.240
And that's it, you guys.

55:38.240 --> 55:39.240
That's all we have time.

55:39.240 --> 55:41.640
We really want to show you how to get that started.

55:41.640 --> 55:42.640
But we're going to have to run.

55:42.640 --> 55:46.000
But we ran out of film, you know, the camera, the batteries.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Yeah.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
Yeah.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
So, boy, I don't know.

55:49.000 --> 55:53.760
So it sounds like this is still something I want to kind of try to refine because I think

55:53.760 --> 55:55.960
this is a key part to how to deliver this show.

55:55.960 --> 55:59.840
And I think part of it is like there's two audiences we're trying to solve or trying

55:59.840 --> 56:01.080
to serve.

56:01.080 --> 56:05.000
One is the weekly people that will want to tune in and see what we're working on.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.120
And the other was going to be the people who will be coming across the archive in a year

56:09.120 --> 56:12.440
from now when they're trying to implement that project they want to get done.

56:12.440 --> 56:16.320
And it's too bad you can't do like chapter breaks like on a DVD.

56:16.320 --> 56:17.320
Right?

56:17.320 --> 56:18.320
Yeah.

56:18.320 --> 56:20.160
We'll release each one of the DVD.

56:20.160 --> 56:26.000
Now, you could release a playlist file on the website included with like a zip or a

56:26.000 --> 56:32.360
tar jizz or something, although, I mean, is this even a podcast format?

56:32.360 --> 56:35.240
You had to say it like that, didn't you?

56:35.240 --> 56:37.240
Yes, tar jizz, jizz, whatever.

56:37.240 --> 56:38.240
Okay.

56:38.240 --> 56:39.240
Okay.

56:39.240 --> 56:40.240
All right.

56:40.240 --> 56:41.240
All right.

56:41.240 --> 56:42.240
I somehow knew I'd get that response.

56:42.240 --> 56:44.800
It was not intentional, but.

56:44.800 --> 56:50.120
Well, why not having it so you have one episode, say, the lamp stack.

56:50.120 --> 56:54.880
You have one episode about the introduction, and that gets people to say, this is the episodes

56:54.880 --> 56:55.880
about this.

56:55.880 --> 56:57.720
And then on the show notes, there are multiple parts.

56:57.720 --> 56:59.840
They can jump to different posts.

56:59.840 --> 57:04.360
So everything's still self-contained in the one episode, but it's split up so people can

57:04.360 --> 57:06.840
see what they can get to the sections that they want to.

57:06.840 --> 57:10.740
And in this way, you could benefit having it archived on the website and archiving

57:10.740 --> 57:15.000
it on YouTube and doing playlists and having it all, you know, organized however you want

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
to in different mediums.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
That makes sense.

57:17.000 --> 57:22.800
It kind of sounds to me like you want to fulfill two requirements, one, which is have the people

57:22.800 --> 57:26.840
who are going to download a chunky video and will be happy to sit there and go through

57:26.840 --> 57:32.520
it and pause it and, you know, continue and jump ahead or whatever.

57:32.520 --> 57:33.520
Yeah.

57:33.520 --> 57:38.360
Whereas you also want the short attention span YouTube audience who will watch a ten

57:38.360 --> 57:42.200
minute video and then, you know, disappear and then maybe come back for the next ten

57:42.200 --> 57:45.200
minute video in the series.

57:45.200 --> 57:49.920
That's three ten minute videos in a playlist or one sixty minute video.

57:49.920 --> 57:51.320
So it's basically a sixty minute video.

57:51.320 --> 57:54.040
You chop into three, put it on a playlist, you're done.

57:54.040 --> 57:55.040
Yeah.

57:55.040 --> 57:56.040
Yeah.

57:56.040 --> 57:57.040
Yeah.

57:57.040 --> 57:58.040
I like what Popey was saying.

57:58.040 --> 58:02.400
Like for your actual website, you put the one final episode and then you put the split

58:02.400 --> 58:04.800
parts on YouTube.

58:04.800 --> 58:08.440
I don't even I don't I don't really like designing any aspect of the show for YouTube.

58:08.440 --> 58:10.720
I don't even like thinking about YouTube.

58:10.720 --> 58:11.720
Makes me so frustrated.

58:11.720 --> 58:13.680
Riley's been trying to get a point in about production.

58:13.680 --> 58:15.400
Go ahead, Riley.

58:15.400 --> 58:16.400
Yes.

58:16.400 --> 58:20.400
That's what I was going to say about YouTube, too, is like you have to make sure the production

58:20.400 --> 58:27.920
is good on it and you do keep people entertained because a lot of the shows like it's the people

58:27.920 --> 58:30.520
who do it at Austin are kind of weird sometimes.

58:30.520 --> 58:31.520
Yeah.

58:31.520 --> 58:38.200
My observation, you know, from some that I've checked out is they're too slow and they're

58:38.200 --> 58:43.000
spending way too much time sort of with the introduction and the and the talking about

58:43.000 --> 58:47.160
themselves and all this kind of stuff instead of just hitting the ground running.

58:47.160 --> 58:50.820
And I really look at it from that that mindset of somebody who wants to come in and solve

58:50.820 --> 58:51.820
a problem.

58:51.820 --> 58:55.920
And I really think that's the person that, you know, you know, in terms of who we can

58:55.920 --> 59:01.220
help and and and who we can provide, you know, more more resources for people looking to

59:01.220 --> 59:02.220
switch to Linux.

59:02.220 --> 59:04.920
I feel like that's the person to serve.

59:04.920 --> 59:08.640
But I still want to make it palatable to everyone else, too, in some way.

59:08.640 --> 59:09.640
So I think.

59:09.640 --> 59:10.640
Yeah.

59:10.640 --> 59:11.640
Go ahead.

59:11.640 --> 59:15.960
You know, this really isn't necessarily a podcast is this we don't really need a format

59:15.960 --> 59:20.640
in a method that would go out to a podcast catcher or anything.

59:20.640 --> 59:21.640
We do.

59:21.640 --> 59:22.640
I don't know.

59:22.640 --> 59:26.560
I think maybe that's why I was thinking maybe still having a final version that is sort

59:26.560 --> 59:28.240
of a longer show type format.

59:28.240 --> 59:29.240
Yeah.

59:29.240 --> 59:32.160
Well, and I think from a podcast version, the one of the advantages is that it allows

59:32.160 --> 59:36.400
you to build up your own personal library of stuff we know and stuff we're sharing.

59:36.400 --> 59:40.020
So you may not even really need to watch that video right away.

59:40.020 --> 59:42.200
But then later on, think, oh, crap, what was that one thing?

59:42.200 --> 59:43.480
And then you have it stored locally.

59:43.480 --> 59:45.560
Some people do want that local media.

59:45.560 --> 59:47.640
They don't necessarily want to watch it online.

59:47.640 --> 59:48.640
Yeah.

59:48.640 --> 59:49.640
Hmm.

59:49.640 --> 59:50.640
All right.

59:50.640 --> 59:52.800
Well, it sounds like we'll do some more discussions.

59:52.800 --> 59:55.720
But thanks for all you know, thanks for giving us a lot to think about, you guys.

59:55.720 --> 59:56.720
That's good input to take there.

59:56.720 --> 59:57.720
Yeah, absolutely.

59:57.720 --> 59:58.720
Thank you.

59:58.720 --> 59:59.720
All right.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:00.720
Well, we got an email from Todd.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.920
He wrote and says, Hey, guys, I've been going through this long experiment to get rid of

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:06.520
Google in my life and trying to find Linux devices for mobile use is hurting me right

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.520
now.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:12.120
I was on CyanogenMod for the time being, but Google has ripped so much out of Aesop that

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.200
it's really leaving a lot to be desired.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:18.720
Would you consider doing a call out for feedback from people using OpenPandora or any of those

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:22.760
crazy Chinese gadgets like or the Yolo phone or something like that?

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.480
Then you could share their feedback on the show and put it in the show notes.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:30.680
I really want to buy an OpenPandora one gigahertz model, but that's a lot of money to spend

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.120
on something that might or might not work out.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.720
If a listener was able to give some feedback and on its use for messaging, SIP and Linux

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.480
apps in general, I'd make it a lot easier for me.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.040
He's also going to post in the Jupiter Colony and on the G Plus Jupiter Colony.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:49.480
Well, I live in Kansas, so I'm trying to get more Google in my life.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.480
The fiber kind.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.480
Yeah.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.480
All right.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.480
So John wrote in, I call it the possible downsides of acceptance.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.800
He said, So I definitely agree that getting more people to use Linux is great for the

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.920
desktop and Linux as a whole.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:06.320
But what if, say, for example, Canonical dominated the Linux space and slowly inched towards

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.560
a closed source system like Windows or Mac OS?

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.520
Do you think that this is a potential issue?

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.700
If something like that happened, then real Linux would be stuck where it currently stands

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:20.680
in which a big shot OS that dominates the market would then enslave all of their users

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.040
and all the new stuff that Linux people are left out in the cold.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.500
What are your thoughts on this matter, John?

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.240
So I don't think this is really quite the same.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.920
I think I hear this comparison a lot and I don't think this is really quite the same

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.360
and it really kind of comes down to license, I think.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:42.240
I think you look at companies like, or distros like Mint and other things, it kind of proves

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.240
that, in a sense.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:48.000
So where Mac or Windows could come in and sort of brace and extend and then dry out

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
all the competition, that's not really an option for things that are based on the GPL

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
as much.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
It's a possibility, I suppose.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.800
And then that would be the market deciding, right?

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.800
This is true.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.280
I think they're confusing the word, the joke about Mark being a dictator with an actual

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.280
dictator.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.280
Yes.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.280
Welcome to Putin OS.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.280
Yeah.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.280
Okay.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.280
All right.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.280
But John, so I wouldn't worry about it.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:14.160
I think the license has shown that if anything, things rise and fall and then at the end of

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.680
the day, it's all GPLed code and that's kind of what matters in the end.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:22.600
Well, lots to think about and we'd love to hear your thoughts on the how-to show as well

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:28.360
and probably the best way to send us your ideas because the Linux action show inbox

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.840
is ridiculous right now.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.440
I bet it is.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.680
We got so many emails.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:37.280
But if you want to shoot your ideas to at HowToLinux on the Twitter, twitter.com slash

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.280
HowToLinux.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.760
We'll be monitoring that for ideas and suggestions and we'll also be eventually posting notifications

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:46.720
when the show gets closer to launch and when we're doing stuff, we'll be posting it there.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.920
Not a lot happening at the moment because the show is still obviously in the early stages

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:54.040
but that'd be a good spot to follow so that way you can get updates but you can also send

01:02:54.040 --> 01:03:01.000
us ideas, topic ideas, format ideas and all that kind of stuff at HowToLinux on the Twitter.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
All right.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.120
Well, thank you very much Mumble Room for joining us.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.040
You guys were great as always and gave us a lot to think about and thanks to Brendan

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.880
for writing in or for calling in and talking to me about the Clementine OS project.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.360
And Chase, thanks to you for joining us.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.080
Hey, you know, it's always fun being here.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:18.020
You know, I feel very comfortable for me to be here with you guys so thank you so much

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.020
for having me here.

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.720
Well, you keep that seat warm because you'll be sitting right there again tomorrow for

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.720
Unfiltered.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.680
Yeah, why don't you put that other chair together so I have a much more comfortable seat.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:25.680
Why don't you put that chair together?

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.680
Come on, man.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.680
I'm in a folding chair here.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:28.680
You're sitting in like my naked.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.680
I know.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.680
Well, this chair is no good either.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:31.680
This chair is no good.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:36.600
Well, Matt, if all goes as planned, on Sunday we'll be chatting with one of the new folks

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:40.900
at the KDE Design Group who are working on the next version of the Plasma desktop to

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.300
make it look even better.

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.300
So that'll be a good chat.

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:46.520
And did you see, by the way, the Numix folks made the official announcement about their

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.920
new desktop they're going to be working on?

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:51.480
You can find that on their G Plus feed and go check that out.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:55.360
Also, don't forget you can join us live on a Tuesday at 2 p.m. over at jblive.tv.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:59.800
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your own local time

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.800
zone.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800
You'll have our mumble room.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.800
You join the chat room.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.280
Do bang mumble and you'll get the mumble server address and you can hang out in our virtual

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.320
log and chat with us in real time.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.320
And we have that open to everybody.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:12.180
If you're working on a project and you want to spread the word, just let us know.

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.180
And we'll have we have a lot of good stuff coming up.

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:16.360
We got a lot of good stuff in the works.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.360
Great stuff in the works.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.120
And don't forget to go to teespring.com slash last 300.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.880
Get yourself a shirt and a challenge coin.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.880
All right, everyone.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.160
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:31.160
If we don't see you on Sunday, we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:56.340
Have a great day.
