1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Has anybody seen this tiny palm phone?

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,420
Is that the companion one that goes with your real phone?

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,260
Yeah, it's-

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,780
I'm so bummed about how they're marketing it.

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,620
Why, why?

6
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,440
I think it's a great idea.

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,060
You don't need a watch, you need a tiny phone.

8
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,900
Okay, you're right.

9
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,860
That sounds, that sounds dumb.

10
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,180
I want a tiny phone instead of a giant phone.

11
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,500
I just want that to be a thing again.

12
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,180
I miss my small phones.

13
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,660
Cassidy, what you're looking for is the Sony XZ1.

14
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,460
I had a X, a Sony something compact

15
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,300
and it was pretty good.

16
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,120
Oh, that one.

17
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,960
Yeah, yeah.

18
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,780
The compact version.

19
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,620
I just, yeah.

20
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,660
I'm happy that they're doing it.

21
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,420
I just wish more people made small phones.

22
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,180
I wish, I wish that a three and a half inch phone

23
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,060
didn't have to be marketed as a companion.

24
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,900
As a weird thing.

25
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,620
It could be marketed as like a phone.

26
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,380
Well, you know what would legit make me buy this

27
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,340
right now though, is if it ran webOS again.

28
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,500
That would be so amazing.

29
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,340
The good old days.

30
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,180
Yes.

31
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,000
It's weird.

32
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,340
It's like they don't remember the folio that they made

33
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,900
back in the day that was a companion device

34
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,600
that didn't even get released.

35
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,180
How do they think this is going to work?

36
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,980
Also companion devices.

37
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,620
Isn't that a thing from like, you know, 12, 13 years ago?

38
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,180
Can you remember having companions to things?

39
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,460
Isn't Palm a thing from 12 or 13 years ago?

40
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,260
This is Linux Unplugged episode 271 for October 16th, 2018.

41
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,260
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

42
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,420
that's playing high fidelity sound clips

43
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,420
over its Thunderbolt 3 port on Linux.

44
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,240
It's amazing.

45
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,080
My name is Chris.

46
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,900
My name is Wes.

47
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,860
It worked.

48
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,300
That's our first intro.

49
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,580
No problems, no glitches, Linux for the win.

50
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,100
Played live off the ThinkPad as the sound board

51
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,060
over a Thunderbolt 3 connection

52
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,900
into the mixer via sound interface.

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,420
Just a proud milestone.

54
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,660
All right, well, that's not what we're here to talk about.

55
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,780
Coming up on this week's episode,

56
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,820
we've got a bunch of community news,

57
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,020
and then we'll ask Dan and Cassidy the hard questions

58
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,260
about elementary OS Juno's new release

59
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,220
that just came out moments ago.

60
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,920
We'll preview this week's Ubuntu 18.10,

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,660
chat some hardware with Wimpy,

62
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,540
and then we'll bring Dalton on from Ubuntu Touch

63
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,100
and ask them about the new Ubiport's OTA 5 release.

64
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,640
And then after we're done with that,

65
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,780
we're gonna announce our own free software project,

66
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,140
a modest one, and we need your help naming it.

67
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,580
And I may have found a, quote,

68
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,020
Photoshop alternative, unquote, for Linux.

69
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,540
And I found it in the most unlikely place.

70
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,200
I started trying to get old Photoshop 7 under wine,

71
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,620
couldn't actually find it anywhere

72
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,980
where I could get a valid download,

73
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,580
I mean, backup copy,

74
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,520
wandered off into GIMP and Inkscape and Corita for hours,

75
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,140
and ended up on our app pick this week.

76
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,220
And we'll do a full panel review

77
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,020
of this potential Photoshop replacement for Linux users.

78
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,260
But before we go any further,

79
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,820
we gotta bring in that mumble room.

80
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
Time, appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

81
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,100
Hello. Hello.

82
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,400
Whoa, that is, that is, hold on, down periscope.

83
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,420
We gotta look at this.

84
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,940
Brandon's in there, Brent's in there,

85
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,340
Cassidy's in there, Cubicle Nate,

86
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,340
Dan's in there, Mr. Echo, Dave, Eric, Funtalis, hello.

87
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,940
MiniMech, Popey, Sean, TechMav, and Wimpy.

88
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,780
Hello, virtual lug.

89
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,620
A lot of snads.

90
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,820
That is, that's such a long list,

91
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,900
I'm almost gonna have to take a breath

92
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,540
after going through that, that is impressive.

93
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,900
Pace yourself, we've got a huge show.

94
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,440
We have a huge show today.

95
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,140
We are also just doing a little public service announcement

96
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,500
here at the top of the show.

97
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,860
We won't be live next week,

98
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,660
we have a very special feature edition

99
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,140
of the Unplugged program.

100
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,640
We're gonna do a deep dive into a project

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,780
we've been working on,

102
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,940
we're gonna bring on the lead developer of PipeWire

103
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,180
and talk about the future of video and audio

104
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,820
and what happens to Pulse Audio,

105
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,420
and all of that next week,

106
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,500
including a review of that crazy high-performance

107
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,020
Dell Precision 5530 laptop.

108
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,580
So we will have an episode for you next week,

109
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,860
but we just will not be live,

110
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,940
because I will be down at MeetBSD,

111
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,940
which is on October 19th and 20th of 2018 in Santa Clara,

112
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,100
at the Intel campus, Wes.

113
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,220
I'm gonna sneak around Intel

114
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,760
and see if I can find the next generation processors.

115
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,100
Make sure it has Linux support now.

116
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,860
That might help them with some of their production issues

117
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,380
too, you know, pretty clever.

118
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,220
That is generous.

119
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,340
Check their benchmarking process whilst you're there.

120
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,900
Yeah, and maybe walk out of there

121
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,620
with the next generation NUC too.

122
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,780
That'd be pretty good.

123
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,060
So yeah, I'll be at MeetBSD next week.

124
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,940
I don't know.

125
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,260
I realized that I'm probably walking into

126
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,460
a whole bunch of Linus jokes, you know?

127
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,100
They're all gonna be cracking about Linus

128
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,540
the whole time I'm down there.

129
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,060
Hey Chris, how's Linus?

130
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,900
You know?

131
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,120
You're gonna have to get a thick skin

132
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,380
just so you can, you know, maintain relations.

133
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,220
That's important.

134
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,060
You're our ambassador there, Chris.

135
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,980
I know, I know, I know.

136
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,980
I'll have to bring like chocolate or something.

137
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,940
I hear the BSD guys like chocolate.

138
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,700
Well, let's get into the community news.

139
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,220
Just a quick one off the top here.

140
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,140
Not only a happy birthday,

141
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,940
a happy 22nd birthday this week to KDE,

142
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,700
but also it seems they've received

143
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,740
a somewhat sizable donation from the Handshake Foundation,

144
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,860
a $300,000 US Greenback donation.

145
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,420
Handshake is pleased to be able to support

146
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,800
KDE's international community

147
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,400
of dedicated volunteers, they write.

148
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,240
That's great for them.

149
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,700
That is great for them.

150
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,500
And 22nd birthday too.

151
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,420
Just, I don't know, a lot of good news these days.

152
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,340
Caligra, by the way, the Caligra Office Week,

153
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,940
which is a great office suite,

154
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,060
is gonna get 100,000 of that.

155
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,780
I can't happen to notice that Gnome

156
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,100
got just a little bit more money from these guys.

157
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,340
I don't know what that's about.

158
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,860
You had to go there.

159
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,700
You had to go there.

160
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,620
I just had to.

161
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,100
Unbelievable, Wes.

162
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah, you're right though, huh?

163
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,840
They did.

164
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,420
But you know what?

165
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,980
Maybe that just means there's less work

166
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,180
that needs to be done on the Plasma side.

167
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,660
I'm trying. Let's go for that, yeah.

168
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,100
That seems plausible.

169
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,700
Yeah, that's awkward.

170
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,340
All right, well let's change gears

171
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,540
and talk about the brand new, fancy,

172
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,820
version five release of elementary OS Juno.

173
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,100
It's here, it's refined, and it's improved.

174
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,380
And Daniel and Cassidy from elementary OS are both here.

175
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,580
Guys, welcome back to the Unplugged program

176
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,660
and congratulations.

177
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,020
Thank you, thanks for having us.

178
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,340
Hey, thanks for having us on.

179
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,140
This seems like maybe one of the releases

180
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,180
you've worked the hardest on.

181
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,420
I don't know, maybe I've been following it a lot closer,

182
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,820
but it really seemed like this one was a lot of effort

183
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,800
and a lot of hustle.

184
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,920
Yeah, it's definitely a huge update.

185
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,980
And I also spent a lot of time actually

186
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,520
documenting everything that's changed,

187
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,700
so that also helps.

188
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,560
Yeah, the post Cassidy is,

189
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,820
it's almost like one of those

190
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,420
John Syracuse-style reviews that was created in-house.

191
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,820
I love it actually, it's really in-depth.

192
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,860
What system did you use?

193
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,340
Is this a text file to track all of this

194
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,980
or is there actually a system you used to track all this?

195
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,900
Yeah, I don't know, I mean, GitHub mostly,

196
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,860
like just following along.

197
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,420
Yeah, cause we use a milestone planning on GitHub,

198
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,700
so we can check each milestone along the way

199
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,180
and see what all issues and pull requests were submitted.

200
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,460
So that helped a lot.

201
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,460
Yeah, so I want to just ask you guys

202
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,860
both a couple of questions that have been kind of lingering

203
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,060
in the back of my mind

204
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,300
with the release of Juno on the way.

205
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,020
I think I wanted to start with

206
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,860
the developer side of the story.

207
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,620
So I think one of the things that you've gained

208
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,900
the most traction for recently is the App Center,

209
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,400
the pay what you want model has been interesting to watch.

210
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,020
There is some really good updates in Juno

211
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,300
where you can try the app before you buy it

212
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,540
and then be reminded to purchase it.

213
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,140
I think that's an interesting take

214
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,940
on that particular problem.

215
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,580
I don't know if this is a Dan or a Cassidy question,

216
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,100
but I'm curious what the back channel communication

217
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,260
is like between you and the developers

218
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,780
that are creating these apps.

219
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,460
And in addition to that, how much expectation you have

220
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,340
that they'll be updated for Juno now?

221
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,060
So there's a lot of developers that actually hang out

222
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,880
in our community Slack, which is super helpful.

223
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,220
So they've kind of formed their own community there.

224
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,800
And then it's easy for us to jump in

225
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,420
and talk to them really quickly that way.

226
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,040
We also have a Gitter channel that some people are using,

227
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,800
but we've used a GitHub issues a lot actually

228
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,160
during this release to give people information

229
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,600
and let them know like how they can update

230
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,860
their applications.

231
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,860
And as of release time out of the over 100 applications

232
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,560
that are available total, 75 of those

233
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,040
have been ported to Juno so far.

234
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Whoa, whoa, that is significantly more than I would expect.

235
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,960
That's awesome.

236
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,880
And that shows some excitement in the development community.

237
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,600
So it seems like there is some actual momentum there too.

238
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,680
That's great, congratulations guys.

239
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,200
I think the other thing, just thinking about things

240
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,660
that have really shifted since your last release,

241
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,820
because you guys are not really on the same release cadence

242
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,700
that anybody else is.

243
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,400
And so some significant things have shifted in the community

244
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,440
since your last release.

245
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,680
And I think maybe one of the more significant ones

246
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,320
for your projects and totally correct me if I'm wrong,

247
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,440
is the conversation around it's a Mac OS rip off,

248
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,840
it's a Mac OS clone.

249
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,320
And I think it has transitioned to,

250
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,760
it's an elegant, well-designed desktop,

251
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,480
and it's a workstation desktop.

252
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,200
And it's not just for new users,

253
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,680
but it can work really well for new users.

254
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,800
So that's, I think, and do you agree with that assessment?

255
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,880
Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot more new ones now.

256
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,720
There's a little more sense of purpose and place

257
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,640
within the great array of distros.

258
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,440
You still got your ankle biters who are still,

259
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,000
ah, it's a Mac rip off, who don't really pay any attention

260
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,680
and don't look into it.

261
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,440
But I think for the most part, the conversation has shifted.

262
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,760
My buddy from Coder Radio, Michael Dominic,

263
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,240
is moving over to using it

264
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,320
as his primary day-to-day development platform.

265
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,160
That's awesome.

266
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,400
Yeah, he finds it to be a nice, clean, elegant,

267
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,080
get out of his way, just work the way he wants.

268
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,360
And that's a pretty big shift of tone.

269
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,280
That's a big shadow for a project

270
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,280
to crawl out from underneath.

271
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,680
And I don't know if you completely agree with me,

272
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,600
but I'm curious if you guys have a sense

273
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,880
of what the next conversation is,

274
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,120
what the next statement is that the project needs to make.

275
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,920
Like, what's the next hurdle communication-wise,

276
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,040
community perception-wise that you see?

277
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,720
Hmm, yeah, I mean, I think focusing on privacy

278
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,240
is always a really big,

279
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,120
it's always been a big focus for us,

280
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,280
but we're paying more attention

281
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,040
to actually actively talking about it

282
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,920
and kind of making that be a bigger conversation

283
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,680
because as we see more cloud services,

284
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,320
as we see more, even desktop operating systems

285
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,560
be more invasive in your privacy,

286
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,280
like that's super important to us

287
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,440
that we don't do any of that.

288
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,560
So I think that's probably one of the biggest focuses

289
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,400
coming up.

290
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,680
Hmm, I'm curious too, along those lines,

291
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,120
is there cross-pollination work

292
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,480
with some of the stuff you've been doing,

293
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,400
System 76, that's gonna show up down the road too?

294
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,520
Like the installer?

295
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,400
Yeah, so I mean, the installer we helped,

296
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,560
we designed and helped develop the front end for,

297
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,760
and Pop!OS is currently shipping that,

298
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,200
and yeah, there's been this secure by default series,

299
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,720
I guess, of posts that I've written

300
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,400
and that we've been talking about,

301
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,320
and encryption by default is a big part of that,

302
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,760
and that's something that the installer lets us do.

303
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
We're not currently shipping it

304
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,800
because there's actually other pieces of the stack

305
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,240
we have to develop to be able to do that,

306
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,040
like initial setup.

307
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,600
We don't use GNOME initial setup

308
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,840
because it has a lot of GNOME dependencies.

309
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,960
So there's still some work that we have to do,

310
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,200
but yeah, getting secure and privacy by default

311
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,360
is a really big deal.

312
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,200
I like that.

313
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,040
I think that's really cool,

314
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,360
and I'd be a pretty happy camper

315
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,400
to see the home encryption land by default.

316
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,440
I gotta kind of be honest with you guys,

317
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,960
the installer, although it's a great installer,

318
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,920
a bunch of guys, don't get me wrong,

319
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,880
the installer does sort of feel a little out of place

320
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,460
on the desktop now because the rest of it is,

321
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,240
there's such a clear design language on the rest of it,

322
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,000
and the installer doesn't quite follow it,

323
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,960
and the style sheet, I don't know,

324
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,560
it doesn't quite look right to me on that installer.

325
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,880
And so I think that for the next release

326
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,920
would be a really nice piece to replace

327
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,240
if everything's ready.

328
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,120
Exactly, yeah, the current plan is

329
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,480
that could be a big feature for 5.1 hopefully,

330
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,040
so that's definitely a focus.

331
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,960
Now, I'll tell you something else while we're in this area

332
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,240
that would be, I think, helpful for adoption,

333
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
although I understand it's a really hard problem,

334
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,240
is something to make it a little more testable under VMs.

335
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,360
And I think it was good, like, when you guys sent out

336
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,080
an email to some of us to review it,

337
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,120
you said, by the way, it doesn't work perfectly in VMs,

338
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,320
there's some things that don't render quite right.

339
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,280
Why is that?

340
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,480
And is there any potential of one day fixing it

341
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,560
so that way people that just want to try it

342
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,800
on their machine under a VM can give it a go?

343
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,040
Yeah, so the thing with that is a lot more

344
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,880
of kind of the underlying stack.

345
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,960
The desktop environment does require

346
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,920
some hardware acceleration for animations

347
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,760
and things like that.

348
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,680
And it looks great too.

349
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,600
Yeah, the way that GTK handles the fallback

350
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,920
when animations are disabled can sometimes mean

351
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,360
that you have extra spaces where things are supposed

352
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,640
to be slide out revealed and things like that.

353
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,000
So that might be fixed in the future stack

354
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,240
with upcoming technologies like Vulkan, Wayland, GTK4.

355
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,640
Who knows, that might be improved on that place.

356
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,120
But for us, I think a lot of those issues

357
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,280
are more in the underlying technology.

358
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,600
Yeah, I thought that might be the case.

359
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,600
If I may, you'll remember that Ubuntu

360
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,560
is now collecting hardware metrics

361
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,800
for people that want to share that information.

362
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,240
And we've learned that there is a large proportion

363
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,120
of users installing the Ubuntu desktop on virtual machines.

364
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,400
And I know that Will Cook has a vested interest

365
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,040
in improving that experience and working upstream

366
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,520
to land the necessary performance improvements

367
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,120
and fixes to make the VM experience just generally better.

368
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,240
So I think that's something that will improve in time.

369
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,440
Yeah, that would be awesome.

370
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,280
I know it might also be more obvious in elementary OS

371
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,800
because we use a lot of animation and a lot of GTK revealers

372
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,160
which are those little animated things

373
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,840
that kind of collapse down or expand open.

374
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,480
So it might just be more obvious in elementary OS

375
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
than other desktops because of the types of widgets

376
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,320
that we use.

377
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,760
But yeah, getting all those fixes upstream,

378
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,600
that would be great.

379
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,440
Thanks, Wimpy.

380
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,080
Yeah, it would be as nice for me to be able to do test drives

381
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,040
but I do totally understand that there's a certain experience

382
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,840
you're trying to achieve on a modern desktop.

383
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,120
A lot of desktops just don't perform their best under VM.

384
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,240
So that's not an unusual thing either.

385
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,160
There's a few others that I always like to catch up

386
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,120
on you guys with.

387
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,800
Also requested by my co-host, Michael Dominic,

388
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,200
was he was hoping for the elevator pitch

389
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,480
on why somebody looking to target elementary OS

390
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,160
should bother learning Vala.

391
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,560
Yeah, it's really about,

392
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,000
and we actually gave a talk about this recently

393
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,040
at the Libre application summit.

394
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,440
It's really about having the one true developer path of,

395
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,400
Vala was created by Gnome for GTK and G-stack development.

396
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,040
And so that's what we use and it works really well for that

397
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,040
using, it's tailor-made for our stack.

398
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,440
And really it's less important about which exact language

399
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,000
we choose.

400
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,160
It's more about the fact that we have a specific language

401
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,880
that we recommend people to use.

402
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,280
It's also just a really great, easy to understand language.

403
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
It's pretty simple to read.

404
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,760
It's, if you've come from other languages like C-sharp,

405
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,800
it's, or Java even, it's really similar.

406
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,800
So it's more about the ecosystem of development around that.

407
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,800
So there's the documentation,

408
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,720
there's the community of other developers

409
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,760
who are writing open source code using that one language.

410
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,080
It just makes this whole big development ecosystem

411
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,960
a lot better.

412
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,240
That makes perfect sense.

413
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,200
I always liked that answer.

414
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,560
I think that's really a solid reason.

415
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,960
And we see it on other platforms that are doing well,

416
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,360
right, they do that.

417
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,720
Now, Cassidy, this is the first release,

418
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,840
the first major release since you've been a full-time

419
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,280
employee, how's that working out for you so far?

420
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,200
It's so great.

421
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,040
Is it?

422
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,880
It's so good.

423
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,720
Yeah, I love it.

424
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,560
Good, I'm glad to hear that.

425
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,600
It's so cool.

426
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,880
Yeah, I've been able to spend a lot of time

427
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,440
doing a lot of the stuff I really love,

428
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,280
like both development and design work,

429
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,120
but also things like writing a 7,000 word release post

430
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,520
about it and taking all the really great screenshots

431
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,360
and stuff.

432
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,600
So it's been a really great deal.

433
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,360
I think too, it's worth mentioning,

434
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,880
because you guys don't get a lot of credit for this,

435
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,280
that what appears to be a pretty polished set of,

436
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,840
I mean polished is not even doing it justice,

437
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,840
an extensive encyclopedic set of release notes.

438
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,120
Honestly, if I was a super fan of this OS

439
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,880
and I had been waiting and waiting and watching

440
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,640
the countdown, to be able to read through this

441
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,920
would be very rewarding.

442
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,520
And it's, of course, like everything you guys do,

443
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,920
it itself is well laid out and well formatted

444
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,760
with great visuals, the prettiest screenshots

445
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,000
on the internet.

446
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,160
And I like the way you do this because it allows the reader

447
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,040
to just appreciate and examine that element of the UI.

448
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,880
And this also extends into the press kit

449
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,960
that they send out to some folks that sign up for it.

450
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:12,640
And in there is also like a resource of screenshots

451
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,040
where they'll zoom in on a particular element of the UI.

452
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,480
So you can sit there and really kind of appreciate

453
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,240
how well it's thought out.

454
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,880
Because when you see it on your screen with three or four

455
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,520
other windows and the toolbar and the dock,

456
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,440
it's sort of just one of the many details.

457
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,800
But when you take these applications

458
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,600
that are on elementary OS and you isolate components

459
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,920
of their interface, you can appreciate really

460
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,240
how well designed there are.

461
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,600
And this press kit is just really, really well done

462
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,880
with cautions about the VM and other explanations in there

463
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,080
about the features.

464
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,600
And so from end to end, this has felt

465
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,920
like one of the most professional releases

466
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,200
of a software product, not of a Linux distribution,

467
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,560
not of an open source project, but of a software product.

468
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,200
And I think you guys have nailed it

469
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,640
at a level of professionalism that is up.

470
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,720
It's rare for the industry in general.

471
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,800
So my hat's off on the back end organization and effort

472
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,160
for the Juno release.

473
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,480
It's exceptional.

474
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,360
Thank you so much.

475
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,880
Yeah, that's awesome to hear.

476
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,160
Well, guys, just to make everything easy in our show

477
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
notes, we've direct linked to the ISOs.

478
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,400
So that way, people can just bypass the website all together.

479
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,720
Just kidding, of course.

480
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,320
I saw your tweet to DistroWatch this morning,

481
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,680
and I thought, oh, what are they doing?

482
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,480
What are they doing?

483
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,640
Of course, elementary OS is a crowdfunded effort.

484
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,400
And there's multiple ways you can do that.

485
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,600
And one of the options is to kick them a few bucks

486
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,240
when you go download the ISO.

487
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,160
And even if it's just something you try out,

488
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,960
I think it's worth kicking them a few bucks

489
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,400
because they're doing something nobody else is doing,

490
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,840
and they're doing it really well.

491
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,280
That's a new standard, I think.

492
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,440
Yeah, on a lot of fronts, on how you communicate

493
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,800
with developers, on how they should build tools,

494
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,600
on how to distribute applications

495
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,720
for your platform, how they can monetize those applications.

496
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,200
They're literally one of the few app centers or app stores

497
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,880
in the entire market that has figured out a way to do demos.

498
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,640
I don't know why Apple and Google and Microsoft

499
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,880
haven't been able to figure out this system, but somehow,

500
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,360
these guys over at elementary OS figured it out.

501
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,040
Plus, the whole thing is exceptionally well-designed,

502
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,880
and they've been doing this for a while now.

503
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,760
So this is multiple releases in, and it deserves that 5.0.

504
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,480
It really does.

505
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,520
I think it deserves that 5.0 number.

506
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,320
And I just think it's a great release.

507
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,520
So even if you don't stick with it,

508
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,240
I think it's worth kicking them a few bucks.

509
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,960
So go check it out.

510
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,240
We will have links to the website and the announcement

511
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,040
in the show notes.

512
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,360
Congratulations, guys.

513
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:34,920
Good release.

514
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,440
Thank you.

515
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,400
I hope you guys get some rest.

516
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,760
And as long as you get all the bugs fixed,

517
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,000
the people report right away.

518
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,760
Hey, and if you want to go get more Dan

519
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,760
and maybe understand the hype around the Plasma desktop

520
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,200
or hear Dan's thoughts on it, which, again, was another.

521
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,160
I thought that was really well done, too.

522
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,360
Dan did an analysis of some of the UI quirks of Plasma

523
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,440
that bother him.

524
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,760
And Popi offered a really solid rebuttal to a lot of it.

525
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,880
And the conversation, I thought, was great,

526
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,600
especially as a Plasma user.

527
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,240
And it was in user error 50.

528
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,400
You can check it out at error.show slash 50.

529
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,720
That's error, not air.

530
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,480
Error.show slash 50, where they break down all the Plasma hype,

531
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,160
as well as a few great hashtag ask air questions

532
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,960
and some heavy topics.

533
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,000
Oh, yeah, it's a wild episode, that one, but great.

534
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,680
That's good.

535
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,200
I got an email into the show from listener Alan with an E.

536
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,160
He says, love the show.

537
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
It's now my number one go-to for all the Linux things.

538
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,560
I have a question that I'm hoping you can answer for me.

539
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,600
I'm fairly new to the Linux community.

540
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,640
And recently, I saw a website that's

541
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,360
come out saying that Flatpak is a security risk

542
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,840
and shouldn't be used.

543
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,160
I've heard it referenced on your show a few times,

544
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,280
and it seems like it's a way to install software.

545
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,120
I was wondering if you could alleviate some confusion,

546
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,280
or should I discontinue the use of Flatpaks?

547
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,640
Is this an internet hoax or a security risk?

548
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,520
Alan.

549
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,240
That's honestly a pretty good question.

550
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,760
There's been a lot of things up in the air,

551
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,120
and if you don't really understand the technology,

552
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,320
if you're not using it, or you haven't looked at the source

553
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,000
code behind it, how could you know?

554
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,800
Yeah, a website recently came out, flatkill.org,

555
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,000
where it went after Flatpaks for inadequate sandboxing

556
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,840
practices and shipping out-of-date libraries.

557
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,800
The author, which is a really common mistake,

558
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,000
though, attributed these flaws to Flatpaks themselves.

559
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,320
Instead of how the developers have packaged them,

560
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,440
as if this developer, or as if this author of the blog post

561
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,480
was unaware that this is how maybe potentially hundreds

562
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,080
of thousands of Docker images ship,

563
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,720
this is how some packages are in the Debian repo right now.

564
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,920
This is not a new problem to software.

565
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,380
This has been a problem with software for a long time,

566
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,820
and this is, I believe, made worse

567
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,520
when you have volunteers packaging the software instead

568
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,280
of the developers directly packaging it themselves.

569
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,960
So Flatkill takes off, goes all over the typical places,

570
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,800
and I just saw people shitting on the Flatpak concept

571
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,220
and on SNAP packages.

572
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,940
And I can't believe on October 16 of 2008,

573
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,640
we have to have a minute where Chris explains the reason we

574
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,600
need universal packaging.

575
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,000
I can't believe that people still don't get this.

576
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,080
And I think it's because everybody is so self-obsessed

577
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,400
that they can't figure that there could be problems out

578
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,160
there that they've never witnessed.

579
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,040
And they have no ability to empathize with anybody else

580
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,120
on the internet, it appears.

581
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,980
I mean, I'm just projecting a bit here,

582
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,360
but it seems to be the case.

583
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,340
Experience holds up.

584
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,720
Besides sandboxing, which is a nice aspect,

585
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,920
if you configure it correctly, of Flatpaks, or isolation,

586
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,880
whatever you want to call it, even if you just look at that,

587
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,000
that itself is a nice improvement.

588
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,600
But creating an API system, creating a portal system

589
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,480
for Wayland, that way you can get access

590
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,400
in Wayland environments where everything is sandboxed,

591
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,840
that way you can get access to hardware and devices.

592
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,280
This is all necessary.

593
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,320
And you can't just say because you have a sandbox,

594
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,360
then you have 100% security anyways.

595
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,000
Security is a multi-layered thing.

596
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,920
You don't just put locks on your doors,

597
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,880
you also put locks on your windows, right?

598
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,720
Because security is many things, and sandboxing is a component.

599
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,160
And if one of those many things is bogus,

600
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,280
that doesn't mean the entire thing is bogus,

601
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,000
especially if it's not an implementation,

602
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,360
or especially if it is an implementation detail,

603
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,160
and it's not like a core fundamental flaw with Flatpaks.

604
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,200
But let's talk about Flatpaks and the specific desktop app

605
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,040
problem space.

606
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,040
Because really, I think when we think about this,

607
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,200
we think about the servers.

608
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,160
But the security position on the desktop to begin with

609
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,480
is horrible.

610
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,080
Anything in your session basically

611
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,760
has complete access to everything

612
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,800
belonging to your user.

613
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,640
Think about the way an X11 system traditionally works.

614
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,000
Even with these limitations on a traditional Linux desktop,

615
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,400
Flatpaks still brings security, like default sandboxing,

616
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,680
IPC filtering.

617
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,840
A new file system too, don't forget that process,

618
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,560
and UID namespacing, sitcom filtering,

619
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,960
and an immutable user and app directory.

620
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,480
I think it's also worth highlighting

621
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,880
some of the other reasons why Flatpak exists at all

622
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,200
to begin with, or why other universal packaging formats

623
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,240
do.

624
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,480
It allows apps to become agnostic

625
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,280
of their underlying distribution.

626
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,520
So you can have something that maybe

627
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,240
has dependencies on GTK2.

628
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,920
And you don't have to have GTK2 installed system-wide

629
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,200
to run that.

630
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,760
Don't worry that suddenly you won't be able to update anymore

631
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,040
because you broke your package manager.

632
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,000
That's right.

633
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,480
Also, you're separating the release update cadence

634
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,560
of the distribution from the application.

635
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,160
This is a point that we heard from Frank of OwnCloud

636
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,600
and now NextCloud over and over again,

637
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,160
that old, vulnerable versions of their PHP-based application

638
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,640
were still being shipped in the distro repositories

639
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,680
while they had brand new ones available for download

640
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,400
off their website.

641
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,880
The issue is the distribution doesn't

642
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,680
update the repos as often as NextCloud updates.

643
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,840
But if they're shipping them as a universal application,

644
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,320
like a snap, they can update the snap when they want.

645
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,840
It also disintermediates the app developers from the users

646
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,400
when you have it that way.

647
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,000
When you have the distribution in control of the software,

648
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,920
then the developer really is disconnected completely

649
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,440
from the end user.

650
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,280
The developer doesn't really have any idea

651
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,240
of how many installs under Linux they are.

652
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,840
We've heard this from LibreOffice.

653
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,760
They say, yeah, we have a few numbers from our website

654
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,040
and a few mirrors.

655
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,080
But if users install LibreOffice from the distros,

656
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,200
we really don't have any idea of how many installs

657
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,520
we have out there on Linux.

658
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,920
So we don't know where to weigh it, necessarily,

659
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,240
because not all of it checks in.

660
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,520
Not all of it is being pulled from our servers.

661
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,640
And it decentralizes the distribution of applications.

662
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,720
If you can distribute something like Plex server as a snap,

663
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,880
it is not an Ubuntu-specific thing that has now happened.

664
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,680
Last week, Plex announced that the Plex server is now

665
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,920
available as a snap.

666
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,560
It's in the beta channel right now.

667
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,960
It's a beta version of Plex server.

668
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,840
And you can install it from a snap

669
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,240
and have Plex installed and ready to go.

670
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,080
That's incredible.

671
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,040
And it's not an Ubuntu-specific thing.

672
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,640
Canonical did the legwork with the relationship

673
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,880
to help them make that happen.

674
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,040
And in the past, before this kind of thing,

675
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,960
it would have been an Ubuntu-only technology.

676
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,520
It would have been a PPA or a DEB.

677
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,240
The people would have had to have guides

678
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,720
to get working on Arch and get working on Fedora.

679
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,920
And now it is a frickin' snap.

680
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,240
It's not an Ubuntu repo.

681
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,440
And the same thing is true with Flatpaks and App Images.

682
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,480
It's not like Flatpaks are perfect,

683
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,600
but they solve problems.

684
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,000
Same with snaps, same with App Images.

685
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,360
And the crap on the concept is to pretend

686
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,440
like the existing way to distribute software on Linux

687
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,280
has been sufficient.

688
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,080
It has not been.

689
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,080
We wouldn't be having this conversation if it had been.

690
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,640
And it's anti-intellectual to blame the core technology

691
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,600
for the developers' bad actions.

692
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,960
I think it's frustrating with the tone, too, right?

693
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,520
Because as you just said, Flatpak

694
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,480
isn't perfect, but it's a progression.

695
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,400
We're trying to get better.

696
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,280
We're trying to have more options for sandboxing,

697
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,240
for understanding what resources an application might need

698
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,080
and it should be allowed to have on your computer.

699
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,640
And yes, you can do that poorly.

700
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,360
You can not implement sandboxing.

701
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,920
You can leave things too open,

702
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,160
and we should be aware of that.

703
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,000
We should be aware that, yes,

704
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,440
when you do ship all your dependencies bundled together,

705
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,560
sometimes they don't get updated.

706
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,360
But that's already a problem in these platforms,

707
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,880
and we should talk about it,

708
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,480
but we don't need to throw the whole thing out.

709
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,840
How many Windows systems have old DLLs that get sprayed

710
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,480
onto their hard drive when you run the install wizard?

711
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,520
Or all Macs ever.

712
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,320
DMG files that probably ship with old libraries in them.

713
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,640
I'm curious what Popey thinks, though,

714
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,320
about my wild assertion that this is going to be

715
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,360
more of a problem whenever you have volunteer-curated

716
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,560
Flatpaks or Snaps, and that it really kind of relies

717
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,680
on the software shop to integrate the packaging

718
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,280
into their production pipeline.

719
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,840
Well, first of all, I'd say it's really unfortunate

720
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,160
that the person who had issues with Flatpak

721
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,720
decided to create a website and an ill-informed bit of copy

722
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,160
on a webpage and try and brand it as some security nightmare.

723
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,080
I think that's really not the way to go.

724
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,040
If you want, you can engage with the developers

725
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,000
and talk to them about the issues you have.

726
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,240
Supply code is the absolutely best way to go,

727
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,200
but otherwise, supply bugs or test cases

728
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,440
to prove the things you're trying to illustrate are wrong.

729
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,840
But I think the way they went about it

730
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,240
was just completely wrong.

731
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,080
And it really stirred up the whole sentiment

732
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
against some of these package systems

733
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,240
which are trying to solve problems.

734
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,080
I agree.

735
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,920
As you say, all of them are trying to solve

736
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,160
similar problems in different ways,

737
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,080
and this just wasn't really helpful at all.

738
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,760
100% agree with you.

739
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
You nailed it.

740
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,200
Now, my question, though, is do you think that,

741
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,960
I mean, the one fundamental truth that we could find in here

742
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,960
is developers may lackadaisically configure

743
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,680
their sandbox requirement,

744
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,320
and GNOME software could do a better job

745
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,920
of alerting users of weak sandboxes.

746
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,600
I installed a snap today via Discover on the latest Plasma,

747
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,080
and I actually got a warning that it was an unconfined snap,

748
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,960
and it asked me if I was okay continuing.

749
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,440
See, that's slick, yeah.

750
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,280
You should be asked.

751
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,640
That's how it should work.

752
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,480
Right.

753
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,000
So there's some obvious areas for improvement,

754
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,080
or not packaging really old libraries or failing

755
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,680
to update them, which seems like that is a volunteer issue.

756
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,200
There's a lot of things that need to catch up.

757
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,400
It's, you know, the guys who are working on Flat Hub

758
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,240
and AppImage and SnapD and all these other technologies,

759
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,360
there's a whole lot of legacy that they're trying

760
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,800
to drag through into the 21st century,

761
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,280
and some of that is some of the software stores

762
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,920
don't understand the concept of confinement,

763
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,680
and so they need to know how to present to the user

764
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,200
and make it possible for the user to make those decisions,

765
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,080
like whether that's in badges or little verified ticks

766
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,680
or however that's represented to the user

767
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,840
so the user can make an informed decision

768
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,800
exactly the same way as you do on your mobile phone.

769
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,320
You go into the Android store, you start looking at reviews,

770
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,480
you look at how many downloads this thing has.

771
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,840
Does it look like it's come from a reputable developer,

772
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,520
or is this like Mr. Joe Smith in, you know,

773
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,560
some random country in Middle Asia?

774
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,600
Like, you need to empower users with the ability

775
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,720
to make decisions to control their own computer

776
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,240
and control what software they put on their computer,

777
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,800
and that's what we're trying to do.

778
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,280
We're trying to make it easier for users

779
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,280
to make those decisions, and sometimes,

780
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
we're not quite there.

781
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,920
Things like GNOME software doesn't quite present

782
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,520
the information we'd like, which is why

783
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,840
we had a design sprint a few weeks ago,

784
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,880
and our designers are working with the upstream

785
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,920
GNOME software developers to improve that situation,

786
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,160
so it's all, it's in progress, but it's not,

787
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,520
we just haven't arrived at that final destination,

788
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,360
and I'm not sure we will anytime soon.

789
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,560
It's a rocky road, and we're all on it,

790
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,640
and we're all on it together.

791
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,880
There's no point us fighting.

792
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,760
That's why this flatkill.org, or whatever it was,

793
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,680
was not helpful, because it is in progress,

794
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,560
and it really is, it is sort of a shame,

795
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,680
because the issue, the reason why I'm sensitive to it,

796
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,880
and the reason why I say it's a bit of a shame

797
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,760
is because I've heard a lot over the years

798
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,480
via different methods of feedback

799
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,560
over the different shows that distributing applications

800
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,800
on Linux is a daunting of enough challenge

801
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,880
that a lot of developers look at it and go,

802
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,880
meh, nah, not worth it.

803
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,040
We talk about that all the time.

804
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,240
People driven away are just scared

805
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,880
to even figure out what's happening.

806
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,040
I mean, think about that.

807
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,560
That's where they stop.

808
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,800
I can't even figure out how to properly distribute

809
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,720
downloads from my website in a way

810
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,240
that's guaranteed to work across most of the distributions.

811
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,200
I can give you a use case.

812
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,880
A while ago, we were approached by a software developer,

813
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,840
and they had an application that worked on Windows,

814
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,200
worked on Mac, and they got a prototype working on Linux,

815
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,800
but they didn't know how to distribute it,

816
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,680
and we worked through building a SNAP,

817
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,360
but yeah, they could have chosen any technology.

818
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
They just happened to have chosen SNAP,

819
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,080
and we worked with them to get that in the store,

820
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,720
and they had to really sell it to their senior management,

821
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,800
because their senior management was not convinced

822
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,640
that Linux users would pay for software

823
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,800
or would pay for their subscription service,

824
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,080
and they weren't sure that it was worth the time

825
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,240
to invest to port the application.

826
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,560
I mean, it didn't need porting,

827
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,600
because it's all Python and Qt,

828
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,920
and really, it was easy to port.

829
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,320
It was just do we want to support it on Linux,

830
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,040
and it turns out they get better technical reports,

831
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,000
bug reports from Linux users.

832
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,560
They get better feedback from Linux users

833
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,800
and better engagement from Linux users,

834
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,240
and yes, those people do turn into subscribers,

835
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,000
so they are making money out of customers

836
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,500
who are running Linux, so it does work.

837
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,800
It can work, and we can help make it easy

838
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,220
for developers who are building software

839
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,400
to bring their software to Linux users.

840
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,520
It's not perfect, but we're certainly getting there.

841
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,760
I hope so, and it feels like we've made a ton of progress

842
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,740
in that direction, and it's a huge deal

843
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,160
to have Plex server available as a SNAP.

844
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,160
That's one of those things that has, I think,

845
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,600
converted a few folks to Linux,

846
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,880
like, all right, I'll set up a Linux rig in my garage

847
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,480
or in my office, and I'll try to get it.

848
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,880
Yeah, that's one of the first things people want to do,

849
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,560
but it's kind of been a pain to get going before.

850
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,160
Yeah, I mean, if you're not really familiar

851
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,480
with Linux at all, it's sort of daunting.

852
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,200
Now it's a SNAP command.

853
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,360
It's pretty cool.

854
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,520
I was pontificating with Wes earlier today

855
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,240
that I really feel like we're at a point

856
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,440
where for a lot of us that have been using Linux

857
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,840
a long time professionally, there,

858
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,120
and obviously this is broad strokes,

859
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,440
but for me, I've landed on a spot

860
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,080
where I feel like there's two desktops

861
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,520
that are right for a lot of us,

862
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,560
and I know a lot of people are gonna disagree with me

863
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,960
on this, but just go with me.

864
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,640
I think one of our greatest desktops,

865
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,120
surprise, surprise, is Plasma.

866
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,120
If you are willing to invest some time into setting it up,

867
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,500
I think it's a really great utility workstation.

868
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,640
It's a workhorse system.

869
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,480
It's kind of that classic Linux application style

870
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,560
where it has all the right technical fundamentals.

871
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,640
It's a powerhouse, but you gotta get to know it

872
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,480
and you gotta put in the time.

873
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,520
And you still find, you could be using it

874
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,800
a couple of months in and still find new features,

875
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,000
and you're like, oh man, I've been waiting

876
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,860
for computers to do that.

877
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,600
That's great, I didn't even know that was there.

878
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,080
I'm surprised I couldn't find that before.

879
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,240
Like, it's not maybe surfaced super well.

880
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,200
And then, and I'm not just saying that

881
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,240
because they're here, I think on the other end,

882
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,160
you have elementary OS, which is more of a complete,

883
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,960
cohesive package.

884
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,380
Where Plasma is a workstation desktop interface

885
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,780
that you can put on any distribution,

886
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,240
elementary OS is really best as a whole.

887
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,220
And you're really not changing and tweaking your themes.

888
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,880
You could, like, so in code, you could change it

889
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,540
from a light theme to a dark theme.

890
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,800
Like, there's a few areas where you can customize,

891
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,800
but it really is a very well thought out,

892
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,120
refined, out of the box experience

893
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,000
that's not really meant to be heavily modified.

894
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,840
That's what's good about it.

895
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,560
It's meant to just get down to work.

896
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,240
And you have these two really,

897
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,880
these two on the really, I think,

898
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,680
far spectrums of each other.

899
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,040
And in there, ironically, as maybe the most popular

900
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,480
desktop environment, is Gnome Shell.

901
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,920
As time goes on, Gnome Shell has improved,

902
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,080
especially in the last year or so.

903
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,360
It seems like it's gotten a lot better,

904
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,840
but things still need to get fixed up.

905
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,440
And one of the big changes that I think

906
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,120
will be really hard for users to process

907
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,120
is the eventual removal of the GTK theme support.

908
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,640
That seems to be the direction we're going in,

909
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,960
and there's a lot of really good reasons for it.

910
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,320
As a lot of people, like Joey at OMG Ubuntu, are putting it,

911
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,920
GTK 3 themes don't actually exist.

912
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,640
It is an irony, really, because there are so many

913
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,520
beautiful Gnome Shell themes.

914
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,440
The new 18.10 theme is great.

915
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,920
Yaru, and it's really nice.

916
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,480
It almost works, it's so, it's close,

917
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,320
and clever people have managed to hack this together

918
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,440
so that you get something that largely works,

919
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,240
but that doesn't mean it's how it should be.

920
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,640
So this, the way it actually kind of comes down,

921
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,360
and this is from Tobias Bernard,

922
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,600
who's written a well-reasoned article over on his blog,

923
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,360
writes that essentially what it comes down to

924
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,280
is GTK themes are exploiting a flaw rather than standards.

925
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,760
There's no API.

926
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,920
And here's a quote.

927
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,840
There is no clearly defined theming API.

928
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,040
There are CSS style sheets,

929
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,680
but they were only ever meant to be used

930
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,160
by the platform and app developers.

931
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,600
The platform style sheet is called Edwadia,

932
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,920
and that is for a reason, which Yaur is,

933
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,560
or how do you pronounce it, Yaru?

934
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,760
Yaru, whatever the Ubuntu 18.10 theme is,

935
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,200
is based off of Edwadia.

936
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,680
But essentially, themes are a hack.

937
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,160
They're kind of an attempt

938
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,480
to graft on a new look on top of Gnome 3.

939
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,520
And there is inconsistency throughout.

940
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,720
It's sort of like papering over cracks, really.

941
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,680
And then when you launch things like Electron apps

942
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,520
or Firefox, you see little areas

943
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,080
where it's not quite perfect.

944
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,600
There's no really best standards to adhere to.

945
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,520
App developers have no idea

946
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,480
what theme is being smashed onto their app,

947
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,240
so they can't plan for that.

948
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,360
And app developers then have to fix the bugs

949
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,400
that only appear in those custom themes.

950
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,240
So then they get the bug reports.

951
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,040
And then the theme devs have to patch around bugs

952
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,640
and app updates when they find them,

953
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,000
which probably is pretty hit and miss.

954
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,600
It's actually pretty busted right now.

955
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,840
And a lot of, well, I mean, all of the themes really

956
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,880
that you see out there in Gnome 3 land

957
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,200
are all based off of other themes,

958
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,680
because the hard work is actually getting it to work.

959
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,480
You gotta go in and raw dog hack the CSS of the Gnome shell.

960
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,280
Which are used by other things.

961
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,760
That's a huge API, very easy to cause conflicts.

962
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,040
I'm just, I'm really dying to ask Cassidy or Daniel about this,

963
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,200
because to me, this is a problem

964
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,160
that doesn't exist on elementary OS.

965
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,640
And it's a problem that desktops like Plasma plan for,

966
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,320
and they do have a system and support for it baked in.

967
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,520
And then on the other end of the spectrum,

968
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,880
you have elementary OS that just really sort of opted

969
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,920
to just come up with your own look.

970
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,080
And as a result of that, developers know what to expect,

971
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,800
and there is a consistent look.

972
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,440
But it did strike me that, boy, it'd be nice

973
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,840
if I could have a system-wide dark mode on elementary OS.

974
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,040
I had an itch to tweak a few things.

975
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,520
I think because I'm a long-time Linux user,

976
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
that just is what I come to expect.

977
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,880
Elementary OS is, in a sense,

978
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,120
making some hard design decisions for the user

979
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,320
that Plasma would let me fiddle with all day.

980
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,280
Yeah, I think I agree completely with Tobias' stance here.

981
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,240
And just the fact that we don't put any style sheet settings

982
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,680
up there, and we make sure that all of our developers

983
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,640
are publishing their screenshots

984
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,000
using the system style sheet and configuration,

985
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,040
does a couple things.

986
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,600
And one, it empowers them to do custom styling

987
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,200
that doesn't look non-native or doesn't break.

988
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,040
Some of the most popular apps in the store

989
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,720
have done really, really interesting things with GTK CSS

990
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,080
that they would never be able to do

991
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,200
if they had to assume that their application

992
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,600
can be styled any which way.

993
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,520
Yeah, the buttons may be somewhere

994
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,480
you completely don't expect or may not light up

995
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,920
the way you expect or have a text color you expect.

996
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,120
Yeah, so they've been able to do a lot of interesting things

997
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,920
with their own visual style and branding,

998
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,400
which makes these apps feel really refined and cool.

999
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,880
But it also helps when you go into App Center

1000
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,320
and you're looking at screenshots of all the applications,

1001
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,160
what you see is what you get.

1002
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,360
It's never going to be some random style sheet

1003
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,360
pictured in the screenshots, and then when you download it,

1004
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,000
the app doesn't look like that.

1005
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,480
You always get what you pay for.

1006
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,360
I hadn't even thought about that.

1007
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,040
I hadn't even thought about that you could be looking at an app

1008
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,560
that has a totally, like in my case,

1009
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,120
it would undoubtedly have a light theme,

1010
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,560
and then I would install it on my box

1011
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,640
and launch it as a dark theme.

1012
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,680
It immediately is different than the picture.

1013
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,480
That's not something that weirds me out,

1014
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,120
but I could see it weirding out some folks

1015
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,760
or not meeting expectations.

1016
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,360
Well, especially when you've paid money for an application

1017
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,800
and then you download it and there's

1018
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,200
some great broken visual thing with it,

1019
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,520
then you feel like this is supposed

1020
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,480
to be a quality product that I paid the developer to get this

1021
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,120
and it's broken out of the box.

1022
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,760
Wimby, can I ask you about Mate?

1023
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,760
Are themes implemented differently

1024
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,200
on that era of the Mate desktop?

1025
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,200
How does that work over there, or is it an ugly hack, too?

1026
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,080
No, it's not an ugly hack.

1027
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,800
It's taking advantage of the facilities that

1028
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,800
exist in GTK 3 in order to use style classes to style widgets.

1029
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,240
Which is how it is done on Qt, too, essentially.

1030
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,320
Which is much the same way that the elementary folks

1031
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:50,400
do things, although they prescribe a style sheet that

1032
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,280
is part and parcel of the API of designing

1033
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,800
your elementary application.

1034
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,680
So in elementary, you get this prescribed,

1035
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,480
consistent user experience.

1036
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,760
And in Mate, because we appeal to an audience that

1037
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,920
are used to having multiple themes and the ability

1038
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,280
to customize things to their heart's content,

1039
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,840
we have multiple themes that implement style classes

1040
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,880
in different ways to change the look and feel of the desktop.

1041
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,800
So the issue here is specifically what with GNOME?

1042
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,640
In the write-up, I noticed particular focus

1043
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,440
on client-side decorations, and the header bars

1044
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,120
seem to be a major source of issue.

1045
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,320
So is it these shell-side things that is really the problem?

1046
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,600
It's not the actual GTK 3 applications?

1047
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,840
Maybe Dan and Cassidy can answer this better,

1048
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,040
but I suspect that GNOME are running

1049
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,640
into a position that elementary solved long ago, which

1050
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,320
is Adwaita on GNOME is part of the API of the GNOME shell

1051
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,560
and the GNOME desktop experience.

1052
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,440
But people using GNOME are still in the mindset

1053
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,240
that this is a configurable, dynamically themeable thing.

1054
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,720
Yeah, I think the hard part, especially for GNOME,

1055
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,160
is that there is no GNOME OS.

1056
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,560
So the most popular shipped GNOME desktop

1057
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,320
is Ubuntu right now, right?

1058
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,000
So it's not even shipping their intended visual style.

1059
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,280
So when people are writing applications against GNOME,

1060
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,400
they're not even really writing against Adwaita.

1061
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,940
Yeah, it's interesting that that's the case now,

1062
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,840
and now this conversation is relevant.

1063
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,320
I think that's interesting.

1064
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,320
I wonder if this conversation would be coming up

1065
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,560
if it was Fedora that was shipping

1066
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,440
as the largest GNOME desktop.

1067
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,720
As Dan says, people are targeting effectively Ubuntu.

1068
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,960
Predominantly, they're not targeting GTK or Qt at all.

1069
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,080
Predominantly, they're using Electron.

1070
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,160
The significant number of developers out there

1071
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,280
are not writing GTK or Qt applications.

1072
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,040
Electron uses a little GTK in there, I think, just a bit.

1073
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,160
A tiny, tiny little bit.

1074
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,240
No, Electron developer knows that.

1075
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,000
No.

1076
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,580
That's just an implementation detail.

1077
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,320
No reason to concern yourself.

1078
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,380
Well, that's fair, but I think we've experienced issues

1079
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:14,120
where Chromium and Chrome, when you maximized it,

1080
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,120
didn't have window controls for months.

1081
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,240
And they shipped it like that because they only tested

1082
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,920
against Ubuntu, and it worked in Ubuntu.

1083
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,900
And that was how it worked in Ubuntu, and that was great.

1084
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,880
And then on other desktops, it didn't work.

1085
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,640
So I think even if they're not writing in GTK,

1086
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,680
they're still testing against Ubuntu.

1087
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,960
I'm curious to know how the world goes on if we

1088
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,960
do go to a one-theme world.

1089
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,160
I mean, we essentially are now, but nobody follows it.

1090
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,240
So I don't know what they could do to make it a one-theme world.

1091
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,080
But that seems to be the direction of the conversation

1092
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,640
is make it Adwadia, and then everybody

1093
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,760
knows what they're getting.

1094
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,920
Is this a one-theme world for all of Linux

1095
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,880
or a one-theme world for GNOME?

1096
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,560
Yeah, right, exactly, for GNOME.

1097
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,560
Well, for Fedora, basically.

1098
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,560
Well, that's just it.

1099
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,500
It seems to me that Sam Hewitt made a blog post about this

1100
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,400
a while ago about how GNOME needs

1101
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,960
to make a theming API rather than just screw everybody,

1102
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,880
we're doing it this way.

1103
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,000
The problem is that we had something like that with GTK2,

1104
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,400
and it turned out that it was really restrictive.

1105
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,520
And now we have this great API that's

1106
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,360
great for application developers,

1107
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,520
but it's bad when users touch it.

1108
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,360
It empowers developers to have more expressive API available,

1109
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,720
but it also makes the applications more fragile

1110
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,440
when users try to pull those styles out

1111
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,400
from underneath them.

1112
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,680
So the reason why this is back up today

1113
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:42,120
is Tobias Bernard, over on one of the blogs at gnome.org,

1114
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:48,280
wrote a really good post on why these themes do not work.

1115
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,880
And he showed a lot of examples.

1116
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,440
Unfortunately, our friends over at System76

1117
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,520
kind of take a beating, because he shows out

1118
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,120
a lot of inconsistencies in Pop!

1119
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,840
OS's theme, where certain buttons don't light up,

1120
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,920
a block is hanging off randomly off the header bar.

1121
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,080
And when he zooms in on it, you can really kind of see

1122
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,080
the difficulties.

1123
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,200
Then he shows some examples of some things coming down

1124
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,120
the road in Nautilus that just don't even

1125
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,160
render properly at all in the theme,

1126
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,400
because the theme is going to have to be tweaked now

1127
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,520
to support that new feature in GTK3.

1128
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,320
And at the end of it, he basically devastates themes.

1129
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,040
He really does.

1130
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,520
Like, he's like, it's an ironclad case here.

1131
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,000
And it seems to me that, and he even addresses, like,

1132
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,160
for the users want themes.

1133
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,640
And I admit, I'm one of them.

1134
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,440
That's kind of one of the things I like about Plasma,

1135
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,600
is I have all those theme options,

1136
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,720
and I can just download them right off the thing

1137
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,320
and install them and try them.

1138
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,560
So the conversation is continuing.

1139
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,920
And I have a sense it would be good for GNOME and the, quote,

1140
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,760
GNOME platform, end quote.

1141
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,240
But I don't understand how it would

1142
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,760
be good for downstream distributions that

1143
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,200
want to have a different look and feel,

1144
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,400
so that way it looks and feels like Antegros,

1145
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,920
or it looks and feels like Ubuntu.

1146
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,360
Like, you've got to tweak it a little bit.

1147
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,720
I think, I mean, that's always been the case.

1148
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,280
Maybe everybody could ship the same exact looking GNOME shell,

1149
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,320
but I just don't see it.

1150
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,240
And there's no formal facility, there's no formal API

1151
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,840
that they could be shutting down here,

1152
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,240
because they never created one.

1153
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,840
So people can just make the same hacks

1154
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,600
they've always been making.

1155
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,200
So I don't really quite understand

1156
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,960
how they would even enforce it.

1157
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,440
But the conversation's getting louder,

1158
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,880
and I find it to be fascinating.

1159
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,480
And I say, if you're going to make Adwadi the default,

1160
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,720
you better keep investing in it.

1161
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,840
Keep making it look great.

1162
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,160
But it's a great post, and we'll have a link to it

1163
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,000
in the show notes.

1164
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,560
If you want to look at the examples,

1165
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,880
and if you are concerned about this at all,

1166
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,640
I really encourage you to read the post.

1167
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,920
We'll have OMG Abuntu's summary of it,

1168
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,040
and then we'll have a direct link to the blog post too.

1169
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,800
In the show notes, linuxunplugged.com

1170
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,240
slash 271.

1171
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:48,840
Let's keep moving, though.

1172
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,320
We've got a lot more to get into.

1173
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,440
We've got much more.

1174
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,840
A new version of DXVK is out this week.

1175
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,720
It features some great improvements and support

1176
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,360
for great new games that were either supported before

1177
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:04,240
and broke or needed fixes, like Assassin's Creed and BioShock

1178
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,800
and Dark Souls 3.

1179
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,200
Some really good stuff in here.

1180
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,760
And also today, the folks over at Crossover Office

1181
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,760
released Crossover 18, which includes their DXVK support,

1182
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,960
which is support for Vulkan.

1183
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,960
What is it, takes DirectX calls and translates them to Vulkan?

1184
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,880
Direct3D 10 and 11.

1185
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,280
Thank you, thank you.

1186
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,480
So that's in Crossover now too.

1187
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,040
So they had another release this week,

1188
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,600
so that's congratulations to them.

1189
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,680
Oh, hot new tech.

1190
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,880
Linux Academy is trying something kind of adorable,

1191
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,160
and I thought I'd give a shout out to that.

1192
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,160
If you are carving pumpkins with the kids, which we do it now,

1193
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,040
two rounds of pumpkin carvings.

1194
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,120
That's because we've got a practiced hand.

1195
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:44,720
Oh, yeah.

1196
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,760
Oh, I am the best gut scooper.

1197
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,000
Are you putting tux on there?

1198
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,840
You got a tux pumpkin?

1199
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,640
Yeah, what's happening?

1200
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,200
That is such a good idea, I can't believe in it.

1201
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,760
No, I did an owl pumpkin last week.

1202
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,240
Oh.

1203
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,000
Yeah, for the little one.

1204
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,440
And I didn't even think of this, but Linux Academy

1205
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,600
is doing a pumpkin carving contest

1206
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,000
if you want to win some gems, which you can cash in for swag.

1207
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,520
I think you just hit them up at hashtag jackonlinux.

1208
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,640
And oh, that's funny, because we're

1209
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,320
going to be doing some jackonlinux stuff.

1210
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,240
Jack-o-linux, jack-o-linux.

1211
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,600
I'll put a link in the show notes.

1212
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,280
If you're carving pumpkins and want to win some swag, why not?

1213
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,080
I should have thought of that.

1214
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:17,680
You know what I did?

1215
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,320
And you guys can rip this off, and maybe you'll

1216
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,600
see some swag, is my middle child wanted

1217
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,400
to do a Pinocchio pumpkin.

1218
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,160
So we looked up the picture on the phone

1219
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,960
and kept it there while we were carving it.

1220
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,040
But then the stroke of genius was busted off the stem

1221
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,640
off the top of the pumpkin and rammed it in the nose hole,

1222
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,960
so it's got a Pinocchio nose from the stem.

1223
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,160
It was a pro move.

1224
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,360
Also, just one more quick one this week, Chrome OS

1225
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:46,080
in the stable channel is now getting Linux app support.

1226
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,240
It seems like a huge deal.

1227
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,080
And the folks over at linuxjournal.com

1228
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,720
decided, well, let's install Gnome software

1229
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,280
and then play around with that.

1230
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,920
And they ended up getting that installed.

1231
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,840
And so they could just browse Gnome software.

1232
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,800
They got GIMP installed.

1233
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,000
It is a Chromebook world out there, Wes.

1234
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,720
You should get one.

1235
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,360
You'd be hip down in Seattle with a Chromebook.

1236
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,240
Oh, yes, I would.

1237
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,120
Do you actually see many Chromebooks in Seattle?

1238
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,640
Not really.

1239
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,720
No, I haven't actually ever seen one.

1240
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,400
Now that I think about it, I've never seen one.

1241
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,720
But you should still get one.

1242
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,000
It's weird to see it when you look at them installing it

1243
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,480
and it just says, installing Linux.

1244
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,320
Yeah.

1245
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,040
Like, what a weird message.

1246
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,080
But hey, I mean, stable, it's a big deal.

1247
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,760
It actually means people might use it now.

1248
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,520
Well, speaking of Microsoft, oh, wait.

1249
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,960
No, that's just what Google is turning into.

1250
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,560
Well, speaking of actual Microsoft,

1251
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,600
huge news that everybody's been talking about

1252
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,520
is that they contributed 60,000 patents

1253
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,840
to the Open Innovation Network.

1254
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,000
And I got to say that, as always, the response

1255
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,520
has been wide ranging.

1256
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,120
But the overall, I think, response has been tremendously

1257
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,200
positive.

1258
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,480
I have seen, I still am seeing tweets and people

1259
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,480
in the chat room and people in the Telegram group

1260
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,480
going, wow, they really have changed.

1261
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,480
They really have changed.

1262
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,320
Wow, this is it right here.

1263
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,040
This is the big change.

1264
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,080
It is pretty massive.

1265
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,320
Have I talked to you all about this?

1266
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,920
What are your thoughts on Microsoft contributing

1267
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,360
60,000 patents to the Open Innovation Network?

1268
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,600
Do you think it changes anything practically?

1269
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,360
I mean, I think it had been hanging out there.

1270
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,480
It had been a little bit awkward, right?

1271
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,760
Because we've seen the Microsoft Loves Linux

1272
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,200
campaign for a couple of years now.

1273
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,640
We've seen their big open source pushes.

1274
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,040
This sort of felt like a little bit of that old management

1275
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,920
still there, or the mean corporate Microsoft.

1276
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,000
And it's, well, we still got our patent war

1277
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,880
and that whole Android situation.

1278
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,960
So it kind of just feels like an act of good faith,

1279
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,840
as sort of like, we don't need to play on this level anymore.

1280
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,960
And let's just compete on software.

1281
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,120
Yeah, but Wimpy, isn't this just a long play

1282
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,760
to do the embrace part before you extinguish?

1283
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,600
No.

1284
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,320
All right, very good.

1285
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,160
Here we have it.

1286
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,680
OK, well, that's settled.

1287
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,720
I'm not going to indulge any negativity around this subject.

1288
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,600
I think this is remarkable that Microsoft

1289
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,640
have contributed so many patents to the OIN

1290
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,840
and is the most significant evidence

1291
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,560
that we can point to that there is definitely

1292
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,720
a cultural change.

1293
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,320
Not just happening, but that has happened within Microsoft.

1294
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:13,880
I agree.

1295
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,400
These kinds of things inside companies this size

1296
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,200
take a lot of people internally to make it happen.

1297
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,080
Yeah, exactly.

1298
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,360
There were a lot of cogs involved.

1299
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,080
I'd be fascinated to know how this started.

1300
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,960
Where's the advocacy coming from?

1301
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,080
So we were going to ask that.

1302
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,760
I did invite a couple of folks on the show.

1303
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,600
They both attempted to make it work, but were traveling

1304
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,440
and couldn't come on the show today.

1305
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,160
I was going to ask them that.

1306
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,680
So if I get the opportunity in the future, though,

1307
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,880
I think the story is big enough, I

1308
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,080
may still try to take them up on that when they're done.

1309
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,040
Although, then we're running into holidays.

1310
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,480
But it is a hell of a move by a company that was once

1311
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,600
considered at war with Linux.

1312
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,140
And it is true that it really only protects people

1313
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,920
in the open innovation network.

1314
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,560
That innovation network is free to join.

1315
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,060
And it's a massive statement.

1316
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,680
It's really also a messaging to developers

1317
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,120
that you can use these core technologies, the core

1318
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,960
technologies that, by the way, power Azure,

1319
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,160
you can use those to build your devices.

1320
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,200
And you can hook them all the way up to the Microsoft tools

1321
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,240
chain, and we're not going to come after you.

1322
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,760
That's really what the message is here.

1323
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,080
And this is how they're signaling it.

1324
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,100
That's really what this is about.

1325
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:15,960
It's about signaling.

1326
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,880
It's about positioning.

1327
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,640
And I welcome it.

1328
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,600
I say congratulations.

1329
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,480
Huge story to them.

1330
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,520
And will they stop going after Android ex-fat use?

1331
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,760
Who knows?

1332
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,920
Who knows?

1333
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,160
But it doesn't really matter.

1334
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,120
I think this is a good.

1335
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,600
That separate would be great to see them stop doing that.

1336
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,760
But separate of that, this is still a great move.

1337
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,880
I remember the days when I would talk with Jeremy

1338
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,400
from the Samba project.

1339
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,120
And he would tell me how paranoid

1340
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,400
they were constantly of Microsoft coming after them.

1341
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,560
I can only imagine.

1342
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,840
And then the monomemory around Mono, the paranoia around Mono.

1343
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,800
I had to lose my tomboy over all that.

1344
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,120
Tomboy was one of the best note-taking applications

1345
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,320
for desktop Linux back in the day.

1346
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,640
But it had the one sin of being a Mono-based application.

1347
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,120
And then there was that, I don't know,

1348
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,360
what would you call it, Popey?

1349
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:06,040
There was like a mandate to rid Mono across Linux, right?

1350
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,080
Yep, there was.

1351
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,960
And sadly, some of those people worked at Canonical

1352
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,240
and celebrated when Mono was removed from the ISO.

1353
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,480
That may be very, very sad indeed.

1354
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,800
And it was all out of fear of Microsoft's patent aggression.

1355
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,200
That's what it was all based out of.

1356
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,880
Completely mental.

1357
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,880
Yeah, now here we are.

1358
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,360
And it never materialized.

1359
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,160
And they've contributed 60,000 patents

1360
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,240
to a patent consortium that protects people

1361
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,040
that use Linux technologies.

1362
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:33,920
Just weird.

1363
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,880
It's great, though.

1364
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,640
It's great.

1365
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,040
What's also great is this week, in just a few hours

1366
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,280
from this recording, especially from the release

1367
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,640
of this recording, Ubuntu 18.10 will be out.

1368
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,400
It's a Cosmic Cuttlefish.

1369
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,760
And it's got that brand new theme

1370
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,520
we were just talking about and the latest performance

1371
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,440
improvements to GNOME and GNOME 3.30.

1372
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,000
And I kind of feel like, in a big way,

1373
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,080
it's the best-looking, best-performing Ubuntu

1374
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,200
I have ever used.

1375
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,880
Couldn't believe it when I loaded it up.

1376
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,480
And it had been a while since I was using GNOME, too.

1377
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,680
So it was also my first back into GNOME.

1378
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,160
And oh, man.

1379
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,920
Oh, man, if it didn't make me kind of go, this is nice.

1380
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,080
You had that same experience.

1381
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:17,480
Oh, yeah.

1382
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,320
I mean, it kind of feels like really hitting

1383
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,880
the stride after 1804.

1384
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,440
And then now things are just getting more polished.

1385
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,840
And they fit together better.

1386
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,800
And it's faster.

1387
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,520
And finally, we're at home in GNOME as much as we can be.

1388
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,600
It's really nice.

1389
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,680
Super, super smooth, really good-looking.

1390
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,520
And there's still a few areas that, long-term, I'd

1391
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,380
love to see changed.

1392
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:42,320
But I think it's one of the best implementations.

1393
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,600
What are they?

1394
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,240
Well, honestly, I'd love to see the installer redone.

1395
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,160
I don't know.

1396
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,320
I feel like it just feels a little.

1397
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,960
It does fine.

1398
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,200
But the last part where it's installing packages

1399
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,160
and all of that, like the whole terminal box

1400
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,720
is cramped and tiny.

1401
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,720
The status information is not very useful.

1402
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,200
It just feels like it could use a retouch a little bit.

1403
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,400
And I don't know.

1404
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,360
It's not horrible.

1405
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,240
But it feels a little out of date these days,

1406
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,680
compared to what some other distro installers look like.

1407
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,560
Now, there's a lot of installers that are a lot worse.

1408
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,480
So it's not a huge complaint.

1409
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,520
Because it's, on the average, pretty good.

1410
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,600
I think Ubiquity has stood the test of time.

1411
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,720
And everything else is just catching up a bit now.

1412
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,080
Yeah.

1413
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,200
I think it just needs a little catch-up.

1414
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,680
Yeah, exactly.

1415
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,840
Also, I think it would be super cool to see a little nod

1416
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,840
towards some kind of smartphone integration.

1417
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,920
I just think that's a good end user feature, like GS Connect

1418
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,800
or something like that in there out of the box

1419
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,680
would be pretty, pretty sweet.

1420
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,600
Some other features around that, too, I think

1421
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,720
would be kind of nice, like integrating

1422
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,240
with people's workflows and stuff.

1423
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,280
I think Canonical, too, could be in a good position

1424
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,400
to work with upstream cloud providers

1425
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,360
to have more account integration.

1426
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,640
I feel like that's something that would be really nice if I

1427
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,640
could easily log in and get my calendar and my contacts

1428
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,840
and all of that synced down.

1429
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,160
I know it's been a long-term hope thing.

1430
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,280
But it'd be really nice to see that.

1431
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,160
Because that's something you do get on Chrome OS

1432
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,880
or you will get on the Chrome OS tablet and stuff like that.

1433
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,360
And you get it with Outlook and whatnot.

1434
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,720
More people expect the cloud to be

1435
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,040
sort of first class in their operating system.

1436
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,520
But out of the box, beautiful, fast.

1437
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,560
I didn't really have much more takeaway than that

1438
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,160
because not only is it not out yet,

1439
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,280
so I don't want to give it the full review,

1440
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,320
but I've only had a few days with it.

1441
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,080
But damn, really well done.

1442
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,320
Wimpy or Popey, is there anything

1443
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,800
in particular with the 1810 cycle

1444
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,480
that you want to call out?

1445
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,560
I'm thinking.

1446
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,240
Anything, or anything with Mate too, Ubuntu Mate.

1447
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,200
Well, Popey, do you want to answer for Ubuntu?

1448
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,760
So from Ubuntu, I'm one of those people

1449
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,800
who always try and stick to the LTS.

1450
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,480
And then something comes along in the release after the LTS,

1451
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,080
and it really makes me want to upgrade.

1452
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,040
Yes, yes.

1453
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,600
But, and I'm sorry to do this, the fact

1454
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,240
that we now have snaps, I generally

1455
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,720
don't need to do that because I don't need to upgrade.

1456
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,080
I can stay on the LTS, and I can get all the new applications.

1457
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,880
So I'm actually definitely staying on the LTS.

1458
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,320
I love the work the desktop team are doing,

1459
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,520
but I'm sticking with 1804.

1460
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,200
Fair enough.

1461
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,480
I actually think you could be on 1604 for the most part

1462
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,120
and not really feel it these days.

1463
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,040
It's kind of funny.

1464
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:14,880
It's totally changed.

1465
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,720
It's a different world from two years ago.

1466
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,720
This is the lunch conversation that Wes and I had.

1467
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,280
Exactly.

1468
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,320
Wes was like, yeah, I just don't know

1469
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,920
if I want to stick with an LTS because it usually

1470
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,720
starts to feel stale.

1471
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,360
I'm like, yeah, back in the day, I'd

1472
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,200
feel like a distribution was stale three months

1473
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,360
after release.

1474
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,840
But today, I could be on 1604, and I wouldn't even feel it.

1475
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,720
It really is true.

1476
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,480
Well, what about that Ubuntu mate there?

1477
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,880
Wimp, anything you want to call out for the 18.10 release?

1478
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,000
So the 18.10 release, curiously, has really

1479
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,540
got an eye on what will become Ubuntu 1804.2.

1480
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:49,240
So one of the things that I've been making representation

1481
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,360
for within the Ubuntu project, with the help

1482
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:57,840
of the likes of Will Cook, is to land the necessary drivers

1483
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:05,160
to have a really good AMD GPU experience in 18.10.

1484
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,600
Because the hardware stack that exists in 18.10

1485
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:15,040
is what will become the hardware enablement stack in 1804.2.

1486
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,360
So we've lined everything up so that that stack

1487
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,600
is in a good place.

1488
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,920
And therefore, that's what's coming to 1804.2.

1489
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,360
And from the mate point of view, all of the work

1490
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:34,080
has been in upstream mate to fix lots of bugs in mate itself,

1491
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:39,120
which all now exist in Ubuntu mate 18.10.

1492
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:43,320
And that's a prerequisite having all of those fixes in 18.10.

1493
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,840
You have to have all of your fixes in the current release

1494
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,320
in order for them to be candidates for what's

1495
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,480
called SRUed back to 1804.

1496
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,120
So all of the setup for 18.10 is work

1497
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:00,800
to make an 1804.2 that has got lots of fixes and better

1498
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,040
hardware support in it.

1499
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,160
Hold on a second here.

1500
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,160
Hold on a second here.

1501
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,200
So in a way, what you're saying is

1502
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,520
you could view the dot, like the intermediary release

1503
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,840
between an LTS, like the 18.10 release in this case,

1504
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:19,240
as a cycle to build proper back ports to 1804?

1505
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:19,760
Yes.

1506
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:28,200
And certainly, so 16.04 was my first LTS with Ubuntu mate.

1507
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:34,320
And we didn't do a great job of actually delivering fixes back

1508
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,320
to 16.04.

1509
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,760
And I've learned from that.

1510
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,720
So I've used this 18.10 cycle as a means

1511
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:47,080
to collect up those fixes to then start delivering them back.

1512
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:51,000
Now, I'm not saying you have to wait all the time until 1804.2.

1513
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,920
They'll start drip feeding out now.

1514
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:57,680
But by the time 1804.2 comes out in February, all of that stuff

1515
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,280
should have been back ported and available.

1516
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,320
That's cool.

1517
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,160
I love hearing that.

1518
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,180
Because that means that if I just

1519
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,520
want to stay on the previous install that I'm happy with,

1520
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,160
I still get all the goodies that I really care about.

1521
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:14,640
And then for fun, I've, so this is a little look

1522
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,320
at how the sausage is made.

1523
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,680
I've decided to do a little side project for Ubuntu mate for 18.10.

1524
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:26,320
So as we record this in two days from now, 18.10 is released.

1525
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:30,440
And I will be releasing bespoke images for the GPD Pocket

1526
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:36,280
and the GPD Pocket 2 alongside the official releases.

1527
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:40,400
So you got your hands on the new GPD Pocket.

1528
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,400
How does it run on there?

1529
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,480
How does everything run?

1530
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:48,160
The GPD Pocket 2 is a huge improvement over the GPD Pocket in every respect.

1531
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,480
So in terms of what it has inside it, it's

1532
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:58,400
equivalent to a Mac Air Book in terms of CPU and all the rest of it.

1533
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,720
Yeah.

1534
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,240
Boy.

1535
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,160
Yeah, it's the same.

1536
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,720
It's the same CPU package and everything.

1537
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,760
Wow.

1538
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,160
And the thing that's peculiar about those, if you're not familiar,

1539
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:14,040
these are milled aluminum netbook style devices.

1540
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,600
So they're seven inch screens, although ridiculously,

1541
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:22,600
they're 1920 by 1200 displays, seven inch displays.

1542
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:26,160
So effectively, they're high DPI because of the size

1543
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,400
of the screen and the pixel density.

1544
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,840
So I've prepackaged these with the necessary,

1545
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,320
and also the screens are rotated.

1546
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,440
So if you don't make any accommodation for the hardware,

1547
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:42,360
you get the screen displayed in the wrong perspective.

1548
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:46,680
So these images have got the necessary rotations for the screen

1549
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:51,040
and also the necessary rotations for the touch display.

1550
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,720
Otherwise, where you touch doesn't level up

1551
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,960
with the actual display itself.

1552
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:00,240
And things like changing the font size of the console font.

1553
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,760
So if you do switch to a TTY, you can actually read it.

1554
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:09,240
And rotating the frame buffer so that when

1555
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,160
you're looking at grub, for example,

1556
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,400
that sort of stuff is correct.

1557
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,880
And I've landed a curious little tweak

1558
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,400
in the Ubuntu Marte image, which is

1559
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:24,480
to use some funky features of the X server to do some scaling.

1560
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:29,360
So obviously, 1920 by 1200 on a seven inch display

1561
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,760
is teeny tiny.

1562
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:33,640
But if you enable high DPI, it's too big

1563
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:40,080
because you effectively get a 960 by 600 display

1564
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,000
effective resolution, which is too small.

1565
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,840
So I've used a quirk of the X server to scale that.

1566
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,520
So you get something that's representative,

1567
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:54,000
like 1280 by 800 effective resolution.

1568
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,120
So it's still big enough to be useful,

1569
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,080
but also large enough that you can actually see and use.

1570
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,080
And that's hidden just behind the tick box.

1571
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,160
So if you don't like that, you can just turn it off

1572
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,160
and get the full native resolution.

1573
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,760
Oh, that sounds like a really nice setup.

1574
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,960
That sounds like it's going to be the best out-of-the-box

1575
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,120
experience on this hardware.

1576
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,400
Yeah, I like the original one.

1577
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,120
But the community around the original GPD Pocket

1578
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,960
has sort of fallen by the wayside now.

1579
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,000
So that's one of the reasons why I've done this,

1580
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,840
is to sort of reinvigorate that to give those people that have

1581
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,640
got these devices somewhere to go.

1582
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,680
But the GPD Pocket 2 is sort of brand new.

1583
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,720
Their backers are just receiving those units now.

1584
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,520
And you can buy them on Amazon and all the rest of it.

1585
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,600
So I think it's a good time to provide

1586
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,440
a good image for that device.

1587
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,680
Rough estimation of the battery?

1588
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,360
About 12 hours.

1589
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,840
No.

1590
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,520
No.

1591
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,240
Wow.

1592
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:48,760
Yeah.

1593
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:51,360
They must cram a decent battery inside that little thing.

1594
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,880
Yeah, it's a good battery, and it sips power.

1595
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,800
So it's about 10 hours for the original model

1596
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,400
and about 12 for the new one.

1597
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,960
I've had both of them on a desk today.

1598
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,440
Neither of them have seen a charger all day.

1599
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,400
And they've got about 60% battery life left.

1600
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,000
Yeah, that CPU is supposed to be pretty low power.

1601
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,840
And I guess the keyboard, is it actually usable?

1602
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,200
I mean, you can't fit two hands on it.

1603
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:20,600
So in the GPD Pocket, in the original,

1604
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,800
the key cap arrangement was just mental.

1605
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,720
And the key caps themselves were wobbly,

1606
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,080
and they weren't accurate.

1607
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,000
And you could strike a key, and it wouldn't register.

1608
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,720
And that whole experience was hideous.

1609
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,680
Fortunately, although the keyboard arrangement

1610
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:41,040
on the GPD Pocket 2 is still, let's say, quirky,

1611
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,280
the keys themselves actually work well.

1612
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,400
So it's just a case of learning the peculiar keyboard

1613
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,040
arrangement.

1614
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,040
But when you strike a key, it does actually

1615
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,600
do what you expect it to do.

1616
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,360
And having the two side by side, the GPD Pocket 2,

1617
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:59,520
as somebody who does an awful lot on the command line

1618
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,120
and with a keyboard, is leaps and bounds more usable

1619
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,680
than its predecessor.

1620
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,440
Well, I enjoyed your full review on the Ubuntu podcast.

1621
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,880
So people should check that out, ubuntupodcast.org.

1622
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:13,360
Rumor has it there will be a full review there very soon.

1623
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,440
Check it out there.

1624
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,920
In fact, I think it's already out.

1625
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:16,680
So you might just go over there.

1626
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,080
And if it's not, just download all of them

1627
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,040
until you find it.

1628
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,160
Just download all of them.

1629
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:20,840
Keep going.

1630
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,600
It was out on Friday last week, so you'd go and listen

1631
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,640
to that right now.

1632
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,480
Nice.

1633
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,000
Well, that is really making me want one.

1634
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,760
Well, especially if you're like an on-call engineer or something,

1635
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,880
that would just be the perfect guy

1636
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,880
to drag around with you, a terminal, wherever you are.

1637
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,880
No kidding.

1638
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:36,480
No kidding.

1639
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,600
You know we could put Jack Audio on that thing

1640
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,800
and make it a podcast, Rick.

1641
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,320
You know we could do that.

1642
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,200
I wonder how it would hold up.

1643
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,320
It has a fan, right, Wimpy?

1644
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,360
It has a little fan in there.

1645
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,000
So Joe would still yell at me for it.

1646
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Yeah, so the original one is a software-controlled fan.

1647
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,640
And interestingly, the second-gen one actually

1648
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,240
has a hardware fan button.

1649
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:59,320
So you can turn it on and off at will.

1650
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,320
It's a bit sort of manual.

1651
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,520
But it doesn't need the fan unless you're doing something

1652
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,760
really intensive with it.

1653
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,040
So you can turn it on and off.

1654
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,120
And obviously, you can control the battery endurance

1655
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:12,960
with that as well.

1656
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,520
The perfect broadcast, Rick.

1657
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,800
You can just flip off the fan.

1658
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,720
I think that's perfect.

1659
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,800
So there's another set of devices

1660
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,280
that are getting an Ubuntu update of a different nature

1661
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,360
this week.

1662
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,880
The Ubiports project is getting down

1663
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,240
a pretty good cadence of releases.

1664
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:32,040
And they have OTA 5, which has finished up

1665
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,960
some of the 16.04 LTS support.

1666
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,800
You'll remember that phone versions of Ubuntu

1667
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,880
are one LTS behind.

1668
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,560
That's current for them.

1669
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,280
And there's some nice improvements

1670
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,680
in this new release.

1671
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,600
And so we wanted to chat with Dalton from Ubiports.

1672
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,080
Dalton is there.

1673
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,400
I asked him what his title was.

1674
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,920
And he told me that it was development manager.

1675
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,800
So he is their development manager.

1676
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,240
And we asked Dalton to tell us about the new release.

1677
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,800
Dalton, welcome to the show.

1678
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,200
Hey, thanks for having me.

1679
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,480
So Dalton, it looks like the big news this week

1680
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:06,240
is Ubuntu Touch OTA 5 is out.

1681
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,560
What are the touchstone features in OTA 5?

1682
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,960
Yeah, OTA 5 has made a bit of noise.

1683
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,720
The big feature we've got out this time

1684
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,000
is the new browser, that is the Morph browser.

1685
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,200
This brings the Qt Web Engine, replacing the old Oxide Engine.

1686
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,360
Both of them are based on Chromium.

1687
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,200
But Qt Web Engine is a lot newer.

1688
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,200
Oh, yeah.

1689
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,880
And it also looks like it's got sort of a more responsive

1690
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:30,680
design to it.

1691
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:34,120
So it scales across different devices and screen sizes

1692
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:34,880
as well, true?

1693
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,720
Yep, we've always had the device scaling features

1694
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,040
coming in with convergence.

1695
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,920
But this just adds a little bit of extra sauce to it.

1696
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,440
Yeah, I suppose that probably is true.

1697
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,680
Is that particularly tricky with Ubuntu Touch?

1698
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:52,120
Everything you put in has to be scalable to different device

1699
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:52,920
sizes.

1700
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:56,800
One of the tricks of the iOS platform is it's all fixed.

1701
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,680
They keep adding to it, and changing it,

1702
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,200
and adding notches and whatnot.

1703
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,440
But it's essentially all fixed.

1704
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,800
You can do dynamic layout, but you almost always

1705
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,000
know what you're going to get.

1706
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,800
But with Ubuntu Touch, there's really no way for you

1707
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,400
as the development team to know, or the key developers,

1708
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,160
has that been a challenge?

1709
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,160
Or is technology to the point where that's totally doable?

1710
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,640
So a lot of developers are getting experience

1711
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:21,440
with this type of design with websites and mobile first.

1712
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,080
But it is always kind of a weird paradigm

1713
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,960
to get your head around where my app could

1714
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,440
be used on any of these all the time, and it could change.

1715
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,960
So some of the pinnacles of that design

1716
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,040
include Deco2, the browser itself,

1717
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,440
and a lot of other apps that we've got in our store.

1718
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,360
That makes a lot of sense.

1719
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,920
Yeah, right, these sorts of apps are more popular.

1720
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,920
We're thinking about this already as people

1721
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,480
making apps for end users.

1722
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,760
I'm pretty curious.

1723
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,840
It looks like from the end user perspective,

1724
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,400
getting OTA 5 is pretty easy.

1725
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,840
I can just hit Upgrade, get the latest OTA,

1726
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,880
reboot, and be in the new environment.

1727
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,520
How do you get to that level of QA?

1728
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,360
How do you test this stuff so you know you're not

1729
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:02,320
going to break people's phones, especially as a smaller team?

1730
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,960
We had a lot of people doing a lot of testing.

1731
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,080
I know for my part, I've got several devices here,

1732
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,800
including the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 tablet.

1733
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:14,680
Those were going from 1504 to 1604 daily.

1734
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:15,680
Wow.

1735
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,040
It's just a lot of keeping that all straight

1736
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,720
and making sure that it's all working.

1737
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,200
And we have a great community and an excellent QA team

1738
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,760
who is helping us out with that throughout the entire process.

1739
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:26,960
That's great.

1740
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:29,800
We also have the new Setup Wizard,

1741
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,040
which helps you once you get onto 1604,

1742
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:36,240
since apps aren't necessarily compatible between the two,

1743
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,480
update all of your apps, make sure

1744
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:38,840
that everything's ready to go.

1745
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,440
Now, I was reviewing the roadmap on the website,

1746
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,920
and it shows that really OTA 6, I think,

1747
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,440
is what it's called, that's really

1748
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:50,360
going to be a release that addresses technical debt.

1749
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,760
I'm curious, what kind of technical debt?

1750
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:56,120
So with the new browser, of course, it's brand new stuff.

1751
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,440
There are issues with it.

1752
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,120
So we have problems with if you try to change your home page,

1753
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,960
when you click on the box, it flies off the screen

1754
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,200
and weird things like that when the keyboard pops up.

1755
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,440
Brand new stuff.

1756
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,440
Bugs did find their way in.

1757
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,200
So what we're trying to do with OTA 6

1758
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,000
is just make sure that we take care of all of those.

1759
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,960
So all of this work is pretty exciting,

1760
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,840
but what are you guys doing?

1761
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,600
What are possible approaches to increase awareness

1762
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,440
so that more people who might be interested in this project, who

1763
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,720
don't already know, might know to try it out

1764
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,400
and use this great new release?

1765
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,680
So word of mouth is always the most important.

1766
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:37,760
If you do like Ubuntu Touch, get out there and talk about it.

1767
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,920
We also have a few different outreach projects

1768
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,840
for contributors right now with different channels helping

1769
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,120
people get started with development, especially

1770
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,760
on Ubuntu Touch.

1771
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:52,160
Or Hacktoberfest is going on right now with DigitalOcean.

1772
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,720
So we've got bugs labeled as Hacktoberfest,

1773
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,120
which will be nice and easy for people to get started with.

1774
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,140
I'm making sure that I put in instructions

1775
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:01,720
on how to do the contribution, how to get started

1776
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:02,640
with the workflow.

1777
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,080
DigitalOcean's Hacktoberfest is being

1778
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,460
used for a couple of different open source projects.

1779
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:07,840
That's a great way to do it.

1780
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,080
So Dalton, do you have a sense of about how many users are

1781
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,280
out there in the world using Ubuntu Touch at this point?

1782
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,840
Do you have a rough estimate?

1783
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,920
One of the things that we put on our banners

1784
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,400
while we're at conferences and things is,

1785
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,440
we don't know who you are, and we want to keep it that way.

1786
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:28,120
So we deliberately don't take that much data about users.

1787
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,540
We do have inklings of information

1788
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:34,960
from our push server, which sends out notifications.

1789
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,880
But we don't have terribly hard numbers on that.

1790
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,720
What kind of infrastructure does that take?

1791
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:44,240
And is that a cost that is being covered

1792
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,440
by a particular sponsor, or is that something

1793
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,640
the project is fronting to run the push servers

1794
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,360
and the OTA stuff, the back end stuff?

1795
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,880
A lot of our server infrastructure

1796
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,120
is sponsored by different providers, DigitalOcean,

1797
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:59,160
packet.net, and Scaleway.

1798
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:03,200
So we do have a lot of that covered for us.

1799
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,040
The push server itself is actually running

1800
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,520
on DigitalOcean's smallest VPS.

1801
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:12,440
Luckily, it is very light and does its work very well.

1802
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,920
However, for the larger things like system image, which

1803
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,920
actually does the OTA upgrades, it

1804
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,040
is a significant bandwidth cost.

1805
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,880
So we are appreciative of our sponsors and also people

1806
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,240
who support us on Patreon.

1807
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,200
Very good.

1808
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,580
Patreon sounds like a good way people could directly

1809
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:28,760
support the project.

1810
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,080
What's the URL for that?

1811
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:30,800
It is.

1812
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,360
If you want to find links to sponsor us via Patreon,

1813
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:37,560
Bitcoin, or a few others, that's ubiports.com slash

1814
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,280
donate.

1815
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:38,780
I love it.

1816
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:42,080
Still repping the Bitcoin, even at $6,400 of value.

1817
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,600
You're a good man, Dalton.

1818
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,620
So Dalton, I've got a couple of links to your GitHub page,

1819
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:50,560
MrUniversalSuperBox, and other things in the show notes,

1820
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:55,920
like the Ubiport site, the news about the new OTA5 release.

1821
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,920
Is there a Telegram group or any other communities

1822
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,240
you might mention that people are just

1823
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,920
starting to get curious about Ubuntu Touch

1824
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:01,880
they could go check out?

1825
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,380
Yeah.

1826
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:05,640
You can always join us at at Ubiports on Telegram.

1827
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,880
We're Ubiports on most social networks,

1828
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,240
including Twitter, Facebook, Mastodon, and just about

1829
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,880
anywhere else you'd expect to find us.

1830
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:13,560
Very good, Dalton.

1831
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,600
Well, thanks for joining us on the Unplugged program.

1832
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,600
Thanks for having me.

1833
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,400
I follow the project with some interest

1834
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,080
because it seems to me, although there's a few others out there,

1835
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,760
you got your Plasma Touches out there

1836
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,680
and you got your Purism efforts, I acknowledge.

1837
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:30,480
But I really feel like Ubuntu Touch could

1838
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:34,000
be a great alternative one day for that general purpose Linux

1839
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,400
distro that you can get a piece of hardware and load it on.

1840
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,000
So it's fascinating to watch the project work this stuff out.

1841
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,120
And then from my perspective, I'm like, take your time.

1842
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:41,640
Get it right.

1843
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,280
Yeah, I want to come back in, I don't know, a year

1844
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,140
and just maybe have a tablet that runs that I leave around

1845
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:47,840
my house and I have on the couch every day.

1846
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,840
That'd be perfect.

1847
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:49,400
That would be.

1848
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,360
That would be pretty neat, pretty neat.

1849
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,400
All right, so speaking of things that are pretty neat,

1850
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,480
we have something that we're working on behind the scenes.

1851
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,040
This whole production pipeline that we have

1852
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,240
is manual labor intensive here at the network.

1853
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,960
And now that we're part of Linux Academy,

1854
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,840
one of the things that we want to try to do

1855
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:11,520
is give back anything we really can of our process

1856
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,740
to the community.

1857
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,360
Eventually, perhaps, being able to go,

1858
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,860
depending on our time and resources,

1859
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:18,800
be able to go essentially to the level of a guide

1860
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,760
you could follow to start podcasting under Linux,

1861
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,260
how to record, how to get decent audio, how to publish it,

1862
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:24,720
and then even some tools and scripts

1863
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,320
to help you automate some of the trickier parts.

1864
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,840
That's sort of our end-to-end goal way down the line

1865
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,800
as we build these components.

1866
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,360
In some cases, we'll just adapt existing projects.

1867
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,920
In other cases, we might create our own.

1868
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,180
And we're beginning this project behind the scenes.

1869
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:44,200
It is really an automation project

1870
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:51,640
to make the process of deploying our episodes as error-free

1871
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,400
as possible, to take out the human element

1872
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,120
as much as possible, and to make it so when whoever edits

1873
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,480
the show, like in this case, it'd be Joe,

1874
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,800
when he hits the Publish button, it's

1875
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,720
immediately available on all of the destination platforms

1876
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,800
that we publish in all of the feeds.

1877
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,580
It doesn't require any human intervention, which right now,

1878
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:11,480
Joe can publish it.

1879
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,920
But then somebody here in the JB office

1880
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,960
has to go actually publish it to the feeds,

1881
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:17,520
publish it to the website.

1882
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,560
There's a lot more manual.

1883
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,840
And it's a lot of copypasta, a lot of filling out feeds.

1884
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,400
And eventually, we want to get it

1885
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:27,000
so it automates the encoding, the publishing, and even more.

1886
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,160
It's the whole pipeline from going from show notes

1887
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:30,880
to the website.

1888
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,240
All of it just is completely automatic.

1889
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:37,080
And this is going to be a modular monster

1890
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:38,720
that we build over time.

1891
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:42,720
And Wes is starting on the first parts of it right now.

1892
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,720
And once we start to build this, we'll build it in phases.

1893
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,920
We'll build the most time-critical components

1894
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:48,880
that we need automated.

1895
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,680
And then we'll start adding on, doing encoding.

1896
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,100
We want to circle back eventually.

1897
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:54,600
If you watch our videos on YouTube,

1898
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:58,280
we have automated renders that have the album art

1899
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:02,400
with a waveform that's like 13 frames a second, which

1900
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,480
is for file size.

1901
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,520
The beautiful thing is those files are like 75, 80 megabytes.

1902
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,400
But the downside is the frame rate sucks.

1903
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,480
We want to start using the videos

1904
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:14,820
that we use for like Linux Action News, which is manually

1905
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,320
artisan handcraft encoded by Joe.

1906
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:18,440
Each and every week.

1907
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,760
But we want to automate all that and improve that and make

1908
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,260
our process just a little more slicker, a little easier

1909
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:26,440
to get shows out the door.

1910
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,980
And then we want to release all of it.

1911
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,640
So to start, I have a couple of bits

1912
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,240
that I want to draw your attention to.

1913
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,200
Number one is we need a name.

1914
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,680
We need a name for a system that automatically publishes shows.

1915
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:39,680
And I'd like it to be something we could refer to on Air.

1916
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,760
It's like we have JBot, for example.

1917
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,700
We have these other components, which

1918
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:49,160
are well-known components because we've named them.

1919
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:52,340
So I'm trying to come up with a good name for this system.

1920
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:53,920
We've got a code name, but I don't even

1921
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,640
want to say what it is.

1922
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,440
I don't want to even spoil it with the code name.

1923
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,080
So we've created a form that we'll

1924
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:02,600
have linked in the show notes, linuxunplugged.com slash 271.

1925
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,400
I also just linked it in the IRC room.

1926
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,900
And it's just, what's your nickname?

1927
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,780
Because you just want to give somebody credit.

1928
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:11,120
And what's your suggestion for the automation system's name?

1929
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,000
What should we name it?

1930
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,240
And I think if we get a bunch of good ones in there,

1931
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,040
we'll take like the top five or something,

1932
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,040
and then we'll put it to a vote in the episode

1933
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:21,200
when I get back from EPSD, if I survive all the Linus jokes.

1934
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,200
But we need your help.

1935
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,560
We can't do the naming and all the work of doing.

1936
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,240
We tried, actually.

1937
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,240
That's just too much.

1938
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,480
We tried, and we already bombed.

1939
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,680
We couldn't come up with any names that were catchy that

1940
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,360
would be like a good term.

1941
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,640
Because the idea is we're going to publish this up

1942
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,080
on our GitHub page, and we're going

1943
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,600
to make it available for anybody that

1944
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,200
wants to make it a system that automates from show notes

1945
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,560
to publishing.

1946
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,560
And that's a pretty nuanced process, especially one

1947
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,720
that involves album art, and tags, and descriptions,

1948
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:53,600
and chapter markers, and videos, and MP3s, and YouTube,

1949
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,900
and CDNs, and a lot of different services

1950
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,280
that need integration.

1951
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:01,340
Yeah, so there's a lot actually to it that solves problems.

1952
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,720
And so we want it to be available,

1953
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,800
but we want it to go by a name.

1954
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,320
So we're hoping you'll help us name it.

1955
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,280
And then we have a bit of a direction change.

1956
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,200
And Mumble Room, this is completely

1957
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,600
open to your interpretation and your pushback

1958
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,920
if you think I'm making the wrong decision here.

1959
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:20,780
So floor is open to dissenters on this next one here.

1960
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:23,600
But I had me a think recently.

1961
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,160
It's funny really how this kind of works out.

1962
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:30,120
So Eric, the IT guy, has dutifully

1963
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:34,000
built us a very nice GitLab instance

1964
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,680
on a pretty beefy DigitalOcean droplet.

1965
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,920
And I bought a cool domain, jupytercode.io, right?

1966
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,060
I mean, that's pretty cool.

1967
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:44,600
And we were all pretty hot to trot on this.

1968
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,640
And it really came up right around the time

1969
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,680
Microsoft announced their purchase of GitHub.

1970
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:53,040
And the infad thing to do was to abandon GitHub

1971
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,640
and go grow your own GitLab instance.

1972
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,440
And we thought, yeah, we should do that, too.

1973
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,200
We should be hosting our own stuff.

1974
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,800
And so he built a great one, and we got backups turned on.

1975
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,080
I mean, it's really well done.

1976
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,400
We've got some projects on there we started with.

1977
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:11,080
And I started having a think last night.

1978
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,380
And I was chatting with Wes.

1979
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,280
And I was looking at our public GitHub page,

1980
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:17,000
github.com slash jupyterbroadcasting.

1981
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,280
Like, you know, there's the caster soundboard on here,

1982
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,200
which I'd love for it to get more attention.

1983
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,960
There's the Roku app on here.

1984
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,960
There's the Kodi plug-in on here.

1985
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,520
There's already groups and people that have been involved.

1986
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,400
There's open issues.

1987
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:36,480
Like, this page has been cultivating a small community.

1988
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,240
And the reason we were standing up a GitLab instance

1989
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:42,040
was because of this anti-Microsoft hysteria.

1990
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:44,000
And I started having this conversation with Wes.

1991
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,200
And I'm thinking, is it actually easier for discovery,

1992
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,120
for the general public, if we have it on GitHub

1993
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,300
when people are looking for this stuff?

1994
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:54,120
Like, if we build a few tools, because this automation system

1995
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,920
is one of a few tools we're going to be talking about soon,

1996
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,460
we're going to talk about another tool next week

1997
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,300
that we're building.

1998
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,840
And we're going to also release this open source.

1999
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,040
And by the way, we mean GPL.

2000
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,620
We want it to be publicly discoverable.

2001
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:11,200
We want it to be something that people can get easy access to.

2002
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,440
And so I just asked Wes.

2003
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:17,260
I'm like, pros and cons here, Wes, versus GitLab versus GitHub.

2004
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:18,680
And we had a few back and forth.

2005
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,800
Like you mentioned, there's a few tools

2006
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,100
we could probably use with GitLab

2007
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:22,560
that we might not use with GitHub.

2008
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,080
I don't remember exactly what they were.

2009
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,240
I mean, there's a lot of integrated services

2010
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,040
with GitLab, right?

2011
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,280
There's CI stuff.

2012
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,160
There's a lot of tweaking you can do,

2013
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,800
because it's a thing you're running yourself.

2014
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,180
And GitHub's not that way.

2015
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:35,400
Plus, there's the geek credit of running something yourself

2016
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,840
versus using a hosted service.

2017
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,880
And it was all open source.

2018
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,880
So we were talking about the pros and cons of it.

2019
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,920
And sure enough, I go over to RLinux,

2020
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,080
because I'm having a chat with Wes in one tab.

2021
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,440
And then the other time I go over to RLinux,

2022
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:49,440
I'm just kind of putzing around while waiting for his thoughts.

2023
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,960
And I see a thread in there.

2024
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:55,780
And it's all caps, reminder, migrate off of GitHub.

2025
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:57,520
And then it's a thread of over 100

2026
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:02,400
reactionary, knee-jerk, anti-Microsoft comments.

2027
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,220
Nobody's giving a good technical reason

2028
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:05,420
why they should migrate off.

2029
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:07,760
Everybody is just knee-jerk reacting

2030
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:09,000
to the Microsoft purchase.

2031
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,360
They just hate Microsoft.

2032
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,640
And I think I don't want to be part of that anymore.

2033
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:19,000
At what point do we allow for the possibility of change?

2034
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,440
Open source and free software should

2035
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:25,040
be as much of a social thing as it is a technical thing.

2036
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,800
And at some point, we have to own up

2037
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,120
to that social participation factor.

2038
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,240
If we don't, we just seem bigoted and stuck in the mud.

2039
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,120
And I'm sorry if that comes off as offensive.

2040
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,440
But when I read that thread, I was offended.

2041
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,880
I couldn't process it anymore.

2042
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,920
It was just hate for hate's sake.

2043
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,400
There was no logical argument.

2044
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,560
Like, the reasons we were bringing up

2045
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:48,560
were like control over our own instance,

2046
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,800
integration with external tools, the geek cred

2047
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,720
for having itself hosted, being divorced

2048
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,400
from a commercial platform.

2049
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,000
Like, those were the advantages.

2050
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,600
But that thread had none of that.

2051
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,960
It was just the Microsoft hate.

2052
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,280
And then I felt a little dirty for even taking this endeavor

2053
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,600
because of it was just the thing to do.

2054
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,140
It was the end thing, the wave to do.

2055
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:10,720
It was like, let's do it.

2056
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,220
Let's do it.

2057
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:14,200
And Eric was more than willing to build it for us.

2058
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,480
And so we ran.

2059
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:18,040
And then I look back at it now after a cooling off period,

2060
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,440
and I thought, we could actually be doing ourselves harm.

2061
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,080
There's a community that's already establishing and growing

2062
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:23,640
there.

2063
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,920
There's people that have already been submitting issues.

2064
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,320
There's developers who are contributing things.

2065
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,000
And it's discoverable on a public forum.

2066
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,160
And in the end of the day, it just doesn't make it confusing

2067
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:37,080
either shifting everything or having stuff in multiple places

2068
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,920
was just more complexity than we were getting benefit out of.

2069
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,800
And we constantly have to make decisions over,

2070
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,840
when do we use services?

2071
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,760
Or when do we roll something ourselves?

2072
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,080
And this just isn't a huge part of the stuff.

2073
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,960
Like, we're not running a GitLab.

2074
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:52,200
It's just not something that we need to be doing.

2075
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,280
And if there's a point in time that we want to,

2076
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:54,960
GitLab's great.

2077
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,200
And we would have no problem using it.

2078
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,560
It's wonderful that we have that opportunity and that option.

2079
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,880
We may even keep a mirror just for our own backup, really.

2080
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:02,760
Something we've been checking.

2081
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,960
Well, maybe we might keep it, but just for ourselves.

2082
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,540
That's something we could totally do.

2083
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:08,600
By the way, if in next week's episode

2084
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:13,040
we mention the GitLab URL, sorry about that.

2085
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,880
We recorded that before Future Chris had

2086
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,600
changed his mind on this thing.

2087
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,880
So I don't know if that might be confusing.

2088
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:19,080
The show notes will be accurate.

2089
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,800
So you can go get actual links, even if we say the wrong thing.

2090
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,180
You know what we should do is have Joe go back and just

2091
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:26,640
record over with the right URL, which would be hilarious.

2092
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:27,560
It'll be Joe's voice.

2093
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,320
Yes, that would be so good.

2094
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,920
No, but really the URL you want to go to

2095
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,680
is going to be github.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

2096
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,160
And there's a couple things that are coming there right now.

2097
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,040
There's a new project that's up there that we'll

2098
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,360
be talking about next week.

2099
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,400
That already has a name, so that's up in public.

2100
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,400
And there's a couple of things that I myself

2101
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,720
have committed to it that I was so proud.

2102
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,440
It's possible because it's all Bash script in that case.

2103
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,160
And then Caster Soundboard is back up there again.

2104
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:54,320
And boy, oh boy, I would really love it

2105
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,520
if people wanted to take a look at Caster Soundboard.

2106
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,320
It could use some love.

2107
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,000
It is a great piece of software with a ton of potential.

2108
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,280
But the UI has got a lot going on.

2109
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:06,080
And it could really use the ability

2110
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,880
to select sound interfaces.

2111
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,860
The great thing about it is the changes

2112
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:12,460
and builds that people commit get packaged up as a snap.

2113
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:13,960
And so it is available still as a snap.

2114
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,840
So that's actually been something we've

2115
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,280
been able to use here in Studio.

2116
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,740
It just has a few tweaks.

2117
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:21,660
Like not being able to change the sound interface

2118
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:23,320
is a killer one for us.

2119
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,960
But we have projects up there, including Kodi plugins,

2120
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:26,800
all of it.

2121
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,720
We're going to try to start coming around to over time.

2122
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,260
Our mode of operation right now is

2123
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,840
we're going to fix a few things in our own house,

2124
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,080
clean up a few things, get that built,

2125
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,840
get that up on our GitHub page, and make it available to people.

2126
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,940
And then over time, expand out from there, start new projects.

2127
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:45,000
But also, we want to start contributing in other ways

2128
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,200
to other projects, maybe not just in code,

2129
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:47,920
but in other ways.

2130
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,800
So that'll all be stuff down the road.

2131
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:52,560
But for right now, it starts with you helping

2132
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,480
us name our automation system.

2133
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,520
We'll have a link, linuxunplug.com, slash 271.

2134
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,400
Or I'll drop it in the IRC again if you

2135
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,440
want to go submit a name.

2136
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:03,200
And then maybe we'll vote in a couple of weeks

2137
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,120
when I get back.

2138
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,160
Pretty excited about that.

2139
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,200
But what do you guys think in the Mumble Room

2140
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,840
as far as abandoning my plan to go to GitLab

2141
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,280
and sticking with GitHub for now?

2142
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:15,060
Does anybody have initial thoughts on that?

2143
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:18,240
Well, the thing that I would say is that the GitLab has

2144
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:22,440
a lot of more tools and better issue tracking.

2145
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:25,200
You can switch around issues and everything.

2146
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:29,120
So in that regard, I really like GitLab for that reason,

2147
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,920
not because of Microsoft owning whatever,

2148
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,240
but because of the tools.

2149
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:37,320
And I would say that Microsoft buying GitHub

2150
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:40,000
was a push to test out other stuff.

2151
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,120
But I think the test really proved it valuable.

2152
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,840
Yeah, I think that is one of the parts I'm

2153
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:52,320
the most concerned about is I was really dreaming up

2154
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,880
some great uses for the issue tracker stuff.

2155
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,080
That was an area I thought we could expand quite a bit.

2156
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,160
So maybe that's an area we still use it for.

2157
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:00,840
Right.

2158
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:02,200
I mean, this doesn't have to be permanent.

2159
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,000
I think the biggest thing is just

2160
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,440
I think we realized a little bit that we had some stuff, more

2161
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,600
stuff going for us over at GitHub that we realized.

2162
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,560
So we can build and grow there.

2163
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,760
And if we decide that GitLab is a tool that we really

2164
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:15,040
want to use, well, we already have it.

2165
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,040
Yeah, it seems like it's worth keeping around

2166
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,640
for other reasons besides just the projects,

2167
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,520
but also as sort of like a backup.

2168
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,600
And people are right in the chat room

2169
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,680
that, yes, GitLab also runs their own service as a website.

2170
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,400
So we could go host it over there.

2171
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,520
I think that's a little more comparable to just using

2172
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,040
GitHub.

2173
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,560
Due to that, it's just feature sets

2174
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,360
because they're both proprietary services.

2175
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:38,720
It comes back to the same old frustrating argument

2176
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:41,000
that seems to be particularly hard for the open source

2177
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,440
community to have, and that is the network effect.

2178
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,600
That's why people still log into Skype.

2179
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,440
That's why people still use all of these services that

2180
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:55,000
are closed and spy on you is because of the network effect.

2181
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,320
And that was the realization I had.

2182
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:00,000
It's not like it's huge over at GitHub,

2183
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,760
but it was beginning to roll.

2184
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,300
And people were interacting with it,

2185
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,600
and it was seeing some success.

2186
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,420
And I just thought, it's already starting

2187
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:07,880
to experience that network effect.

2188
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,720
Plus, you have the overall network effect

2189
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:11,320
of being on the GitHub site.

2190
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,480
People might, in some cases, just

2191
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:16,720
assume that's where you go.

2192
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:19,240
And so to me, that was the cincher.

2193
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,440
But I'm not totally convinced.

2194
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:25,640
So it's an area that's open for future consideration.

2195
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:29,040
And the nice thing is, until we get super in-depth with things

2196
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,280
like issues or wikis or other formats,

2197
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,280
as long as we're just using it for repo hosting,

2198
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,880
all of this is easy to change.

2199
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,680
Yeah, we have such a cool thing that we're

2200
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,520
working on right now that we'll talk to you

2201
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,320
about in next week's episode.

2202
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,320
But before we get out of here, I wanted

2203
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:46,960
to tell you about this Photoshop for Linux replacement

2204
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,880
that I found.

2205
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:48,920
Really, for Linux, that's not fair.

2206
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:49,400
That's not.

2207
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,120
I mean, you can use it on Linux.

2208
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,800
So that part's true.

2209
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,160
You could use it on any desktop.

2210
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:56,120
You sure can.

2211
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,320
I'm going to say it's pronounced Photopea.

2212
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,320
What about Photopea?

2213
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,400
Photopea.

2214
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,040
Oh, you're right.

2215
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,680
It's probably, god, I'm so proud of that.

2216
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,800
Honestly, I read it the same way that you did, though.

2217
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:05,560
I don't know why.

2218
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:08,000
And I don't know how, maybe they don't have guidance.

2219
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:08,640
No, no.

2220
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:09,200
No, no.

2221
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,560
There's no reason to pronounce it Photopea now

2222
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:12,440
that you say Photopea.

2223
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,880
No, you're completely right.

2224
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:14,920
You're completely right.

2225
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:17,840
It's funny, because you just don't really,

2226
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,520
you never know what's going to come out of my head.

2227
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,800
You never know what it's going to come up

2228
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,120
with when it reads something.

2229
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:23,880
So I just kind of roll with it.

2230
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,280
This looks a lot like Photoshop.

2231
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,520
And it's in your web browser.

2232
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,840
Now, I'm going to just put that out there.

2233
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:29,840
It's in your web browser.

2234
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,680
Calm down, because I know about GIMP.

2235
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:32,360
Calm down.

2236
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:33,440
I know about Inkscape.

2237
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,200
Calm down.

2238
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:35,720
I know about Corita.

2239
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,680
Let me explain myself here.

2240
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:42,160
You see, class, as I switched to Linux a while back,

2241
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:45,320
one really sticking area that I've always been fiddling with

2242
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,720
is all of the PSD files that we have.

2243
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:51,520
Every artist who's ever created anything for us ever

2244
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,480
has always sent it in a PSD file.

2245
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,400
We might get an SVG file.

2246
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,640
The only time we've ever received

2247
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:01,680
a logo that wasn't in PSD was the time

2248
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:04,000
that Dan refreshed the user error graphics

2249
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,240
and sent us something that was.

2250
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:08,840
That's literally the only time is when Daniel sent us

2251
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:09,840
something.

2252
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,960
And I assume because he made it under free software.

2253
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:15,120
I don't actually know what tool it changed.

2254
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,360
I don't think he told me.

2255
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:16,840
But anyway.

2256
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:17,240
He ducked out.

2257
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:18,920
It's probably Inkscape, though.

2258
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:19,400
Yeah.

2259
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:19,600
OK.

2260
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,520
Thanks, Cassidy.

2261
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,680
Anyways, that's literally it and everything else, everything

2262
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:26,840
from any of the shows we've ever had, any of the individual assets.

2263
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:28,640
They're all in PSD files.

2264
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:32,400
And for the most part, anything that

2265
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,200
involves complicated text editing really falls down

2266
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,280
in GIMP or Corita.

2267
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,600
Corita won't even edit the text.

2268
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:40,400
It just doesn't even happen.

2269
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,160
It'll display it, but it won't edit it.

2270
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,040
GIMP has an extremely hard time.

2271
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:47,880
And initially, I thought I'd be OK with the GIMP support

2272
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:51,440
because most things seem to be working when I would open up in GIMP.

2273
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:55,360
As time went on, I realized, especially as I would go back

2274
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:58,360
to some of the older stuff, it, in some cases, was butchering it.

2275
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,960
And I didn't know it until I would render it out and save it.

2276
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,720
And then I'd send it to somebody and say, what the hell is this?

2277
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,880
It was kind of embarrassing because I sent it to a graphic artist.

2278
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:07,120
And I'm like, what the hell is this?

2279
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,480
They're like, what are you talking about?

2280
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:09,680
It's not that bad of a logo.

2281
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:12,240
I mean, I know I think it could use a refresh.

2282
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,680
And then they sent it back to me.

2283
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,760
So I essentially started down the path of trying

2284
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,200
to get Photoshop working under wine, which, boy, is that a backache.

2285
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:22,720
Just a lot of one.

2286
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:25,600
If you can get your hands on Photoshop 7, which I could not.

2287
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,560
You know, I don't spend a lot of time checking the backs of trucks

2288
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,560
on the internet anymore.

2289
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:35,800
Free Software has dulled my skills of finding Windows, Juarez.

2290
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,280
And so I could not find Photoshop 7.

2291
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,080
It made me feel like an old man.

2292
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:43,480
And trying to get Creative Cloud installed under Linux is a joke.

2293
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:46,120
So I'm really glad I'm getting the full benefit out

2294
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:48,320
of that Creative Cloud subscription.

2295
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:51,120
Kept digging around for alternatives, trying to figure out if I could just

2296
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:54,960
really what I did is I spent the most time trying to make it work under Kim.

2297
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:59,400
Eventually, though, I came around to Photopea, Photopea.com.

2298
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:03,080
It was a bit of a shaggy dog discovery because I first discovered them

2299
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:05,840
on GitHub as I was going through GitHub looking at different projects

2300
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,380
and their PSD support.

2301
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:09,640
And they have some open source projects, which maybe I'll get

2302
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:13,320
Wes to talk about here in a second, but their main core application

2303
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,320
is not open source.

2304
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,640
It is closed source.

2305
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:18,440
And so I just happened to check out their website for some reason

2306
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:22,320
and discovered that they basically have built Photoshop in the web browser.

2307
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:27,920
And it has full support for PSD files, for GIMP XCF files, for.sketch files,

2308
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:32,120
for any SVG, TIFF, JPEG, PNG, DNG, you name it.

2309
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,600
It's got support for it.

2310
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,160
And it'll open them up from your local machine.

2311
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:38,600
You don't have to upload it to a cloud storage first.

2312
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,360
It'll upload it from your local file system.

2313
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:41,800
Yeah, this all just happens locally.

2314
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,520
It's just a JavaScript app running.

2315
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,960
There's not a cloud component.

2316
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,920
You can actually disconnect your computer from the internet

2317
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,160
once this app is loaded.

2318
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:51,600
And as long as you don't close the tab, it will continue to work.

2319
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:52,580
It's pretty great.

2320
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:58,620
And I was able to open up a Photoshop file that has always only worked

2321
01:31:58,620 --> 01:31:59,840
under Photoshop.

2322
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,120
I'm telling you guys, I was getting so desperate.

2323
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:04,120
I was preparing to do the Mac in the cloud.

2324
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,200
Have you heard about this service?

2325
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:05,840
I do.

2326
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,120
This is something that Mike told me about on Coda Radio.

2327
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:10,640
This is his solution, because he switched over to elementary OS

2328
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:11,880
as his daily driver.

2329
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:15,000
But he's still got to build and sign iOS applications for his customers.

2330
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,160
And you've got to be on a Mac.

2331
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:19,900
So he got a Mac and a cloud subscription, where it's just like a Mac mini

2332
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:22,280
that he gets accelerated remote desktop.

2333
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:25,400
So there's just some racks of Mac minis out there just so people can do them.

2334
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,120
Yeah.

2335
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,480
And he's able to do it through his web browser on his Linux desktop.

2336
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:29,960
Nice.

2337
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:34,080
So I was thinking, that is a ridiculous way

2338
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:37,240
to get access to all of these legacy PSD files.

2339
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:41,960
But I was starting to consider it, because about once a week,

2340
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:44,800
I need access to something in this catalog.

2341
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:46,880
And I generally need access right away, because it's

2342
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,360
somebody asking me for something, or a show needs to go out,

2343
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,560
and it needs something.

2344
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,800
And I thought, OK, maybe this is one way I could avoid this.

2345
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:56,480
If I can't find Photoshop 7, I was desperate.

2346
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:59,400
So when I came across Photopea, and I opened up that PSD file,

2347
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:04,520
I edited that text field, and then I saved it out as a JPEG,

2348
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:06,520
I signed up for the Pro account.

2349
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:09,240
And I got you in there, and I got Joe in there,

2350
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:10,360
and I got Brent in there.

2351
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:14,360
So that way, we could all try it out and really kind of kick

2352
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:15,720
the tires on this thing.

2353
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:18,800
And before we get into some of the open source projects they're involved in,

2354
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,200
I kind of want to hear what Brent thought of it.

2355
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,720
Because I got to imagine there's been times, Brent, when

2356
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:25,800
you're working with photos, you've wished that Photoshop

2357
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,280
has been available for Linux.

2358
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,200
Not that GIMP isn't great, but that's got to have crossed your mind.

2359
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,600
And I'm wondering if this scratched that itch a little bit,

2360
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,200
or if it fell short for you.

2361
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,720
Good question.

2362
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:39,240
My first reaction to this was, well, it's not actually that interesting to me,

2363
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,840
because I've been on open source software for such a long time,

2364
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:47,240
and I work basically all in my own little silo.

2365
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,680
But then I was thinking about all these little edge cases.

2366
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:52,760
And I remember when I was switching from Photoshop

2367
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,160
and those proprietary tools into open source,

2368
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:59,960
it was this strange gray area where a lot of the work that I was doing

2369
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:01,960
was still in PSDs and things like that.

2370
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:06,240
And then I was trying to move over without necessarily having

2371
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:09,720
a license to the software, because I was trying to get away from it.

2372
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:11,280
So then I thought, oh, wait a second.

2373
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,600
This actually might be really useful for a lot of people.

2374
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:18,880
And surprisingly, it is fairly functional for, I guess,

2375
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,720
what could be described as a web application.

2376
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:25,040
Yeah, I opened up some PDFs in there, opened some various just random images

2377
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,320
that I have.

2378
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,160
It's pretty nice.

2379
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,400
I will also say that they do a good job.

2380
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:32,480
It's fairly responsive, especially for a browser app.

2381
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:35,920
And when you're loading something like a PostScript file or a PDF

2382
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,600
and it doesn't have the right fonts, it's very clear about what's happening,

2383
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,520
which ones you're missing and what it's substituting.

2384
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:41,400
Yes, thank you for bringing that up.

2385
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,120
Because one of the things it will do is it will go out

2386
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:45,840
to various resources on the internet and try to match it.

2387
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:49,560
And if it can't, it'll try to match it with the closest free alternative,

2388
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:50,520
which is pretty neat.

2389
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:51,200
That is nice.

2390
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,360
It's a nice system there.

2391
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:56,400
So all in all, Brent, any other impressions you took away from using it?

2392
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,080
Did it feel like a decent tool to you?

2393
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,560
Or did it feel a little weak?

2394
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,200
Yeah, when you asked me to look at this,

2395
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:03,680
I actually ended up taking a whole bunch of notes

2396
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:06,060
because I thought, oh, jeez, this is really interesting.

2397
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:09,720
So my first observation is that I ended up

2398
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:12,440
using a whole bunch of keyboard shortcuts, which

2399
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:16,240
is how I usually use GIMP or Darktable and things like that.

2400
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:22,800
But I ended up about half of them worked in this web UI, which was great.

2401
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:27,600
But then I kept trying to zoom in and stuff, which is just control and scrolling.

2402
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,760
And then I ended up, it didn't quite work.

2403
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,600
So I took that at first like, oh, that's kind of a bummer.

2404
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,200
But then I thought, oh, wait.

2405
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:38,480
I feel so at home in this web app that my brain doesn't even

2406
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:43,120
know the difference between using the web app and a native application.

2407
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,160
So I thought, oh, jeez, they're doing a good job here if I can't even,

2408
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:48,680
you know, I forget after 30 seconds.

2409
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:52,080
Yeah, you could wrap it up in a Native Fire script

2410
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,040
and get away with thinking it was a local application with layer

2411
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,400
palettes and colored settings.

2412
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,680
It's a complicated UI.

2413
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:59,920
I mean, it's an impressive little app.

2414
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,480
And so they do have a few things they're contributing open source

2415
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:03,080
that you found.

2416
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,600
Yeah, they have a GitHub account.

2417
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,200
I mean, again, it was easy to find as a result of that.

2418
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:10,080
Just nothing crazy, but they've got some typesetting scripts

2419
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:13,560
to work with OTF or TrueType fonts.

2420
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:14,960
They've got a TIFF decoder.

2421
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,280
You can go poke around and see.

2422
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:18,960
It's a lot of gnarly JavaScript.

2423
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:21,120
Yeah, it's some really complicated stuff.

2424
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:23,360
But then again, that's exactly the kind of thing

2425
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,640
you want somebody else to do all the hard lifting on.

2426
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:27,240
I was excited, honestly, just for, you know,

2427
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,040
there's all kinds of, I know how to convert files, right?

2428
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:29,880
I know how to use GIMP.

2429
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,320
Like, if I need to make an ICO or I

2430
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:32,720
need to convert something for someone,

2431
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:33,920
I have the tools to do that.

2432
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,000
But if you already have access to this,

2433
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,880
it can also be really nice for users when, like,

2434
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,280
you can load from a URL, then you

2435
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,560
could quickly save out another file

2436
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,280
that you needed to convert, even on whatever computer you're at.

2437
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,800
So that part seems nice, too.

2438
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,320
There's a couple other interesting things about it,

2439
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:47,560
just as we wrap up.

2440
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:51,000
Number one is they offer it as a white label service.

2441
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,520
So you can white label this and re-post it.

2442
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:58,320
And then they also offer a decent API.

2443
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,040
So you could.

2444
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,160
We'll have to play with that.

2445
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,880
Yeah, it's a photo editor with an API in the web browser,

2446
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:07,640
Photopea, if you want it, P-E-A, if you want to try it out.

2447
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:10,800
And again, I'm not saying it's replacing your GIMP.

2448
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,680
I'm saying it's supplementing when sometimes that PSD

2449
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:15,280
file just won't open.

2450
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:17,640
Or you want something that works a little bit more

2451
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:18,680
like Photoshop 7.

2452
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:21,680
So if your brain knows that Photoshop 7 style layout,

2453
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:22,640
this is pretty much it.

2454
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:24,280
It's like Photoshop Lite a little bit.

2455
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:27,880
Just the stuff you actually used in Photoshop.

2456
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:30,000
There are two other things I really liked about it

2457
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,800
that I just want to mention quickly.

2458
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:34,360
One of them, which is I tend to read terms of services

2459
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:35,360
for these things.

2460
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:36,920
And it was nice and short and concise.

2461
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:39,520
But one of the things I loved was one of the first lines

2462
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,440
was the content is yours.

2463
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,360
These terms, I'm going to read it now.

2464
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,720
These terms don't grant us.

2465
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:47,120
And we don't claim any ownership rights on your content,

2466
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:48,960
which some of the other applications,

2467
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,080
it's a gray area there.

2468
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,080
Yeah, good catch.

2469
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:51,680
Good thinking.

2470
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:52,840
I bet you would check that.

2471
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:56,960
Well, that's an important part of any creative audience.

2472
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,840
But then the other part that, Chris, I think

2473
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:01,680
you would really like this is if you end up

2474
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:03,480
logging in with one of the accounts

2475
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:07,000
that they support, which is Google or Facebook or GitHub.

2476
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,360
GitHub I thought was interesting.

2477
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:11,160
But they will store your preferences

2478
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:13,200
across different sessions.

2479
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:14,920
So you can be on multiple computers

2480
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:16,920
and still have all of your preferences

2481
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:19,280
synced between all of those, which I thought was great.

2482
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:20,320
I do like that.

2483
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:21,160
I do like that.

2484
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:25,360
That is, this is probably how I will be tweaking show art

2485
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,400
while I'm on the road, I think, to meet BSD.

2486
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,440
I think this is what I'm going to do.

2487
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:30,720
This is probably it right here.

2488
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,520
Well, thank you, Brent, for taking a look.

2489
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:33,480
I like that.

2490
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:36,920
Go get more Popey and Mr. Wimpy and Mark II

2491
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:38,200
over at the Ubuntu podcast.

2492
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,600
Wimpy, you know what you ought to do

2493
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,960
is you ought to invite that Dan Fore guy on the show.

2494
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:44,240
And you should ask him the really hard questions.

2495
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:46,080
Spoilers.

2496
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,720
I'm just saying you should think about it.

2497
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:48,720
Just think about it.

2498
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:49,200
I'm not saying.

2499
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,120
Already thought about it.

2500
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:50,640
Oh, OK.

2501
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:52,920
Check back in in two days' time.

2502
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,160
Oh, you know.

2503
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:54,760
Are you kidding?

2504
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,080
I listen on day one.

2505
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,360
I listen the day it comes out.

2506
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,000
I will.

2507
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,440
Yeah, I listen on Thursday.

2508
01:38:59,440 --> 01:38:59,960
Good, good.

2509
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:04,760
And Cassidy, anywhere you want to send folks to check out,

2510
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:05,600
I don't know.

2511
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,360
You got a new release.

2512
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,240
You got a Patreon page.

2513
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:08,200
You got a lot going on.

2514
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:09,580
You got a machine.

2515
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:10,920
You're raising funds for anything

2516
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,080
you want to just give a plug out to.

2517
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,680
Give it out there because you've stayed for the whole show.

2518
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,440
You deserve it.

2519
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:19,080
I mean, just head to elementary.io to check out Juno.

2520
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:22,200
And there's the release post is linked to from there.

2521
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:25,760
And otherwise, you can find me at Twitter.com

2522
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:29,240
slash CassidyJames or over on the soon-to-be-dead Google

2523
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:31,760
Plus at CassidyJames as well.

2524
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:32,480
Too soon.

2525
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,280
Hey, you know what?

2526
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,760
By the way, I was following your tweets about the Pixel 3

2527
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:36,280
camera.

2528
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:37,320
You are right.

2529
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:39,160
That is some amazing stuff.

2530
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:40,200
It's pretty bonkers.

2531
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:40,800
It is.

2532
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:41,440
It is.

2533
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,760
So Cassidy was calling out some of the tricks they're doing.

2534
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:44,680
It's just incredible.

2535
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:45,640
You're going to make me get one.

2536
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:46,280
Yeah, yeah.

2537
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:48,080
Go read his Twitter feed.

2538
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,440
You're going to be pretty impressed.

2539
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:49,720
All right.

2540
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:51,080
Well, I'll mention my Twitter.

2541
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:52,080
I'm at Chris Elias.

2542
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:52,960
He's at Westpane.

2543
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,600
You can go get more of him at techsnap.systems.

2544
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,520
And of course, everything we talked about today

2545
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,960
linked at linuxunplugged.com slash 271,

2546
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,360
including your name submissions for our project.

2547
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:04,000
We really do want those.

2548
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,600
I'll be out at MeetBSD next week,

2549
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:08,320
but we will have a recorded episode released for you.

2550
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,560
And then I'll be back the Tuesday after that

2551
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,040
with our regular live show.

2552
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,840
So do come back.

2553
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:16,060
Join us in that virtual log.

2554
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:18,600
You can just Google Mumble Jupiter Colony,

2555
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:19,400
and it'll come up.

2556
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,620
It's easy peasy.

2557
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:24,240
And then the chat room during the show is irc.geekshed.net

2558
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:26,720
pound hashtag.

2559
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,240
Number sign, Jupiter Broadcasting.

2560
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:29,680
You go in there, you chat with us.

2561
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:30,920
We chat with you.

2562
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:32,280
It's a good show.

2563
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:33,480
It's a good time.

2564
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:35,840
But it's even better if you're there.

2565
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,400
It's even better.

2566
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:38,400
Thanks for joining us.

2567
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:41,000
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

2568
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:46,620
Take care.

2569
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:21,820
Oh, it's a big show. That's one of our longer ones just happen, and I just told John

2570
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:23,820
I'm gonna try to keep it to an hour 10

2571
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:29,480
You're just trolling a male. You know what's funny is we recorded two Linux unplugs last week

2572
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:34,740
We had the regular show and then we had to make the the makeup show for the week that we're I'm out and we're like

2573
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:37,880
What the hell are we gonna talk about? We're gonna have no show next week. We just did two shows boom

2574
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:42,700
There's a huge show but echo we were talking on the pre show about KX studio a little bit

2575
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:46,060
Which has been helpful and we're gonna talk about that next week a little bit

2576
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:48,060
It's been helpful for us here in the studio

2577
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:54,900
And you were saying that that is a one-person shop over at cake studio, which is mind-blowing. Yeah, it's a fault

2578
01:41:54,900 --> 01:42:00,580
Fuck FA out. I forget. He's like super cool in the IRC. He's been really helpful

2579
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:06,980
Although man fuck TX otherwise known as Felipe Kaleo. That is that wow that is amazing a lot of hard work

2580
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:13,180
It's a kick studio is a great set of plugins and repositories and packages to make audio production and real-time audio production

2581
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:20,100
Doable under Linux and it's a big part of what we're using these days. So oh man, that's great

2582
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:23,260
that's it's amazing what one person can do in open source and

2583
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:43,260
At the same time makes you really want to go over there and contribute somehow. It really does
