WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.660
You know, Wes, we've got this wonderful Apollo laptop here.

00:02.660 --> 00:07.120
This here, I got it from Entraware as an extended test here.

00:07.120 --> 00:10.280
They sent it over and I've been using it now as the main show.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.020
And it's such a nice looking laptop

00:12.020 --> 00:13.920
that I don't really want to put stickers on it

00:13.920 --> 00:16.880
because it feels like this laptop's gonna outlive

00:16.880 --> 00:18.080
any one particular sticker.

00:18.080 --> 00:18.920
Totally.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.120
So then I thought, well, you know what I'll do

00:20.120 --> 00:22.600
is I'll get those vinyl sticker mats

00:22.600 --> 00:24.440
for the whole back of the screen.

00:24.440 --> 00:25.600
It does have a nice, beautifully clean back.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.800
Yeah, and so you just get one roughly the shape

00:27.800 --> 00:30.720
of like a MacBook Pro or MacBook 13, whatever they're called.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.480
And I'll put the stickers on that.

00:32.480 --> 00:34.440
So I got a couple of different ones

00:34.440 --> 00:35.880
and you know, they take a little time to be made.

00:35.880 --> 00:36.900
So they're still getting delivered.

00:36.900 --> 00:39.120
The first one I got, I just wanted, you know,

00:39.120 --> 00:41.440
a canvas to put like cool stickers from Fests on

00:41.440 --> 00:43.480
because when you go to these Fests, you just get-

00:43.480 --> 00:44.320
Stickers abound.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.880
Yeah, so the first one I got is just a real nice,

00:46.880 --> 00:48.760
it's kind of hard to see, it looks a little blue

00:48.760 --> 00:50.020
because there's blue lighting in the studio,

00:50.020 --> 00:52.640
but it's just a wood grain vinyl sticker.

00:52.640 --> 00:53.560
You see that there, Wes?

00:53.560 --> 00:54.400
Very tasteful.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.400
Just a nice wood grain.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.560
Oh yeah.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.520
And I'll just, I thought because it's brown,

00:58.520 --> 01:00.360
white stickers would really pop on this.

01:00.360 --> 01:01.200
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.000
So this is gonna be one that I could take on and off

01:03.000 --> 01:06.120
and these can be applied and removed and then reapplied.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.080
And then the other one I got,

01:07.080 --> 01:09.080
because I thought it would maybe match my outfit

01:09.080 --> 01:10.760
very often on the Linux Action Show,

01:10.760 --> 01:11.920
is a red plaid sticker.

01:11.920 --> 01:12.760
You see that? Yeah.

01:12.760 --> 01:14.960
I got a red plaid for the back of the Apollo.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.520
So I can be wearing red plaid

01:16.520 --> 01:18.320
and the Apollo can be a red plaid

01:18.320 --> 01:20.280
and it can be double red plaid and last now.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.120
This is amazing, Chris.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.640
Yeah, I'm really happy about this one too.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.240
So that'll be going on the back of the Apollo.

01:25.240 --> 01:26.400
That'll be the first one I'm rocking.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.360
I'm really excited for a red plaid.

01:28.360 --> 01:30.720
Yes, thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:30.720 --> 01:35.720
This is Linux Unplugged episode 136 for March 15th, 2016.

01:35.720 --> 01:56.720
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's getting in Lady Jupiter and going to pick up the ham radio. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. That's my plan at least, we'll see.

01:56.720 --> 02:05.720
The weekend before Linux Fest Northwest, I'm going to see if Noah wants to take a road trip in Lady Jupiter and go pick up ham radio to help assemble the Linux Fest crew.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.720
Guess what, Wes? Big show today.

02:07.720 --> 02:08.720
Yeah, huge show.

02:08.720 --> 02:09.720
Big show.

02:09.720 --> 02:11.720
You know, there's a few things we need to talk about.

02:11.720 --> 02:16.720
Some new Linux hardware that people are really excited about and we're going to talk about some of the interesting things around that.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.720
Mozilla's got something new that I'm really looking forward to, excited to share that.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.720
Later on in the show, we'll talk about our Snappy future

02:23.720 --> 02:29.720
and if these Snap packages, Snappy packages are really, you know, they are coming, are they really advantageous?

02:29.720 --> 02:37.720
There actually seems to be a pretty good solid pro and cons list and there's one potential thing that sort of reeks of issues of the past.

02:37.720 --> 02:42.720
We'll discuss that and a few of the security issues around Snappy packages. See what people think. See what they think, Wes.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.720
Absolutely.

02:43.720 --> 03:01.720
And then, I've been tracking a particular drama since about 2013, gnome client-side decorations, love them or hate them. Starting in Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu Mate will have, or Mate, will have support for client-side decorations, pop over menus, shadows around borders.

03:01.720 --> 03:02.720
So much fanciness.

03:02.720 --> 03:08.720
Yeah, Wimpy spent some time getting everything up to snuff and we're going to talk about client-side decorations a little more.

03:08.720 --> 03:16.720
Not going to spend a lot of time on it, but we're just going to talk a little bit about why a traditional-style desktop like Ubuntu Mate might be doing something like this.

03:16.720 --> 03:20.720
So we got all of that, plus we got the updates to do before we get into the show.

03:20.720 --> 03:23.720
It's just too much stuff, Wes. It's too much stuff.

03:23.720 --> 03:24.720
Let's get started.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.720
Let's get started by bringing in that mumble room. Type of probably a Green's mumble room.

03:27.720 --> 03:28.720
Hello.

03:28.720 --> 03:29.720
Hello.

03:29.720 --> 03:30.720
Good evening.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.720
Hello, everybody.

03:31.720 --> 03:35.720
So, guys, Wes brought something real special into the studio today.

03:35.720 --> 03:43.720
As hosts of your virtual Lug, we like to have a couple of brewskis because, really, I don't know if you've ever been to a meetup or a Lug.

03:43.720 --> 03:44.720
I have.

03:44.720 --> 03:48.720
But the best ones that I've been to were at a restaurant where they were serving beer.

03:48.720 --> 03:51.720
Usually they're at schools or libraries.

03:51.720 --> 03:52.720
Something a little more tame.

03:52.720 --> 03:53.720
Yeah.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.720
You can't really let your Linux flag fly.

03:55.720 --> 03:56.720
No, that's right. That's right.

03:56.720 --> 04:02.720
That's what I like about Linux Unplugged's virtual Lug is you get to bring your own booze and we like to just have a beer.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.720
We're not going crazy. We're not getting stupid.

04:04.720 --> 04:05.720
We have a show to do.

04:05.720 --> 04:08.720
Actually, I mean, we do sometimes get stupid, but that's not related to the beer.

04:08.720 --> 04:09.720
No.

04:09.720 --> 04:13.720
So, Wes brought two couple of unique beers in, both from the same brewery but different types.

04:13.720 --> 04:18.720
Mine is the Ribstop Rye Pills from Basecamp Brewery out of Portland, Oregon, Wes.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.720
They even put their GPS coordinates on the metal can.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.720
Easy to find.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.720
Yeah, so there you go.

04:23.720 --> 04:27.720
And then Wes is drinking the Intense IPL.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.720
Intense, like a tent.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.720
Whoa.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.720
Hey.

04:31.720 --> 04:32.720
Fun city over here.

04:32.720 --> 04:33.720
From Basecamp.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.720
I got a score of 85 on your brewskis and I got a BA of 85 on mine.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.720
So, both rated very good from the beer advocate community.

04:39.720 --> 04:40.720
And these bottles are beautiful.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.720
Very beautiful and I'm really enjoying this beer.

04:42.720 --> 04:43.720
Yeah, right?

04:43.720 --> 04:44.720
Yeah, it's really a good beer.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.720
So, anyways, Basecamp out of Portland, Oregon, great beer to go with your Linux.

04:48.720 --> 04:54.720
Wes, you know I spotted this story a couple of days ago and I dropped it in our thread and I said we got to talk about this thing.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.720
Here it is right here.

04:56.720 --> 04:57.720
I got this here.

04:57.720 --> 05:00.720
This is the – this one here is the Raspberry Pi 2.

05:00.720 --> 05:01.720
Could you tell by looking at it?

05:01.720 --> 05:02.720
Can you tell?

05:02.720 --> 05:02.720
No.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.720
There's a couple of ways you can tell.

05:05.720 --> 05:08.720
If you look at the Raspberry Pi, there's a little –

05:08.720 --> 05:10.720
A field guide to the Raspberry Pi.

05:10.720 --> 05:11.720
This is your quick guide right here.

05:11.720 --> 05:20.720
If you want to know if it's a Raspberry 1, 2, or 3, you know it's a Raspberry Pi 3 on the – if there's a little Wi-Fi, a little white Wi-Fi antenna right there and then nothing on the corresponding side.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.720
That's one quick way.

05:21.720 --> 05:25.720
Also, this HDMI port has this little color thing on there that's not there on the number one.

05:25.720 --> 05:35.720
Anyway, so the Raspberry Pi 3, pretty nice device, but the first thing I thought when I saw this thing was, geez, I really now want the ability to boot from USB storage.

05:35.720 --> 05:36.720
Yeah.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.720
I'm sick of the SD card thing.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.720
I want just a big disk.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.720
Turns out that was actually a feature they enabled in the Raspberry Pi 3.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.720
Really?

05:43.720 --> 05:45.720
And Western Digital didn't take any time.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.720
They're capitalizing on this.

05:47.720 --> 05:52.720
They got a $46, 314-gigabyte hard drive built just for the Raspberry Pi.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.720
The Pi drive.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.720
It's based on a Western Digital Blue.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.720
And one of the things that's kind of unique about it is its interface.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.720
It's got a little – see the little USB interface there?

06:01.720 --> 06:03.720
It's a slim profile drive.

06:03.720 --> 06:04.720
Oh, that's cute.

06:04.720 --> 06:05.720
Yeah.

06:05.720 --> 06:11.720
They say it would normally cost about $45 a gigabyte – no, I'm sorry, $45 for the drive.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.720
They're selling it right now at $34.42.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.720
Seven-millimeter high drive.

06:17.720 --> 06:22.720
It's just based on the regular blue drives that you'd see in a laptop.

06:22.720 --> 06:27.720
They're going to also include with a Berry bootloader to make it easier to run multiple

06:27.720 --> 06:29.720
OSes from the same drive hooked up to your Pi.

06:29.720 --> 06:30.720
Huh.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.720
That's funny.

06:31.720 --> 06:32.720
Yeah.

06:32.720 --> 06:33.720
And I was watching –

06:33.720 --> 06:34.720
I could see that getting included in some of those kits, though.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.720
Mm-hmm.

06:35.720 --> 06:36.720
Mm-hmm.

06:36.720 --> 06:37.720
For sure.

06:37.720 --> 06:38.720
I was watching in my Google Plus feed.

06:38.720 --> 06:39.720
A lot of people are ordering this.

06:39.720 --> 06:40.720
Yeah.

06:40.720 --> 06:41.720
So people are excited about this.

06:41.720 --> 06:42.720
Bummer.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.720
Anybody seen this?

06:43.720 --> 06:44.720
Would you add a hard drive to your Raspberry Pi?

06:44.720 --> 06:45.720
You know, $46.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.720
You get 314 gigabytes.

06:47.720 --> 06:54.720
I definitely would if I had one just to be able to do what I want to do with it.

06:54.720 --> 06:55.720
Is that a media center?

06:55.720 --> 06:57.720
Because that was one of my first thoughts was – yeah.

06:57.720 --> 06:58.720
Yeah.

06:58.720 --> 06:59.720
Media center, pretty much.

06:59.720 --> 07:06.680
You know, just have something small or maybe I want to do media center and IRC local server.

07:06.680 --> 07:09.480
You know, I could do two things with it easily.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.680
That's also enough for like if you kept this as your on-the-go media server, you could

07:12.680 --> 07:14.080
sync down from Plex or whatever.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.080
That's what I was just going to say.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.400
That's enough for a pretty reasonable moving library.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.200
I've been coming up with – I've been trying to come up with a solution for an offline

07:20.200 --> 07:24.360
storage for my library that makes it easy to work with and being able to hang something

07:24.360 --> 07:27.960
off a Raspberry Pi moves that Raspberry Pi up a notch in my list.

07:27.960 --> 07:28.960
Pretty cool.

07:28.960 --> 07:32.160
And the price, $46 for your 314 gigabytes.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.400
My first hard drive was 20 megabytes.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.400
So –

07:35.400 --> 07:36.400
Yeah.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.400
Is that still in production?

07:37.400 --> 07:38.400
Is that –

07:38.400 --> 07:39.400
No.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.400
No.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.400
No.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.400
Wes, have you heard of Servo?

07:42.400 --> 07:43.400
Yes, I have.

07:43.400 --> 07:47.400
I'm actually legitimately excited about Servo because we finally got ourselves – well,

07:47.400 --> 07:49.560
a rough ship date of like June, was it?

07:49.560 --> 07:50.560
I think.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.560
June.

07:51.560 --> 07:52.560
June.

07:52.560 --> 07:53.560
Servo –

07:53.560 --> 07:54.560
That's very specific.

07:54.560 --> 07:55.560
June.

07:55.560 --> 07:56.560
Which could be like the very end of June.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.560
I don't even know if there's a – I mean, I assume they mean this June, but I don't

07:57.560 --> 07:58.560
know if it's said.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.560
Could be.

07:59.560 --> 08:00.560
Hey, June.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.560
Yeah.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.560
Could be.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.000
It could be like June 2018.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.760
Servo is a modern – a permanent – modern performant browser engine designed to be

08:10.760 --> 08:12.440
super fast.

08:12.440 --> 08:18.440
Everything is of multi-process, but outside of that, it's built on Rust, which is interesting,

08:18.440 --> 08:20.440
which I think is maybe the most interesting thing about it.

08:20.440 --> 08:24.200
It's coming out of the Mozilla Research Division and they're building it for Linux

08:24.200 --> 08:26.320
and – what's that?

08:26.320 --> 08:27.320
The Mac and Android.

08:27.320 --> 08:28.320
You know, it's funny.

08:28.320 --> 08:32.960
They don't list Windows on here, but they do say Linux, 64-bit Linux.

08:32.960 --> 08:33.960
64-bit Linux.

08:33.960 --> 08:34.960
And Firefox OS.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.400
What are you looking forward – well, yeah, sure, sure.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.920
What are you looking forward to with Servo?

08:38.920 --> 08:42.680
I think it's just neat to see like a project of this scale being built in Rust.

08:42.680 --> 08:44.560
I've enjoyed following Rust's development.

08:44.560 --> 08:49.260
I think it's a neat new systems language with a lot of interesting features.

08:49.260 --> 08:50.260
So it'll be neat.

08:50.260 --> 08:51.260
I don't know.

08:51.260 --> 08:57.440
And Gecko is cool, but everyone is – it's WebKit these days or Blink or whatever.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.560
So it's kind of interesting to see Mozilla pursuing something new and maybe if they can

09:00.560 --> 09:05.000
bring some real improvements to that scene using Rust, that'd be awesome.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.560
I would love.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.320
I haven't tried it or anything, so I don't know.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.320
Go ahead, Rodden.

09:09.320 --> 09:13.160
The cool thing about it is that Rust, the language, was actually developed because of

09:13.160 --> 09:14.160
Servo.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.160
Yeah, right.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.160
I know, which shows you how long they've been working on it, too.

09:17.160 --> 09:20.120
Hopefully that means they're getting it right.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.120
Yeah.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.120
Hopefully.

09:22.120 --> 09:25.480
The benchmarking with Red Renderer looks awesome, though.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.480
This is the thing.

09:26.480 --> 09:33.680
I mean, you guys know if I could switch my workflow over to Firefox, I would and this

09:33.680 --> 09:37.280
could be a huge step towards making people excited again about writing some of the extensions

09:37.280 --> 09:39.880
that I use on Chrome and some of that stuff.

09:39.880 --> 09:44.500
I find just totally arbitrary example that is not really any kind of real-world test

09:44.500 --> 09:46.520
other than it happens to affect me directly.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.120
When I use that web app called IRC Cloud – have you ever seen this?

09:49.120 --> 09:50.120
Yes, I have.

09:50.120 --> 09:55.000
When I use it in Firefox, if I leave the studio on a computer and I leave it running and I

09:55.000 --> 10:00.160
come back the next day, Firefox will be seized up, but not only just that, my entire desktop

10:00.160 --> 10:02.860
session will be very, very, very laggy, very laggy.

10:02.860 --> 10:04.460
Same thing happens on our GNOME web.

10:04.460 --> 10:05.460
Same thing.

10:05.460 --> 10:09.200
The same thing, which is a WebKit browser, does not happen under Chrome.

10:09.200 --> 10:14.120
In fact, I can pin it to my browser in Chrome and accidentally forget to leave it there

10:14.120 --> 10:18.120
for days and days and days and notice zero performance difference.

10:18.120 --> 10:22.280
I know this is a silly benchmark, but for me, it tells me something about the way these

10:22.280 --> 10:28.760
applications are architected, that the same exact web application in Chrome seems – yes,

10:28.760 --> 10:33.400
Chrome uses more memory up front and all of that, but at the same time, it doesn't, after

10:33.400 --> 10:35.840
a day, crash my machine.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.960
Not a very common work scenario.

10:37.960 --> 10:40.520
Not a big deal, but I think it makes a difference.

10:40.520 --> 10:44.080
Is there a possibility there's also some sort of effect here with what we see in the Linux

10:44.080 --> 10:47.680
world with firmwares, where things are tested for Windows but not Linux, are things these

10:47.680 --> 10:51.840
days kind of just being written for Chrome in mind?

10:51.840 --> 10:52.840
I don't know.

10:52.840 --> 10:53.840
Could be.

10:53.840 --> 10:54.840
Could be.

10:54.840 --> 10:55.840
Could be.

10:55.840 --> 10:56.840
Could be, yeah.

10:56.840 --> 10:59.240
So I'm looking forward to seeing them get people excited and fired up, and Servo –

10:59.240 --> 11:00.720
I'm going to try to write something in Rust.

11:00.720 --> 11:01.720
It seems fun.

11:01.720 --> 11:02.760
Yeah, and Servo looks really cool.

11:02.760 --> 11:06.600
So we like to follow – another project we like to follow is – this is sort of what

11:06.600 --> 11:10.760
this portion of the start of the show has become on Unplugged, is open source projects

11:10.760 --> 11:13.680
that we think are interesting that we follow and want to give you updates on.

11:13.680 --> 11:17.360
Kitson, you want to jump in on Chrome and using more memory before we move on?

11:17.360 --> 11:18.360
Go ahead.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.360
Yeah.

11:19.360 --> 11:22.420
I was thinking that might be why it is more performant is because it's keeping that

11:22.420 --> 11:28.520
memory fresh in the background rather than perhaps pushing it on to hard disk or swap.

11:28.520 --> 11:29.520
Right.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.520
Yeah.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.520
That could very well much.

11:31.520 --> 11:37.440
And also because even if one tab goes a little wonky, it very often does not affect the other

11:37.440 --> 11:38.840
tabs on Chrome.

11:38.840 --> 11:39.840
That could help, too.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.320
So yeah, good point.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.320
All right.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.420
So we'd like to follow the Minecraft project.

11:43.420 --> 11:47.360
The future of open source artificial intelligence, intelligence, intelligence.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.240
We often hear from Ryan in their videos.

11:49.240 --> 11:52.920
They have a new keynote style video, which doesn't work as well for me as some of their

11:52.920 --> 11:56.360
other videos, but they do have something pretty cool to announce.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.840
You heard of that X Prize there, Wes?

11:58.840 --> 11:59.840
Minecraft's going cray.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.840
Oh.

12:00.840 --> 12:05.320
So we'd like to introduce founder and CEO of Mycroft, Joshua Montgomery, to tell you

12:05.320 --> 12:07.200
about our new announcement.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.240
Thank you, Ryan.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.240
Hello, Joshua.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.240
Hello.

12:11.240 --> 12:14.880
I'm Joshua Montgomery, the founder and CEO of Mycroft AI.

12:14.880 --> 12:20.380
Mycroft has partnered with Techstars, Vocality, Sprint, Ubuntu, and Lucid Labs in the pursuit

12:20.380 --> 12:23.560
of an artificial intelligence platform for the connected home.

12:23.560 --> 12:29.680
Today, I'm pleased to announce that Mycroft will be pursuing the IBM Watson AIX Prize.

12:29.680 --> 12:35.160
The IBM Watson AIX Prize is a $5 million prize being awarded for significant accomplishments

12:35.160 --> 12:37.960
in the field of artificial intelligence.

12:37.960 --> 12:42.600
Should we win the prize, the $5 million will be donated to open source projects based on

12:42.600 --> 12:45.480
the wishes of our developer community.

12:45.480 --> 12:48.160
To win this prize, we've set a lofty goal.

12:48.160 --> 12:53.760
It's our goal to create an artificial intelligence platform that interacts with people so naturally

12:53.760 --> 12:57.520
that when you speak to it, you can't tell whether you're speaking to a machine or to

12:57.520 --> 12:58.520
a person.

12:58.520 --> 12:59.520
That's awesome.

12:59.520 --> 13:04.640
For this effort, we're providing $250,000 in resources and assigning machine learning

13:04.640 --> 13:07.960
expert Jonathan Dorlands to lead the effort.

13:07.960 --> 13:14.080
Our first milestone on the road towards this goal is the open source speech-to-text engine

13:14.080 --> 13:20.000
that takes speech and converts it into text both accurately and fast.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
We're looking for developers, students, and researchers interested in artificial intelligence

13:25.000 --> 13:28.700
and in donating time and effort to the open source community.

13:28.700 --> 13:33.760
If you're interested in working with AI and you have a passion for open source, please

13:33.760 --> 13:38.960
visit us at openstt.org to find out more information.

13:38.960 --> 13:42.680
Together we can win the IBM Watson AIX Prize.

13:42.680 --> 13:43.680
That's interesting.

13:43.680 --> 13:44.680
Thank you.

13:44.680 --> 13:45.880
There is so much going on in AI right now.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.600
It really is.

13:47.600 --> 13:54.840
Microsoft today is talking about their AIX initiative, which they're going to be training

13:54.840 --> 13:57.360
open... They're going to be some sort of... Oh, I got to look into it more.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.520
I said I was going to, and I need to.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.520
It looks very interesting.

14:02.520 --> 14:03.520
And just in our backyard.

14:03.520 --> 14:07.280
Of course, this week, Google's AlphaGo just...

14:07.280 --> 14:08.280
Where can it go?

14:08.280 --> 14:09.280
Right?

14:09.280 --> 14:14.800
It just won a four-to-one match, I guess, so the human won once.

14:14.800 --> 14:20.240
It's a really interesting week for artificial intelligence, and the MyCraft project basically

14:20.240 --> 14:21.760
seems to have news almost every week.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.760
It really does.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.760
I'm thrilled with how well they're doing.

14:24.760 --> 14:28.140
So far, I don't get a sense that they're failing to deliver.

14:28.140 --> 14:32.720
It feels like they're on track, and they're doing well.

14:32.720 --> 14:36.720
I'm a little taken aback, because not only is it rare these days, it seems like, for

14:36.720 --> 14:40.660
a Kickstarter that I've been interested or backed actually to do well...

14:40.660 --> 14:42.280
Where's the subtle disappointment?

14:42.280 --> 14:43.880
Right, right.

14:43.880 --> 14:50.400
But also, this is a really big deal for them not to F up for Linux and open source.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.960
This is an area that's been so corporate control.

14:53.960 --> 14:57.960
There's open elements to it, but all the big stuff is coming from...

14:57.960 --> 15:04.440
It's an area that has been so driven by the marketing strategies of Amazon, and Google,

15:04.440 --> 15:07.480
and Apple, and Microsoft with Cortana.

15:07.480 --> 15:11.080
This has taken it so much further beyond that.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.560
None of them are extensible in any way, really.

15:14.560 --> 15:19.040
One point, I'm like, at what point is the MyCraft project going to crack?

15:19.040 --> 15:24.320
At what point does a little upstart new project like this, that's doing something so ambitious,

15:24.320 --> 15:29.920
reach their maximum capacity to handle all of these new partnerships and agreements?

15:29.920 --> 15:32.280
Or when do they get bought and suddenly corrupted?

15:32.280 --> 15:37.320
Well, they did just get into that accelerator, which should help, but yeah, it's just something

15:37.320 --> 15:38.960
that I worry about, because they're so important.

15:38.960 --> 15:39.960
Yes.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.640
You don't really have a... They're it, really.

15:41.640 --> 15:46.240
Yeah, but Joshua and Ryan seem to have pretty good heads on their shoulders.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.420
It's pretty interesting to watch all of that.

15:48.420 --> 15:50.200
To see the broader market.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.840
So if you're interested, please do help them out.

15:51.840 --> 15:55.080
I think this is going to... If things keep going like they're going, this is going to

15:55.080 --> 15:56.080
be a big project.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.080
Yeah.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.080
I'm hoping... Here's what I'm hoping.

15:58.080 --> 16:03.080
I'm hoping MyCraft test production unit, Linux Fest Northwest, hands-on.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.080
Yes.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.080
Hands-on.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.080
Right?

16:06.080 --> 16:07.080
That would be the thing.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.080
And then we'd be one of the few places with cameras there-

16:08.080 --> 16:10.840
Maybe we can ask it to play the live stream.

16:10.840 --> 16:11.840
Oh my gosh.

16:11.840 --> 16:12.840
That would be-

16:12.840 --> 16:13.840
That could happen.

16:13.840 --> 16:14.840
If you could say, MyCraft.

16:14.840 --> 16:15.840
MyCraft, play JBLive.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.360
We have to get its name right.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.360
That's prerequisite.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.360
I want to call it JARVIS.

16:19.360 --> 16:22.360
You should be able to call it whatever you want, right?

16:22.360 --> 16:23.360
Computer.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.360
Wouldn't that be nice?

16:24.360 --> 16:25.360
Computer.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.360
Computer.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.360
Play JBLive.

16:27.360 --> 16:28.360
And then it starts the stream.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.360
That would be so awesome.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.600
So I'm hoping we get our hands on, because we're going to have cameras there.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.720
We're going to have the whole crew there.

16:33.720 --> 16:34.720
Everybody get to play with it.

16:34.720 --> 16:35.720
We'll all get our thoughts.

16:35.720 --> 16:36.720
We'll see.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.240
We shall see.

16:38.240 --> 16:41.280
And you know that back end... Because one of the nice things about MyCraft, you can

16:41.280 --> 16:43.360
deploy your own back end infrastructure.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.800
You can deploy that on a DigitalOcean droplet.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.480
Oh, that's right, DigitalOcean's sponsor of the Linux Unplugged program.

16:49.480 --> 16:53.060
Go to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

16:53.060 --> 16:54.060
One word.

16:54.060 --> 16:55.060
Lowercase.

16:55.060 --> 16:56.060
Ultimate power.

16:56.060 --> 16:59.120
You hear those clowns over at the Linux Action Show, they have a new promo code?

16:59.120 --> 17:00.120
Losers.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.860
Screw those guys.

17:01.860 --> 17:04.160
We got DOUNPLUGGED and we've had that for a long time.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.400
Go unplug your DO droplet.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.400
Well don't unplug it.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.780
That would be bad.

17:08.780 --> 17:12.400
Unplug your mind and expand it by creating a DigitalOcean droplet.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.400
DigitalOcean.com.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.080
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and you get a $10 credit.

17:16.080 --> 17:18.080
You can start in less than 55 seconds.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.080
And pricey plans?

17:19.080 --> 17:20.640
They start at only $5 a month.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.680
You see how that DOUNPLUGGED is going to hook you up.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.760
You get 512 megabytes of RAM at $5 a month.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.480
A 20 gigabyte SSD because they all SSDs.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.320
All SSDs with one CPU and a terabyte of transfer.

17:31.320 --> 17:35.280
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

17:35.280 --> 17:38.200
London, and I believe a brand new one.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.200
Brand new.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.200
In India.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.200
It's crazy.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.920
They've got a simple interface, that intuitive control panel, and that powerful and straightforward

17:44.920 --> 17:45.920
API.

17:45.920 --> 17:46.920
API.

17:46.920 --> 17:47.920
They've got a straightforward API, Wes.

17:47.920 --> 17:52.720
And you've got to go check it out at DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.000
Their pricing plans are simple and straightforward.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.480
They've got one click deployment of a bunch of great open source applications using all

17:58.480 --> 17:59.480
open source code.

17:59.480 --> 18:02.920
The entire stack from the virtualizer all the way up, they're using open source code

18:02.920 --> 18:03.920
there.

18:03.920 --> 18:04.920
AVL.

18:04.920 --> 18:05.920
Love it.

18:05.920 --> 18:06.920
Love it.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.120
And then when you get going, they have tutorials to take it even further.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.240
If you go to their community section, they've got write-ups on all those things you need

18:11.240 --> 18:12.240
to know.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.480
These are some of the best tutorials in the community.

18:13.480 --> 18:14.760
Like Let's Encrypt.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.760
That's a hot topic right now.

18:15.760 --> 18:22.240
They've got Prometheus, package management basics, how to use Tink, how to use Puppet.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.240
All of these things.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.800
And DigitalOcean has gots it.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.160
And it just makes your experience even better.

18:26.160 --> 18:27.160
So go to DigitalOcean.com.

18:27.160 --> 18:29.440
Go check out all of the good stuff.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.200
Look at the incredible pricing.

18:31.200 --> 18:35.680
And if you really want to feel like it's 2016, like if you've just been like, ho hum, Back

18:35.680 --> 18:39.920
to the Future said it was going to be awesome and you're not feeling like it's really 2016,

18:39.920 --> 18:42.480
I got something for you.

18:42.480 --> 18:45.760
Install Docker on your laptop or your desktop.

18:45.760 --> 18:48.200
Create a really cool Docker image.

18:48.200 --> 18:53.640
And then go deploy to a DigitalOcean droplet in seconds and realize, okay, yeah, it's 2016.

18:53.640 --> 18:57.660
I just spun up a super powerful server with crazy fast bandwidth with all of my software

18:57.660 --> 19:01.080
config that was completely identical on my laptop in seconds.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.200
It's very cool.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.520
And you know, even if you don't use any of that stuff, if you just want a Linux rig,

19:05.520 --> 19:10.120
you can SSH into and just poke around, a great opportunity.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.760
DigitalOcean.com.

19:11.760 --> 19:16.240
Just use that promo code, DOUNPLUGGED.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.560
Big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

19:19.560 --> 19:24.240
Wes, you got yourself here one of them early edition Sputniks, right?

19:24.240 --> 19:25.240
Yes, I do.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.760
The first one, if I don't make a mistake there.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.600
And you know, that's what my son uses too.

19:30.600 --> 19:35.680
And it's a pretty great laptop, but this week, a new laptop entered the scene.

19:35.680 --> 19:36.680
It's making me jealous.

19:36.680 --> 19:42.000
Yeah, the new Skylake-based Dell XPS 13 with Ubuntu pre-installed is arriving in the US.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.760
It's a fifth generation Intel.

19:43.760 --> 19:44.760
So that's not bad.

19:44.760 --> 19:50.440
With an i7, you know, it's a two-core, up to 16 gigabytes of RAM and a nice fatty SSD

19:50.440 --> 19:54.600
loaded out of the gate with Ubuntu.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.600
Are you tempted, Wes?

19:55.600 --> 19:56.600
Oh, yeah.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.600
Are you?

19:57.600 --> 20:02.360
I mean, I've been looking at these new ones with that tiny bezel for a long time now.

20:02.360 --> 20:03.360
Yeah, that is nice.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.360
Yeah, that, yeah.

20:04.360 --> 20:07.760
And I guess on these new ones, they're also offering a lot of these in their business

20:07.760 --> 20:09.980
precision line, but with the same form factor.

20:09.980 --> 20:12.280
So I think that would be the one I would be looking at.

20:12.280 --> 20:13.280
Yeah.

20:13.280 --> 20:18.600
Their precision line workstation notebooks, the Precision 5510, 3510, and 7510, and 7710,

20:18.600 --> 20:21.600
15 and 17-inch variants are also available.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.880
I believe they're more configurable, like they're less locked down.

20:24.880 --> 20:25.880
Yeah.

20:25.880 --> 20:29.880
So the XPS 13 is a small, tiny laptop that's really nice.

20:29.880 --> 20:33.640
Don't have any word yet on when they're going to support 16.04.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.200
They're shipping with 14.04 right now.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.360
I mean, I didn't install Arch anyway, so I don't know why you're wasting my time here,

20:38.360 --> 20:39.360
Chris.

20:39.360 --> 20:40.360
Hey-o!

20:40.360 --> 20:43.920
So up to 16 gigabytes of memory, a 512-gigabyte solid-state drive.

20:43.920 --> 20:48.560
I don't understand this, and this is where I don't feel like Dell has yet matured to

20:48.560 --> 20:55.160
a true Linux vendor, is 14.04 is just not a good choice if you're shipping on a high

20:55.160 --> 20:56.880
DPI display.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.920
This is a soapbox I've gone up on before.

20:58.920 --> 21:04.000
It's not a – I guess they must have used – yeah, yeah, yeah, because you can only

21:04.000 --> 21:10.480
go to, what, GTK 3.10 in 14.04, and that's only the very initial high DPI support in

21:10.480 --> 21:14.680
your GTK applications, and it's gotten so much better since then, and you're really

21:14.680 --> 21:15.680
missing out.

21:15.680 --> 21:23.400
And so when you ship a laptop with a 3,200 by 1,800 resolution, and you don't –

21:23.400 --> 21:25.360
Close to 16's release.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.360
Yeah, exactly.

21:26.360 --> 21:29.600
That's why it will be a really nice upgrade to 16.04 when they do ship.

21:29.600 --> 21:30.880
Hopefully it's not too long.

21:30.880 --> 21:34.400
You know Project Sputnik's been going since 2012.

21:34.400 --> 21:37.760
And so that's actually a pretty old laptop in computer terms you've got there.

21:37.760 --> 21:38.760
Yeah, it is.

21:38.760 --> 21:43.560
And when they first did it, I was a little – I was actually pretty skeptical.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.040
I didn't think this was a good idea.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.440
I also basically didn't think Dell was going to stick with it.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.440
No.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.120
Well, in all time, it's kind of just been this one little thing, not on the side.

21:51.120 --> 21:53.680
I am encouraged that they're expanding to the precision line.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.760
I think that's a big story here.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.840
And they've had some in the past, too.

21:58.840 --> 22:01.240
This isn't the first time they've done this, but they've expanded the program even

22:01.240 --> 22:02.240
more so.

22:02.240 --> 22:06.840
And I think what they've done here that was really super smart, that the other OEMs

22:06.840 --> 22:12.680
should take away from like your HPs and your La Navas, is they're targeting developers.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.800
They're calling it the developer edition, right?

22:14.800 --> 22:16.440
They're targeting power users.

22:16.440 --> 22:22.360
And I think that has been key to a success because they're not saying this is the laptop

22:22.360 --> 22:24.320
that will forever replace Windows.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.480
This is a laptop that's better than a MacBook.

22:26.480 --> 22:27.480
This is the MacBook killer.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.800
They're not saying any of that.

22:28.800 --> 22:33.240
What they're saying is if you want a developer laptop and you're a technical user, we've

22:33.240 --> 22:34.240
got a computer for you.

22:34.240 --> 22:37.280
Which is pretty neat because it makes it good like you're hired at your new job and then

22:37.280 --> 22:39.020
I go, what do you need to work with?

22:39.020 --> 22:41.880
You could say MacBook Pro or whatever, but now you could say something like this and

22:41.880 --> 22:43.720
get nice hardware, nice screen.

22:43.720 --> 22:44.720
Very much so.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.720
You don't need to have work or probably order from Dell.

22:46.720 --> 22:47.720
Right.

22:47.720 --> 22:48.720
They already have a supplier there.

22:48.720 --> 22:49.720
Yeah.

22:49.720 --> 22:50.720
That is a big deal.

22:50.720 --> 22:51.720
Now, not available outside the U.S. yet.

22:51.720 --> 22:52.720
Good to know.

22:52.720 --> 22:55.880
But I think some of the precision machines are, which might be better rigs to go with

22:55.880 --> 22:57.280
anyways depending on your needs.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.280
Probably more expensive.

22:58.280 --> 22:59.280
Okay.

22:59.280 --> 23:00.280
So let's ask the mumble room.

23:00.280 --> 23:05.440
Anybody in the mumble room, you know, tempted to pick up a laptop, maybe put funds aside.

23:05.440 --> 23:09.040
Let's put yourself in the market for a laptop right now.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.040
Around 2000.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.040
Chris Lass is buying.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.040
Around 50.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.040
Yeah.

23:13.040 --> 23:15.040
That's a big coin.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.040
Well, it's about $400, everybody.

23:16.040 --> 23:20.480
You know, something around $15,000 to $2000, a nice high-end laptop, and you want it to

23:20.480 --> 23:21.840
run Linux.

23:21.840 --> 23:28.880
Can somebody give me a reason why you wouldn't necessarily go with this laptop at this point?

23:28.880 --> 23:29.880
That says it right there.

23:29.880 --> 23:30.880
I think.

23:30.880 --> 23:31.880
Look at Dell.

23:31.880 --> 23:35.200
I can't think of, I mean, other than if you want a larger screen, but then you go to precision.

23:35.200 --> 23:40.100
So you know, I'm hoping now that this really spurs on System76 to really step up.

23:40.100 --> 23:41.480
They have some great machines.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.480
They do.

23:42.480 --> 23:47.040
And especially like in the higher end, like just on the pre-show, I was sort of wishing

23:47.040 --> 23:49.200
that I had my Bonobo hooked up right here.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.940
And on the Oryx Pro, like, right?

23:51.940 --> 23:57.360
But when it comes down to these super light, really thin, good battery life, high-resolution

23:57.360 --> 24:03.700
screens, I know for my XPS 13, which is the last model, that screen is damn good.

24:03.700 --> 24:05.160
It's one of the best screens.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.160
Yeah.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.720
You know, I still look at it every now and then when I open up, I go, damn, I can't believe

24:08.720 --> 24:10.160
this is a Linux computer.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.160
I just can't even believe it.

24:11.160 --> 24:12.160
And that's you.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.160
Yeah.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.400
I mean, and Apollo is great, and Entraware has a great hardware setup.

24:16.400 --> 24:20.120
I think I would – my preference would be to go with System76 or Entraware first.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.040
Yes, I agree.

24:22.040 --> 24:25.520
But if they weren't – but if I wanted something like this, I would consider it.

24:25.520 --> 24:26.520
I would.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.760
Oh, I guess they say we're in a different channel on the Mumble Room.

24:28.760 --> 24:29.760
Is that true, Wes?

24:29.760 --> 24:30.760
Is that true?

24:30.760 --> 24:31.760
That doesn't look true to me, Wes.

24:31.760 --> 24:32.760
That don't look true to me.

24:32.760 --> 24:33.760
If we are, double-click on there.

24:33.760 --> 24:34.760
There you go.

24:34.760 --> 24:35.760
All right.

24:35.760 --> 24:36.760
So if anybody – sorry.

24:36.760 --> 24:37.760
If we were in a different channel, I don't know how that could have happened.

24:37.760 --> 24:42.480
But if you didn't get a chance to say something, your thoughts on the XPS 13 virtual log before

24:42.480 --> 24:43.480
we move on?

24:43.480 --> 24:44.480
No.

24:44.480 --> 24:51.060
It seems like a great laptop.

24:51.060 --> 24:52.720
And nobody had a reason why you wouldn't pick it up, right?

24:52.720 --> 24:53.720
We didn't miss that?

24:53.720 --> 24:54.720
No.

24:54.720 --> 24:55.720
There's no major reason I could think of.

24:55.720 --> 25:00.720
Other than – I mean, what about the fact that it's Dell?

25:00.720 --> 25:03.000
They're all the same now.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.040
Isn't it even cheaper, though, than the Windows one now?

25:05.040 --> 25:06.040
I don't know if it is.

25:06.040 --> 25:07.040
It used to not be.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.040
Maybe it is now.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.760
I thought I heard someone make a comment about that.

25:09.760 --> 25:10.760
Hmm.

25:10.760 --> 25:11.760
Hmm.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.760
Yeah.

25:12.760 --> 25:16.560
But to say that it's just a Dell – I mean, Alienware is Dell, too, so.

25:16.560 --> 25:17.560
Well –

25:17.560 --> 25:21.320
Yeah, but you're just basically saying Alienware is awful now.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.320
Well –

25:22.320 --> 25:26.400
And you'll put a Linux sticker over the little Dell symbol, right?

25:26.400 --> 25:27.480
I haven't yet on my other one.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.160
I guess I just – I don't know.

25:29.160 --> 25:33.240
I don't really know what Dell's future holds for them, but I'm glad they're doing it.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.040
But at the same time, I look at the other vendors and go, so you're still planning to

25:36.040 --> 25:37.680
just do that Windows thing, huh?

25:37.680 --> 25:38.680
Right.

25:38.680 --> 25:39.680
Still planning to ship Windows.

25:39.680 --> 25:40.680
That's working for you, huh?

25:40.680 --> 25:41.680
Okay.

25:41.680 --> 25:42.680
Yeah.

25:42.680 --> 25:43.680
So, muhahaha.

25:43.680 --> 25:46.920
You're a Dell fan, so defend them now that I've insulted the honest –

25:46.920 --> 25:49.000
Yeah.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.120
So I have two Dell laptops, and the first one holds five gear, and the cellist – one

25:54.120 --> 26:00.120
– the one I have now is still going, and it's about six GM, maybe seven.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.120
So it's held up well is what you're saying.

26:02.120 --> 26:03.120
Yeah.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.120
Yeah, that counts for something.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.120
Yeah.

26:05.120 --> 26:10.400
I have a laptop that its birthday was last week, and it's now 10 years old and still

26:10.400 --> 26:11.400
runs and it's a Dell.

26:11.400 --> 26:15.480
The other nice part is they're pretty easy to get parts for and service generally.

26:15.480 --> 26:17.880
There's a lot of people who know how to fix Dell laptops.

26:17.880 --> 26:18.880
That's true.

26:18.880 --> 26:19.880
That is all true.

26:19.880 --> 26:24.320
If you're a developer and you just want to get your job done and you want a nice support

26:24.320 --> 26:25.320
contract –

26:25.320 --> 26:26.320
It's a pretty good choice.

26:26.320 --> 26:27.320
Yeah.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.320
I would shop around.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.320
Those support contracts.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.320
That's right.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.320
Yeah.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.320
So you want to buy one?

26:32.320 --> 26:33.320
Let's just look.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.320
We're not going to actually buy one, but I've got the XPS 13 laptop up here, the Dell

26:34.320 --> 26:35.320
figure.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.960
So I figured before we got done here, let's just see.

26:37.960 --> 26:42.000
So it starts here with a couple of different – I wonder if I'm on the right one.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.880
It's kind of hard to find the Ubuntu edition.

26:44.880 --> 26:47.880
I don't feel like I'm on the right one because these ones have Windows stickers.

26:47.880 --> 26:52.160
So let's start by trying to find it, and let's just Google search for it, okay?

26:52.160 --> 26:53.160
We're going to get the full experience.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.160
Are you ready?

26:54.160 --> 26:55.160
Yeah.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.160
Okay.

26:56.160 --> 26:57.160
We are Linux users who need a new laptop.

26:57.160 --> 27:00.320
So, yeah, let's say we're going to search for Ubuntu Dell XPS, okay?

27:00.320 --> 27:01.320
That should be enough, don't you think?

27:01.320 --> 27:02.320
I would hope so.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.320
Okay.

27:03.320 --> 27:04.320
There we go.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.160
The Dell Developer XPS 13 Edition.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.080
First link on our Google search results.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.080
Easy peasy.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.080
All right.

27:10.080 --> 27:11.080
Didn't even have to bother with the Dell site.

27:11.080 --> 27:12.560
I'm feeling good already because that's usually where I go wrong.

27:12.560 --> 27:13.560
Oh, look.

27:13.560 --> 27:14.560
It's Ubuntu right there.

27:14.560 --> 27:15.560
Yeah, Ubuntu right there.

27:15.560 --> 27:16.560
Now, look at this, Wes.

27:16.560 --> 27:22.520
We've got two editions to choose from, one that starts at $899.99 and one that's $1,049.

27:22.520 --> 27:26.720
I'm kind of inclined to say –

27:26.720 --> 27:27.720
What's the difference?

27:27.720 --> 27:30.840
Well, I think the huge difference here is a faster processor.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.400
Well, you're going to need that.

27:32.400 --> 27:36.680
But otherwise, the specs look – let's customize the $1,000 one.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.240
I have work to get done here.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.240
Yeah.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.240
I do like a fast rig.

27:40.240 --> 27:48.320
So you really get – so you can upgrade to 256 gig solid state.

27:48.320 --> 27:50.160
These all say fifth generation i7.

27:50.160 --> 27:51.160
Are these the last ones?

27:51.160 --> 27:52.160
Oh, it must be.

27:52.160 --> 27:56.440
No, though, because mine's an i7.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.560
So I can't change it to an i7 from here.

27:59.560 --> 28:00.560
So the final –

28:00.560 --> 28:01.560
The fifth generation.

28:01.560 --> 28:02.560
Yeah.

28:02.560 --> 28:03.560
These are all – the new ones are Skylake.

28:03.560 --> 28:04.560
Yeah, that's true.

28:04.560 --> 28:05.560
That is true.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.560
But you know what?

28:06.560 --> 28:07.560
They're marketing this.

28:07.560 --> 28:10.600
Yeah, maybe they're not available for – well, that's too bad.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.320
So why make the announcement yet?

28:12.320 --> 28:13.760
Double check on that for me, Wes.

28:13.760 --> 28:17.820
So it looked like it was around – that one was around $1,100, $1,400, depending on how

28:17.820 --> 28:19.240
you configure it.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.240
Fifth generation is Skylake.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.240
Sixth generation?

28:21.240 --> 28:22.240
Yes.

28:22.240 --> 28:23.240
Well, then those probably are.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.280
So they're not actually available for sale yet.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.200
That's too bad.

28:27.200 --> 28:30.320
I was going to see how much it would be if we wanted to configure one right now.

28:30.320 --> 28:31.320
I want it right now.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.320
Yeah, yeah.

28:32.320 --> 28:33.320
Would you consider upgrading yours?

28:33.320 --> 28:36.480
I mean, is that your personal machine or is that a work laptop?

28:36.480 --> 28:38.120
It is a work laptop.

28:38.120 --> 28:43.200
It's an extra work laptop, which is why it's good enough for now.

28:43.200 --> 28:47.960
But I have been – I mean, I have been – one of these days, I'm just going to snap and

28:47.960 --> 28:48.960
buy a new laptop.

28:48.960 --> 28:49.960
Yeah?

28:49.960 --> 28:50.960
Would this be on your list?

28:50.960 --> 28:51.960
It's very high on my list.

28:51.960 --> 28:52.960
You know what's confusing?

28:52.960 --> 28:55.480
It's hard because they all called the new.

28:55.480 --> 29:01.040
So they say the new XPS 13 developer edition, and it starts at $1,500, but then you – oh,

29:01.040 --> 29:02.040
wait a minute.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.880
Well, look at this, Wes.

29:03.880 --> 29:04.880
What changed?

29:04.880 --> 29:05.880
What?

29:05.880 --> 29:06.880
I don't know what changed, but now you're –

29:06.880 --> 29:09.320
Now you're on the new, new, new developer edition.

29:09.320 --> 29:11.160
Yeah, and now it's sixth generation.

29:11.160 --> 29:13.400
What the hell just happened?

29:13.400 --> 29:14.400
What the?

29:14.400 --> 29:15.400
Holy crap.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.400
All right.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.400
Well, here on Linux Unplugged, we've unlocked the secret code necessary.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.080
I wonder if I just had to refresh the page.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.160
That might have been it.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.160
So here we go, Wes.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.160
It starts – holy smokes.

29:23.160 --> 29:26.280
It starts at $1,500, but it goes all the way up to $2,300.

29:26.280 --> 29:27.620
You get a one-terabyte hard drive.

29:27.620 --> 29:28.620
So let's go with the middle –

29:28.620 --> 29:29.620
So it really is in the MacBook Pro.

29:29.620 --> 29:30.620
Yes.

29:30.620 --> 29:31.620
Let's go in the midrange.

29:31.620 --> 29:32.620
Let's start with a 512.

29:32.620 --> 29:34.880
I can't go below 512 for my main work machine, right?

29:34.880 --> 29:35.880
I mean, that's –

29:35.880 --> 29:37.440
I'm all right with 256, but let's go 512.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.600
In what world, Wes?

29:38.600 --> 29:39.600
In what world?

29:39.600 --> 29:40.600
Jeez Louise, Wes.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.600
Jeez Louise, that's disgusting.

29:42.600 --> 29:46.960
Sixty gigabytes of RAM, 512-gigabyte PCIe solid state.

29:46.960 --> 29:47.960
Oh, PCIe.

29:47.960 --> 29:48.960
Yeah.

29:48.960 --> 29:49.960
Oh, boy.

29:49.960 --> 29:50.960
Tasty.

29:50.960 --> 29:51.960
Oh, boy.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.120
Oh, boy.

29:53.120 --> 29:54.260
So that's funny.

29:54.260 --> 29:57.480
So by the way, don't Google search for like what we did because you might get that same

29:57.480 --> 29:58.480
result we did.

29:58.480 --> 29:59.480
Yeah.

29:59.480 --> 30:00.480
Do not imitate.

30:00.480 --> 30:04.820
We re-clicked on the logo of the XPS developer edition and it loaded this page.

30:04.820 --> 30:08.080
So be careful how you search because you might get to the wrong thing.

30:08.080 --> 30:11.000
So ours is going to be $1,949.99.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Okay.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Okay.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Okay.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
I can see it.

30:15.000 --> 30:24.360
Boy, it's barely worth that, I mean at least based on mine, unless they've improved the

30:24.360 --> 30:25.360
build quality a little bit.

30:25.360 --> 30:26.360
Right.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.900
There's the case gives – it's a plastic case.

30:27.900 --> 30:31.160
It gives – and the other thing is is where you rest your wrist right here, see they're

30:31.160 --> 30:35.720
showing that right here, yeah, it's the same exact material.

30:35.720 --> 30:36.720
It shows stains like an SOB.

30:36.720 --> 30:37.720
Oh.

30:37.720 --> 30:38.720
That's disappointing.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.240
And like when you're sitting there like we all do when you're sitting there eating chicken

30:41.240 --> 30:45.680
wings and browsing Reddit.

30:45.680 --> 30:46.680
You get chicken –

30:46.680 --> 30:47.680
The truth comes out.

30:47.680 --> 30:48.680
You get grease.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.440
You get wing grease on your laptop and ain't nobody –

30:51.440 --> 30:52.680
Is this why you won't bring that to the studio?

30:52.680 --> 30:53.680
You're too embarrassed.

30:53.680 --> 30:54.680
It's just filthy.

30:54.680 --> 30:55.680
No, man.

30:55.680 --> 30:56.680
It smells delicious.

30:56.680 --> 30:57.680
I want it at home.

30:57.680 --> 30:58.680
I want it heated up gently.

30:58.680 --> 30:59.680
It smells great.

30:59.680 --> 31:00.680
Yeah, it's great.

31:00.680 --> 31:01.680
Yeah, the build quality.

31:01.680 --> 31:02.680
So the build – I don't know.

31:02.680 --> 31:03.680
$2,000 for a Dell is –

31:03.680 --> 31:06.520
Then you imagine what you can spend that money on a desktop.

31:06.520 --> 31:07.520
Yeah.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.520
Yeah, exactly.

31:08.520 --> 31:09.520
Oh, yeah.

31:09.520 --> 31:13.600
With a really nice – that's the other thing is the Intel graphics is not cutting it for

31:13.600 --> 31:14.600
me.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.560
And when you throw high DPI in there, it's even worse.

31:16.560 --> 31:17.560
So if you just get like a nice –

31:17.560 --> 31:18.560
This is –

31:18.560 --> 31:22.880
Full HD, you know, like 1080p laptop and then you can spend your money on your beautiful

31:22.880 --> 31:23.880
desktop.

31:23.880 --> 31:27.240
I was trying a little, you know, a little game in here on the Apollo which is the Sky

31:27.240 --> 31:28.920
Lake Iris.

31:28.920 --> 31:29.920
Still not good enough.

31:29.920 --> 31:34.520
Still – so, boy, if $2,000 – I might be wrong.

31:34.520 --> 31:35.520
Let's go check.

31:35.520 --> 31:40.100
But I think when you get into a $2,000 Apple laptop, I think you get dedicated graphics.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.980
You get the Iris Plus.

31:41.980 --> 31:43.600
Right now it's an AMD.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.640
Is that how – okay, so let's go look.

31:45.640 --> 31:48.800
So would that be a MacBook Pro?

31:48.800 --> 31:53.800
And I guess this maybe isn't a fair benchmark but it kind of seems like, you know, you have

31:53.800 --> 31:59.240
to at least consider that one of the better selling competitors – but they don't offer

31:59.240 --> 32:01.640
dedicated graphics in a 13-inch form factor.

32:01.640 --> 32:02.640
So you do have to step up –

32:02.640 --> 32:03.640
Oh, that is a difference.

32:03.640 --> 32:06.440
You do have to step up to 13-inch but, yeah, when you – or I'm sorry, 15-inch.

32:06.440 --> 32:12.160
But once you step up to 15-inch, you get a legitimate quad-core processor on the MacBook

32:12.160 --> 32:14.600
instead of the dual-core i7.

32:14.600 --> 32:20.240
You get 256 gigabytes of PCIe storage, not as good as the Dell.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.640
And you get the Iris Pro video.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.440
I don't see dedicated graphics on this one actually.

32:24.440 --> 32:25.440
Oh, okay.

32:25.440 --> 32:26.440
Well, then maybe you have to go a little more expensive.

32:26.440 --> 32:27.440
Yeah, you might.

32:27.440 --> 32:28.440
So, okay.

32:28.440 --> 32:29.440
All right.

32:29.440 --> 32:32.520
I just – for $2,000, I want my damn dedicated graphics and I want my damn dedicated graphics

32:32.520 --> 32:33.520
real bad.

32:33.520 --> 32:38.560
Although, even at a – unless you get something like the Oryx, a lot of the dedicated in the

32:38.560 --> 32:43.360
laptops are still – they're better but it's not what you pay for, you know?

32:43.360 --> 32:44.360
Yeah.

32:44.360 --> 32:51.120
I want something around $1,000 that's really – like the Centraware starts at a good price,

32:51.120 --> 32:52.120
the Apollo, right?

32:52.120 --> 32:53.120
Yeah.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.120
So, yeah.

32:54.120 --> 32:55.120
It's closer.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.120
But, yeah.

32:56.120 --> 32:57.440
The marketing is done by Dell.

32:57.440 --> 32:58.440
Look at our beards.

32:58.440 --> 32:59.480
We sell Linux as system T.

32:59.480 --> 33:03.360
Mumbo room, anybody else want to talk about the XPS?

33:03.360 --> 33:05.440
Either we're being unfair or maybe we're being too fair.

33:05.440 --> 33:06.440
Go ahead and share your thoughts.

33:06.440 --> 33:07.440
Going once, going twice.

33:07.440 --> 33:15.400
I think what it comes down to is that Dell might be trying to shift – excuse me, shift

33:15.400 --> 33:20.880
over from being just strictly a Windows OEM and they're trying to get that Linux crowd

33:20.880 --> 33:22.360
a bit.

33:22.360 --> 33:28.480
Looking at the System76 Oryx Pro and even at a 15-inch or 17-inch, it's still a better

33:28.480 --> 33:30.600
deal for under $2,000.

33:30.600 --> 33:31.600
Wow.

33:31.600 --> 33:32.600
Oh, really?

33:32.600 --> 33:33.600
Yeah.

33:33.600 --> 33:41.120
Like, it's like $1,300 and you're getting a GTX 970 or a 980 mobile from NVIDIA.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.120
Oh, boy.

33:42.120 --> 33:48.080
And so it's like, good try Dell, but dude, System76 is killing it on these deals.

33:48.080 --> 33:49.080
Yeah.

33:49.080 --> 33:53.560
So how much is the super thin lightweight worth and I guess it all comes down to your

33:53.560 --> 33:54.560
workflow.

33:54.560 --> 33:55.560
Yep.

33:55.560 --> 33:56.560
That's your like main workstation.

33:56.560 --> 34:02.080
He said something there, Wes, that I wanted to – do you think this is Dell's hedge against

34:02.080 --> 34:06.760
Windows collapsing and are they just doing it in a way that is hyper-focused and they're

34:06.760 --> 34:07.760
able to learn from?

34:07.760 --> 34:09.800
Because obviously they're focusing, like we mentioned, at developers.

34:09.800 --> 34:10.800
Yep.

34:10.800 --> 34:11.800
And I think that –

34:11.800 --> 34:15.880
But if you're Dell, you're Michael Dell and you're like, you've got to look at your money,

34:15.880 --> 34:16.880
you see where your money's spent.

34:16.880 --> 34:21.440
You see this group of like eight or ten guys and gals that are burning money on working

34:21.440 --> 34:22.440
for Linux.

34:22.440 --> 34:23.440
Why are you spending that money?

34:23.440 --> 34:27.200
Why is Michael Dell spending that money, Wes?

34:27.200 --> 34:30.720
You know, I think it kind of – it might play also into the enterprise shift.

34:30.720 --> 34:31.960
You know, they bought EMC.

34:31.960 --> 34:37.160
They were looking at kind of focusing on enterprise and I think if you're going to still be selling,

34:37.160 --> 34:42.840
you know, workstation level components, Linux is a good bet for that kind of like power

34:42.840 --> 34:43.840
user.

34:43.840 --> 34:44.840
Yeah.

34:44.840 --> 34:45.840
And maybe you're building web apps.

34:45.840 --> 34:46.840
Yeah.

34:46.840 --> 34:47.840
And infrastructure.

34:47.840 --> 34:48.840
Yeah.

34:48.840 --> 34:52.720
The red pepper, you had a point to make about workstations.

34:52.720 --> 34:54.080
Go ahead.

34:54.080 --> 35:01.520
You can always order a Dell Precision 15-inch laptop with Fibonacci on it.

35:01.520 --> 35:02.520
Yeah.

35:02.520 --> 35:04.880
The Precisions now, they've expanded with this announcement.

35:04.880 --> 35:09.680
They've expanded the Precision line with more customizability and so maybe one day we'll

35:09.680 --> 35:11.160
see Wes show up with a Precision.

35:11.160 --> 35:18.600
You know, I love – if I had unlimited money, if I could have all of the laptops in the

35:18.600 --> 35:22.520
world, I think I would like to have the Apollo for my portability instead of an XPS.

35:22.520 --> 35:28.120
I actually think – my truly unbiased opinion having the XPS 13, the last generation, and

35:28.120 --> 35:32.000
having the Apollo, the Apollo is a better computer and the trackpad is better on the

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Apollo.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Wow.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.080
So for portability, I think the Apollo is better.

35:37.080 --> 35:38.080
But –

35:38.080 --> 35:39.080
I really want to just slide that into my bag when I leave.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.080
I'm not going to lie.

35:40.080 --> 35:45.160
At the same time, I want some of the features and power of the Oryx and I actually have

35:45.160 --> 35:49.880
had some limited production capabilities with the Apollo because it's not powerful enough.

35:49.880 --> 35:54.600
So part of me, if I had unlimited money, Wes, I would have the Apollo as like my portable

35:54.600 --> 36:00.360
machine and the Oryx as my – I got to do a whole bunch of work and I'm doing it between

36:00.360 --> 36:03.240
the studio and home all the time and that would be my machine.

36:03.240 --> 36:07.600
And I would have two laptops because there's not a perfect laptop for me right now.

36:07.600 --> 36:13.120
There's not one that answers all the things like the – the thing about the Apollo, lightweight,

36:13.120 --> 36:14.240
super easy to –

36:14.240 --> 36:15.240
Sturdy construction.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.240
Yeah.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.960
So it makes it very easy to move it around because it's really sturdy and a very small

36:18.960 --> 36:20.320
power adapter.

36:20.320 --> 36:24.560
The plus about the Oryx would be it has a great graphics card in it, a great desktop

36:24.560 --> 36:25.560
class CPU.

36:25.560 --> 36:26.560
You can do whatever you throw it at.

36:26.560 --> 36:27.560
Exactly.

36:27.560 --> 36:28.560
But it's huge.

36:28.560 --> 36:29.560
It's heavy.

36:29.560 --> 36:30.560
It has a big power brick.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.560
And fans.

36:31.560 --> 36:32.560
Yeah.

36:32.560 --> 36:33.560
Yeah, that too.

36:33.560 --> 36:36.320
This thing has never once – once – the fans have never once spun up on air, which

36:36.320 --> 36:39.640
is a huge thing for me because then it makes it sound better.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.680
Stopping the show, complaining about the fans.

36:41.680 --> 36:44.280
It happens almost every other week until the Apollo.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.840
And the Apollo has better battery life than the Oryx.

36:45.840 --> 36:49.600
I would guess because it's all Intel and no dedicated graphics.

36:49.600 --> 36:55.920
But either way, yeah, I don't feel like I could land on one single laptop right now.

36:55.920 --> 36:59.560
I guess the way to strike that distance would be to have – or to strike that balance would

36:59.560 --> 37:05.120
be to have a pretty well-built desktop PC that's within reason and then have a nice

37:05.120 --> 37:06.120
portable laptop.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.120
Right.

37:07.120 --> 37:11.600
And then – but still, I'm just trying to justify how you spend $2,000 on a computer

37:11.600 --> 37:16.600
that is limited to 16 gigs of RAM and doesn't have dedicated graphics.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.240
Maybe I'm just a PC master race guy.

37:19.240 --> 37:23.800
I mean, I don't even – I'm not trying to be like, oh, you've got to have fast components.

37:23.800 --> 37:27.560
But $2,000 and you don't have dedicated graphics and you can only do 16 gigs of RAM, that sounds

37:27.560 --> 37:29.060
crazy to me.

37:29.060 --> 37:32.800
On the other side, I get frustrated that the RAM is always lock-stepped with the other

37:32.800 --> 37:33.800
components.

37:33.800 --> 37:39.240
Like, maybe I don't need the 512 because I do a better job of keeping my file system

37:39.240 --> 37:40.240
organized than Chris does.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.240
Right.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.840
You know, or I don't need the super nice touch, I just want the full HD.

37:43.840 --> 37:44.840
Yes, right.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.880
You can never get the like 16 gigs and 32 gigs in that model.

37:47.880 --> 37:48.880
Yeah.

37:48.880 --> 37:49.880
Yeah, yeah.

37:49.880 --> 37:51.760
Okay, Muhahaha, tell me about this.

37:51.760 --> 37:56.960
You think it's – for $2,000, you say it's worth it if – as long as you get a good

37:56.960 --> 37:59.800
amount of use out of it, like several years, maybe more?

37:59.800 --> 38:00.800
What do you think?

38:00.800 --> 38:03.120
Yeah, I think it's fine.

38:03.120 --> 38:07.640
But how do you get five years of use out of a computer that doesn't have dedicated graphics

38:07.640 --> 38:09.760
and is locked to 16 gigs of RAM?

38:09.760 --> 38:11.160
Seriously, how do you get five years out of that?

38:11.160 --> 38:15.840
Debbie unstable and never change a thing.

38:15.840 --> 38:22.000
So I think you – okay, I don't think you can do it if you are planning to game, but

38:22.000 --> 38:26.920
if you're just planning to use it for development, yeah, just browsing, okay, maybe browsing

38:26.920 --> 38:29.840
maybe that is kind of overpowered, but yeah.

38:29.840 --> 38:30.840
I don't know, man.

38:30.840 --> 38:34.440
You know, I just read something, Wes, today.

38:34.440 --> 38:35.440
Didn't you link it to me?

38:35.440 --> 38:38.840
One of the features, and the reason why I didn't put it in the show is because I didn't

38:38.840 --> 38:43.240
understand it, so I didn't want to read it on air, but one of the features in kernel

38:43.240 --> 38:47.360
4.5 is a bunch of work on the new open source AMD driver, right?

38:47.360 --> 38:49.280
Yes, I believe so.

38:49.280 --> 38:52.740
And I don't know – can you pull up our thread on that computer and pull that up because

38:52.740 --> 38:56.800
– maybe I can, because one of the things – and this is why I didn't include it in

38:56.800 --> 39:06.880
the show is they talk about accelerating ButterFS file system calculations using the AMD GPU.

39:06.880 --> 39:11.200
So if you're following me here, that would mean your file system runs faster because

39:11.200 --> 39:13.920
it's using the GPU to crunch numbers.

39:13.920 --> 39:16.280
That – yeah, okay, let's see.

39:16.280 --> 39:21.840
Also, by the way, it has better PS2 support, Wes points out.

39:21.840 --> 39:22.840
Super important.

39:22.840 --> 39:24.800
When you need that very accurate PS2 mouse.

39:24.800 --> 39:28.600
Here's why – here's the part that it says – this is why I didn't read it on air.

39:28.600 --> 39:32.780
So they say, so what's exactly so promising about Linux kernel 4.5?

39:32.780 --> 39:39.600
It includes an implementation of initial support for the AMD PowerPlay power management technology,

39:39.600 --> 39:46.440
and it also brings high performance to the AMD GPU open source driver for Radeon GPUs.

39:46.440 --> 39:55.080
As a result, it will improve scalability in the free space handling of the ButterFS file

39:55.080 --> 40:01.100
system, and it will have better EPOL multi-threaded scalability.

40:01.100 --> 40:05.200
So this article is saying that the – I don't – this is why I didn't – this just got

40:05.200 --> 40:10.800
– I'm just shooing this in, but this thing is claiming that the improved GPU drivers

40:10.800 --> 40:15.420
will help with ButterFS free space calculations.

40:15.420 --> 40:16.720
How can that be a thing?

40:16.720 --> 40:17.720
And if it –

40:17.720 --> 40:18.720
It's not a thing.

40:18.720 --> 40:19.720
Okay.

40:19.720 --> 40:20.720
It's not a thing.

40:20.720 --> 40:21.720
There's supposed to be separate things.

40:21.720 --> 40:26.920
They added a new free space map cache to ButterFS in version 4.5.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.840
Okay, good, good, good.

40:28.840 --> 40:29.840
All right.

40:29.840 --> 40:33.000
So because my point was going to be – but I can't – and that's why I was like that

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
can't be right.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.520
There's no way that's right, but where I was going with this is I see future workloads

40:38.520 --> 40:43.740
that are improved because your GPU takes some of the compute.

40:43.740 --> 40:48.160
It's already here today, but it's mostly here in production work.

40:48.160 --> 40:54.760
So when you tell me that this XPS 13 is a five-year computer, I don't know.

40:54.760 --> 40:57.720
I don't know if that's true.

40:57.720 --> 40:58.720
I don't know if that's true.

40:58.720 --> 41:03.240
I think there's a certain class of people that don't – they can't have a five-year

41:03.240 --> 41:09.020
computer, and you might be one of them.

41:09.020 --> 41:10.020
Maybe on a desktop.

41:10.020 --> 41:12.680
Maybe on a nice desktop that you don't game on.

41:12.680 --> 41:13.680
That's okay.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.560
Well, so there you go.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.560
There you go.

41:17.560 --> 41:18.560
Fine.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.560
Fine.

41:19.560 --> 41:20.560
That's just fine for Chris.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.560
But that's not that there's anything wrong with that.

41:21.560 --> 41:26.360
And there are some users that you can have an older ThinkPad and use it for a long time

41:26.360 --> 41:27.360
and it works great.

41:27.360 --> 41:28.360
Yeah, that's true.

41:28.360 --> 41:29.360
That's a good point, Wes.

41:29.360 --> 41:30.360
That's a good point.

41:30.360 --> 41:33.640
Yeah, I guess where I was going with this is I guess what I was trying to say and I'm

41:33.640 --> 41:38.040
not saying it very well is I think there will be future work tasks and loads that are automatically

41:38.040 --> 41:42.200
offloaded to the GPU that you as an end user don't even realize like your web browser

41:42.200 --> 41:46.160
and its rendering or how your menu pops up when you go to search for applications on

41:46.160 --> 41:47.160
your computer.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.160
Oh, yeah.

41:48.160 --> 41:49.160
Lots of interaction stuff is being –

41:49.160 --> 41:50.160
Yeah.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.560
Today and in the future, more and more stuff will be GPU accelerated.

41:51.560 --> 41:54.440
And if you don't have a computer that has a good GPU, you're going to be left behind

41:54.440 --> 41:55.440
a little bit.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.440
Your system's – that's all I'm saying.

41:56.440 --> 42:01.100
You see that software rendering pop up and you get sad and everything's slow.

42:01.100 --> 42:04.120
And for me, when I'm using my XPS 13, that just means, okay, this isn't a time I could

42:04.120 --> 42:05.120
play games.

42:05.120 --> 42:07.120
I just – I can't play games on this computer.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.120
And that's kind of a bummer sometimes.

42:08.120 --> 42:09.640
I mean, there's always race to the sun.

42:09.640 --> 42:10.640
That barely works.

42:10.640 --> 42:11.640
That barely works.

42:11.640 --> 42:12.640
Really?

42:12.640 --> 42:14.840
Well, part of the issue is 4K.

42:14.840 --> 42:22.000
And then part of the issue is so many games right now suck at changing their resolution.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.360
And so when you try to run it in windowed mode, it still gets really funky.

42:25.360 --> 42:28.080
So there's just a lot of rough spots still.

42:28.080 --> 42:30.120
And it makes gaming frustrating on the XPS.

42:30.120 --> 42:31.120
It's just not even worth it.

42:31.120 --> 42:32.120
Where you stream it from your computer.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.120
I don't know.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.120
Probably different games.

42:34.120 --> 42:37.680
Like a different – my kids can play Minecraft.

42:37.680 --> 42:38.680
That works pretty well.

42:38.680 --> 42:39.680
Right.

42:39.680 --> 42:40.680
So there you go.

42:40.680 --> 42:41.680
That works.

42:41.680 --> 42:42.840
That works, Wes.

42:42.840 --> 42:47.320
But things like – like actual game games that are like not – that aren't like

42:47.320 --> 42:48.320
–

42:48.320 --> 42:49.320
That aren't written in Java?

42:49.320 --> 42:50.320
Yeah.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.320
Those don't play so well.

42:51.320 --> 42:52.320
Mm-hmm.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.320
Mm-hmm.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.320
Yeah.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.320
All right, Mumbo.

42:55.320 --> 42:56.320
Any other thoughts on the Linux laptop topic before we move on?

42:56.320 --> 42:57.320
Going twice.

42:57.320 --> 42:58.320
Going twice.

42:58.320 --> 43:02.160
All right.

43:02.160 --> 43:03.160
So let's talk – let's take a break.

43:03.160 --> 43:07.760
Let's take a moment to reset before we get into something that is looking out into the

43:07.760 --> 43:08.760
future of it.

43:08.760 --> 43:09.760
Let's talk about Ting.

43:09.760 --> 43:10.760
All right, everybody.

43:10.760 --> 43:11.960
I'll talk about something you can get right now.

43:11.960 --> 43:13.280
You don't got to wait until the future.

43:13.280 --> 43:17.160
You don't have to wait until Captain Picard on the Enterprise comes by and has the solution

43:17.160 --> 43:18.160
for you.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.160
No, friends.

43:19.160 --> 43:21.760
Get out there right now.

43:21.760 --> 43:27.160
And go to linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com, Wes.

43:27.160 --> 43:30.680
You go there right now and you'll get a $25 discount off your first device.

43:30.680 --> 43:35.600
Or if you have a Ting compatible device and they got CDMA and GSM, guess what?

43:35.600 --> 43:38.760
They'll put $25 towards your first month or whatever.

43:38.760 --> 43:41.980
Like your average Ting bill right now, $24 a line.

43:41.980 --> 43:44.960
So $25 in credit is going to pay for more than your first month.

43:44.960 --> 43:46.560
It's your minutes, your messages, your megabytes.

43:46.560 --> 43:47.560
They add them up.

43:47.560 --> 43:48.680
Whatever bucket you fall into, that's all you pay.

43:48.680 --> 43:49.840
It's $6 for the line.

43:49.840 --> 43:50.840
That is Ting.

43:50.840 --> 43:52.040
They got a bunch of great devices.

43:52.040 --> 43:53.040
They're unlocked.

43:53.040 --> 43:55.320
You can get them from Ting directly or you can bring your own.

43:55.320 --> 43:59.320
They have no contract, no early termination fee, and they have a really good dashboard

43:59.320 --> 44:01.620
and fanatically good customer service.

44:01.620 --> 44:02.620
That's Ting right there.

44:02.620 --> 44:03.620
It sells itself.

44:03.620 --> 44:04.620
I don't need to sell it.

44:04.620 --> 44:05.620
It sells itself.

44:05.620 --> 44:08.280
But one thing that's kind of cool is they're geeks.

44:08.280 --> 44:10.040
And you can see this in some of their blog posts.

44:10.040 --> 44:12.320
They did a blog post about cord cutters.

44:12.320 --> 44:14.320
They've been doing a whole series about cord cutters.

44:14.320 --> 44:15.320
They love cord cutters.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.320
Yeah, they do.

44:16.320 --> 44:21.800
They talk about how cord cutting not only saves you money, which is kind of obvious,

44:21.800 --> 44:23.640
but also saves you a whole bunch of time.

44:23.640 --> 44:28.580
The geeks over at Ting did the math and it's unbelievable.

44:28.580 --> 44:33.360
Not only do you learn a little bit about how commercials work in television, which is pretty

44:33.360 --> 44:38.680
insightful, but you also get a little idea of how much time you save when you stream

44:38.680 --> 44:43.040
shows without commercials versus watching shows or even like DVRing through them.

44:43.040 --> 44:44.040
It's a pretty cool blog post.

44:44.040 --> 44:45.520
They've got a whole bunch of good stuff.

44:45.520 --> 44:47.020
Start by going to linux.ting.com.

44:47.020 --> 44:50.600
That supports this show, gets you the discount, and lets them know you heard about it.

44:50.600 --> 44:55.280
See, the best part, they let us put – Linux is now a sub-domain on their website.

44:55.280 --> 44:56.280
Isn't that wonderful?

44:56.280 --> 44:58.720
That says it all that you need to know about Ting right there.

44:58.720 --> 44:59.720
Yes, it does.

44:59.720 --> 45:00.720
Exactly.

45:00.720 --> 45:02.440
It is very, very cool.

45:02.440 --> 45:03.440
Go check them out.

45:03.440 --> 45:06.240
Go get a great device from GSM Cards starting at $9.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.240
All the way up to feature phones.

45:07.240 --> 45:08.240
With Amazon Prime.

45:08.240 --> 45:09.240
Yes.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.240
Get it just as soon as you possibly want.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.240
Yes.

45:11.240 --> 45:12.240
Put it in anything.

45:12.240 --> 45:14.800
Then they've got, of course, feature phones and basic Android phones that are just nice,

45:14.800 --> 45:17.880
clean Android phones all the way up to the high-end luxury phones.

45:17.880 --> 45:22.840
I'm thinking of having like a, oh no, the internet went out again, emergency gateway

45:22.840 --> 45:24.160
with Ting, $6 a month.

45:24.160 --> 45:27.000
I probably won't use it like nine months out of the year.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
Here's a nice thing.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.800
If you had a way to activate it when your internet goes out, you could just turn the

45:30.800 --> 45:33.520
line on and off, and then you're not even paying the $6.

45:33.520 --> 45:34.520
Exactly.

45:34.520 --> 45:35.820
And then just transparent internet.

45:35.820 --> 45:37.060
Don't tell Ting I told you that.

45:37.060 --> 45:43.480
But you could go get one of their MiFi devices, or whichever one you want, just grab a SIM.

45:43.480 --> 45:46.600
There's no contract, and you just pay for $6.

45:46.600 --> 45:51.840
If you forget to turn it off, you'll pay $6.

45:51.840 --> 45:56.480
If you say to yourself, you say, self, it's worth it to me to pay $6 a month to have internet

45:56.480 --> 45:57.480
always available.

45:57.480 --> 45:58.480
Honestly, it is.

45:58.480 --> 45:59.600
Yeah, it is.

45:59.600 --> 46:01.120
Then you could just pay $6 a month.

46:01.120 --> 46:06.240
But you could also turn it off, and then use the Ting app on your phone to then turn the

46:06.240 --> 46:09.520
line back on when your internet goes out, and then good to go.

46:09.520 --> 46:11.160
Because if the internet goes out, I know.

46:11.160 --> 46:12.160
Yeah, yeah, you do.

46:12.160 --> 46:13.160
Right away.

46:13.160 --> 46:14.160
Oh, there's no missing out on that.

46:14.160 --> 46:15.160
I'm in a terrible mood.

46:15.160 --> 46:16.160
Yeah.

46:16.160 --> 46:17.160
Where's all my stuff?

46:17.160 --> 46:18.160
Linux.ting.com.

46:18.160 --> 46:22.040
Go there, support this show, check out Ting, get yourself a discount.

46:22.040 --> 46:24.840
Big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

46:24.840 --> 46:29.600
I don't know what it is about these snappy packages, Wes, but I continue to feel like

46:29.600 --> 46:30.600
a dope.

46:30.600 --> 46:31.600
It's gotta be in your bonnet.

46:31.600 --> 46:36.800
Well, I struggle because it's a whole bunch of different type of technologies.

46:36.800 --> 46:38.720
And you know what's funny about it?

46:38.720 --> 46:40.420
It's not even like the first attempt at this.

46:40.420 --> 46:43.240
It's maybe a different take on many attempts, we're gonna get to that.

46:43.240 --> 46:47.440
But I do wanna take a moment and talk about snappy packages.

46:47.440 --> 46:51.200
So there's Snappy Personal, their new approach to package management and updating is designed

46:51.200 --> 46:55.680
to be faster, more reliable, transactional with stronger security.

46:55.680 --> 46:59.480
Snappy for at least one of the desktop spins and of course, you got Snappy Core, you got

46:59.480 --> 47:01.760
the phone, they're all using snap packages.

47:01.760 --> 47:05.280
There's also on a future, which is still gonna be deb packages, a lot of the base OS will

47:05.280 --> 47:07.400
be using deb.

47:07.400 --> 47:11.640
Snap packages will be used to sort of unify the concept of package management against

47:11.640 --> 47:13.400
Internet of Things and desktops and all of this.

47:13.400 --> 47:20.960
So developers could create these snap packages that are like a package build from the AUR,

47:20.960 --> 47:26.560
so it's a script file that tells you where to go get all of the files, meets a container,

47:26.560 --> 47:30.800
meets PBIs, which are like statically linked libraries and all of that.

47:30.800 --> 47:33.760
Is this a good rough description, do you think, Wes, from your understanding?

47:33.760 --> 47:35.600
It seems to capture it.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.320
Basically, I mean it's pretty rough.

47:37.320 --> 47:38.320
There's a little more but...

47:38.320 --> 47:39.800
That's the snap package.

47:39.800 --> 47:44.600
And then there's a backend component to it that's run by Canonical that's sort of like

47:44.600 --> 47:49.360
the backend repo server, if you will, that is aware of where things are at and keys and

47:49.360 --> 47:51.240
whatnot and things like that.

47:51.240 --> 47:53.320
So this is another component to it.

47:53.320 --> 47:58.240
It's not a distributed system necessarily, it is a centralized system with a server.

47:58.240 --> 48:04.520
And this appears to be something that a lot of projects are trying to solve, this particular

48:04.520 --> 48:06.560
problem of distributing software.

48:06.560 --> 48:08.680
And there's different takes on how it should be done.

48:08.680 --> 48:14.000
A couple of them that are interesting is the GUIXSD, I don't know if you know about this

48:14.000 --> 48:17.120
one, Wes, but GNU's got an attempt at this one.

48:17.120 --> 48:19.680
Nix, I think is what it's called, Nix.

48:19.680 --> 48:21.400
Yeah, they're kind of sister distributions.

48:21.400 --> 48:22.400
Yeah, yeah.

48:22.400 --> 48:27.000
So you have Nix and you have GUIX and you have Limba, which is another project that's

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
trying to do this.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
That's a new one to me.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.080
And you have, of course, XUG App, which is a big one from the GNOME folks.

48:32.080 --> 48:34.040
I've kind of been waiting to see what's going to happen there.

48:34.040 --> 48:40.120
And XUG Apps are sandbox apps that the whole goal here, they say, is allowing developers

48:40.120 --> 48:44.560
to distribute applications across Linux distributions, something we've talked about with Michael

48:44.560 --> 48:48.440
Dominic on Coderadios many, many times, even in the last week's episode, because he'd been

48:48.440 --> 48:50.840
running Ubuntu for a while.

48:50.840 --> 48:54.720
If I wanted to create an app, let's just crazy-pie this guy.

48:54.720 --> 48:59.520
Let's say, have you noticed how there is not really a great app store for Linux?

48:59.520 --> 49:04.120
Let's just say we could create an app store for all distributions, but how would you make

49:04.120 --> 49:06.320
applications you could distribute across all of those?

49:06.320 --> 49:09.520
You need something, you need something sandbox, something that takes into account all the

49:09.520 --> 49:12.540
different libraries and different versions of things.

49:12.540 --> 49:16.020
Sandbox applications are the future for that type of distributed application.

49:16.020 --> 49:19.120
Not all of our apps that we install are going to be sandbox, but the ones where it's like

49:19.120 --> 49:23.220
one click and you download and you run, these are going to be sandbox applications.

49:23.220 --> 49:26.000
That's the way these things, all of these different projects are going.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.080
And however they're implemented, that's where there's differences.

49:29.080 --> 49:31.960
SNAPs, SNAP packages are an Ubuntu-specific thing.

49:31.960 --> 49:37.280
XUG Apps are sort of a distribution agnostic kind of thing.

49:37.280 --> 49:38.280
Recently we talked about AppImage.

49:38.280 --> 49:39.280
Remember?

49:39.280 --> 49:40.280
Yeah, that was fun.

49:40.280 --> 49:43.680
Yeah, was that just last week we talked about AppImage or two weeks ago?

49:43.680 --> 49:47.720
Two weeks ago, which is essentially another download run anywhere thing.

49:47.720 --> 49:50.760
It's download an application, mark it executable, and run it.

49:50.760 --> 49:51.760
No need to install.

49:51.760 --> 49:52.760
No system libraries.

49:52.760 --> 49:53.760
Has similar SNAPs.

49:53.760 --> 49:57.760
You know, it has like a read-only kind of, you know your app doesn't change.

49:57.760 --> 49:58.960
It's not getting overwritten.

49:58.960 --> 50:00.720
All the dependencies are bundled together.

50:00.720 --> 50:03.040
So a lot of different takes on this.

50:03.040 --> 50:08.200
Anybody in the Mumber Room kind of maybe more familiar with SNAP packages and some of the

50:08.200 --> 50:11.160
technical details that maybe wants to fill in anything that I've missed here?

50:11.160 --> 50:14.960
You guys are welcome to jump in.

50:14.960 --> 50:18.160
And of course, the Chapman's pointed out, updates are going to be an interesting thing

50:18.160 --> 50:21.520
with SNAP packages because you'll have your base system updates and then you'll have to

50:21.520 --> 50:25.560
update your SNAP packages as well, which might have their own libraries and their own containers.

50:25.560 --> 50:27.200
But those will just be Delta updates, right?

50:27.200 --> 50:28.760
Is that what they're working on?

50:28.760 --> 50:29.760
Supposedly.

50:29.760 --> 50:30.760
Yeah, supposedly.

50:30.760 --> 50:31.760
Very much so.

50:31.760 --> 50:35.240
So we're going to get to a point in the future where there's going to be a lot of different

50:35.240 --> 50:38.320
like technologies that are essentially solving the same problem.

50:38.320 --> 50:39.320
Well, we're already there.

50:39.320 --> 50:41.400
It's just none of them have any large acceptance.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.640
When Ubuntu rolls out SNAP packages.

50:42.640 --> 50:43.640
That's going to be a big push.

50:43.640 --> 50:44.640
Yeah.

50:44.640 --> 50:45.640
Yeah.

50:45.640 --> 50:49.720
XGG Apps though is, you know, Fedora, Red Hat, Gnome behind that one.

50:49.720 --> 50:50.720
So I wonder.

50:50.720 --> 50:51.720
Yes.

50:51.720 --> 50:54.520
Kits and Kitty, you were asking about APT?

50:54.520 --> 50:55.520
Yes.

50:55.520 --> 51:00.680
So if I'm understanding this right, does this mean that SNAP packages will coexist on the

51:00.680 --> 51:02.920
same system as APT Git?

51:02.920 --> 51:03.920
Correct.

51:03.920 --> 51:04.920
Yeah.

51:04.920 --> 51:07.960
So basically the base OS is still going to be based on Debian.

51:07.960 --> 51:10.960
Ubuntu, whatever it's going to be, is still Debian based.

51:10.960 --> 51:13.800
The core OS packages are installed by APT.

51:13.800 --> 51:16.640
You can still install packages from APT.

51:16.640 --> 51:22.600
Think of it, I do in this term, I think of it as how the AUR has this user created applications

51:22.600 --> 51:25.520
and then Arch itself has repos, official repos.

51:25.520 --> 51:27.960
Well, I think the FreeBSD models may be a little better.

51:27.960 --> 51:28.960
Yeah, you're probably right.

51:28.960 --> 51:29.960
Yeah.

51:29.960 --> 51:31.960
Or, you know, in OSX land it's slash applications.

51:31.960 --> 51:32.960
Yeah.

51:32.960 --> 51:33.960
It's the same thing here.

51:33.960 --> 51:34.960
It's the same directory.

51:34.960 --> 51:37.080
But OSX doesn't have a base package manager, right?

51:37.080 --> 51:38.080
Well, no.

51:38.080 --> 51:39.080
You just get it all at once.

51:39.080 --> 51:40.080
It's the same thing.

51:40.080 --> 51:41.080
Yeah.

51:41.080 --> 51:42.080
Yeah.

51:42.080 --> 51:43.080
In this case, you still have devs getting updated in the background.

51:43.080 --> 51:44.080
Sure.

51:44.080 --> 51:45.080
You're now going to have your package manager is going to need to update.

51:45.080 --> 51:49.040
You're going to need to do an APT Git update and upgrade and SNAP package manager is going

51:49.040 --> 51:50.040
to do an upgrade.

51:50.040 --> 51:51.040
Right.

51:51.040 --> 51:52.720
I wonder if they'll wrap that in one or if it will be distinct.

51:52.720 --> 51:53.720
I would assume, right?

51:53.720 --> 51:54.720
Yeah.

51:54.720 --> 51:55.720
I would think so.

51:55.720 --> 51:56.720
Yeah.

51:56.720 --> 52:01.360
So the two will coexist because, I mean, let's be honest, they can't repackage everything

52:01.360 --> 52:02.600
in Debian as a SNAP.

52:02.600 --> 52:04.240
Yeah, becoming another Debian.

52:04.240 --> 52:05.240
Yeah.

52:05.240 --> 52:06.240
Yeah.

52:06.240 --> 52:07.920
And there's no benefit to that, really.

52:07.920 --> 52:11.320
So you have a couple of different technologies.

52:11.320 --> 52:18.640
The ones that I'm very interested in, besides SNAP packages, are XEG apps.

52:18.640 --> 52:24.920
They use cgroups, just like Docker containers do, and namespaces, could leverage SE Linux

52:24.920 --> 52:27.960
and KDBus in the future.

52:27.960 --> 52:31.520
And they're already writing today with Wayland in mind, which I think is really nice.

52:31.520 --> 52:32.520
See, that's nice.

52:32.520 --> 52:37.680
And I would – I mean, however we get to better sandboxed, better containerized or

52:37.680 --> 52:40.720
not applications, that would be a big win for Linux security.

52:40.720 --> 52:42.920
Do you think actually it would be a big win for security?

52:42.920 --> 52:43.920
Because the big pushback –

52:43.920 --> 52:44.920
I mean, it depends on how well it's done.

52:44.920 --> 52:50.840
The big pushback that seems – that everybody always talks about is don't bundle your dependencies.

52:50.840 --> 52:51.840
Don't statically link.

52:51.840 --> 52:55.520
Gentoo has this Wiki post here about why you shouldn't do it.

52:55.520 --> 52:59.000
Everybody always says the problem with PBIs is they include all of their own libraries,

52:59.000 --> 53:05.200
which means if there's a security vulnerability in open SSL, you have to update lib SSL on

53:05.200 --> 53:10.520
lib open SSL on all of those applications instead of just updating it once on your system.

53:10.520 --> 53:11.520
Is it better for security?

53:11.520 --> 53:12.920
See, that's a good point.

53:12.920 --> 53:18.440
I was more referring to the sandboxing parts of it, which I think Snappy has less as compared

53:18.440 --> 53:19.440
to maybe XEG.

53:19.440 --> 53:22.720
You know, where you're using cgroups, maybe you have a whole network namespace.

53:22.720 --> 53:24.180
I don't know.

53:24.180 --> 53:26.320
There is an issue with bundling dependencies.

53:26.320 --> 53:29.840
That's one thing that Linux users for a long time have kind of cited as like, hey, we don't

53:29.840 --> 53:30.840
do this.

53:30.840 --> 53:34.440
I guess it depends on how widespread it is.

53:34.440 --> 53:35.760
Like I like if the base system –

53:35.760 --> 53:36.760
And I think it –

53:36.760 --> 53:37.760
Oh, go on.

53:37.760 --> 53:41.120
I was going to say, I think it depends on who's doing the bundling.

53:41.120 --> 53:44.120
I think if it's upstream, the maintainers of the distro doing the bundling and they're

53:44.120 --> 53:48.320
actually keeping track of security updates and those sorts of things, it's fine.

53:48.320 --> 53:51.160
Like in the case of Snappy, if Canonical is doing the building of the snaps and they're

53:51.160 --> 53:53.720
actually being responsible and updating it, then it's fine.

53:53.720 --> 53:56.280
It'll come right from the same source they're getting the things in the distro.

53:56.280 --> 53:58.800
If it's coming from somebody who's responsible –

53:58.800 --> 53:59.800
If it's coming from somebody who's responsible –

53:59.800 --> 54:00.800
And all the bundling will be okay.

54:00.800 --> 54:01.800
Yeah.

54:01.800 --> 54:02.800
If it's coming from somebody who's responsible.

54:02.800 --> 54:03.800
Right.

54:03.800 --> 54:04.800
But that's kind of the problem is then when you let it go to developers, sometimes they

54:04.800 --> 54:05.800
are not responsible.

54:05.800 --> 54:06.800
They're fixing their bundle dependencies.

54:06.800 --> 54:07.800
Yeah.

54:07.800 --> 54:08.800
An example –

54:08.800 --> 54:09.800
Oh, go ahead.

54:09.800 --> 54:12.800
If you're getting Eclipse and it's given the Eclipse project, chances are they're just

54:12.800 --> 54:16.680
going to throw it all together into one great big snap and it's just going to be like,

54:16.680 --> 54:17.680
well, what if that changes?

54:17.680 --> 54:20.520
It's like, well, they're probably just going to say, oh, it works.

54:20.520 --> 54:21.520
Just don't use that.

54:21.520 --> 54:22.520
You know?

54:22.520 --> 54:23.520
Hmm.

54:23.520 --> 54:24.520
Yeah.

54:24.520 --> 54:28.440
I think that – I look at that and I go, there could be a possibility that you could

54:28.440 --> 54:33.840
have a couple of applications installed that have out-of-date libraries after a security

54:33.840 --> 54:34.840
issue.

54:34.840 --> 54:38.040
At the same time, that's a theoretical problem.

54:38.040 --> 54:41.960
I mean, it's a theoretical problem that's pretty easy to abstract from watching what

54:41.960 --> 54:43.360
could happen.

54:43.360 --> 54:44.920
But it is a theoretical problem.

54:44.920 --> 54:48.560
It also can go the other way, like subsonics problem, right?

54:48.560 --> 54:50.560
It wants newer libraries to be installed.

54:50.560 --> 54:51.560
Oh, yeah.

54:51.560 --> 54:52.560
That's very much.

54:52.560 --> 54:53.560
You're trying to install in 14.4.

54:53.560 --> 54:54.560
Yeah.

54:54.560 --> 54:55.560
If you start messing around with that stuff.

54:55.560 --> 54:56.560
Right.

54:56.560 --> 54:57.560
But you want your new app to have the shiny new on.

54:57.560 --> 54:58.560
Yeah.

54:58.560 --> 54:59.560
Super patched.

54:59.560 --> 55:04.280
The other thing is actually – what actually makes a system usually more secure is to avoid

55:04.280 --> 55:10.160
a monoculture and to have diversity and to have a lot of different obstacles in the way

55:10.160 --> 55:11.520
for an attacker.

55:11.520 --> 55:15.560
And so ironically, we've talked so much about having statically linked libraries could

55:15.560 --> 55:17.840
be a security issue.

55:17.840 --> 55:18.840
It's possible.

55:18.840 --> 55:20.360
This is just – I'm just putting this out there.

55:20.360 --> 55:24.920
But it's possible that having a whole bunch of random different versions of things on

55:24.920 --> 55:30.440
one system makes it very hard for an attacker to be able to set expectations and know what

55:30.440 --> 55:34.360
to be able to rely on exploiting in order to take advantage of a system.

55:34.360 --> 55:38.520
In other words, because these applications will all be using different versions of libraries,

55:38.520 --> 55:41.840
there may not be a common threat for an attacker to take advantage of.

55:41.840 --> 55:46.160
So diversity may actually end up being a security advantage.

55:46.160 --> 55:50.140
Just saying – I'm not saying theoretically that sounds sound, but in the way things seem

55:50.140 --> 55:54.880
to actually work out, one of the reasons why there's way less viruses for Linux – don't

55:54.880 --> 55:55.880
kid yourself.

55:55.880 --> 55:57.720
It's not because we have a small usage.

55:57.720 --> 55:59.760
Linux has a huge market share in servers.

55:59.760 --> 56:02.320
There's a ton of money in Linux malware.

56:02.320 --> 56:06.400
There's very few Linux malware, partially because we have a good security model, but

56:06.400 --> 56:12.220
also because we are fragmented as F. And it's very hard to write once and run anywhere on

56:12.220 --> 56:13.440
Linux right now.

56:13.440 --> 56:15.160
And that includes malware.

56:15.160 --> 56:16.360
That includes malware.

56:16.360 --> 56:22.320
And so if you continue to diversify in a weird way, you may be adding to security.

56:22.320 --> 56:23.320
I don't know.

56:23.320 --> 56:24.320
I could be wrong.

56:24.320 --> 56:25.320
But it might not be all –

56:25.320 --> 56:28.080
I'm going to package all my malware as SNAP packages thanks to you, Chris.

56:28.080 --> 56:29.080
Hey-o!

56:29.080 --> 56:30.080
Hey-o!

56:30.080 --> 56:31.080
And also submit it to the AUR while you're at it.

56:31.080 --> 56:34.880
Kitson, I wanted to give you a chance to jump in, though, because you had a point that

56:34.880 --> 56:35.880
I wanted you to ask.

56:35.880 --> 56:36.880
Yeah.

56:36.880 --> 56:42.720
I could actually see this being used to create a two-tiered system for package managing.

56:42.720 --> 56:47.480
Maybe you could have packages installed in your home directory somewhere.

56:47.480 --> 56:53.320
That way when you go to update your system and you want to do a full wipe on your system

56:53.320 --> 56:59.880
partition, you can keep those applications that you have installed on your home partition.

56:59.880 --> 57:03.320
I don't know if that's technically possible, but that's an interesting idea.

57:03.320 --> 57:04.320
Yeah.

57:04.320 --> 57:08.880
I've – Poppy, I'm glad you joined us because I just gave like a rough explanation

57:08.880 --> 57:09.880
of SNAP packages.

57:09.880 --> 57:11.520
I don't know if you've been listening.

57:11.520 --> 57:14.760
But if you want to correct me in any way, if you know any better, you feel free to jump

57:14.760 --> 57:15.760
in.

57:15.760 --> 57:16.760
I haven't been listening.

57:16.760 --> 57:17.760
I'm sorry.

57:17.760 --> 57:18.760
I was far too busy on the other podcast.

57:18.760 --> 57:19.760
Yeah.

57:19.760 --> 57:20.760
I know the time zone thing.

57:20.760 --> 57:21.760
The time zone thing.

57:21.760 --> 57:22.760
Yeah.

57:22.760 --> 57:23.760
Look at you.

57:23.760 --> 57:24.760
You're back-to-back podcasting right now, aren't you?

57:24.760 --> 57:25.760
I know, right?

57:25.760 --> 57:26.760
You're pro.

57:26.760 --> 57:27.760
You're pro.

57:27.760 --> 57:28.760
Never stop.

57:28.760 --> 57:32.620
We were just actually talking about SNAP packages, and this is actually something that I'm really

57:32.620 --> 57:36.880
glad you're here to answer because we talked about the dependencies and static link libraries,

57:36.880 --> 57:44.240
but one other thing, a kind of a con I've heard about SNAP packages is the backend can't

57:44.240 --> 57:46.240
be implemented on premises.

57:46.240 --> 57:53.520
The backend is run and controlled by Canonical, and there's not really an equivalent of having

57:53.520 --> 57:56.440
a local repository on your land.

57:56.440 --> 57:58.120
Is that – am I accurate?

57:58.120 --> 58:00.720
I'm not sure that's the case.

58:00.720 --> 58:04.240
That might be the case today because it isn't all finished yet.

58:04.240 --> 58:10.560
It's all like shifting sand underneath you at the moment, but I don't doubt that that

58:10.560 --> 58:14.320
will be the case in the future because I know there are plenty of people who want to implement

58:14.320 --> 58:20.520
SNAP on premises and don't necessarily want to have their systems calling outside to the

58:20.520 --> 58:21.520
internet.

58:21.520 --> 58:22.520
Sure.

58:22.520 --> 58:25.360
I mean, just look at providers like DigitalOcean who have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

58:25.360 --> 58:28.520
and hundreds of Ubuntu machines doing updates.

58:28.520 --> 58:29.520
For them, it makes a lot of sense.

58:29.520 --> 58:36.440
Also, one of the big selling points of SNAP is the secure side of it, and if you're a

58:36.440 --> 58:41.800
security-conscious organization where you want to make sure that there's no possibility

58:41.800 --> 58:45.560
for outside ingress to your network, then you want to make sure that all updates are

58:45.560 --> 58:47.360
delivered from inside your network.

58:47.360 --> 58:49.240
So I'm sure that's something that's on the radar.

58:49.240 --> 58:54.440
I've seen other people discuss it within Canonical, and at trade shows I've seen it

58:54.440 --> 58:58.680
being discussed, so I don't think it's dismissed as not happening.

58:58.680 --> 58:59.680
It's just not done yet.

58:59.680 --> 59:00.680
Sure.

59:00.680 --> 59:01.680
Sure.

59:01.680 --> 59:02.680
That makes sense.

59:02.680 --> 59:06.880
So if I was a betting man, Bobby, and I was asking for hints from you, when would I bet

59:06.880 --> 59:12.640
that I could install – when can I reliably expect to install SNAP packages?

59:12.640 --> 59:13.800
And am I using the right term?

59:13.800 --> 59:14.800
Is it a SNAP package?

59:14.800 --> 59:17.240
When I'm talking like instead of a DEB, is it a SNAP?

59:17.240 --> 59:18.240
Well, we tend to call it a SNAP.

59:18.240 --> 59:19.240
A SNAP.

59:19.240 --> 59:20.240
Oh, okay.

59:20.240 --> 59:21.240
So have you got a SNAP for that?

59:21.240 --> 59:22.240
Yeah.

59:22.240 --> 59:23.240
Yeah.

59:23.240 --> 59:24.240
Have you got a SNAP for that?

59:24.240 --> 59:25.240
That's good.

59:25.240 --> 59:28.240
So will there be a point where I'll be able to install them?

59:28.240 --> 59:29.240
You made that up.

59:29.240 --> 59:30.240
Wow.

59:30.240 --> 59:31.240
That's brilliant.

59:31.240 --> 59:32.240
I'm glad that came over.

59:32.240 --> 59:33.240
Get this man a raise.

59:33.240 --> 59:34.240
That is good.

59:34.240 --> 59:35.240
That is what's going to happen.

59:35.240 --> 59:36.240
That's what people will say.

59:36.240 --> 59:40.520
And so is the goal to have – is it going to be possible to install them in 16.04?

59:40.520 --> 59:41.520
Like I don't understand when that –

59:41.520 --> 59:42.520
Yep.

59:42.520 --> 59:43.520
Really?

59:43.520 --> 59:44.520
Oh.

59:44.520 --> 59:45.520
Yep.

59:45.520 --> 59:46.520
Well, you already – I mean, there's pre-release images now.

59:46.520 --> 59:51.160
I'm running SNAPy on my Raspberry Pi 2, which is on my desk in front of me.

59:51.160 --> 59:56.360
I've got the light blinking away at me as it's building stuff, but it's kind of – it's

59:56.360 --> 59:57.360
under development.

59:57.360 --> 59:58.360
It's shifting sand right now.

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.480
It's really heavily under development.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.520
And so, you know, things can change.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.680
APIs can change, terminology changes, and so on.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:13.800
But once 16.04 is out, sometime soon after that, I would expect it to all stabilize,

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:21.800
and you would get an LTS-style SNAPy image for your device, whatever device that is,

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.760
and be able to install SNAP packages or indeed for the desktop as well.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.880
I remember the next – it seems like – not that that isn't enough of a challenge.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:36.000
But then the next really big milestone would be to get the developer community creating

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
their own SNAPs.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.200
Are you – I mean, am I following?

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.200
Does that seem like the next step?

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.680
And that seems like a massive task.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.680
Yeah.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.920
And we're trying to – we're creating tools to make that easy.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.920
Like that is a target.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:53.080
That is a definitive target is to get developers creating SNAPs.

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.840
And one of the tools that we have is called SNAPcraft.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.840
Oh, yeah.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.840
That's right.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:02.200
SNAPcraft just takes a single plain text YAML file, like – so for example, you can

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:09.080
take a single plain text YAML file and bring together an application that is currently

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.080
on GitHub.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:16.340
And you can bring like the tip of trunk on GitHub, and you can pull in whatever dependencies

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.340
it needs.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.520
Maybe that application needs FFmpeg or AVConf or something like that.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:25.480
And so you can go and get the AVConf from the Debian Archive or the Ubuntu Archive.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:29.240
Or you can go and get – if you need Bleeding Edge, you can go and get that from GitHub

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:34.200
or Bitbucket or wherever it comes from and pull all of these things together into an

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:38.520
application and define all of that just in a single plain text YAML file.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.520
Right.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.520
And SNAPcraft.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.520
Right.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.480
And boom, it pushes out SNAP, which you then upload to the store.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.640
In fact, you can upload to the store directly from SNAPcraft.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:52.200
So you can just do SNAPcraft, SNAP, and it will create a SNAP, and then SNAPcraft upload,

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.680
and boom, you're in the store.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.120
It's super easy.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.120
I love it.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:04.000
You know, when I first started playing with SNAPs, I was as skeptical as you and was fearful

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.300
for change as you.

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:10.440
And recently, I have been playing with it, and it is an amazingly good file.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.680
So the YAML file that describes the SNAP, what is that called?

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:18.680
Because I watched Shuttleworth up on stage write one of those in probably 25 seconds.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.000
He'd probably written it 100 times, but...

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
It's a plain text file.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Yeah.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
What do you call that file, though?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
It's the...

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
YAML?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Yeah.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
It's a SNAPcraft.yaml.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
It's got a predefined name, SNAPcraft.yaml.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Okay.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Okay.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
YAML.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Yeah.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
YAML.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
So...

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
It's got a predefined format, and it's very easy to read.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Yeah.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.520
And in this file, you could say grab a file from GitHub or grab a file from FTP or grab

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.760
a file from apt-colon-slash.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.760
Like, the source can...

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:47.760
Okay.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.760
Where am I wrong?

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:49.760
Well, yeah.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.760
But you're right.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.760
I mean, the syntax is different.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:55.760
But yeah, you say, go and get this from GitHub, go and get that from the archive.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:02.600
But you might say, like, for example, if you package up something simple like Calcet, right?

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.920
Calcet is written in Perl, I think.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.880
So you'd need a certain number of Perl modules.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.280
You don't need all of Perl, and you don't need every Perl module.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.920
And in fact, the way that Debian and Ubuntu package things, they tend to bundle together

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.120
a whole bunch of modules, but you don't need all of them.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:23.020
So why would you package all of that together in dependencies in your Calcet application?

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:27.220
You would pull in Calcet and then the one or two modules that you need.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:32.240
So it's not just go and get this thing from GitHub, but go and get this thing from GitHub,

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:37.280
go and get this Debian package, but only get these individual parts of that Debian package.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.080
You don't have to get the whole thing, and go and get these individual parts of another

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.080
Debian package.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:47.720
So you can smush together all the bits that you would normally find inside, say, for example,

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:51.760
a Windows executable, or what you'd find inside a Mac DMG file.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.280
There'd be loads of individual parts.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.920
We call them parts in the Snappy world.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:03.920
And those are brought together and built together to form one atomic unit, which is a snap.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.740
Has there been any talk about any other distributions letting this run?

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.160
How easy would it be to port?

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.160
Because I feel like that's where I'm really amazed.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:13.880
Dude, we barely have it running on Ubuntu, let alone someone else having it.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.840
But how standalone are they?

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:17.840
Maybe it can work on Debian.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.840
They're all self-referenced.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.120
It seems like it could probably work on Debian.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.120
Right.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.120
So they are SquashFS files.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:31.840
So technically, a snap is a SquashFS file, which is mounted at a particular path in the

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:32.840
file system.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:33.840
Okay.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:34.840
That's kind of similar to what AppImage was doing.

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:35.840
Yeah.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:37.480
And there's two parts to it.

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:41.000
There's the read-only part, which gives you the security that you know those files haven't

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
been modified.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Right.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
And then there's a writable part.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.320
So every application needs a writable area, whether it's config or data or state or whatever

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.320
it is.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.320
Yeah, exactly.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.600
And so a snap gives you both of those.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:00.040
And potentially, that could be installed on other distributions.

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.080
Obviously, that's not our focus.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.080
Right.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.080
Right.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.720
We're totally focused on running on Ubuntu.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:09.800
I want to just, if we can – well, you know what?

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:11.560
I want to do the big takeaway.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.240
But before then, I want Kitson to jump in.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.240
And then I'll jump in.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:16.720
Kitson, go ahead.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:23.440
So with what you're describing and everything, it does sound really complex to actually install

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.920
the application as far as the behind-the-scenes stuff goes.

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:30.800
So does this mean that the snap packages, will they remove themselves cleanly from a

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.040
system and clean up their own depths and not configs?

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.600
Oh, my God, yes.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.040
It's less complex, in fact.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:45.600
So one of the nice things about snaps is when you upgrade them, if anything goes wrong,

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.320
they automatically roll back.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.160
And the same goes for the kernel and the OS.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:51.960
So in the event that you have –

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.960
Whoa, whoa.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.960
The kernel's going to be a snap?

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:54.960
Yep.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960
The kernel's a snap.

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.960
Not a deb.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:57.960
The OS is a snap.

01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.960
Well, where's the line drawn?

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.660
No, in terms of desktop, is that true?

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.660
Or is that you just talking –

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:02.660
Oh, right.

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:03.660
Okay.

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:04.660
No.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.760
If you think about the Raspberry Pi running –

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.760
Sure.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:07.760
Or the phone.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:08.760
Or the snappy – yeah, yeah.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:09.760
Or the phone.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:10.760
Then the kernel is a snap.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:11.760
The OS is a snap.

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:19.320
On the desktop, right now, for 16.04, it's slightly blurry because you have a mixed mode.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:23.740
You've got the Debian world where you can still install Debs, but you've also got the

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:25.960
ability to install snaps as well.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.760
You've got these two dimensions, as we call them.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:33.600
So in fact, this is where it gets – it fuzzes your brain a little bit.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:39.160
If you install on a Raspberry Pi a snappy install – so it's snappy out of the box

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:46.740
– then you can have the classic dimension, which lets you install Debs, and conversely,

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:52.240
if you've installed a Debian-based distro, like a desktop, there is the snappy dimension.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:07:00.020
So on either side, you can install both, but they're kind of kept separate.

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:06.880
So if this actually all gets pulled off and there are actual snaps available for things

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:12.600
I care about, like say Sublime Text and Dropbox and Telegram and Chrome, which could take

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.160
a year or so, but whatever.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.360
Let's just say it takes a while.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:22.560
What we are essentially now entering into the era of is an LTS that no longer holds

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.820
you back from having modern applications.

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:32.720
So where 14.04 – you could say the difficulty with 14.04 was it was always sort of tied

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:37.920
down to an older version of GTK, which at this point in time now feels a little limiting.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:41.080
Certain things you just can't install, et cetera.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:47.240
But with 16.04, if snap packages actually take off and there are snaps, I could install

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.720
an application like Corebird two years down the road now.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:55.640
So let's take like a hypothetical example, like exactly what you're saying.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:08:02.360
Let's take 16.04 and 16.04 ships with, I don't know, LibreOffice 5.1 or whatever

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.720
the latest version of LibreOffice is.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.180
Because it's an LTS, the support lasts for years.

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:13.760
And then sometime during that support cycle, the Document Foundation release a new version

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:17.760
of LibreOffice, which is like the kick-ass version of LibreOffice that has –

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:23.200
High DPI, integrated support, online collaborative editing.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.200
Oh yeah, boom, go.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.200
All of that stuff.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:26.200
Yes.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.120
And more that you could not even think about.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.120
I want it now.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.200
Like we're talking AlphaGo levels of functionality.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.320
So imagine they did that, right?

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:40.040
Typically we wouldn't put that back in the LTS release because we freeze the release

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:44.460
and we only do bug updates and security updates.

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:50.080
Imagine that there is a Snappy package in the store which is LibreOffice 6 or 7 or 8

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:54.240
or whatever, which is bundled with whatever libraries are required to make that thing

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.720
work on 16.04.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:09:02.560
Now you could choose to stay on LibreOffice 5 or you could say I'll take LibreOffice

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:07.600
6 or 7 because my business needs it or because I like the bleeding edge or I just want to

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.640
try this stuff out and then undo it afterwards and roll it back afterwards.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.840
Because it's a self-contained SquashFS file, when you uninstall it, it's all gone away,

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.600
including all the dependencies.

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.600
That is going to be.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.960
And of course I know people listening are going to say, hey, there's a bunch of other

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.560
people doing this.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:23.560
And I say, great.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.560
Totally.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.120
Which validates exactly what we're doing.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.440
Clearly we're not doing the wrong thing.

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:32.960
And it's like a very common, it's like, okay, great now ship and let's see what works really

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:33.960
well.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:34.960
I'm looking forward to that.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:35.960
Yeah.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:36.960
Wow.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:43.760
So maybe is it possible that there is something I can play around with for like my 16.04 review

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.160
to talk about the process?

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.680
Is there something out there already or am I going to, is it going to be like, you know,

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:53.600
a down the road 16.04 kind of thing?

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.600
What to install?

01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:00.680
I would love to install a snap package for the first time on Linux action show during

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.720
the 16.04 review.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:03.720
That'd be awesome.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:04.720
Yeah.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:05.720
You probably could.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:06.720
You probably could install it.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.400
You're not going to be able to install because it's early days, but there would be a small

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:15.680
set that you could probably install fairly close to release, if not like soon before

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:16.680
release.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.720
I think it's and then many more after.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:25.480
Well another idea for the developers, because one of the most as a developer side, the most

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:31.120
annoying thing about Linux distribution is to get it in the repo with the snap packages.

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:35.800
It seems like you just write a YAML script file or, you know, not script, but a YAML

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:41.240
setup file and then you just submit it or build a package, submit it and you're done.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.440
And you're in control of that.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.600
So if you, if you want to push a new version to the store every day, if you want to push

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:51.020
a new version, like yeah, a new version comes out twice a day and then there's a security

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:54.920
update and then there's a bug fix cause you were having a bad day and you did a typo and

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:59.360
sure enough you can shove another one in the store and your users will get another.

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:03.520
And if you, and if you push an update that actually balks on client systems and it doesn't

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:07.400
start anymore, then the client systems will roll them back for you.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.400
That's nice.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.400
That is nice.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:10.400
Wow.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.140
I am so, uh, the next segment, I'm going to, it's good.

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:16.480
This actually sort of just builds on everything we just talked about in terms of 1604 I, I,

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.400
before we go too much further here, I got to just disclaimer sitting in front of me.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:25.520
I do have an Ubuntu Mate 1510 machine, but that right there, that's mint over there.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:27.120
That's arch upstairs is arch.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.480
I mean, I'm still a multi distribution man.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:32.480
I love, I still love arch, but I gotta say,

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:39.480
I have never been more excited about an Ubuntu release in, uh, I mean, I'm, I mean, I, I

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.560
maybe since 1204, I don't know.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.240
I don't, I, this is genuinely looking like an incredible release.

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:52.040
And a part of that is because, I mean, the snapback is just sounding awesome, but what's

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:57.600
coming down the road, uh, I just had a conversation last night with Wimpy about some of the work

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:04.040
he's done on Ubuntu Mate that's going to ship in 1604 to, to sort of bridge that gap between

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:09.800
the traditional desktop environment and where the quote unquote modern Linux desktop is

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:14.160
going and how do you not fall behind and have to become your own island.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.180
And that stuff is landing in 1604, so you take the snap packages, you take the long

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:26.080
term support, you take the really great derivatives now, um, and ZFS.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.280
So anyways, uh, I'm going to, we're going to talk about, uh, the work that Wimpy did,

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.200
but first I want to talk about Linux Academy, our sponsor right here on the Unplugged program,

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.200
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:37.280
In fact, live stream, would you all go there right now?

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.520
Go there right now so that way they can see in their logs during the Unplugged show.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.520
They got a huge spike in traffic.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:43.520
Let's just do it.

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:44.520
Let's see.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.600
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.600
Go there right now.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.440
Learn more about the Linux Academy.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:53.520
It's a platform to learn the technologies built on top of Linux and of course the Linux

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.600
fundamentals itself.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:58.560
Either that's in a nugget, a deep dive, two minutes to 60 minutes long, or it's through

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:06.000
a comprehensive course with downloadables, great study guides, audio, video, live streams,

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.940
all of that, 2,300 and what, 32 courses.

01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:12.940
Look at that.

01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:14.820
Instructor help is available when you need it.

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:15.820
That's really nice too.

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:16.820
They have a great system.

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:19.880
You can go in there and you can tell it how much time you have available in a week.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:20.960
I have time on a Tuesday.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.800
I have time on a Thursday.

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.660
And then of course after the Linux action show, I'm going to do a little bit of study

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:27.160
and so I got some time on Sunday.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.280
Well, guess what?

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.320
You tell it that, you plug that into the system, it automatically generates courseware for

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.400
you that matches that availability.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:36.320
They also have other systems that are great for those of us that are time crunched and

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.720
when you want to go deep, so many great courses on that.

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.740
I think their scenario-based labs are pretty unique.

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:47.520
Those are really cool labs that put you in the middle of tasks common to everyday environments

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:50.440
so you really get a sense of working out in the field.

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:54.200
You can work in their advanced lab environments completing the task from beginning to end.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:57.080
It's an entire scenario that you might find in the working environment.

01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:58.080
It's the real deal.

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.840
It is nice and the thing about it is they have seven plus distributions to choose from

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:06.040
so it automatically adjusts the virtual machine and the courseware to match that distribution

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.240
and then they've got graded server exercises which I think is really cool.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.120
They automatically grade your actions so you can see how well you did which is really nice

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:15.120
and they have systems in there.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:20.640
If you've got a little bit of anxiety, not to mention the community is stacked full of

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.040
Jupyter Broadcasting members and they're adding content.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.120
They're working on an Android app.

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.800
They've got an iOS app now.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.960
They're updating all the time.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.560
They've just moved to new offices with new staff.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:34.040
They're expanding like crazy and they're doubling down on the content but what I think is really

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:43.920
nice is they're hiring dedicated staff to make sure the back catalogue of content, huh,

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.080
the back catalogue – that's harder to say – try saying that, Wes, the back catalogue

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.080
of content.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.080
Try that.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.080
I'm not sure you said bat catalogue.

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.080
Yeah.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.080
Try saying the back catalogue of content.

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.080
Go ahead.

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.080
Try it.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.080
Back catalogue of – it's hard.

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.080
Try it.

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.080
Back catalogue of content.

01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.880
You had to slow down.

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:00.880
Try it.

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:01.880
Say it fast, Wes.

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:02.880
Say it fast.

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:03.880
Back catalogue of content.

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:04.880
Say it one more time.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:05.880
Back catalogue of content.

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:06.880
That's really hard.

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.880
Damn you, Chris.

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:11.360
So they've got dedicated personnel now, dedicated – because they're dedicated, Wes.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.360
I don't know if you knew this.

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.360
They're very dedicated.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:17.160
They're dedicated to that back catalogue of content over at Linux Academy, which I

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.440
think is just a brilliant move.

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.440
Great in-depth resources.

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.440
Go check them out.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:22.440
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.280
It's a great fit for you guys.

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:25.280
And they're a great sponsor.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:29.200
Thank you, Linux Academy, for sponsoring the unplugged program, LinuxAcademy.com slash

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.200
unplugged.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.200
Unplugged.

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:33.240
And keep that catalogue shining, Linux Academy.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.720
Keep that catalogue shining.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:40.840
So this is literally how the conversation goes last – I think it was last night because

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:47.480
Wimpy knows that we've been following the client-side decoration thing on Gnome and

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:51.640
the whole debate between client-side and server-side decoration implementations and all of that.

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.480
We've followed it since the beginning, really.

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.840
So we're talking back and forth and he says, well, tomorrow I'm going to write up this

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.760
post about this work I did in Ubuntu Mate.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.520
And then about 30 minutes go by and he links me to the post that he'd written because

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.680
he's so excited about it.

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.000
He's had to get it out there, I think.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.760
So I don't even want to take it from you, Wimpy.

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:09.760
I don't want to steal it.

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:14.480
But give us an update about some of the work that you did to implement client-side decorations

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:18.000
and header bar applications in Ubuntu Mate, which will be shipping in 16.04.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.520
Can you tell us a little bit about some of that work you did and why?

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:24.740
I can.

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:31.560
So although I've done some things, I've not done anything particularly new.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:39.040
So there's a hat tip here to Wolfgang Albrecht, who is the Mate developer who maintains the

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.000
Mate themes.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.920
And he worked out a lot of this stuff.

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:50.640
And I borrowed from the work that he's done in order to do this.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:17:00.560
But what this gives us is that the default themes in Ubuntu Mate now support client-side

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:04.960
decorated applications and those applications with header bars.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:10.760
And although they have run in the past, they obviously execute, they didn't render correctly.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:17.400
So they didn't have the shadowing effects, and the popovers didn't render correctly,

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:20.640
and a whole raft of just little annoyances.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:25.840
And it's one of those things that when you're using the computer, and I'm using it day after

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:31.280
day, and you want some of those newer applications that are using client-side decorations and

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:37.560
header bar, my favorite at the moment is Corebird, which is hands down the best Twitter client

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:38.560
for desktop Linux.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.800
I agree.

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:46.520
But looked like complete arse, and it wasn't, you know, Ubuntu Mate wasn't doing justice

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.520
to this application.

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:49.000
How do I install it right now?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.880
Could I install it in the repo right now so I can show people?

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.200
Because I'm on the older version.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.120
I'll tell you what, I'll log in.

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.120
Is it not easy?

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.840
Okay, if it's not easy, it's okay.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:02.200
If it was in the software boutique, for example, I would just go ahead and do it.

01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:07.560
Yeah, it's not easy because it's part of the artwork package, which also includes the Plymouth

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:13.440
themes, and the structure of the Plymouth stuff has changed in 16.04 and isn't backwards

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:14.440
compatible.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:16.400
What is the version of GTK in 16.04?

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.040
I think it's 3.18, I think.

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.040
Yeah, I think that sounds right.

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:23.560
I think that's what I remember reading too.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:28.120
So Wimpy, one of the first things when you implemented this, and by the way, it genuinely

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.120
looks good.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.280
One of the things I like about the screenshot is you mixed in traditional title bar applications

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.900
and client-side decoration.

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:36.920
It's very consistent.

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:40.640
It took, I think, three or four comments before people are like, why would you do this?

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.840
This is an atrocity.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.080
Client-side decoration should burn.

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:49.400
I looked back, Wimpy, we've had comments about this, about client-side decoration since 2013.

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.460
The drama doesn't seem to be going away.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:57.840
Why would the bastion of the traditional desktop, where I go to avoid the atrocity that is Unity,

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.880
why would that implement client-side decoration?

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:00.880
Hang on.

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.880
I was just channeling.

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.880
I was just channeling.

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:03.880
Cool.

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:04.880
Peter, you've got something to say.

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:05.880
I can tell.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:06.880
No, no, no.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:07.880
Carry on.

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:08.880
Okay.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:16.040
So it's very, very simple.

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:21.680
You can't hide from the fact that there are client-side decorated applications and applications

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.760
using header bars.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.280
And there are not a huge number of them, but those numbers are growing.

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:33.200
And certainly some of the new applications that are coming along from the GNOME desktop

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:37.440
are compelling and use this design paradigm.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:43.420
And to simply cut yourself off from being able to use those applications would be extremely

01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:50.280
short-sighted for an LTS release and thinking about how those applications are going to

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:54.680
develop and probably become more prominent over the next five years.

01:19:54.680 --> 01:20:00.880
So I wanted to get the support in so that people that are using Ubuntu MATE can have

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:06.320
their traditional applications and we like that stuff and that's great.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:12.080
If there are one or two client-side decorated applications that are clearly best in class

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:16.360
and hands down, the best one that you want.

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:20.360
You don't want it to look rubbish and you want it to work properly and blend with the

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:21.360
rest of the desktop.

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.360
Yeah.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.960
You don't want a penalty for choosing a different desktop environment.

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:25.960
No.

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:26.960
Yeah.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:27.960
No.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:32.260
So Michael Dominic, co-host Coderadio, probably the second mention in this episode, he switched

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:35.240
to Ubuntu recently when his MacBook died on him.

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:40.820
And he's been running 14.04 and one of the applications he tried to install was Corbird.

01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:43.080
But it's not been going well for him.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:47.560
So your insight about needing to have this well supported on an LTS I think is a good

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:51.180
one because he's not willing to run anything but an LTS.

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:56.840
So he's just sort of stuck in this limbo right now and it looks really well done.

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.560
Kitson, I wanted to give you a chance to jump in though because you had something you wanted

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.560
to mention.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.560
Go ahead.

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:04.760
I think Kitson went to get some popcorn.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:05.760
I think he's good.

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.760
He's good.

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:07.760
He's good.

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:12.000
Well, I did find it interesting that people were jumping on the bandwagon saying, by you

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:18.520
supporting client-side decorations here, you're going to help encourage more application development

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:19.520
like that.

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:20.520
Which I –

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:27.640
Well, the thing is that GNOME is kind of this unstoppable force.

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:35.520
So you can't just pretend that GNOME is not out there iterating on their desktop and their

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:41.480
applications every six months and that this is the design direction that they're going

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.480
in.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.800
That's simply crazy.

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:50.040
Well, and I think also – and I don't know, it's not just that wimpy.

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.200
Isn't it also Mere and Weyland?

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:59.120
Well, to some extent and I'll cross that bridge in the future.

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.120
That's –

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:07.460
I guess if my understanding is correct though, GNOME's plan for supporting Weyland is essentially

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:14.920
– their continued effort is behind client-side decorated apps and that's sort of going

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:19.360
to be the future direction for Weyland-supported GNOME applications, am I – right?

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:24.280
So in order for Mate desktop to even begin down the path of Weyland or Mere support,

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:30.000
which your parent distribution is switching to, you have to go this route, don't you?

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Eventually?

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.080
To some extent, yes.

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:37.920
And even if it's eventually, even if it's in another two years for the next LTS, isn't

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:42.680
it sensible just to do it now and learn that?

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:46.160
And this isn't stuff that other people haven't done before.

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:52.560
I think that Ubuntu have got this to some extent as well and some of the other desktop

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:53.680
environments.

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:59.280
But this was new to Ubuntu Mate and I was very pleased with the results because I've

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:08.840
had about a week of some spare time with my computer and we've got ahead of the schedule

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:13.880
for the 16.04 release, so we've got an extended period of being able to do some bug fixing

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.400
and refinements.

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:19.520
And there's been a few things about the themes and the look and feel that I've really never

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:24.420
been happy with, but there's always been something more important needed dealing with.

01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:29.640
So actually having the time to sit down and sort of smooth some of those rough edges.

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:35.240
And then I look back at this, you know, several evenings work and I'd got one computer that

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:38.080
was running that last week's image.

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:42.320
And then this one I'd been working on, I thought, you know what, I really feel like we've nailed

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.320
this.

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:46.800
This is such an improvement because there's there's tweaks and improvements across the

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:55.560
theming across the board and with the Qt4 and Qt5 integration that is activated by default.

01:23:55.560 --> 01:24:00.920
So those are facilities that exist within Qt4 and Qt5 that you have to hook into.

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:02.680
But all of that is baked into Ubuntu.

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:06.320
And just to sort of just sort of break that down, what you're saying is you've enabled

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:11.960
the support for Qt applications to sort of integrate and adopt the look of the GTK application.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:15.000
So they should look at place on the Mate desktop.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Yeah.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:23.320
And those applications that don't define a very specific style will look like a GTK application.

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:28.960
So the Qt apps will look like GTK applications where that's not the case is something like

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:31.940
the official telegram desktop client.

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:36.320
They've got a very specific style that they've kind of hard coded into the application.

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:40.120
They have linked to their own version of Qt and all that kind of stuff.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:41.120
Yeah.

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.120
Yeah.

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.520
This is pretty cool.

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:49.600
And I think this combined with the software boutique will also be in 16.04, right?

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.600
Yeah.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:52.560
And Corebird is in the software boutique.

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:53.560
Yeah.

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.760
That software, literally wimpy, I'm not kidding.

01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:02.600
That software boutique is what kept me on the Apollo running 15.10.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.880
Because when you gave me the PPA for that, all of the extra stuff that I was wanting

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:09.720
from the AUR was in the boutique and I just went through and installed it all in a few

01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:10.720
minutes and then, OK.

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:11.720
Well, now I'm good.

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:12.720
I don't need to go anywhere.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:17.920
But now, now I'm actually considering switching my Arch desktops over to Mate for a little

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:18.920
while.

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:19.920
Whoa.

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:20.920
Yeah.

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:21.920
I know.

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:22.920
We'll see where it goes.

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:23.920
Crikey.

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:24.920
I know.

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:25.920
You'll have to do a lot of heavy lifting for yourself because...

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:26.920
I know.

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:27.920
That is legitimately true.

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:28.920
And that's why I'm hoping Snap packages.

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.160
That's why I'm hoping Snap packages.

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:34.760
I want Snaps for everything and then I'm back on Ubuntu, everybody.

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:35.760
What's up?

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:36.760
Oh, we'll see.

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:37.760
I was actually...

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.760
Full circle.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.440
I was targeting for Fedora as my next landing spot.

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:44.120
But you take this, you take the stuff that Wimpy is doing here, I just love it, and then

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.800
you combine that with Snap packages.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.800
That's a hard, hard thing.

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.280
You know, it's going to drive me to...

01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:49.280
Yeah, go ahead.

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:55.400
I was just going to say, just to sort of close out, I started by mentioning Wolfgang Albrecht

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.240
and then I've reused his work.

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:04.600
I've updated the default themes in Ubuntu Mate, so that's Ambient Mate and Radiant Mate.

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:10.760
But all of the official Mate themes also have all of this support built in.

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:18.400
So the full theme suite is all CSD header bar enabled.

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:22.800
So it's not just one theme, it's everything that comes.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:23.800
It is...

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:28.240
The next couple of years are going to be really something.

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:30.440
There is really a lot of, you know...

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:36.400
And wouldn't it be great in this time if Copper on Fedora got even better, and the build service

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.640
had more and more vendors that were just using the build service, and Snap packages had more

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:44.960
and more people creating Snap packages, and the AUR continues to just be the best thing

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:46.240
out there ever.

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:47.240
Wouldn't that just...

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.560
I mean, wow!

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:50.560
It's so funny.

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:54.680
Depending on your perspective on where you sit, software is either the hardest thing

01:26:54.680 --> 01:27:01.240
to ever do on Linux, and deploy and install, or it is about to be the coolest it has ever

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.400
been ever.

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:06.480
It just depends on your perspective at this point, and if you're a power user who might

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:12.820
be buying that Dell Sputnik because you're a developer, then to you, this is awesome.

01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:15.640
And if you're a regular user, you just got to wait it out a little while, and all this

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.280
stuff will eventually get smoothed out.

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.320
That is pretty freaking cool.

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:23.600
Well, in mumble room, anything else before we wrap up on today's episode, because I'm

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:28.440
ready to go get myself some 16.04, I'm ready to go install some Ubuntu Mate on my arches.

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.440
Get some snaps!

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:31.680
It's going to be a mess up in this place.

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.680
And you know what?

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:33.680
Yeah.

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:34.680
Yeah, go ahead.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:38.720
I wanted to say earlier before my system decided to do what it did.

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.960
When you went AFK, we need away from Mike.

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:42.960
You went AFM.

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:43.960
AFM.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:44.960
Yeah.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:45.960
AFM, bro.

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:46.960
Yeah.

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.240
Well, what happened was this push to talk stopped working on me temporarily, so I had

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.160
to log out and log back in.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.160
I forgive you.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.160
Go ahead.

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:58.080
But yeah, I think supporting the client-side decorations in Mate is extremely important

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:02.000
because it's part of the concept of just working.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.160
And if an application doesn't just work, then people aren't going to use it.

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:10.720
And then the other part of that is if this is a new person coming to Linux, suddenly

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:15.040
that desktop is a desktop that doesn't work for them, and they're not going to recommend

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.600
it to anybody else.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:21.680
So I think it is crucial that these kinds of standards are implemented and supported

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:24.880
correctly in other desktops.

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:25.880
Hmm.

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:26.880
Good point.

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:27.880
And you know what?

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:35.120
I just realized that if I switch away from GNOME 3 because I like Ubuntu Mate's implementation

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:41.080
of the desktop, I'm literally stepping away from the beast that is GNOME and then becoming

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:44.600
dependent on Wimpy's brand of implementation.

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:45.600
That is a scary...

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.600
That is a scary...

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:47.600
They all have all the power.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:48.600
Oh, my goodness.

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:49.600
Oh, my goodness.

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.480
Well, Cotton Rotten, you wanted to mention something.

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:53.480
Go ahead.

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:54.480
Oh, about extensions.

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:55.480
Yeah.

01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:56.480
Oh, yeah.

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:01.400
I just wrote a solution for a problem that I had and a lot of people had.

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.120
In general, there's a preview for it.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.000
That's what it looks like without the extension.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.600
And this is what it looks like with it.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.480
Well, describe it for the audio audience, too.

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:12.480
It's a...

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:17.820
Essentially, what it does is take the GNOME extensions website and provides download buttons

01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:18.820
for the actual extensions.

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:19.820
Oh, cool.

01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:20.820
So you can install them directly.

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:21.820
I see.

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:22.820
Yeah.

01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:24.800
So it's a little cut off on the live stream, but...

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.280
And then I guess that'd be...

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:29.280
So that way, when you reload, you can add them back really quickly, I guess?

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:30.280
Yeah.

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:33.900
You can add them back with the tweak tool and you can also pick which version you want

01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:35.160
in case you don't have...

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.120
It's not detecting the right version, things like that.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.120
Nice.

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:41.320
And it also supports Chromium and basically everything.

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.120
Oh, that's definitely nice.

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:47.360
Yeah, because you got to use a browser that has the Netscape plugin API in order to use

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.360
that.

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:49.360
Yeah.

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:50.360
So it just bypasses it completely.

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:52.960
I'm not sure it's the best way to go, but for you Arch users, oftentimes, almost all

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:56.920
those GNOME extensions are in the AUR, too, and then the package manager updates them.

01:29:56.920 --> 01:30:03.640
While developing it, I talked to one of the GNOME developers and he said that in 3.22,

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:06.560
he's expecting to have GNOME software support for extensions.

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.560
Oh.

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:11.440
And as we wrap up, we should mention, too, that I think OMG Ubuntu has an article about

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:18.320
Canonical looking for a hand on getting their implementation of GNOME software up to schnuff

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.560
because the icons and stuff are broken.

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:23.480
So you guys, if you are interested in that, you can go check that out.

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:26.120
Hey, but you know what, Wes?

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.760
It's a great sound effect.

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:33.760
That brings us to the end of this week's episode of the Unplugged program, 1.36, in the bag,

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:34.760
in the can.

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.880
Man, Linux Fest is coming up so soon.

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:37.880
I'm excited.

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:38.880
Yeah.

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.600
At some point, we're going to have people in the studio.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.240
I mean, what are we going to do with them?

01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:44.240
I don't know.

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.240
Just join us for the shenanigans over at jblive.tv.

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:46.240

Contact to send us an email, and we'll see you right back here next week.

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:39.800
We should give a total shout out to both Popeye and Wimpy, pro broadcasters.

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:44.840
If you ever watch a radio DJ live stream, you get kind of weirded out, at least I did.

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:50.840
The first couple of times I watched Adam Carolla or our local DJs here on Cairo do radio, the

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:56.480
music's playing, and the music's right about to hit, and as the music's hitting the intro,

01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:59.440
they sit down and go, ah, welcome to blah, blah, blah, blah, and it's like, they were

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:04.240
just outside in the room three seconds ago, and then they sat down and just started talking

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.920
like they'd been there the whole time.

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.000
That's what Popeye and Wimpy did this week, because the time zone changed.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:15.040
They're recording the Ubuntu podcast, and then they slip into the mumble room, and some

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:17.680
quick maneuvering on our part.

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:21.280
We bumped the client-side decorations at the end of the show, and we realized daylight

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.280
savings.

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.280
You're giving away our secrets.

01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:26.240
I know, but it all worked out pretty well in the end, so thank you guys for making that

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.240
work.

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:28.240
Yes, thank you.

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.240
We appreciate it.

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:30.240
That was good fun.

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.240
You're welcome.

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.240
I had no idea what the hell you said before we arrived about Snappy.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:36.640
You could have said it was just on the biggest pile of dog shit before I came in.

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.120
Ironically, no, I think if you listen back to the whole-

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:40.160
And then I come in and go, yeah, I completely agree.

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:44.940
I think if you listen back to the whole episode, it all flows really well, because it all sort

01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:48.880
of went together, so that was pretty funny.

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:50.880
Firewatch is loading.

01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:51.880
Here we go, Wes.

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:52.880
I'm excited.

01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:57.920
Ooh, we get a little intro video.

01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:00.600
All right, bring it.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:03.440
Now the mouse cursor's in the video.

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:04.440
Panic Incorporated.

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:11.100
Hey, Panic, sure, okay, I know Panic.

01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:13.840
You old hat, you.

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.800
Boulder, Colorado, 1975, Wes.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:21.800
Get ready.

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:30.120
Uh, I don't see anything right now.

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:33.760
All I see is this, oh, okay, I'm supposed to do something.

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.480
Here we go.

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:40.280
She's about your age, late 20s, laughing with well-dressed professors and grad students

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:42.520
from a nearby CU, Boulder.

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:46.040
You, Henry, are out drinking with your pals.

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:47.040
You approach her.

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:48.240
Bold move, Chris.

01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.840
You are drunk.

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:53.800
So what's your, you know, major?

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:54.800
You?

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:55.800
You're pretty.

01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:56.800
Which one do you want to go with?

01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:57.800
I like that one.

01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:58.800
I like that one.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:33:59.800
I do too, I like that one.

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:00.800
It's sincere.

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:01.800
Are you guys playing Leisure Suit, Larry?

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:03.080
No, we're playing Firewatch.

01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:05.520
You're pretty, she says coolly.

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:06.520
You are not.

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:08.160
You are a future hangover.

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:09.160
Wow.

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.160
What?

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:11.160
You reply confused.

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:12.160
Someone should buy you a cheeseburger, she says.

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:16.000
You flake down a waiter, and one week later, you are Julia's boyfriend.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Nice move.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000
Thank you, sir.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Thank you.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:30.000
All right, so now we're in an elevator, sort of an emo elevator with a really low frame

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.680
rate.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:32.680
So I can click on objects.

01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:33.680
I'm going to pick up this backpack.

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:34.680
Hey, look at that.

01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:35.680
I got a backpack.

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:36.680
Wes.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:37.680
Why are you so critical of this elevator?

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.680
Well, look at the frame rate.

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:42.920
I mean, I know this thing's just Intel Graphics and it's doing mirroring, but, oh, what do

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:43.920
we got here?

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:44.920
Okay.

01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:46.920
Let's walk forward.

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:47.920
Huh.

01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:51.000
The music is great.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.160
So I'm in a parking garage.

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:53.760
Do they sell just the music?

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:54.760
Yes, they do, actually.

01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:55.760
Oh, wow.

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:56.760
Great.

01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:57.760
Yeah.

01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:58.760
They do have that on Steam.

01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.760
Well, I'm going to buy both, I guess.

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.760
It's pretty cool.

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:01.760
All right.

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.760
So this is a pretty hip little truck.

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:03.760
Let's see if I can get in.

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.240
Oh, I happen to have the keys.

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:08.880
It does seem to match your bag.

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:09.880
All right.

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:13.640
I'm in the truck now.

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:15.920
You date for over a year.

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:17.760
She drives you absolutely nuts.

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:20.760
It's great.

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:24.640
Aw, cute.

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:25.640
You move in.

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:29.240
You share an apartment near the school with a view of the mountains.

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.040
You two drink beer out on the deck.

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:32.480
Here, cheers, Wes.

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:34.960
You drink beer just about anywhere.

01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:35.960
That's great.

01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.080
Life is good.

01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:40.080
Julia wants to get a dog.

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:41.080
Oh, do it.

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:42.720
Dogs are great.

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:44.920
There's a scruffy undersized beagle Julia's in love.

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:45.920
She wants to bring it home.

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:48.840
She wants to bring it with her to class.

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:51.280
She's also an intimidating but gentle.

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:54.680
There's also an intimidating but gentle German shepherd.

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.760
Nothing bad could happen to Julia while walking this dog.

01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:57.760
It's badass.

01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:00.760
Let's go with the G. I don't know.

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:03.760
What do you think?

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:09.000
I feel like if Julia got the dog that she can bring to class, it would be an expression

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.240
of your love out in public.

01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:12.240
Yeah, true.

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:15.520
So then she would be able to brag about you, like, oh yes, my boyfriend got me this dog.

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:17.280
As long as she's the one feeding the dog.

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:18.800
And the thing is, beagles are barkers.

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:19.800
They sure are.

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:20.800
They're going to bark.

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:21.800
So I'm going to say beagle.

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:22.800
What do you say?

01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:23.800
All right, do it.

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:24.800
We name him Bucket.

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:28.120
Bucket's a good dog, and a week later, you've totally forgotten about the other one.

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:29.920
Julia loves him.

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:30.920
You love him too.

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.960
Does it feel like they're manipulating us?

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:33.960
Yeah.

01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:40.040
1979, you talk out on the deck, it's summer, 9.30 PM, and the heat still radiates off the

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:41.040
high desert.

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.520
What do you think about kids?

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:43.520
She asks.

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:44.520
Oh boy, Wes.

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:45.520
Getting serious.

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:46.520
Kids?

01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:48.660
They're not very smart, or good at much.

01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:54.360
I'm saying if you and I had some, a couple of little idiots.

01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:55.600
I think we should just say yes.

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:56.600
All right, do it.

01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:00.080
I mean, when this question comes up, she's been thinking about that for a long time.

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.920
You've got to be careful how you answer this one, Wes.

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:03.920
Heads up.

01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:04.920
You're a man with experience.

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:05.920
In that case, we should probably get married.

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:06.920
Yeah?

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:07.920
I would like that, you say.

01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.620
These kids are going to be screwed up enough.

01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:12.440
It's probably the best that their parents are hitched.

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:13.960
You say she's absolutely right.

01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.720
This game moves fast.

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:16.720
Yeah, man.

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:19.240
It's a modern game.

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:22.720
Now you're getting in your super cool... Wait, no, we just got out of our super cool truck.

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:24.480
I missed the truck.

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:27.000
Looks like we're out for a hike.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.200
Let's go take a little walksies.

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:31.640
Thorough fire trial head.

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:32.640
We're all here.

01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:34.480
Don't forget to check in.

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:38.080
Warning, thoroughfare trail is not recommended for the inexperienced hikers.

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:39.560
Don't bring fireworks.

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:40.560
Huh.

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:44.640
This is a pretty gorgeous game, even with the graphics settings turned down to work

01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:45.640
on the Intel graphics.

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:46.640
Yeah.

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:51.560
How do you check in, Wes?

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:53.560
Interesting.

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:56.200
Boy, look at this.

01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:59.660
This is something I think I'm going to play later after the show.

01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:02.520
This is where I miss the Bonobo right now.

01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:04.000
Bonobo will be able to chew on this.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Yeah.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.160
This is part of cool... I didn't check in, so if you see where I'm supposed to check

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.160
in, you let me know.

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.160
I sure will.

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:12.160
Uh-oh.

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:14.000
We got a little crossfade happening.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Stand by one.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Oh, she is.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
1980.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.880
It's Thursday night, and Julia is four hours late.

01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:20.880
She doesn't call.

01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.760
You're worried and getting angrier by the minute.

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:23.760
Whoa.

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:24.760
We got to temper, don't we, Chris?

01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:25.760
She walks in after you've gone to bed.

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:26.760
But not really.

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:27.760
I'm up.

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:28.760
Just pretending to be asleep.

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:31.240
She's not quite drunk, but she's clearly been having a fun time.

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:34.480
You fight when she gets between the sheets.

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:36.680
You fight when she gets between the sheets.

01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:38.720
Do you get mad, or do you ignore her?

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:41.240
You want to press her?

01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:42.720
For convenience of time, I say we press her.

01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:43.720
Yes, press her.

01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:44.720
Let's get mad.

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.200
I mean, Pacific Northwest-wise, we should probably pick the acid.

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.880
You call her an inconsiderate asshole.

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.320
I don't think I would have done that.

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.320
No.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:53.560
She tells you to eff off yourself and not to be such a baby.

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:55.600
You call her selfish.

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.560
She knows you mean it, and it hurts her feelings.

01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:58.560
Ouch.

01:38:58.560 --> 01:38:59.560
That was the wrong call.

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:01.160
This is an emotional game.

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:02.160
I did not mean to do that.

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:03.160
No.

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:04.160
Julie still likes to draw.

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:05.160
She draws plants from her research.

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:06.160
She draws all the places you go.

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:07.160
She draws you.

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.040
You pose and flex like a he-man.

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:12.000
You frolic like Victoria's Secret Model.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Let's go with the Secret Model thing.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Yeah, definitely.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.120
It would be funny.

01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:16.120
She was right.

01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:20.080
You are very pretty.

01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:24.120
Okay.

01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:27.080
Now we're hiking again.

01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.560
It's like we're thinking of this while we're hiking.

01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.560
It's red out.

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:30.560
You see how...

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:31.560
Yeah.

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.880
No instruction of where I'm supposed to go.

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:34.880
No clues.

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:35.880
No mini-map.

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:36.880
Now this is making me want to just wander around.

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:38.580
No health bar.

01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:40.280
No hit points.

01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:43.280
No weapon.

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:45.060
Nothing.

01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:46.720
No indication of where I'm supposed to be going.

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:49.240
I'm just a dude walking out in the forest right now.

01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:52.120
This kind of feels like Up in the Corner.

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.080
That's all you've ever been, Chris.

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:55.240
Although I have better frame rate in real life.

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:58.160
Oh, what's this say?

01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:59.160
Two forks.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:00.160
Okay.

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.160
There we go.

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:02.160
We got to look at it.

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:03.160
Let's go.

01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:06.080
Can I jump?

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.960
Space bar to climb over obstacles.

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:08.960
Space bar.

01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:09.960
There we go.

01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:10.960
Perfect.

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:11.960
Wow.

01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:12.960
I did quite the jump there.

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.400
Oh, look at that sunshine, Wes.

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:15.400
Look at that.

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:16.400
Beautiful.

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:17.400
1982.

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:22.480
During the summers, you and Julia enjoy walking Bucket at night.

01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:23.480
Bucket.

01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:27.240
There's a festival in town that brings folks from faraway places.

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:31.960
One of them tries to mug you with a knife.

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:32.960
Bucket gets kicked.

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:33.960
Oh, that dog.

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:34.960
Oh, that effing dog.

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:35.960
Julia yells.

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:39.040
She gets flustered and has trouble speaking when she gets stressed.

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:40.040
You confront the attacker.

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:41.040
What do we do?

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:44.040
Do we scare him away or beat him in?

01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:45.040
I think we're a gentleman.

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.040
We scare him away.

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:47.040
We scare him away.

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:48.040
Okay.

01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:51.960
Reach into your pocket like you've got a gun and threaten to kill him.

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:53.680
You manage to scare off all three of them.

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.680
Wow.

01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:55.680
Whoa.

01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:57.400
You scare all three of you and he runs away.

01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:58.520
This is moving fast.

01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:00.880
Julia has to take a different path from that day forward.

01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:01.880
You say it's okay.

01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:02.880
You don't want to go that way either.

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:05.880
From then on, you walk by the river.

01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:08.960
The river's pretty anyway.

01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:09.960
1984.

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:20.200
Plans to have kids have got waylaid by work.

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:21.840
Julia gets offered a job at Yale.

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:24.240
Yale is in Connecticut, 2,000 miles away.

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.360
It's a great job, associate department chair.

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:27.360
She wants to move.

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:34.280
You absolutely do not convince her not to take the job or agree if she commutes back

01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:35.280
and forth.

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:36.280
Ouch.

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:37.280
Neither of those are very good options.

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:38.280
Yeah.

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:39.280
Yeah.

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:40.600
Ooh, Chris, this is hitting hard.

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:44.600
I'm going to say agree if she commutes.

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:47.480
I guess so.

01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:50.840
If she's angry at us for that, she has every right to be.

01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:52.320
You ask if she'll commute back and forth.

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:53.560
You don't want to move to Connecticut.

01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:56.080
She says that'll be hard, but she'll do it for you.

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.080
Dang.

01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:58.080
Thanks.

01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.080
You tell her not to pass it up if she wants.

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:00.080
She agrees.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:04.000
She flies back to Boulder three times each semester.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.120
1985.

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:09.980
Julia sent home from Yale on paid leave after having an episode.

01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:14.160
She lost it on college for borrowing books that were on a colleague that were important

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:15.160
to her research.

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:17.960
She didn't remember she'd happily loaned them to him just two days prior.

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:18.960
Jeez.

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:22.520
She was found crying in the stairwell.

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.760
You say that maybe you guys should talk to someone about it.

01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:25.840
That's one option.

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:28.080
You make macaroni and drink wine and try to forget about it.

01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:29.400
What do you think?

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:30.400
I say talk to somebody.

01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:31.400
Yeah.

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:32.400
Let's do that.

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:33.400
Because I'm also worried about that time she came home late.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.400
Yeah.

01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:38.160
After seeing multiple doctors and having many tests, they are worried that Julia might be

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.080
suffering from early onset dementia.

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.080
She's 41.

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:50.520
You decide to keep it a secret for now, for the both of you.

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:51.520
Now we're camping again.

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:55.560
There you go, Wes.

01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:56.560
Here's our journal.

01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:01.200
Maybe we should leave it right here and let the viewer at home fill in the rest.

01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.200
I'm interested though.

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:03.200
I'm hooked.

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:04.200
Whoa.

01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:05.520
That's where we should leave it.

01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:06.520
Right there.

01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:07.520
Right there.

01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:08.520
Perfect.

01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:24.640
There you go.
