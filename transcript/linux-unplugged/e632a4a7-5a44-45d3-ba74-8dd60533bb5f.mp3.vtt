00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
Okay. Well, we love to talk up Chris's hair and rightfully so I'm here. It's quaffed. It's lovely

00:05.640 --> 00:11.520
I want to get a little closer to it, but I'm sad to say I think I've discovered one hair based competition

00:11.520 --> 00:15.480
I don't think you'd win. I don't know Wes don't count the hair out. What do you got?

00:15.480 --> 00:33.640
All right. Well, maybe you want to throw down in the USA mullet championship. I'll do it for the show. Hello

00:33.640 --> 00:39.400
friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is was my name is

00:39.400 --> 00:46.520
Brent. My name is Alex. Hello gentlemen. Well, we have a really fun show today. We took on a challenge

00:46.520 --> 00:53.680
could a demanding Linux user someone who demands excellence live with a reasonably low cost Linux

00:53.680 --> 00:59.320
box. We take a look at a couple of surprising budget Linux PCs. I bet you've never even heard of and

00:59.320 --> 01:05.680
we'll see how they hold out. Plus, we've been challenged to put Linux Mint to the test is the

01:05.680 --> 01:11.560
freshest mint the best Linux for a low end PC. We'll give that a shot and tell you our opinions as

01:11.560 --> 01:17.400
well. Then we'll round out the show with some great boosts, some pics and a lot more. So before we go

01:17.400 --> 01:21.800
any further, you know, it's our duty. We got to say time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

01:21.920 --> 01:31.920
Hello, Mumble Room. Hello, Chris. So many names today. A very strong Mumble Room. Wow. So great.

01:31.920 --> 01:36.000
Hello, everybody. And hello, all of you up there in the quiet listening as well. Very nice to have

01:36.000 --> 01:41.120
you along for the show today. I also want to say good morning over to our friends over at tail

01:41.120 --> 01:47.200
scale. tail scale is a mesh VPN protected by wire guard. We love it. And it's going to change your

01:47.200 --> 01:52.520
networking game. It's going to blow your mind. Go see what wire guard is capable of. Oh, it's a good

01:52.520 --> 01:56.800
morning to go over there. I don't care what time of day it is. Say good morning from Linux unplugged

01:56.800 --> 02:03.040
at tailscale.com. Go try it up to 20 devices free. You can wish them good night too. I suppose I just

02:03.040 --> 02:07.160
like the idea of it's always morning at tailscale. You know, it's always a good morning over at

02:07.160 --> 02:10.760
tailscale. Okay, so we got to start the show off with the meetups. You know, we've been talking

02:10.760 --> 02:14.080
about meetups, we've been talking about meetups. And I know I've listened to podcasts where I'm

02:14.080 --> 02:18.400
like, well, that meetup doesn't apply to me. I wish they didn't talk about it all the time. But

02:18.400 --> 02:23.440
here, here's the thing, buddy, here's the thing. These meetups are a bigger deal than I think you

02:23.440 --> 02:27.640
appreciate until you can attend them. And that's kind of why we continue to talk about them is

02:27.640 --> 02:33.560
because once you go to a meetup, you experience the kind of connection that I think is, I don't

02:33.560 --> 02:37.120
know, it's almost like built into us that we need that kind of social connection with our with our

02:37.120 --> 02:44.280
tribe. And so it can be re energizing, it can be profound in a lot of ways. And so we just had a

02:44.280 --> 02:49.640
couple of them wrap up. And that's one of the reasons Alex is here today. How you feeling, Alex?

02:49.640 --> 02:53.080
Good morning. I know you just woke up a little a little bit before the show, you just got back

02:53.080 --> 02:56.680
home. How was the meetup and everything? How was your flight and all that stuff?

02:56.840 --> 03:00.640
Well, I'm not gonna lie, Chris, you're probably hearing my voice. I'm a little tired right now.

03:01.520 --> 03:06.760
Yeah, I can hear it. Well, yeah, you got a little bit of that frog flight was fine. You know, 18

03:06.760 --> 03:14.720
month old toddler on a nine hour fart tube flight, what could go wrong? We only had one meltdown

03:14.720 --> 03:20.400
that was I don't know, like if anybody that's listening is a parent and has been in that

03:20.400 --> 03:26.880
situation where your kid is just hyperventilating from the crying on the plane. You just feel

03:27.120 --> 03:31.600
helpless in that moment. Like you want the child to be okay. You want all the people to not be

03:31.600 --> 03:36.640
there. It's just Yeah, that was that was a fun moment. But the meetup made it all worthwhile.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.440
And we got a clip from the meetup from our buddy Joe Resington to just give us a quick flavor of

03:43.440 --> 03:44.160
the event.

03:44.160 --> 03:52.320
Hello, and welcome everyone to late night self hosted after dark in the park. So great. You can

03:52.320 --> 03:57.440
hear the whole thing in late night Linux 190, which is going to come out on August 15. But I

03:57.440 --> 04:02.560
think it's pretty great that Joe joined. And so you've got the late night Linux crew there. You've

04:02.560 --> 04:07.640
got the JB crew there. It's a big conspiracy to make us as jealous as possible. Yeah, I was

04:07.640 --> 04:12.480
watching some I was looking from afar watching some of the pictures come in thinking, man, I

04:12.480 --> 04:17.240
wish I could have been there. It was a beautiful evening. So to set the scene, we're in this

04:17.680 --> 04:22.560
Jubilee Park and gardens just underneath the London Eye down by the River Thames on the South

04:22.560 --> 04:27.360
Bank. And it's just you know, groups of people peppered around on the grass, you know, having a

04:27.360 --> 04:33.080
little picnic and stuff. You know, mid 20s in the temperature, a little bit of sunshine. It was

04:33.080 --> 04:39.320
just the perfect evening to be outside with a group of friends. And a pretty good crowd too. It

04:39.320 --> 04:43.120
looks like you got what nearly 100 folks there. So almost as many people that signed up or more.

04:43.160 --> 04:51.440
Well, I took with me 75 stickers, 150 stickers, sorry. And I had two packs and I came back with

04:51.440 --> 04:58.640
one unsealed pack. So by my count, there were 74 people plus a random lady that decided to come and

04:58.640 --> 05:04.280
sit behind Joe and I whilst we were recording. And we there was this moment where we were in the

05:04.280 --> 05:09.760
middle of this show about 20 minutes in and this just random lady comes and sits like, you know, a

05:09.760 --> 05:15.440
foot behind me and I'm like, Oh, this is going to go south. She what is was because I could see the

05:15.440 --> 05:20.960
cider in her hand. I was like, Hmm, is she drunk? Is she going to cause problems? And no, she

05:20.960 --> 05:25.240
didn't. She sat there the whole time. And then after we finished, I was you know, a shout out to

05:25.240 --> 05:30.000
anybody as anybody not got a sticker because I was very insistent that everybody got a sticker

05:30.000 --> 05:35.320
because it was basically my counter for attendance. Good idea, Alex. And she she went,

05:35.320 --> 05:39.280
Yeah, I'll take a sticker. I'm like, Sorry, who are you? And she went, Do you need to know? I was

05:39.280 --> 05:41.800
like, Hmm, no, I don't actually.

05:43.640 --> 05:48.160
Man, this location is just so beautiful. It's got the Ferris wheel. Of course, you can see the

05:48.160 --> 05:53.440
rivers right there. A huge crowd. It looks like actually, look at that crowd.

05:53.480 --> 05:57.560
Yeah. So the thing about the South Bank down by the Thames there is you get a lot of street

05:57.560 --> 06:03.400
performers and they they gather crowds of 2300 people at a time and this shows last 10 minutes

06:03.400 --> 06:07.560
and then at the end, you give them a couple of quid to say thank you. And so it's just this

06:07.560 --> 06:13.080
really nice family relaxed vibe down by the river, which is exactly what I was going for with the

06:13.080 --> 06:20.400
location. So well, it's out great. And, you know, the fact that we had 75 or so people show up as

06:20.400 --> 06:26.880
well, you know, it was I was very, very pleased. And we had people from all over we had some, I

06:26.880 --> 06:32.600
think the furthest that, you know, by myself, the people came was the Czech Republic. We had two or

06:32.600 --> 06:36.440
three Norwegians there. There was a couple of Dutch people there. I know bites in the mumble

06:36.440 --> 06:39.120
room today. I met bite at the meetup as well. That was nice.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.480
I spent some money to be there for one day.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.960
Did you? Was it kind of expensive to get there?

06:44.000 --> 06:51.400
Yeah. Even taking the train is enormously expensive. I found one of the cheaper flights. But

06:51.400 --> 06:57.240
then I made a little mistake by taking a train back to the airport and paying 40 pounds for a one

06:57.240 --> 07:03.800
way trip and some other little mistakes that made the trip a bit more expensive than I would like.

07:03.800 --> 07:08.160
But yeah, it's not it can't be beaten by something else.

07:08.520 --> 07:12.440
Lessons learned for next year. Right. So that way, if Wes and I make it out there next year,

07:13.120 --> 07:17.080
you can be our tour guide. Yeah. But you get what I'm saying, too, right, Alex, you get that kind

07:17.080 --> 07:21.640
of that charge by being around people that want to talk about the same stuff or excited about the

07:21.640 --> 07:24.520
same stuff. Follow the shows. It's really fun.

07:25.040 --> 07:30.600
It's very surreal meeting a group of complete strangers that know a lot about you and you know

07:30.600 --> 07:35.760
nothing about them because this medium is a very one way, for the most part, a very one way

07:35.760 --> 07:40.600
medium, you know, very weird people like, Oh, how's your mother in law's internet work? And I'm

07:40.600 --> 07:44.240
like, Oh, yeah, we talked about that in self hosted, didn't we? That's that's how you know

07:44.240 --> 07:49.160
that. Yeah. Yeah, you do get a few things like that, for sure. They might know more than we know

07:49.160 --> 07:53.440
about ourselves at times. And then you want to know how you know that Alex is truly a party animal

07:53.480 --> 07:58.760
is that Brent managed to talk him into going to another meetup when he got back to Raleigh. Yeah.

07:58.880 --> 08:05.960
Yeah, they got back at about 2pm here local time in Raleigh. And since I'm you know, to give a

08:05.960 --> 08:11.120
little context, I was house sitting while Alex was away. So but I organized a little sneaky little

08:11.120 --> 08:15.360
micro meetup here in Raleigh. Thanks to our matrix room. It was amazing.

08:16.800 --> 08:24.000
Hi, this is Brent from Raleigh. I found an Alex. Apparently he's doing two days, two continents

08:24.040 --> 08:29.360
and two JB meetups. Hi, Alex. And I even have some stickers left for this one that is planning. It's

08:29.360 --> 08:40.560
true. They've been re imported for this purpose. And I found a few people. Hi. Hello. We've got

08:40.560 --> 08:46.960
what how many are we six, six of us and we're having a great time. A Raleigh rabble. Raleigh

08:46.960 --> 08:53.760
Raleigh. Sounds like you're really enjoying yourselves. Yeah, we had a great time. I think it

08:53.760 --> 09:00.280
was probably a very different energy than the London meetup, right? Well, I think I was awake

09:00.280 --> 09:07.160
for like, our 16 when we sat down. 18. By the time we left, I was a little bit drunk with tiredness,

09:07.160 --> 09:12.680
wasn't I? Not even from the beer I've had. Yeah, easily. But you made it. It was a great time. We

09:12.680 --> 09:18.520
probably laughed more than anything. We had some good food. And it was a nice low key thing. And I

09:18.520 --> 09:26.200
hope the whole idea with these sort of regional based matrix rooms is that some of these meetups

09:26.200 --> 09:32.280
can happen on a regular basis. And maybe even without JB folks. So we hope that I think we can

09:32.280 --> 09:37.000
facilitate that for listeners. Right. That does seem to be happening that we have a listener that

09:37.000 --> 09:40.920
emailed into office hours that wants to start organizing meetups on their own with just other

09:40.920 --> 09:45.640
JB listeners. I love it. I think we'll cover it a bit more in self hosted as well, no doubt talking

09:45.640 --> 09:50.440
about the meter. But for anybody that's listening to this show that was in London or in Raleigh last

09:50.440 --> 09:58.160
night, huge thanks for showing up. I got a huge amount of energy from you all to continue doing

09:58.160 --> 10:02.680
this for a lot longer. You know, it's it's, it's weird sitting in your own room, just talking to a

10:02.680 --> 10:08.360
microphone. It feels a little bit disconnected from reality sometimes. And to actually connect

10:08.360 --> 10:13.800
in meat space with real human meat bags that have been listening. It's it's hard to describe

10:13.800 --> 10:18.680
really, but thank you all for coming. It means a lot. Yeah, yeah, I'm really looking forward to

10:18.680 --> 10:22.200
them to more meetups, too, because it's just you want to keep it rolling. I kind of loved it, too.

10:22.200 --> 10:26.520
You know, I was a little distracted, but I could see the various channels and matrix just just

10:26.520 --> 10:30.040
exploding with little pics. And it made me feel like I was I was almost there. Yeah, it was nice

10:30.040 --> 10:35.000
to watch the London meetup and then the Raleigh group later. And like, you know, happens often

10:35.000 --> 10:41.160
at these events, some gifts were given as well. My name is Philip, and I brought some retired

10:41.160 --> 10:45.400
raspberry pies that have been collecting dust and I thought maybe you could put them to good use.

10:46.760 --> 10:53.320
That is super generous. Now when you say retired, what exactly do you mean? And how old are they?

10:53.320 --> 11:00.680
And what have they been used for? They are several years old. Actually, I can't remember how old they

11:00.680 --> 11:07.160
are. One is a Raspberry Pi three, which is quite a bit older. And one is a Raspberry Pi four.

11:07.800 --> 11:14.440
They started out as a home assistant, of course. And then I kind of moved on from home assistant

11:14.440 --> 11:24.200
to home kit and had grand designs to do other projects with them and never got around to.

11:26.840 --> 11:30.920
That sounds familiar. Well, thank you for bringing gifts. We didn't ask for gifts,

11:30.920 --> 11:35.080
but this is super amazing. Thank you. You're very welcome. That is so great,

11:35.080 --> 11:39.560
you know, and everybody's got a Raspberry Pi these days. They're not using see instead of

11:39.560 --> 11:44.520
feeling guilty about it, you could gift to Brantley, who has been Raspberry Pi short,

11:44.520 --> 11:49.480
you know, not anymore. Thanks. Wonderful listeners. Now you're Raspberry Pi rich.

11:49.480 --> 11:53.800
You know, Philip did also reveal a little later, which I unfortunately didn't get an audio,

11:53.800 --> 11:59.560
but he did reveal that his upgrade that sort of replace these Raspberry Pis is now running Umbral

11:59.560 --> 12:05.160
and he's really loving it. That is great. Boy, he's right in sync, isn't he? Although he went

12:05.160 --> 12:11.480
from home assistant to home kit. And my humble opinion, usually you want to go from home kit

12:11.480 --> 12:16.600
to home assistant, but no judgment. Oh, no home automation shame on the show. Come on.

12:16.600 --> 12:20.920
No, no judgment. Now, Alex, we got a little gift from London as well, didn't we?

12:20.920 --> 12:27.400
We did. Listener Thor, who came in from Norway, has gifted the network one of these remarkable

12:27.400 --> 12:35.960
e-ink tablets. Remarkable is the brand name of the thing. It's this iPad sized e-ink tablet

12:35.960 --> 12:41.960
display annotation device, note taking device. And so we're going to let Brent put it through

12:41.960 --> 12:45.400
its paces over the next week or two before he comes to see you, Chris.

12:45.400 --> 12:51.880
That's fun. Now, is it a touch screen as well? Yes. You know, I've explored it for about 38

12:51.880 --> 12:57.960
seconds so far. So the journey begins now. And I think I'll put it through its paces. It'll see a

12:57.960 --> 13:03.800
few airplanes and cars and hopefully trains as well. So we'll see how it does. Thank you,

13:03.800 --> 13:08.520
by the way. I can't help but think that the best job for that would be a low power home assistant

13:08.520 --> 13:13.480
dashboard that's displaying you info. But yeah, buddy, you turn everything into a dashboard.

13:13.480 --> 13:18.600
That's true. I would say please send in your ideas. I would love to find about, you know,

13:18.600 --> 13:23.400
20 different ways to use this thing. So send them in. What OS do we know? Currently, it says

13:23.400 --> 13:28.840
out of battery. Is that an OS? I'm wondering if it's a Linux. If anybody knows, send it in.

13:28.840 --> 13:33.800
Are you suggesting the poor battery life is a Linux thing? No, it must be Android then.

13:34.680 --> 13:43.000
Hey, yo. All right. So the next round of meetups is Nye. We have a whole swath of West Coast

13:43.000 --> 13:48.520
meetups. So go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting. Wes, you caught this in the news

13:48.520 --> 13:55.640
recently, but it looks like NASA is going all in on the Linux copters. The future plans, I guess,

13:55.640 --> 14:01.800
for Mars exploration are going to include a set of two helicopters for like the next rover.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.400
It's going to come with two of them. They're also thinking of having them pick up samples

14:05.400 --> 14:11.160
for additional missions to return those samples to Earth. So how about that? Yeah. So that's

14:11.160 --> 14:17.320
amazing. Ingenuity has not only, I think, exceeded expectations, but it's clearly set the path

14:17.320 --> 14:24.760
forward for future space exploration with Linux copters. That's just so awesome. When we get down

14:24.760 --> 14:28.680
to JPL, I hope to get a chance to talk to Tim about this specifically and just kind of get his

14:28.680 --> 14:33.160
take on this. And if this wasn't kind of the long goal, maybe they didn't want to outwardly say it,

14:33.160 --> 14:36.040
but I got to imagine they were kind of hoping if this all worked out, this is where things were

14:36.040 --> 14:40.520
going. I wonder if we can get any tips to make our own Linux copter. They're not going anywhere.

14:40.520 --> 14:44.040
They're not going anywhere. I kind of want one now. You could ask Tim yourself, dear listener,

14:44.040 --> 14:50.840
just get your name in the hat. Go to linuxunplug.com slash JPL. We have 15 slots available to our

14:50.840 --> 14:56.360
audience to take a personalized tour of JPL. And we'll be pulling names from that hat as the event

14:56.360 --> 15:01.560
gets closer. So that's linuxunplug.com slash JPL. And that's just a simple next cloud form that we

15:01.560 --> 15:07.320
have that you can fill out. And then we also have our West Coast crew matrix room where we are

15:07.320 --> 15:11.640
organizing with locals along the West Coast and figuring out where people are at. We'd love to

15:11.640 --> 15:16.520
have you join us there as well. That's in our matrix colony. And details for all the meetups,

15:16.520 --> 15:21.720
the individual meetups we're stopping at from Oregon down to Southern California at meetup.com

15:21.720 --> 15:27.880
slash Jupiter broadcasting. All right. I think that's everything with that. The meetups take a

15:27.880 --> 15:32.120
big part of the show during the summer, but they're super important to us. So we want to

15:32.120 --> 15:36.520
dedicate some time to that. You know what? There's not always a lot else going on. That's true. It

15:36.520 --> 15:40.600
is the summer. A lot of developers, especially the ones outside the US, they do this crazy thing

15:40.600 --> 15:47.320
called vacation. And I think some of them are even taking like six weeks off at a time. I don't know.

15:47.320 --> 15:51.080
They must not get paid for it, I'm sure. And they probably have all their medical coverage suspended

15:51.080 --> 15:55.000
because it's tied to their job, I'm sure. Of course. Yeah. Because otherwise that wouldn't

15:55.000 --> 15:57.560
make any sense. It'd be completely unfair. And that's not how we would do it in the States,

15:57.560 --> 16:02.520
right guys? But it's cool. So development slows down a little bit sometimes.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.560
Are you all right over there?

16:05.560 --> 16:07.080
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.760
Extra, extra patriotic today.

16:10.760 --> 16:15.400
Yeah. I just, that's just one thing that, you know, whatever. Let's talk about saving money

16:15.400 --> 16:19.880
because some of us, you know, we don't need to be blowing money right now on expensive computers

16:19.880 --> 16:25.560
that can do the job perfectly fine. This is great too for friends and family, people that just want

16:25.560 --> 16:31.080
a go to Linux machine. And you know, here's one tip that remember to remember tweeted at me that

16:31.080 --> 16:36.200
I think is really the key one. It's just got to remember to shop with Linux in mind when you're

16:36.200 --> 16:39.400
looking for this stuff. Just like you would, if you're going to buy something for the Mac,

16:39.400 --> 16:43.320
you got to shop with the Mac in mind. It's a little less of a problem on windows, but let's be

16:43.320 --> 16:46.520
honest, you got to do it on windows too, because you could end up with something that's really

16:46.520 --> 16:49.720
crap drivers. And that just makes your whole system suck. So you really got to kind of shop

16:49.720 --> 16:53.720
careful on windows. Pick which third-party weird driver applications you want running on your box.

16:53.720 --> 16:57.480
Right. Which auto-updater that starts every time your windows box boots, which one do you want?

16:57.480 --> 17:02.120
So, you know, it's to say it's a compromise to have to kind of shop with Linux in mind

17:02.120 --> 17:05.160
and compatibility in mind. I just disagree. I think that's just the state of computing,

17:05.160 --> 17:08.040
but I just wanted to put that up front. Everything we're going to talk about today,

17:08.040 --> 17:11.720
you just kind of want to shop with Linux compatibility in mind. And today I want to

17:11.720 --> 17:18.200
talk about four cheap Linux PCs. And I use that term generously. I don't mean cheap as in quality.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.960
I just mean cheap as in price. And I want to tell you about four I found. And then I,

17:21.960 --> 17:25.880
and if you guys have any suggestions to, I definitely want to hear those first,

17:25.880 --> 17:30.040
first starting with not one that I have tried personally, but I heard about this from Adam

17:30.040 --> 17:35.000
Curry and it just seems like a crazy good deal right now. Brand new from Amazon,

17:35.000 --> 17:42.680
160 US greenbacks for a Beelink mini SPC with an 11th gen Intel N5095 processor,

17:42.680 --> 17:48.040
eight gigs of Ram and 128 gigabyte SSD. I think it ships with windows 11, but you could put Linux

17:48.040 --> 17:52.840
on there. It's 160 bucks new. And they even have like a $10 off coupon right now. It's crazy.

17:52.840 --> 18:00.840
So 150 bucks for a brand new 11th gen Intel PC or run Linux. That's kind of like just from start

18:00.840 --> 18:05.720
right there, but maybe you want to go even cheaper. Maybe you're really on a budget. Maybe it's for,

18:05.720 --> 18:08.200
you know, maybe it's for your kids, maybe it's for yourself and you just don't want to spend a

18:08.200 --> 18:13.080
lot of money on this kind of stuff right now. I want to tell you about a machine that I got

18:13.080 --> 18:21.320
since the last episode. It is the Acer switch one Intel, Adam's Z 8,300, 1.4 gigahertz laptop.

18:21.320 --> 18:29.320
And it's one of these that you can flip the screen around and run Linux as a tablet if you have the

18:29.320 --> 18:33.800
right distro. So some people are into that, you know, convertible style. I have it here with me

18:33.800 --> 18:41.720
in the studio right now. It's about the size of an 11 inch, you know, or so iPad with the keyboard.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.920
It reminds me back of the days of like the netbook era, you know, kind of that size.

18:44.920 --> 18:49.160
Yeah. And then of course you can flip the screen around and do those kinds of shenanigans. Although

18:49.160 --> 18:52.040
I don't know if I actually would ever try that. Here's the problem. I haven't tried this machine

18:52.040 --> 18:56.040
personally because I got it off eBay and the bastard didn't include the power down there.

18:56.040 --> 18:59.800
Oh no. Didn't even, I forget. And of course it's some random barrel one, right?

18:59.800 --> 19:09.240
So I'm just mentioning this because $45. Oh my goodness. $45. Yes, it's an Adam, but $45.

19:09.240 --> 19:12.360
That's like, you're in pie prices now. And you could have basically a tablet,

19:12.360 --> 19:15.960
PC with a keyboard and Linux is going to run just fine on there, right?

19:15.960 --> 19:17.560
Chris, what's the age of this thing?

19:17.560 --> 19:22.360
Well, the Intel Atom X5 is pretty old. I mean, it's not, it's not a brand new machine. I think

19:22.360 --> 19:26.840
it's like a 2015 model. Again, you're not going to get the latest and greatest for under a hundred

19:26.840 --> 19:30.760
bucks, but you know, to have something under a hundred bucks that you could put Linux on,

19:31.800 --> 19:32.840
it's nice to have that option.

19:32.840 --> 19:36.040
I think this is the episode where you're putting on like the used car salesman vibe. You know,

19:36.040 --> 19:37.400
let me put you in an Intel Atom.

19:37.400 --> 19:41.960
This is a previously loved laptop with a special undercoating.

19:41.960 --> 19:46.280
You're right. It is very tablet-like in that like a bunch of the ports and stuff seem to be

19:46.280 --> 19:51.080
in on the screen side. And then the keyboard is, you know, really just kind of like the keyboard

19:51.080 --> 19:51.640
that's attached.

19:51.640 --> 19:54.920
Right. And it's got a front and back camera on the screen.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.080
Oh, perfect for selfies.

19:57.080 --> 20:00.680
So that's an interesting one. But now I want to tell you about a really practical one.

20:01.640 --> 20:06.040
This is just another hot Chris pick here. This is one that I personally own. I actually bought

20:06.040 --> 20:13.560
this machine to run as, to test it as potentially a replacement for JOOPS's home server to replace

20:13.560 --> 20:17.640
my Raspberry Pi 4. But in the end, I decided the IO was too limiting.

20:19.640 --> 20:28.440
And so this is the Ideapad 3, 14 IML 5, 128 gigabyte SSD, Intel Pentium Gold, 2.4 gigahertz.

20:28.440 --> 20:33.560
This one came with four gigs of RAM, but the bottom pops right off and you can upgrade

20:33.560 --> 20:37.000
basically all the components, but it's very, it's very serviceable in that regard.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
The RAM and the hard drive are accessible in the Ideapad 3. And it's actually a pretty

20:41.000 --> 20:46.200
good little laptop. It's got a decent size to it. It's got a decent trackpad. It's got

20:46.200 --> 20:48.520
a good keyboard for this price range.

20:48.520 --> 20:51.240
Doesn't look bad. I mean, it doesn't stand out, but that's kind of what you want in a

20:51.240 --> 20:51.720
laptop like this.

20:51.720 --> 20:55.640
It's just a simple ThinkPad. It's of the kind of older ThinkPad styling because it's a little

20:55.640 --> 21:00.280
bit older. And it has the Intel Gold CPU, which means it has quick sync, which is one of the

21:00.280 --> 21:03.720
reasons I bought it, but that might be useful to you. Check that out there, Wes. So that

21:03.720 --> 21:06.840
one's a little heavier. This one goes for $260.

21:06.840 --> 21:10.040
It's not bad, though. And it's well weighted. It does not feel off-kilter.

21:10.040 --> 21:13.240
It does not feel off-kilter or off-access when I'm holding it in here, which I like.

21:13.240 --> 21:19.880
Yeah, it is. It's got a lot of the pros of a well-designed Lenovo. It's a little old,

21:19.880 --> 21:25.760
but I still think that Intel Pentium Gold CPU is actually a pretty good little chip.

21:25.760 --> 21:30.880
So I think overall, that's like, out of all of the list, that's going to be my most practical

21:30.880 --> 21:32.200
recommendation right here.

21:32.200 --> 21:36.640
Now, Chris, I see you have a dongle dangling off that thing. Is there a specific purpose

21:36.640 --> 21:38.600
for that, that you're using it for?

21:38.600 --> 21:41.080
Yeah, you could have taken these off before you handed it to me.

21:41.080 --> 21:45.120
Well, it doesn't have Ethernet built in. So that is an Ethernet dongle, just because

21:45.120 --> 21:50.720
I likes to have it wired sometimes. And that's not too uncommon at this price point, is to

21:50.720 --> 21:52.600
not get Ethernet in there.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.240
Or at the higher price points, too.

21:54.240 --> 21:58.520
Yeah, unfortunately, you're right about that. This next one I'm about to talk about doesn't

21:58.520 --> 22:02.640
have Ethernet, but it's not because they're being cheap. It's because it literally wouldn't

22:02.640 --> 22:08.680
fit on the hardware. This one's a lot of fun, guys. This is something really special. I

22:08.680 --> 22:15.440
don't even know how I didn't know about this. It's called the Acer Mini PC. And it was sold

22:15.440 --> 22:18.160
in a Cloud Professor Kit. It's a whole kit that comes...

22:18.160 --> 22:23.480
You could just say Cloud Professor Kit like that and assume we know what that means.

22:23.480 --> 22:26.520
Try it. Open it up here, Wes. I brought it into the studio. This is the Cloud Professor

22:26.520 --> 22:29.720
Kit. And maybe you could describe what's in there. Take a look while I talk about this

22:29.720 --> 22:38.760
device. So this device is smaller than a Chromecast in overall size, or about the size of a Chromecast.

22:38.760 --> 22:45.400
It has a 1.4 gigahertz CPU, two gigabytes of RAM, 16 gigabytes of hard drive space.

22:45.400 --> 22:51.280
It has an HDMI out. They managed to put USB-A on the thing. And they have what seems to

22:51.280 --> 22:58.600
be like a micro SD type slot and a mini USB slot probably for power. The thing fits literally

22:58.600 --> 23:06.160
in the palm of my hand. It is absolutely tiny. And it comes pre-installed with Linux on it.

23:06.160 --> 23:11.080
Okay. So it looks like this thing is targeted. Like, is this a PC to use while you're making

23:11.080 --> 23:12.080
an Arduino?

23:12.080 --> 23:13.080
Yeah, it's for training.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.080
Embedded. Oh, okay.

23:14.080 --> 23:18.320
Yeah. So this kit actually comes with an Arduino in the box, too. So you can connect it.

23:18.320 --> 23:22.360
Yeah. It's got a nice little seed shield here, too.

23:22.360 --> 23:26.660
So you get a whole kit with a book. You get the kit.

23:26.660 --> 23:29.840
Sensor sensor, light sensor. You can make some fun projects with this.

23:29.840 --> 23:36.320
Yes. And it is $38 US dollars. $38 US dollars.

23:36.320 --> 23:40.680
Now I think we also, you get to call yourself a cloud professor after you bought this, right?

23:40.680 --> 23:41.680
So that's also a big part of that.

23:41.680 --> 23:43.720
Well, it's on the thing. So it says-

23:43.720 --> 23:45.280
It also comes with a badge.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.280
Right.

23:46.280 --> 23:53.440
Yeah. And so it's an Atom. It's a fifth gen Atom CPU. So it's an x86 CPU. It's smaller

23:53.440 --> 23:57.320
than a Raspberry Pi in terms of overall width, but it's about the length of a Raspberry Pi

23:57.320 --> 23:58.320
board.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.840
And you could just slap it on the back of one of these studio monitors. It's obviously

24:00.840 --> 24:01.840
fanless.

24:01.840 --> 24:06.200
Yeah. And with the HDMI out, you could hook it up to anything that takes HDMI. It's totally

24:06.200 --> 24:10.480
silent. This has me rethinking the Raspberry Pi for a lot of things. And that's what I

24:10.480 --> 24:14.040
want to use this for, is what I might use a Pi for, but I want x86 compatibility.

24:14.040 --> 24:18.880
Whoa. Okay. So you kind of undersold this whole segment. You know, interesting, yeah,

24:18.880 --> 24:21.760
but really it's a titanic shift in how you're deploying things.

24:21.760 --> 24:26.120
Well, we'll see. I mean, they're cheaper and more available than a Raspberry Pi. That's

24:26.120 --> 24:28.460
just the reality of it right now.

24:28.460 --> 24:31.360
Hopefully more successful than the Titanic, though, Wes.

24:31.360 --> 24:35.560
Oh, we'll see about that. I mean, that's probably why they're going for 30 bucks or 40 bucks

24:35.560 --> 24:36.560
on eBay, right?

24:36.560 --> 24:41.000
I mean, I do think it's interesting though, anytime you mentioned the Pi and the fact

24:41.000 --> 24:46.080
that you have, you know, you have what, five or six and we had Josh on Self Hosted a few

24:46.080 --> 24:53.400
weeks ago who has 47 or something crazy. Like the first place that my mind goes to has always

24:53.400 --> 24:58.840
been just get a single x86 box and replace all of them and you'll save power, you'll

24:58.840 --> 25:03.080
save money. These days, definitely save money. So it's interesting to see you finally go

25:03.080 --> 25:04.080
down this path.

25:04.080 --> 25:07.880
Yeah, that's how I actually got the idea, Pat, is I was thinking, well, one x86 box,

25:07.880 --> 25:12.520
a little more powerful. It has quick sync on there, so it'd be great for Jellyfin or

25:12.520 --> 25:17.280
AirPlex. And then I just wasn't really happy with the overall availability and I thought,

25:17.280 --> 25:21.240
well, if I'm really going to go to the extreme, something like a Raspberry Pi that's x86 would

25:21.240 --> 25:25.960
be the way to go. And this thing, as far as I can tell, runs off of a micro USB for power.

25:25.960 --> 25:30.520
So the power consumption is going to be nothing, right? How cool is that? What do you think,

25:30.520 --> 25:31.520
Wes? You're holding it right now.

25:31.520 --> 25:35.640
Yeah, I mean, it's nice. It's a good little form factor. I like that there's a full size

25:35.640 --> 25:40.880
USB 3 on here, right? So it seems kind of, sure, could I have a few more plugins? You're

25:40.880 --> 25:47.200
going to need dongles maybe, but what it is for the price, yeah, seems worth a shot.

25:47.200 --> 25:51.200
Yeah. So it's the Acer Mini PC with an Atom CPU, or you could just search for the Cloud

25:51.200 --> 25:58.480
Professor. It is what it is, guys. That's just what they call it. I mean, I think you

25:58.480 --> 26:02.600
can find them on eBay without the whole kit as well, but I kind of wanted the kit. I mean,

26:02.600 --> 26:04.600
why not get the Arduino?

26:04.600 --> 26:09.080
You may be able to sell the Arduino for $38 and get your money back.

26:09.080 --> 26:12.680
Well, I think I want to give it away. I think I want to give the whole kit away after I

26:12.680 --> 26:13.680
play with it for a little bit.

26:13.680 --> 26:14.680
That's a nice idea.

26:14.680 --> 26:18.440
Yeah. So I'll keep it all together so that way we can just package the box back up and

26:18.440 --> 26:23.200
ship it out to a listener in the future. So I'll put links to all of the eBay listings

26:23.200 --> 26:29.380
to these in the show notes if you want to try it out. Do any of you guys have a really

26:29.380 --> 26:34.080
just quick go-to budget Linux PC? We've got some recommendations that came in from the

26:34.080 --> 26:36.960
audience that we're going to get to as well, but we'll get to those in a bit.

26:36.960 --> 26:43.560
I do. It's the HP290 Slim. It's one of these old thin client boxes. I think it's 8th Gen

26:43.560 --> 26:50.600
Intel CPUs. They used to be available for under $100. I think it's closer to $150 now,

26:50.600 --> 26:58.840
but typically these things come with the Celeron G4900, which has very capable quick sync performance.

26:58.840 --> 27:02.800
It's been running my Blue Iris box now for a couple of years. Just does the job. It comes

27:02.800 --> 27:09.640
with a 500 gigabyte spinner, I think, from most eBay sellers. I upgraded that to a SATA

27:09.640 --> 27:16.320
or an M.2 SATA or an NVMe SSD. I can't remember which. So for under $200, I've got a very

27:16.320 --> 27:20.880
capable box. I know it's running Windows. I know you asked for a Linux box, but it would

27:20.880 --> 27:22.520
run Linux just fine.

27:22.520 --> 27:28.960
That's a great recommendation. We got a suggestion too for a Dell Wyze thin client from an anonymous

27:28.960 --> 27:34.480
supplier, the 5070 thin client. They said that it actually works pretty well for them.

27:34.480 --> 27:41.160
$120 shipped. They added a 512 gigabyte M.2 and two 8 gig sticks of RAM. The whole thing

27:41.160 --> 27:45.360
off of Amazon is like $105 after they added the upgrades. Then you buy the thin client

27:45.360 --> 27:49.240
itself for $120. You put it all together. You're under $300 and he says you've got a

27:49.240 --> 27:55.320
great or they say you've got a great Linux learning machine. So it's the Wyze 5070 thin

27:55.320 --> 27:57.200
client. So two thin client recommendations.

27:57.200 --> 28:00.520
I have been kind of decently surprised at some of those lower end, you know, the atoms

28:00.520 --> 28:04.520
and the Celeron line even these days. Like if you don't need to do much, you're not doing

28:04.520 --> 28:07.040
serious crunching, it works.

28:07.040 --> 28:13.240
Right. The thing is about the Celeron that's in the HP box are recommended. With QuickSync,

28:13.240 --> 28:19.240
all of the hard processing is going through a hardware chip. So all the threads are doing

28:19.240 --> 28:21.360
is just keeping the OS going really.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.360
Yeah.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.360
It's great.

28:23.360 --> 28:26.080
I mean, it works for the iPad. Why not here? Right? You just got to have the right software

28:26.080 --> 28:30.280
hardware combo. And that's where looking for something with QuickSync can make that. We

28:30.280 --> 28:33.680
got a recommendation from Colin, I believe. Was it Brent?

28:33.680 --> 28:39.480
We actually got this recommendation twice. So I think it's probably a good one. Colin

28:39.480 --> 28:49.240
and Antal also suggested this one. It's a Minis Forum Desk Mini UM350 Ryzen Mini PC.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.400
And this one ships with Manjaro pre-installed on it, it looks like.

28:52.400 --> 28:57.840
Yeah, it's a maybe a little higher budget. It's at the $299. It's currently on sale for

28:57.840 --> 29:03.820
$299. But directly, it's brand new. And so I think you can buy it directly from Minis

29:03.820 --> 29:08.400
Forum and a whole bunch of other places, eBay, you can get it on Amazon as well. And I saw

29:08.400 --> 29:13.360
it, I didn't click into it, but I also saw a link at Walmart. So I don't know what that's

29:13.360 --> 29:19.360
about. But it seems like Minis Forum, which is new to me, has an interesting catalog of

29:19.360 --> 29:22.680
small and not too expensive machines that are worth checking out.

29:22.680 --> 29:27.080
I love this tip. This looks like it'd be a great podcasting machine for doing recordings

29:27.080 --> 29:35.080
and whatnot there. What I love about Linux is that you can actually build a really awesome

29:35.080 --> 29:40.560
budget machine and not feel bad about it. There's something about the Linux community

29:40.560 --> 29:48.120
where it can actually be kind of an awesome cool guy thing to do to go down low end and

29:48.120 --> 29:51.080
make it work with the lowest end PC where it always seems like in Windows, especially

29:51.080 --> 29:56.520
get to the gaming culture, it's always skews towards the biggest graphics card, the fastest

29:56.520 --> 30:00.680
CPU, the fastest machine, all of the lights, all the RGB lighting you possibly can stuff

30:00.680 --> 30:06.320
in there, liquid cooling just to the absolute maximum extreme. And that's just like only

30:06.320 --> 30:11.320
accessible to such a small amount of people. But in the Linux community, we also will celebrate

30:11.320 --> 30:14.960
the really low end and try to make that work and try to find these cool little budget machines

30:14.960 --> 30:18.240
that can get a crap ton of work done for you at a great price.

30:18.240 --> 30:21.240
I love that it's the same Linux, too. You know, because couldn't you just imagine on

30:21.240 --> 30:25.760
some of these lower end machines like other vendors are going to ship a more limited operating

30:25.760 --> 30:29.600
system. But right. We get the we get the same for doesn't come with like Windows starter

30:29.600 --> 30:32.560
edition. Right. That's a great point.

30:32.560 --> 30:37.720
I think what I find really amazing and something that I guess I have lived this lifestyle for

30:37.720 --> 30:43.160
the last many years, you know, with my low end hardware that I somehow make productive.

30:43.160 --> 30:48.000
We've got our low end expert brand in our low end correspondence checking in here. What

30:48.000 --> 30:53.440
I have really loved and and that was true since the beginning of my Linux journey was

30:53.440 --> 30:58.480
that you can you can throw Linux on some of this lower end hardware and it performs in

30:58.480 --> 31:03.720
a way that other operating systems, at least other popular operating systems, just can't

31:03.720 --> 31:08.840
even match, can't even come close. You know, if you are choosing something like I don't

31:08.840 --> 31:17.720
know Joe's XFC favorite or lesser process intensive desktop environments, CPU challenged

31:17.720 --> 31:25.400
machines. Right. I think it's kind of amazing that you can run that on really what fits

31:25.400 --> 31:30.400
in the palm of your hand. You know, that's right. I think one of Linux is major strengths

31:30.400 --> 31:35.040
is it can do that and it can be, you know, the top 100 supercomputers as well.

31:35.040 --> 31:41.480
I agree. So the question becomes which distribution is the right? You got a lot of choice, but

31:41.480 --> 31:46.440
only one can be king.

31:46.440 --> 31:50.560
Linode dot com slash unplugged. Go there to get one hundred dollars and 60 day credit

31:50.560 --> 31:54.320
on a new account. And it's a great way to show your support for the show. Linode is

31:54.320 --> 31:59.040
definitely the Linux geeks cloud. They've got 11 data centers around the world and they've

31:59.040 --> 32:04.580
been hard at work at building something awesome for nearly 19 years because they saw the trajectory

32:04.580 --> 32:09.720
of Linux almost 20 years ago. I can relate to that. And it's that passion that they've

32:09.720 --> 32:13.800
built this business on top of. And if you like to build these systems up from the ground

32:13.800 --> 32:19.600
yourself, or have the option to deploy one of their many one click stacks, Linode has

32:19.600 --> 32:24.320
excellent options for you. And the thing I can say confidently is the performance is

32:24.320 --> 32:28.960
incredible. I just wouldn't put all of our J.B. audience facing stuff on Linode if it

32:28.960 --> 32:33.540
wasn't the case. But it's not just me saying that. Stable Point listed Linode as the fastest

32:33.540 --> 32:40.680
growing cloud provider and the best fit for low latency based use cases thanks to Linode's

32:40.680 --> 32:45.980
high performing MVME storage. But you know this. It's not just the storage that makes

32:45.980 --> 32:50.700
it low latency. It's the fact that they are their own ISP, that they've hyper optimized

32:50.700 --> 32:54.800
their data centers and they know how to build these things efficiently. And they're always

32:54.800 --> 32:58.800
cramming in the latest and greatest hardware, just smoothly and elegantly upgrading your

32:58.800 --> 33:04.120
systems as you go. And they have a bunch of great back end features. S3 compatible object

33:04.120 --> 33:08.360
storage is one of my absolute favorite cloud firewalls, DDoS protection, VLAN support,

33:08.360 --> 33:13.080
Kubernetes support, including now the, you know, Ansible and Terraform too. I mean Kubernetes

33:13.080 --> 33:18.000
is like the go to, but let's be real. Let's be real. I know a ton of people out there

33:18.000 --> 33:21.440
using Ansible to manage their Linode systems. I mean maybe they're doing the whole stack.

33:21.440 --> 33:26.160
I don't know. But I hear from the audience all the time. They're deploying stuff on Linode

33:26.160 --> 33:30.840
using Ansible. And it makes sense. Pricing's 30 to 50% cheaper than other major cloud providers

33:30.840 --> 33:34.840
out there that want to lock you into their esoteric hyperscaler platform. They've got

33:34.840 --> 33:39.080
the best support in the business. Nobody can touch it because nobody's built their business

33:39.080 --> 33:42.680
model like Linode has. So if you run into any trouble getting set up, Linode comes with

33:42.680 --> 33:47.000
amazing 24 seven customer support phone ticket. They'll answer the phone and a human's going

33:47.000 --> 33:52.040
to help you. Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing. If

33:52.040 --> 33:57.120
it runs on Linux, it'll run on Linode. So go try it today. Learn for yourself. Take

33:57.120 --> 34:00.920
advantage of that hundred dollar offer and support the show. You can do it all by going

34:00.920 --> 34:09.200
to linode.com slash unplugged. That's linode.com slash unplugged.

34:09.200 --> 34:17.280
It's that time of year again. We've got ourselves a new Linux Mint LTS 21 Vanessa. And you know

34:17.280 --> 34:25.800
with impeccable timing, we also got a relevant bit of feedback. A boost from Tim Apple. 2,222

34:25.800 --> 34:32.720
sets. New Mint is out. It rarely gets love from any of the Linux podcasts. It'd be great

34:32.720 --> 34:38.280
to get you guys to live with it for a week or maybe just make Wes do it. That's my favorite

34:38.280 --> 34:41.960
part of the email or the boost. Dang it. I mean, I love you Tim Apple, but throw me right

34:41.960 --> 34:46.200
under that bus. Yeah, I think, you know, he wants to, he wants to hear your thoughts.

34:46.200 --> 34:51.440
So could Mint be on a minimum viable machine? Is it the right distribution for that? There's

34:51.440 --> 34:56.720
a lot of choices. And I think for the purposes of these types of machines that we're going

34:56.720 --> 35:00.160
to be talking about today, we should just stick with the cinnamon flavor. I don't, you

35:00.160 --> 35:02.680
know, cause there's a lot of ways you can go, but let's just talk about Mint cinnamon.

35:02.680 --> 35:07.880
Are you, you boys okay with that? Agreed? Let's do it. So Linux Mint 21 is notable because

35:07.880 --> 35:16.040
it's been rebased onto Ubuntu 2204 and it will be supported until 2027. So if you invest

35:16.040 --> 35:19.960
now you get some, you get some use out of it. Yeah. And so this, I think if you're a

35:19.960 --> 35:23.120
Mint user today might be worth listening to as well, but it also means if you're going

35:23.120 --> 35:26.160
to buy a machine, you want it to last a few years, which was one of the requirements we

35:26.160 --> 35:31.560
set this install will be good until 2027, which is about the lifetime we expect from

35:31.560 --> 35:36.240
some of these budget machines. And so there is a lot of small improvements, but it's not

35:36.240 --> 35:42.000
nothing super major to end users, but to the development team, I think some big stuff went

35:42.000 --> 35:47.240
into this. It is really the release where Muffin, which is the compositor and window

35:47.240 --> 35:54.480
manager for cinnamon saw a lot of, a lot of work. Muffin was originally based on Gnome's

35:54.480 --> 36:01.140
Mutter 3.2 release. Gnome 3.2, which is like forever ago. Yeah. Well it's been forked for

36:01.140 --> 36:07.360
like 11 years now. That's a long time to maintain something like that. Yes. And they completely

36:07.360 --> 36:16.680
rebased it around the Gnome 3.36 code base now. So Muffin has been totally rejuvenized

36:16.680 --> 36:23.120
and completely rebased. And as a result, I think you feel the performance throughout

36:23.120 --> 36:28.520
Mint and there's a lot of nice little visual tweaks and improvements that are also taking

36:28.520 --> 36:34.000
advantage of that newer code base. Linux Mint 21 also features improved Bluetooth handling.

36:34.000 --> 36:39.080
They replaced the Blueberry subsystem with Blue Man. Their own Xapps have seen a lot

36:39.080 --> 36:43.640
of improvements throughout this printing and scanning have gotten improvements. And then

36:43.640 --> 36:46.620
there's just some general artwork and theming improvements because of the advantages they

36:46.620 --> 36:52.640
got by updating Muffin. So there's a lot in this one. And I decided to try to get an idea,

36:52.640 --> 37:00.360
try to get my head around how much horsepower does a fully up to date lived in it, you know,

37:00.360 --> 37:05.480
for a little bit Mint install actually take. And I went through a process of loading up

37:05.480 --> 37:10.740
on a couple of different systems and trying to get baseline ideas of how much resources

37:10.740 --> 37:13.720
I should expect. I feel like this is kind of perfect timing too because you've been

37:13.720 --> 37:17.000
tweaking yourself a real nice Gnome setup, right? And kind of just, you know, on the

37:17.000 --> 37:19.900
other side of the fence now, checking out how Cinnamon's been doing. Yeah, I've been

37:19.900 --> 37:27.640
really deep down the NixOS as my desktop using Gnome. And so this was a bit of a shift going

37:27.640 --> 37:32.840
from NixOS to Mint. I mean, talk about two totally different approaches to Linux, right?

37:32.840 --> 37:37.560
Dramatically, right? Because NixOS is essentially a rolling OS, totally super fresh. And you

37:37.560 --> 37:42.340
just mentioned how Mint went 12 years without really updating the backend compositor to

37:42.340 --> 37:47.160
their desktop, right? So it's a real different approach, but different strokes. There's some

37:47.160 --> 37:51.320
people who just really like the Ubuntu base and they want a really solid workstation that

37:51.320 --> 37:54.520
lasts for years. And you see stuff like with their improvements to the thumbnail support

37:54.520 --> 37:58.560
where because they've kind of been, you know, just incrementally improving, there's some

37:58.560 --> 38:03.680
areas like that where it can be really nice. Yeah, it's polished. And it's interesting

38:03.680 --> 38:10.400
to me how you get this true sense of a classic Linux desktop. For those of us who remember,

38:10.400 --> 38:15.200
there are elements of the Cinnamon desktop that strike this balance between Gnome and

38:15.200 --> 38:21.980
Plasma and it brings in stuff that was in Gnome 2, which we used to call Gnome. It has

38:21.980 --> 38:26.820
applets that you can just like right click and you can add a system monitor to the tray.

38:26.820 --> 38:30.760
You know, these things that are just sort of used to come built into Gnome 2, but then

38:30.760 --> 38:35.840
like Plasma, it'll also let you download new ones and install them. The UI is a little

38:35.840 --> 38:39.280
rough. It could be better, you know, it'd be nice to have click and drag and stuff like

38:39.280 --> 38:43.700
that, but it's fine. It really has like the, that feel of classic Linux, like even the

38:43.700 --> 38:47.340
options, the ones that it makes like a drawer where you can have, you can stack more icons

38:47.340 --> 38:52.320
in in your tray and old notes apps that are forked from maps I used to love back in the

38:52.320 --> 38:56.420
day. I don't know if maybe this is only going to make sense to certain people, but if you're

38:56.420 --> 39:00.720
a kid of the nineties, it's like when you get an old car of the nineties, it was a car

39:00.720 --> 39:05.080
in transition, right? Maybe you've updated the stereo, so it's got like a newer stereo,

39:05.080 --> 39:10.520
but it's got the old components of a nineties dash, but it's got some new modules in it

39:10.520 --> 39:15.000
that like can play MP3s that didn't even exist when the car was built. You know what I'm

39:15.000 --> 39:18.400
saying? Yeah, that's what the mint experiences to me and it's not necessarily bad. It's kind

39:18.400 --> 39:21.600
of a nostalgic feeling. There's a sort of comfort to it and that like I know how to

39:21.600 --> 39:25.520
operate that desktop already, you know, I'm familiar with the pair time and to be honest

39:25.520 --> 39:29.280
with you, there's just things about it that are simpler in a lot, in a lot of ways. And

39:29.280 --> 39:34.840
with this, you know, last couple of versions of mint, they've been doing a decent enough

39:34.840 --> 39:39.900
job of integrating flat hub and flat packs, well not flat hub, but flat packs into mint

39:39.900 --> 39:44.100
and they out now with software flat hub and they feel pretty much right at home on the

39:44.100 --> 39:48.480
mint desktop. It's very much a fully loaded Linux. So I thought, Oh, it's going to be

39:48.480 --> 39:51.920
too bloated for these low end PCs because they, you know, it comes with like streaming

39:51.920 --> 39:56.240
TV app, the entire LibreOffice by default, you know, at least those things that I just

39:56.240 --> 40:00.240
don't do anymore. But when I, when I put it to the test and I'm talking to like loading

40:00.240 --> 40:04.760
it up, got it all up to date, got logged into my Firefox, you know, got my stuff the way

40:04.760 --> 40:08.800
I like it, like trying to do some work, get some stuff done after about four hours of

40:08.800 --> 40:15.080
average use. Now this is without electron apps, 1.6 gigabytes of RAM being used, just

40:15.080 --> 40:20.040
1.6 gigs of RAM. That's impressive. Right. Not bad at all. My lowest end machine had

40:20.040 --> 40:24.640
two gigs of RAM and the average is four gigs or above at everything I looked at. A lot

40:24.640 --> 40:29.400
of them have eight gigs and 16 gigs. So using 1.6 gigs of RAM, you're going to get by with

40:29.400 --> 40:33.820
that. You're going to be fine. 13 gigabytes of disk space used. Every machine I looked

40:33.820 --> 40:39.920
at had at least 16 gigs. A lot of them had 128 or more. Right. So six, I'm sorry. So

40:39.920 --> 40:45.960
13 gigabytes of disk space, and that includes the kitchen sink. It's pretty impressive.

40:45.960 --> 40:51.800
And Cinnamon's performance, it holds up. It really holds up. I actually think Mint may

40:51.800 --> 40:56.320
be one of the top contenders for a low end PC after doing my testing. I didn't really

40:56.320 --> 41:01.180
know how it would turn out, but I was actually very impressed. I think I'd like to compare

41:01.180 --> 41:07.400
it to other desktops. Like POP comes to mind. I'd like to see how POP compares. I did play

41:07.400 --> 41:13.760
around with a really minimal configured Plasma desktop, but maybe it's just my usage. I

41:13.760 --> 41:18.280
didn't get it that low on RAM and disk. It ended up being more RAM and more disk with

41:18.280 --> 41:22.080
a Plasma desktop version. So I just, I was curious. I've kind of found Cinnamon decent

41:22.080 --> 41:25.660
when I'm just casually playing some Steam games and stuff. I feel like I ended up fighting

41:25.660 --> 41:30.280
with it less than I do with some other sort of setups where it doesn't understand my full

41:30.280 --> 41:34.520
screen window or wants to steal focus back or just won't hide itself at the right time.

41:34.520 --> 41:39.640
They've done a good job now too for years, but even more so now of integrating Timeshift,

41:39.640 --> 41:43.600
the snapshot management tool. And they've taken it over now as the primary developers

41:43.600 --> 41:49.600
of Timeshift. And because I like to be a jerk, I decided to install Mint with ButterFS. I

41:49.600 --> 41:54.720
did the manual partitioning option and then did the ButterFS option just cause they thought

41:54.720 --> 41:58.760
like, well, let's see what happens when I do this. Actually it didn't boot properly

41:58.760 --> 42:03.840
on my dev one that I tested. I don't know if that was why, but then if I, if I use the

42:03.840 --> 42:07.920
dev one, you know, built in BIOS boot menu and manually selected the UEFI file, it would

42:07.920 --> 42:12.120
boot fine. Might've just been a dev one thing. Don't know. So I decided let's try it. And

42:12.120 --> 42:17.680
when I loaded up Timeshift, like you'd expect, but it was really good to see. Timeshift goes,

42:17.680 --> 42:22.120
Hey, you've got ButterFS. Would you like me to go with ButterFS mode instead of rsync

42:22.120 --> 42:26.760
mode? And so it just starts working with ButterFS snapshots right then and there. Isn't that

42:26.760 --> 42:31.720
amazing? It is. And then they've built in this backend process monitor to let you know,

42:31.720 --> 42:34.840
kind of like when things are happening in the backend, like a Timeshift backup. So you

42:34.840 --> 42:39.560
get kind of like this really subtle notification thing. Just, Hey, there's some backend stuff

42:39.560 --> 42:43.120
happening here. Your machine might be running a little slow. Makes me feel kind of comfortable.

42:43.120 --> 42:47.600
I know I've had Mint machines in the past deployed at like friends and families or that

42:47.600 --> 42:51.040
kind of thing. And you know, I don't need it to be super rock solid necessarily, but

42:51.040 --> 42:55.520
like just this extra layer of protection, peace of mind. Doesn't it feel like, and you

42:55.520 --> 42:59.480
guys tell me if you disagree, but doesn't it feel like if your backs up against the

42:59.480 --> 43:03.480
wall and you've got to recommend a Linux distro to somebody who's on a little bit lower end

43:03.480 --> 43:07.320
hardware and you just want it to be one of those set it and forget it things because

43:07.320 --> 43:11.600
you can't help them later. Mint feels like a pretty safe one to recommend. Like it feels

43:11.600 --> 43:16.740
like you'd give that to a person that maybe isn't super technical. It seems like with

43:16.740 --> 43:20.400
some of the Xapps with like having like a thought of like, Hey, you should probably

43:20.400 --> 43:24.040
do some backups or have some tools for that. Like they're thinking of a more day to day

43:24.040 --> 43:27.880
user than what I'm typically designing for or designing for myself.

43:27.880 --> 43:33.340
But they've also managed to include some of the retro stuff that I as a long time hardcore

43:33.340 --> 43:37.400
Linux user love, you know, like they've got like some of the stuff that made old Linux

43:37.400 --> 43:39.240
desktops the best like screensavers.

43:39.240 --> 43:40.720
You talking about X-Size?

43:40.720 --> 43:46.160
Yeah, X-Size is in there. They've got X screensavers in there. They're not even for better for

43:46.160 --> 43:51.400
worse, right? They're not even dicking around with Wayland, right? It's just, they're honest

43:51.400 --> 43:56.360
about what they are. They are tried and true Linux and they've taken ideas that have worked

43:56.360 --> 43:59.800
in the past and they've kept them integrated into their desktop instead of getting rid

43:59.800 --> 44:00.800
of them.

44:00.800 --> 44:06.360
And as a team, they've just opted to take on more and more work, more and more responsibility.

44:06.360 --> 44:09.680
And a couple of years ago, I thought, well, this is only going to last for so long. They're

44:09.680 --> 44:12.480
going to burn out. But here we two, three years later, they're still doing it.

44:12.480 --> 44:14.840
It's like you almost said something there. What's like, you know, you kind of get out

44:14.840 --> 44:18.200
of like the Linux hipster scene a bit with Mint. You know, they're not necessarily deploying

44:18.200 --> 44:21.840
the coolest thing or, you know, kind of going to shame you about not yet having switched

44:21.840 --> 44:25.720
to pipeline, but, but you get, you get a nice Linux experience still.

44:25.720 --> 44:30.560
Yeah. You get a machine, you turn on and it works. And tomorrow when you turn it on, it's

44:30.560 --> 44:35.320
going to work. And if it doesn't, you got time shift. That's appealing, right? It's

44:35.320 --> 44:39.080
kind of, in a way they're going about a different way of solving what Nix is solving for me.

44:39.080 --> 44:42.240
Okay. Well, you know, as you vary it, you put on various hats and you nebulous think

44:42.240 --> 44:46.480
about what happens to a future studio. What about Cinnamon in the studio?

44:46.480 --> 44:52.400
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I what's your hesitation. I like cinnamon.

44:52.400 --> 44:58.640
I just like modern plasma and modern genome more, especially my current implementations.

44:58.640 --> 45:02.800
My current implementation that I've set up both my plasma and my genome setups are so

45:02.800 --> 45:09.600
freaking great. I've never been happier with desktop Linux ever. It's so for me, I it's

45:09.600 --> 45:14.480
not that it's not great. It's just that it's not really my style. And, um, and you seem

45:14.480 --> 45:17.920
to be having a little, um, you know, renaissance with the desktop on it. It seems like you're

45:17.920 --> 45:21.320
kind of back in a mode of it. Oh, I will. I'm gonna spend a little time and like tweak

45:21.320 --> 45:24.440
this and really make it something I want to see again. I am. Yeah, I'm going through a

45:24.440 --> 45:31.640
tweaking phase and I love it because there's a real unquantifiable thing that I have struggled

45:31.640 --> 45:36.160
for years to describe on this show. And I'm right in the middle of it right now. And it

45:36.160 --> 45:43.080
drives me crazy that as a professional communicator, I cannot communicate what this is. But I've

45:43.080 --> 45:47.000
just this weekend because I was going through the mint stuff and I was testing testing different

45:47.000 --> 45:53.980
hardware and I wanted to compare plasma, cinnamon and genome. So this weekend I deployed NixOS

45:53.980 --> 46:02.940
with plasma on the dev one. Oh, and it was good. But modern Linux. There's something

46:02.940 --> 46:10.640
that genome shell is doing where it feels like it's all one OS and plasma feels like

46:10.640 --> 46:17.240
a desktop window system on top of my Linux box. Like I can feel like there's the plasma

46:17.240 --> 46:21.780
layer and then there's the Linux layer, which is good. In fact, I could even see why people

46:21.780 --> 46:28.340
prefer that in some cases, right? Yeah. But when I when I'm using GNOME on modern Linux

46:28.340 --> 46:32.560
with the latest like system, the latest kernel, latest Wayland, latest GNOME stack, latest

46:32.560 --> 46:39.940
GTK, everything's totally like current. It feels like one cohesive OS like Mac OS does

46:39.940 --> 46:43.520
or even FreeBSD does to a degree. But of course, FreeBSD doesn't once you get into the window

46:43.520 --> 46:51.680
manager. But it's all just one smooth, slick experience that it just feels like everything's

46:51.680 --> 46:55.960
communicating in a good way. And I just can't better. I can't describe it better than that.

46:55.960 --> 46:59.240
But do you kind of get what I'm saying? And so I just don't get that with anything but

46:59.240 --> 47:00.240
GNOME Shell right now.

47:00.240 --> 47:05.080
Oh, that's fair. I mean, I think you have a particular sensitivity to some of the you

47:05.080 --> 47:09.160
know, just how your desktop, the interactivity that you're presented with when you're sitting

47:09.160 --> 47:13.520
at your computer trying to get work done. I wonder if that's would you say the same

47:13.520 --> 47:17.040
in like in the studio environment or something else like that? I think it doesn't matter

47:17.040 --> 47:20.640
as much there. Yeah. I think maybe you're talking about like your primary workstation.

47:20.640 --> 47:25.400
Yeah. Yeah. So Cinnamon just didn't give me that feeling. And I don't know. I don't have

47:25.400 --> 47:29.200
a great way to describe it, but I just don't get that kind of connection like I do where

47:29.200 --> 47:33.080
it feels like and faster like with GNOME Shell. It feels like I'm closer to the metal. I don't

47:33.080 --> 47:37.180
know why. Maybe because everything is running in Wayland and it's just super smooth right

47:37.180 --> 47:43.100
now. But that's just my thing. And it wouldn't stop me from using it on a on a budget machine.

47:43.100 --> 47:47.600
I think I think Cinnamon would do great on there. I'm curious, Brentley, I know you had

47:47.600 --> 47:51.840
a chance to kind of take a look at I think you had a you know, a few thoughts. What was

47:51.840 --> 47:56.840
your takeaway from the latest Mint and where you think it kind of fits in? Well, I have

47:56.840 --> 48:01.840
quite a bit of history with Mint actually that I thought would be related to this these

48:01.840 --> 48:06.680
topics and I think that's important to mention just before I get to my experience, my current

48:06.680 --> 48:13.560
experience. So you mentioned low end hardware. I put Linux Mint on a piece of machinery,

48:13.560 --> 48:21.960
I'll call it, for a friend who had an old laptop that was a four by three screen and

48:21.960 --> 48:30.700
was a 32 bit, a machine that I couldn't buy a hard drive for to upgrade. So this thing

48:30.700 --> 48:35.720
took an IDE, our drive was that old, but my friend was still using it and loved the thing

48:35.720 --> 48:39.840
and said, hey, is there any way you can like it? It was running Windows. I don't know which

48:39.840 --> 48:44.280
version, but it was extremely slow. So she said, hey, is there any way you can kind of

48:44.280 --> 48:49.080
throw that fancy Linux thing you use on here and make it maybe last another year or two?

48:49.080 --> 48:55.060
And the hard drive is starting to present some issues. So I ended up somehow she was

48:55.060 --> 49:01.800
OK with this, but we strapped like duct taped literally an external hard drive to this thing.

49:01.800 --> 49:07.720
But it was an SSD, right? OK, it was USB, like probably one, but it still ran better

49:07.720 --> 49:12.280
than Windows was from the failing IDE hard drive that was in there. This was probably

49:12.280 --> 49:18.660
Linux Mint. I think last time I updated on that machine is Linux Mint 19 at the time.

49:18.660 --> 49:24.040
And it just ran forever and it ran great. And she's not technical, but she just loved

49:24.040 --> 49:28.000
the thing so much that when she bought a new machine that she said, no, no, get rid of

49:28.000 --> 49:32.120
this Windows thing. I want Linux Mint on there again. And I suggested other things. She's

49:32.120 --> 49:39.760
like, nope, I love that thing. So there's there's something to that like stability and

49:39.760 --> 49:43.680
it doesn't change very often. But when it does is just to like tweak a few little things

49:43.680 --> 49:48.360
to make them more stable even. You know, and so I think there's something really nice to

49:48.360 --> 49:53.880
that. And for years at about the same time I ran Linux Mint on my ThinkPad X220. And

49:53.880 --> 49:57.880
last episode I recommended that as the low end piece hardware that I thought was was

49:57.880 --> 50:02.880
worth looking at. And back then it ran beautifully. I don't see why it wouldn't run just as beautifully

50:02.880 --> 50:10.040
now. You have or have not ran Mint on that box on the X220. I have ran Mint. It was the

50:10.040 --> 50:15.280
second choice that I put on there. The first choice was XFC, which I ran I think for a

50:15.280 --> 50:22.700
year. Oh, I let's call it an upgrade upgraded to Mint. And I loved it for I think about

50:22.700 --> 50:27.720
two years. I just love that thing. It was a bit more problematic back then. Wes, you

50:27.720 --> 50:33.560
and I were talking about how there used to be a I think it was a right click menu or

50:33.560 --> 50:39.360
something for Mint back then that would re reinitialize Cinnamon. Oh, sure. Right. You

50:39.360 --> 50:44.920
could just restart that. Restart that real quick. Cinnamon was let's call it fresh back

50:44.920 --> 50:49.200
then. Good news. Good news, gentlemen. You can actually still find that applet. If you

50:49.200 --> 50:54.280
go add applets, you can still find it and add it back. It just isn't default. Yeah, it's

50:54.280 --> 50:57.520
still there. I like that. I like that as like a nervous tick. You know, you type L.S. in

50:57.520 --> 51:01.120
the terminal and you just hit and refresh. Well, you know, now in the Wayland world looking

51:01.120 --> 51:04.880
back and thinking, wow, I could just restart the desktop and all my applications aren't

51:04.880 --> 51:10.120
affected and my whole desktop remains. That's actually a pretty nice feature. This X thing

51:10.120 --> 51:15.460
is neat. It's got some cool stuff in it. So I would say that's like my background with

51:15.460 --> 51:21.720
Linux Mint, sort of a love relationship that slowly faded. And then I moved on to other

51:21.720 --> 51:26.980
other things. So it wasn't meant it was you and you just had outgrown it. It's not you.

51:26.980 --> 51:30.200
It's me. Yeah. And I don't mean to make it sound like, you know, if you're using Mint,

51:30.200 --> 51:33.680
you're not a pro user, because I think the point the point we're trying to hit here is

51:33.680 --> 51:38.800
it's it's it's absolutely a totally usable workstation. And it probably scales very well

51:38.800 --> 51:41.820
on high end hardware as well, I would imagine. And what's really impressive about Mint for

51:41.820 --> 51:46.880
me is two things that come to mind right away is one, the users that use it really love

51:46.880 --> 51:51.200
it. And you see that in forums, you see that on Reddit, you see that all over the place.

51:51.200 --> 51:54.440
Some people really love it. And I can see why and I used to be one. The other thing

51:54.440 --> 52:01.820
I noticed is that the Linux Mint project gets a lot of donations, like a surprising amount

52:01.820 --> 52:05.840
of donations. If you if you browse to their website, they they kindly list them all I

52:05.840 --> 52:12.440
think on a monthly, monthly sort of routine. And it's very impressive how many donations

52:12.440 --> 52:18.360
they get on a monthly basis. And I think that's a testament to how much they matter for some

52:18.360 --> 52:25.020
people. I like this woodcarver over in our matrix room. Linux Mint is super boring. That's

52:25.020 --> 52:30.560
why it's been my daily driver for the last five years. Absolutely rock solid. See what

52:30.560 --> 52:34.920
I mean? Yeah. I don't know, Alex, have you looked at it before? Have you tried Linux

52:34.920 --> 52:40.100
Mint before? Yeah, I did. It's been it's been a long time. And I think I agree generally

52:40.100 --> 52:46.760
with your assessments here that Linux Mint really is the appliance of desktop Linux.

52:46.760 --> 52:54.040
You can just set it up and forget it and just expect it to continue working for a long time.

52:54.040 --> 52:57.640
And that's really an accolade in this day and age. I think one of the reasons I like

52:57.640 --> 53:02.840
recommending it to for a budget Linux machine is not just because it's only for low end

53:02.840 --> 53:07.460
hardware, but because you can recommend it to somebody and it's a full fledged Ubuntu

53:07.460 --> 53:13.200
based Linux. It is not a watered down like tiny distro that has some esoteric crazy little

53:13.200 --> 53:18.920
tiny desktop. It is like a proven track record team behind this desktop environment who has

53:18.920 --> 53:23.320
been producing and like Brent touched on, clearly as a community that is supporting

53:23.320 --> 53:27.520
it that sees a lot of value and it's their contributing value back to the Mint project

53:27.520 --> 53:31.840
and it seems to be working for them. Okay, maybe this is an awkward question, but where

53:31.840 --> 53:34.800
does Ubuntu MATE or something like that fit into this picture?

53:34.800 --> 53:39.640
Right, MATE I think is the other question. I also could see the argument for an XFCE

53:39.640 --> 53:45.040
desktop if it's maybe set up kind of more like in a Windows style. I don't know. That's

53:45.040 --> 53:46.160
a good question.

53:46.160 --> 53:52.880
I think they both fill a very similar space, don't they? And much like the old Steve Jobs

53:52.880 --> 53:59.440
adage, one doesn't have to lose for the other one to win. They can both coexist. They feel

53:59.440 --> 54:01.480
different niches maybe, but...

54:01.480 --> 54:02.480
I agree.

54:02.480 --> 54:09.680
Chris, you asked about my experience with modern Mint and I think it's much like yours.

54:09.680 --> 54:15.600
Comparing to the Mint of yesteryear that I was used to, I just thought it looked super

54:15.600 --> 54:22.080
familiar. I jumped in there and I felt right at home in a nostalgic kind of way and it

54:22.080 --> 54:25.800
was really easy to understand where everything still was because it hadn't really changed.

54:25.800 --> 54:32.320
I mean, there were some neat options that you mentioned with styling that was presented

54:32.320 --> 54:36.920
in the welcome screen that I really appreciated, like highlight color that you could choose,

54:36.920 --> 54:43.200
like little things that I think are nice touches but not too involved. You don't have to get

54:43.200 --> 54:47.960
in there and really know what you're doing. So that felt like a really nice experience

54:47.960 --> 54:52.280
and I thought it just felt super polished. I was really impressed.

54:52.280 --> 54:57.200
See, that's saying something. I'm curious because I mean, you're our head of QA. I mean,

54:57.200 --> 54:59.600
have you managed to break it in any odd ways yet?

54:59.600 --> 55:05.120
I did try to install encryption through the installer because I feel like I've caught

55:05.120 --> 55:13.240
a few distributions, not maybe test that enough, shall we say, that presents some weird like

55:13.240 --> 55:20.840
edge cases, but I haven't found any bugs yet. And I will try a little harder, but I thought

55:20.840 --> 55:22.520
that was, you know, that's something.

55:22.520 --> 55:25.200
You didn't find any bugs. I don't believe it.

55:25.200 --> 55:26.200
I can't either.

55:26.200 --> 55:32.560
I was out late drinking last night, so there's that. But yeah, I thought it was really polished

55:32.560 --> 55:41.520
and I was really impressed and I was surprised that that was my take. So there you go.

55:41.520 --> 55:46.240
Bitwarden.com slash Linux. Go there to get started with a free trial for yourself, your

55:46.240 --> 55:51.640
team or an enterprise. That's Bitwarden.com slash Linux. Bitwarden, quite simply, is the

55:51.640 --> 55:57.760
easiest and the best way for you or a business to store, share and sync your sensitive data.

55:57.760 --> 56:01.000
And Bitwarden is fully customizable. You can use it with your enterprise policies. You

56:01.000 --> 56:04.120
can start on your machine. They've got a Flatpak available. It's, of course, available for

56:04.120 --> 56:09.540
mobile operating systems. And the beauty is Bitwarden is open source, so you can trust

56:09.540 --> 56:13.920
it and it is already trusted by millions of individuals and teams and organizations in

56:13.920 --> 56:18.320
their community. It's what Wes and I use to manage our passwords. It's how we also manage

56:18.320 --> 56:23.560
our two factor codes and other sensitive data like recovery keys for certain applications

56:23.560 --> 56:27.760
and whatnot. It's awesome if you're a matrix user and you want to get a recovery key in

56:27.760 --> 56:31.760
there, just save it right in there with your login information. And Bitwarden has slick

56:31.760 --> 56:35.600
account switching support, so you can jump between a work account, you can jump between

56:35.600 --> 56:39.440
your personal account or maybe the free software project you're working on. And things over

56:39.440 --> 56:44.200
Bitwarden are always improving. In fact, rolling out this week is SCIM support. Yeah, that's

56:44.200 --> 56:48.360
I call it SCIM. Maybe it's pronounced S-C-I-M, but you enterprise folks, you know what a

56:48.360 --> 56:52.600
big deal this is. And it's becoming available this week for Bitwarden to make it easier

56:52.600 --> 56:58.920
than ever to provision and manage users. Bitwarden just made your life so much simpler in the

56:58.920 --> 57:03.240
enterprise. And for all of us out there, that new username generator continues to be a real

57:03.240 --> 57:08.120
winner. Why not have a unique username and a unique password for every site and service

57:08.120 --> 57:13.680
that you sign up for? Maybe you already know about how important it is to have a great

57:13.680 --> 57:18.600
password manager, but does everyone in your family, to your friends, is your business,

57:18.600 --> 57:23.220
your place of work, are they covered here? Are they using the right tool for the job?

57:23.220 --> 57:26.520
Maybe this is an opportunity to try it out for yourself or your business and support

57:26.520 --> 57:31.880
the show. You can do all of that by going to bitwarden.com slash Linux. Go check out

57:31.880 --> 57:41.360
the brand new features rolling out to Bitwarden this week. Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

57:41.360 --> 57:45.360
As always, we got some amazing boosts and feedback into our email. Thank you everyone

57:45.360 --> 57:51.800
for that. Chris and I did touch on, I think what was a little bit of a delicate topic.

57:51.800 --> 57:58.720
So if you feel maybe a little rubbed the wrong way by the boosts, well, we hate crypto too,

57:58.720 --> 58:03.920
it turns out. And we discussed that a little bit more in Office Hours 9. And we just want

58:03.920 --> 58:10.280
you to know that you're still with us. We hear you. Yeah. And we have a rationale. And

58:10.280 --> 58:15.680
we explain it. OfficeHours.hair slash 9. Well, hey, speaking of boosts, Noob Steve

58:15.680 --> 58:24.600
boosted in with 2,222 sets. I'm a duck. D-U-K duck. Loaded with talent. Couldn't boost Coder

58:24.600 --> 58:29.760
without boosting love. Aw, thanks Noob Steve. Wish I could get to one of those meetups,

58:29.760 --> 58:36.400
but hashtag gas for Brent. Gas for Brent. That is great Steve. And I'm happy to report

58:36.400 --> 58:40.600
we were starting to actually get some like details down in terms of dates on when Brent's

58:40.600 --> 58:45.340
going to make it here before the road trip and all that kind of stuff. So it is happening

58:45.340 --> 58:50.200
and your boosts are going to put gas in that tank. So we really, really appreciate that.

58:50.200 --> 58:54.880
And you can't have him. He's mine. And you're going to keep him forever. I understand. Ah,

58:54.880 --> 58:58.480
that's why you got that brand. We're going to, we're going to have to mount a Brent rescue

58:58.480 --> 59:03.760
operation West. We'll break into the middle of the night. Come on Brent, you're coming

59:03.760 --> 59:11.640
with us. And coordinate it all on Matrix. Right, right, right. There you go. Oh, oh

59:11.640 --> 59:21.800
gosh. It's, it's a double duck day from Parrish potato. Honestly, if you find a used laptop

59:21.800 --> 59:27.120
with at least eight gigs of RAM, you'd be able to do a decent amount of quote, regular

59:27.120 --> 59:32.600
computer stuff. I've been playing Skyrim on a laptop I bought for 200 at work between

59:32.600 --> 59:37.040
calls and it works just fine. Hey, that's great. I mean, Skyrim is not the most modern

59:37.040 --> 59:41.640
game, but if that's the one you want to play, that's all that matters. Exactly. The golden

59:41.640 --> 59:50.080
dragon boosts in with 1024 sets. B O O S T. Coming hot with the boost. Coming in hot with

59:50.080 --> 59:56.760
the boost. Back in the day when wifi didn't work, I use Kumbantu and had to go right back

59:56.760 --> 01:00:02.480
to windows. Ouch. Yeah. Then I tried again here in the last three years and it's been

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:08.040
a dream. Sometimes Linux is hard to love, but that tough love forces you to learn new

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:13.120
skills and you appreciate computing that much more. You do learn more. There is something

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:17.000
to that. And sometimes it's an angry learning. You're all, you're like, this is not what

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.160
I wanted to be learning right now, but you still learn. You know, here's my thought.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.760
You want anything? Here's what I think. Wes, you want anything? I think I'm going to find

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.760
out either way. All right, Wes, I'll tell you what I think. I think it's not necessarily

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.880
a bad thing that it's the hard way to learn. I think you need that. You know, it's good

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.480
to have that option. There's easy ways to, you can't always take the easy path. That's

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:44.360
right. That's good. Mic Mac boosts in with, oh, oh, hey, double 1024. It's 2048 sets.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:49.900
Would love to get your guys take on manage IQ. That's manage IQ.org as I'm looking for

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:54.060
an open source single management pain for my local compute management as well as my

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:58.220
cloud formation templates for both my home lab, which is a micro. Okay. It's on a three

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:04.000
node Raspberry Pi four cluster. And then he, he blames you for that, Chris. Okay. I am

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:10.400
aware of terraform. However, I've been hesitant to jump into that world. Thoughts, suggestions.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:16.800
Thanks for all the content. So it's manage IQ.org for this site. And this, okay, so this

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:21.680
does have one kind of thing that appeals to me right off the bat. And that is you kind

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:25.640
of use one tool and you're spinning images for your box at home. You're spinning, you're

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.480
spinning Docker containers. You're spinning public cloud images. I see a lot of different

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.720
platforms on here, VMware, Ansible tower Foreman, of course, Kubernetes. Yeah. I've never tried

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.240
this though. I wonder, I wonder if our dear Mr. Alex has thought, yeah, I thought that

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.660
was my first thought too. So I wonder what Alex thinks of this. So manage IQ is the upstream

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:49.040
version of a red hat project called cloud forms. And I was sent on a training course

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:57.560
to learn cloud forms as a consultant four or five years ago now. And I spent the entire

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:02.340
week with my head in my hands. I know who pays my wages and I should probably choose

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:11.080
my words carefully, but I think it's terrible. I hate it because it's for me, I like infrastructure

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:17.960
as code and cloud forms was everything the other direction. Everything in the interface

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:23.720
was click, click, click. You know, if you like gooey's manage IQ is for you, but for

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:29.720
me, it's just not the right tool for the job. And you mentioned Terraform in your question.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:34.440
And I just think you've got the answer there already. Like the infrastructure as code tooling

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:40.160
is there, it's mature. If you combine it with some of the continuous integration tools that

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:45.540
are now available as well, you can do a lot of the clever stuff that manage IQ purports

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:51.560
to be able to do yourself and not be tied into a specific development cycle of a product.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:57.240
That is great insight, Alex. You know, I have to channel the Nix nerds matrix room right

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:02.400
now just for a moment. And I didn't see that coming at all. They would say check out Nix

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:09.120
OS generators, one config, multiple output formats. Boys, I installed this last night.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:16.120
It is so fricking cool. So you installed super easy on Nix and then you have this Nix OS

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:21.200
generator command and then you tell it what image based on your config on that local box

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.640
that you want. You want an Amazon EC2 image. All right. Tell it that you want a Docker

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:30.680
image. Okay. Hyper V. Sure. No problem. You want just a regular ISO image. You can have

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:36.440
that to K exec. Yep. It's got K exec. It'll output all of that different stuff and more

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:43.160
Proxmox, OpenStack, just a raw file, VMware file, virtual box file, vagrant file. I mean,

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:48.200
it does everything. And what's so cool about it, you just go about setting up your config

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:52.640
like you would anyways. And once you get the box just the way you likes it, you run this,

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.280
it outputs your image and you can tell it for which public cloud you want or what, you

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:59.800
know, what format you want and it's done. It's easy. You sneaky over there and generating

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:04.120
a whole bunch of images. Well, I was trying to come up with a way to test and I thought

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.920
I really like this base and then I can add gnome or I can add plasma. And so that's just

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:13.280
what I did is I created a small little base that I could then just add the different desktop

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:16.800
environment on to do my testing. So it was kind of as close to the same machine as possible.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.760
Plus you could generate your own nice little sort of like live Nix environment, but with

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:25.760
your setup there, you know, just keep it on, keep it on your little vent toy. I hadn't

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:31.040
even thought of that or a VM image even where I could. Oh, that's so cool, Wes. Great idea.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:34.480
You know, if you stay tuned till next week, Chris is going to reveal that he's got his

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:40.120
own Nix based distribution that you can download in any format you'd like for no, no, no, no,

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:43.560
it's going to be Jupiter OS. We're going to come full circle from the start of the network.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:51.280
We actually started the podcast network originally was actually a Linux based OS initiative called

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:56.000
Jupiter. I did not know this and it was, you know, don't call it a distro. It was a Linux

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.720
operating system. We were very Brian and I were really very insistent about that. And

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:05.360
you just like cat slash dev slash Linux action show. Yeah. Well, no, not yet, but we would

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.560
have built that in. I mean, come on. We would have definitely had our show automatically

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:13.480
subscribed on the desktop. Let's be honest when that's what happened is we started podcasting

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.560
and we realized, man, we're way better at podcasting than we are building a desktop.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:23.420
And so we stopped and thankfully the elementary OS guys continued on. And so you got Jupiter

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.480
OS and all of that kind of stuff, which was inspired from some of that work that we did

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:30.840
early on. I'm just inspired. I'm not saying just inspired. And yeah, we did the podcast

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:34.080
thing. So it all worked out. So it would be full circle now for me to start publishing

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:38.800
my own OS. That would be, that would be kind of perfect. You just need to do JP coin next

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:43.960
and then you're all set. Oh, how else are you going to donate to get your eyes? Well,

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:51.380
you know, I'm a big crypto guy. I love crypto. So again, office hours nine, we, we address

01:05:51.380 --> 01:06:00.800
this quite in depth. I like gene being boosted in again. Uh, 1000 sats package formats matter

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:05.280
because it's a pain in the butt to deal with all the variety because you can't just pick

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:10.560
one or two. Even when using gooey's like pop as an example, you can't install snaps or

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:16.880
things from homebrew via the package pop shop. Yet I want stuff from both so that everything

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:21.920
is installed from somewhere that checks for updates. Sadly, homebrew requires manual updating

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:28.800
unless you drop to cron. So this is in response to a topic I kind of just lamented last week,

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:37.520
which was why our package management and tooling and application still such a big deal. I mean,

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:41.660
I realized stuff never dies in the Linux community. We still debate system D as well. But today

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:49.560
as we record the number one post on our Linux with 725 up boats, 282 comments is canonical

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:54.240
should ditch snap, embrace flat pack and improve apt. And then of course you can probably imagine

01:06:54.240 --> 01:07:05.240
how that discussion devolves nuanced. It is informed. Yes. You nailed it. West. It's so

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:10.740
annoying. Like why won't it die? It's funny too, because like, you know, at, at meetups,

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:14.000
just hanging out with like people. I know they use Linux. It does not organically come

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.480
up hardly at all. You don't fight over packaging. It's totally an internet fight thing, but

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:22.560
gene being is right in the sense that I think it does come up because it clearly is something

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:32.080
that matters to people. Gene being also wrote in for a double boost 7,000 sets. Oh, I combined

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.700
it cause he had a double send in there. So that is a, but that's a great, that's near

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:43.620
baller boost. That's close. Not quite though. Right? Close. They write again, the XPS change

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:48.600
you talked about sounds like how Lenovo does things where you can order many laptops with

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:53.920
Ubuntu pre-installed Dell also offers multiple latitude laptops with Ubuntu pre-installed,

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:59.120
at least if you go through a rep, I've just taken advantage of this at work for some special

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:05.000
use laptops with built in Intel broadband modems that work out of the box. Buying with

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.240
compatibility is different in Linux. You can't read a box or Amazon description to know if

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:16.960
it works with distro X. You can know that for a Mac or windows system. That's a fair

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.440
point. You do have a little bit easier time there. I can't argue that. I do have good

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:24.720
news though. Just looking at the Dell.com slash Linux page, it does look like they've

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:29.200
added the new XPS. At least I think it's hard to tell what the XPS these days, cause I think

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:33.800
they make both models available at the same time, the previous one and the current one,

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:39.960
but they have one labeled the new XPS 13 plus and it comes with a 12th gen Intel processor.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:45.200
And I think this is it. And they just have three options, windows 11 home pro or Ubuntu

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.680
LTS. So I think maybe they were just updating the site and we had people sound the alarm

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:56.440
bells. I think it's okay. Next up we have gene being with a triple boost.

01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:06.880
2674 sets. I think that might just be a double leet sets, right Chris?

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.880
Double leet.

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:12.600
They right. I love our clone for getting stuff out of other cloud services and into next

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:17.640
cloud with local disks, AKA not object storage behind next cloud. All the timestamps from

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.200
Dropbox and other places are preserved.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.840
I kind of love the idea. Like maybe you're not a huge fan of the next cloud sinking client,

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.640
but you something great like our clone and just, you can still get, you know, benefits

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.480
of the next cloud experience, but just kind of take that part into yourself.

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.360
Yeah. I'm also going to give a plug for my pick last week that lets you do local encryption

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:37.400
before you upload it to the cloud. Might check that out too.

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:42.280
Yeah. Alex, I was for a bit of context here since you were probably flying or doing some

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:45.760
meetups or something in a different continent at the time. I was mentioning how you turned

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.760
me onto our clone and it's changed my life in a little tiny way. So thank you for that.

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:51.760
Very welcome.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:10:02.920
Next, we have a great booster, Gene Bean for quad booze.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:07.820
Not only did Gene Bean become the number one supporter for this episode with the amount

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:11.360
of boosting that he did, but I think, you know what boys, that's technically a baller

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.360
boost too.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:17.000
Cause I'm a back home baller. If I want something, I just holler.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.740
Gene Bean writes, I got a little excited sending boosts this episode, which is I think clearly

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:26.880
true to make myself feel better about sending so many questions and comments. Here's an

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:30.680
extra bit of leetness for Brent's gas tank.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.380
Thank you, Gene Bean. Thank you for your support on this episode. That is, you are definitely

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:40.360
our top supporter this week. And also thank you everybody who participated in boosting

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:44.280
for Brent to get him down to the studio for some projects that we have. If we can ever

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:49.640
save them from Alex's house continued to boost in. We appreciate your support there. Also,

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:55.280
we recently were sending some splits to the open stats project, which has been contributed

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:58.640
to free software projects. That money has now been contributed several hundred dollars

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:03.480
there. So thank you everybody. Congratulations. And then also one of the things that's fantastic

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:08.040
about these stats that you boost in is we don't sell them.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.360
We kind of consider them maybe as a long-term investment. So it's a way for you to give

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:16.520
us something at a small amount of value today that will continue to work for the network.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:21.080
But instead of just sitting there, not doing anything, we actually put them to work. They

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:26.760
help us open up bigger channels and they helped me get Brent's node up and going with multiple

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:31.440
channels. And just recently, which is a big milestone for me, I was able to open a direct

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.360
channel to the fountain FM node, which is just a lot more efficient in terms of routing

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:42.360
and whatnot. So the boosts also are being put to work today to help us participate in

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.560
that peer-to-peer network even more. And it's just kind of a great way that we can actually

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:51.320
do something with those stats instead of just letting them sit there, which is also fine.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:59.080
But you know, we don't got stuff. All right. We have a boost in from Prozac, a 1999 boost

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:05.760
for Brent's gas fund. And he says, I keep independent media alive. Go podcasting.

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.600
I think that should be my bumper sticker. And it feels like maybe I might need a bigger

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:18.560
gas tank pretty soon. Well, you got to drive back to Brent. Don't remind him. So listen,

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.860
we're doing something just as this is a new segment. And again, we talked about this more

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:24.840
in office hours, but we're going to start tightening the segment up just a little bit

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:30.320
to kind of keep the show moving. So we will be implementing a 1000 minimum sat to get

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:36.080
your boost read on the show. But we do read 100 percent of every boost that come in every

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.600
single one of them, which I actually can't make that claim for email just because the

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:42.480
volume difference. But we do want to keep things moving. So we will have a one K and

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.240
above limit for boost to be read on the show. But every now and then, since we read all

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:51.680
of them, we'll pull some forward. Crypto Kyle this week had one of those. He boosted with

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.560
five hundred stats. So just, you know, about half under the minimum. But I wanted to read

01:12:55.560 --> 01:13:01.740
it anyways. He said, I picked up a Lenovo P50 for just under 400 dollars USD. Super

01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:08.680
powerful with a built in M2000M GPU, a Xeon processor, actually pretty great power and

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:14.120
performance. And it runs NixOS great with ZFS on route with KD Plasma. That seems like

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:17.760
a nice choice for something like a workstation alternative. You don't need to be super portable

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.960
necessarily. But do you want to move it around? Those are nice machines. You got to figure

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.800
West with that Xeon CPU in there to probably do probably some virtualization loads. I mean,

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:30.920
I bet that thing works. I mean, I wouldn't bet it's the best battery life. But if that's

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:34.400
not your goal, I think that's fine. And then we got a bunch of thank you boost. Two hundred

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.160
and ten sats, six hundred sats, fifty sats, ten sats, six hundred sats from Ibuki, Resta

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:45.920
Casta Versta, Burji, User 64 1 and Authorities. You didn't get any of those right. But I know

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:50.000
I did not. I did not. I absolutely did not. Thank you, everyone. Also, who streams in

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.160
the sats in the background. We appreciate you. I just had you know, I'm trying to keep

01:13:55.160 --> 01:14:00.400
it tight. I love trying to try to keep on moving. I'm doing my best, living my best

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.560
podcast life. But we really appreciate everybody that came in. And those of you who also just

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:08.720
stream them in the background. Thank you very much. Go get a new podcast app, new podcast

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:15.080
apps dot com. We love Fountain, Castamatic and Podverse are our favorites. And then the

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:18.480
nerds like to boost in with boost CLI. I don't know if we got to boost CLI. Did we get it?

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:22.600
I don't know if we did this week. But then you've got to change your podcast client.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:27.840
Also Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z dot technology. And one day everyone's going to have this stuff

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:31.840
figured out and I won't have to sit here and I won't be the only one talking about this.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.680
I do want to mention this is going to be on the longer side. But just to wrap this up,

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:41.200
when we started talking about boosts on this show, there were 4000 podcasts on the Lightning

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:48.840
Network. Now we are quickly approaching 8000. We've nearly doubled, not saying we did it,

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:52.080
but the amount of podcasts have nearly doubled on the Lightning Network since we started

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:56.480
talking about it here on the show. It's growing like crazy. So why not grab a new app and

01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:02.800
try it out? Okay, I'm pretty proud of this pic this week, guys. You ever just need yourself

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:07.880
a little FTP? It's pretty hard to come by these days. I try not to admit it, but yeah.

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:13.200
The old file transfer protocol, it got the job done, Wes. It got the job done. But you

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:18.400
know, running FTP, that's for your dad and well, me actually back in the day. But now

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:25.840
you can do it quickly on your desktop with user mode FTP. And it's just a simple, clean

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:31.000
graphical app that you load up, you set things like the username, the password, the directory

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.960
you want to share, and which particular protocol FTP, FTPS, or SFTP that you want to use. Then

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:42.520
you click start, and you got yourself a little temporary FTP server on your box that you

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:47.120
can connect to to transfer apps, files, data, whatever. Super easy and quick.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:51.600
This feels like a weird full circle thing where this is almost like an Android app that

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.440
would do this, you know, on your phone, just a quick little FTP server, but now it's a

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:59.160
desktop Linux. I mean, yeah, I think there are definitely apps like this for Android.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:03.600
So I but this is for your desktop. And you know, this is kind of for me strikes the perfect

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:08.800
balance because I don't really need an FTP server anymore ever. And when I do, I don't

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:12.400
really want to set one up. But this is so easy. Why not? And nice to see for the folks

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:17.720
who may be your concern. They do have FTP S and SFTP. We'll have a link in the show

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:22.560
notes. I think I might just have a bonus pic that I found late last night. You want to

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.560
hear this one?

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:29.200
Bring on us. So I think good ever happens after midnight, dude. Well, it depends. It's

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:35.360
always after midnight somewhere. Right, Alex? Yes. What time is it? What day is it? Right

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.960
now? Actually, right.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:43.960
As some or most of you may know, our new website is coming along really well. We would love

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.560
to get some testing there. So if you can go to Jupiter broadcasting dot net and try to

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:52.080
break it or think of some new features, that would be awesome. And there's a little GitHub

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.400
link there. And that brings me to this new app that I found. I was noticing because we

01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:02.040
have so many great people who are contributing to the new website. It wasn't enough for me

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:07.880
to sit down multiple times a day at the computer and get all the notifications of commits and

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:11.640
issues and discussions and things like that. So I needed a mobile app. But as some of you

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:17.660
may know, I lean very heavily on after it. And I wanted to see if there were any open

01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:24.160
source ways to interact with GitHub. And I found an amazing one that I think is worth

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:30.600
trying. It's called and Wes, I'll see if you've maybe used this before. It's called Octodroid.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:36.920
The way I chose it was that it's extremely active on its own GitHub page. And it seems

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:43.080
like it's got some amazing features. So I'm brand new to it. But it has been working fabulously

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:48.000
for me at least in the last 12 hours. So I think people should check it out.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.120
Hey, looks handy. I don't know that I need more notifications in my life. But if I did,

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.400
this seems nice. I love I love when it's on after it as well. You know, it's easy to get

01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:02.360
and it's open source. Why not put a link to that in the notes as well. All them notes

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:11.760
over at Linux unplugged.com slash 470. Hello. Hello. Remember how we were just planning

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:17.240
episode 400? And that seemed like a lot of work. And now should we start fermenting something?

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:22.360
Yeah, we better. Yeah, we better start brewing now is what I'm saying. You know, who let's

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:26.600
worry about it after the road trip road trip first. Then we'll worry about episode 500.

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:32.300
I think we got a little time deal Linux unplugged.com slash JPL to get your name in that hat so

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:37.080
you can come hang out with us. Of course, we'll also meet down there near the JPL area

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:41.960
if you can make it a JPL. And we've got road stops, several of them, like four or five

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:44.760
of them along the way. And I'm always kind of putting my feelers out there and hearing

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:50.800
where you're all at. Today was kind of a sweet day, I have to say, because within 24 hours,

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:55.560
I heard from two long timers that have been listening since the very start of Linux action

01:18:55.560 --> 01:19:00.200
show. And one of them I'm going to get to meet on the West Coast tour. But one of them

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:04.560
lives in the Midwest. But it was neat to get to connect on Matrix last night. That's lovely.

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:08.160
And talk to them. So, oh, man, you guys have really got me, Johnson, for the meetup. So

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:12.080
I'm looking forward to that. Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for all that. You can

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:18.120
also just connect with us every single Sunday. We do the show live on Sundays at noon, Pacific

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:22.320
three p.m. Eastern over at Jupiter Dot Tube. And we have an open mumble room. You can join

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:26.200
our virtual log, hang out with us. We like to chat during the show during the pre and

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:30.800
post show. It's a great way to kind of get kind of a taste of the meetup experience,

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:35.000
but from the comfort of your own home. So join us. We have it in your time at Jupiter

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.960
broadcasting dot com slash calendar. But of course, I know you all can't make it. See

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:44.520
you next week. Same bad time, same bad station. So, of course, we do have Linux unplugged

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:47.600
dot com slash subscribe. That way you can get the episode every single week when it

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:54.640
comes out like a do. We never miss a week. And of course, go grab Linux action news loaded

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:58.620
with deets. You didn't hear tons of things going on in the world of Linux and open source.

01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:04.200
We cover it every single week. Linux action news dot com. As for us, well, that just about

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:09.000
wraps it up. You can find all of our resources over at Linux unplugged dot com and go check

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.880
out that new test website. Let us know what you think. Jupiter broadcasting dot net. Thank

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.840
you to our members who helped make the show possible in some plug core dot com. And we'll

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:36.280
see you right back here next week.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:21:02.720
I enjoyed that I'd still like to get more submissions on budget PCs, so do feel free

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:08.320
to still send them into the show at the contact page or or however you likes. I think it's

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:13.120
still more we can get to. You know, we did get some some extras that I you know, we couldn't

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:18.040
squeeze into the show, but I thought it would be worth mentioning them quickly. Dave suggested

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:26.600
an HP MT 20 or MT 21 says my four below and suggestions those they are pro books that

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:31.320
were marketed as thin clients. So there's another thin clients recommendation. Hey,

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:37.880
I'm a pro. I want a pro book. Yeah, well under $100 on eBay, apparently. And one of the best

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:45.920
reasons to choose it was all of the different. My brain is fried all of the different plugs

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:51.520
and things like connectivity and ports. Thank you, Chris. Yes, thank, thank, thanks. Cool.

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:59.240
And so that's one. We also got a recommendation for a $400 refurbished horizon mini PC, which

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:06.720
sounds great. That's that'd be a great machine, right? ThinkPad T for 80s came in hot, which

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:11.200
I'm I'm leaning towards one on the desk behind you. Alex is going to sell his if you want

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:15.240
it. Well, it's red. It's red hot property. I might get in trouble if I did that. We know

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:19.040
the T for 80 is a solid machine, though. That's one that we've had direct experience with.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:26.200
Yeah, Matt also has a Linux build from a bunch of parts for sub $300, which sounds pretty

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:32.120
sweet. If you want to do it yourself a little, I like it. Turns out if you try hard enough,

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:40.160
you can. And the last suggestion was a ThinkCenter M 91 P Tower PC. I'm not familiar with the

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:44.580
ThinkCenters as much, but I know that they have been certifying the more recent ThinkCenters

01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:50.960
with Linux. That's a good sign. I mean, this one sounds pretty great. Actually, I 7 2600

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:58.480
with 16 gigs of RAM and an IPS display and apparently open Sousa. Oh, hey, IPS display

01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:01.520
would be nice. You know, I have to say, we didn't talk about it this week, but we covered

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:07.160
it in Linux action news. I think the Lenovo situation was clocked wrong. It sounds like

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:13.440
they had a series of bad events that caused things to go slower than they want with their

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:17.220
Linux initiative last year. You can probably imagine some of its supply chain related.

01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:24.380
Some of it was driver issues and other things. But we played the clips in land, but something

01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:31.080
like 36 different Lenovo machines are being certified to run Linux this year. Can you

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:37.880
believe that? That's crazy. That seems like a good sign. It's episode 252. If you're curious,

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:41.920
I will put an extra plug. It was a great episode. I really enjoyed it over breakfast the other

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:47.080
day. So thank you to gentlemen. Oh, stop. Thank you. No, I can do that. It was a blush.

01:23:47.080 --> 01:24:14.080
Well, you were already blushing because it's hot. But now you're blushing more. It's so
