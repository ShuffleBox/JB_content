00:00.000 --> 00:01.640
You know who did that?

00:01.640 --> 00:02.640
Noah did that.

00:02.640 --> 00:06.000
Noah taped that mic cable to that monitor cable.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.400
Why is it not homed until now, though?

00:07.400 --> 00:08.400
That's a good question.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.680
It's all taped together with electrical tape.

00:10.680 --> 00:11.680
Come on!

00:11.680 --> 00:22.480
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.480
My name is Chris.

00:23.480 --> 00:24.480
My name is Wes.

00:24.480 --> 00:25.480
Hello, Wes.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.480
Is that a homemade bearskin jacket?

00:27.480 --> 00:28.480
I thought you'd be impressed.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.640
That looks nice and toasty.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.180
This episode is brought to you by the all new A Cloud Guru.

00:33.180 --> 00:36.760
They are the leader in hands-on learning and the best way to learn a new skill, well, that's

00:36.760 --> 00:37.760
by doing.

00:37.760 --> 00:41.920
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs for cloud Linux servers and much more.

00:41.920 --> 00:45.320
So get your hands cloudy at a cloud guru dot com.

00:45.320 --> 00:50.920
Well, coming up on the show today, it is indeed an episode out of time.

00:50.920 --> 00:54.840
As you're listening to this, Wes and I are off in the Arctic on a penguin photo walk

00:54.840 --> 00:59.240
getting great action shots of some really delicious looking birds.

00:59.240 --> 01:03.660
I'm a little scared about the polar bear situation, but I'm just going to not bring any meat.

01:03.660 --> 01:07.940
I think, well, that bear jacket smells like meat, so you better think about that one.

01:07.940 --> 01:11.560
We asked you to send in your questions, though, so that way we'd have an episode for you

01:11.560 --> 01:14.880
while we are out and about taking photos and eating penguins.

01:14.880 --> 01:18.440
So in this episode, we're going to answer as many of those as possible.

01:18.440 --> 01:22.200
We are not going to get to all of them, though, but we're going to get to as many as we can.

01:22.200 --> 01:26.120
So I think in the future, we'll either do these in batches or we'll do another episode

01:26.120 --> 01:27.120
down the road.

01:27.120 --> 01:31.160
So if you hear something and or you you didn't hear your question asked, it could still be

01:31.160 --> 01:32.160
pending.

01:32.160 --> 01:35.720
And you all also, if you didn't get one in yet, you still have a chance at ask up dot

01:35.720 --> 01:36.720
com.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.340
We'll do that on a future episode.

01:38.340 --> 01:42.680
But before we get into all of that, we got to say hello to our virtual log time, appropriate

01:42.680 --> 01:43.680
greetings, mobile room.

01:43.680 --> 01:44.680
Hello.

01:44.680 --> 01:45.680
Hello, everybody.

01:45.680 --> 01:46.680
Hello.

01:46.680 --> 01:47.680
Happy Sunday.

01:47.680 --> 01:56.000
Thanks for letting us crash the luck today and and hang out and, you know, do a podcast.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.240
It's pretty awesome.

01:57.240 --> 01:58.240
So what do you say?

01:58.240 --> 02:02.800
Should we get into this huge, huge batch that we got here?

02:02.800 --> 02:06.720
Last week, we're like, let's hold off on Bill's question and let's answer it next week in

02:06.720 --> 02:07.720
our episode.

02:07.720 --> 02:09.080
So why don't we start with Bill's?

02:09.080 --> 02:10.080
All right.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.080
Yeah.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.520
Bill wrote in to us and this is a deep one just to start things off today.

02:13.520 --> 02:19.160
I'm writing as I wonder about the relationship between the Linux community and the Mac and

02:19.160 --> 02:24.040
PC platforms and how that relationship is formed.

02:24.040 --> 02:27.920
I think the Linux communities are quite alerted by anything Microsoft or Windows does.

02:27.920 --> 02:32.560
And this attitude can be seen in the recent discussion about WSLG as it just being a gateway

02:32.560 --> 02:36.080
so that people don't have to use Linux or I think really, you know, Bill speaking to

02:36.080 --> 02:39.240
some of our concerns about well, this really makes it easy and it takes a lot of the stuff

02:39.240 --> 02:42.400
that we kind of had uniquely in our camp before.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.400
Yeah.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.400
I think Bill's picking up on that.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.760
We seem to have a little bit more of an alarm reaction when Microsoft does something than

02:47.760 --> 02:48.960
when Apple does something.

02:48.960 --> 02:49.960
Right.

02:49.960 --> 02:53.120
And kind of the, you know, just how we support things like he quotes you saying that we should

02:53.120 --> 02:56.400
really kind of try to, you know, rather than buy something preloaded with Windows, try

02:56.400 --> 03:01.000
to support folks that are supporting Linux natively on their hardware where possible.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.400
And that's sort of a, you know, just avoid all the Microsoft stuff if you can.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.240
And there's definitely that sentiment out there too.

03:06.240 --> 03:09.980
I think, you know, you have to acknowledge there's a history with Microsoft when it comes

03:09.980 --> 03:16.600
specifically to Linux and free software that has shaded the way people view some of Microsoft's

03:16.600 --> 03:17.680
current actions.

03:17.680 --> 03:26.360
Because in a real way, Microsoft's past sort of modus operandus was embrace and extend.

03:26.360 --> 03:32.120
And so when they came into open source and started participating in a pretty significant

03:32.120 --> 03:36.400
way, it really looked like embrace and extend to a lot of people for a long time.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.400
Yeah.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.400
Yeah.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.400
No, I think that's fair.

03:39.400 --> 03:43.360
So Bill's also kind of wondering, why aren't we more worried about Apple?

03:43.360 --> 03:47.520
And I think this was complicated for a lot of reasons, especially just because this question

03:47.520 --> 03:51.320
keeps changing depending on like what five year period you want to pick here and like

03:51.320 --> 03:54.560
what are the relationships and what are they investing in and how does that work for the

03:54.560 --> 03:55.880
groups we're concerned about.

03:55.880 --> 03:58.800
But Bill's kind of got three main high level reasons.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.520
Apple's hardware is usually pretty darn closed, and they're not so friendly with the open

04:02.520 --> 04:06.980
source efforts to port things onto their systems.

04:06.980 --> 04:11.440
And number two, Apple has not been as friendly to the Linux and FOSS community.

04:11.440 --> 04:14.680
This is another one of those things that has changed, I think, for both Microsoft and Apple

04:14.680 --> 04:16.160
considerably over the years.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.880
But while they have contributed some of the underpinnings, things like cups, stuff like

04:19.880 --> 04:22.560
that, but you don't see a lot of any of their new shiny products.

04:22.560 --> 04:26.800
None of those, there's no Linux version of Messenger or anything like that, right?

04:26.800 --> 04:27.800
Or iMessage.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.800
Yeah.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.620
No, I'd say Apple's contributions are lower level.

04:31.620 --> 04:36.080
They're more like things like WebKit or some of the individual user land tools themselves.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.080
Right.

04:37.080 --> 04:42.560
So if you compare that to like.NET or PowerShell or even just running MS SQL on Linux, VS code.

04:42.560 --> 04:43.560
Sure.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.560
Yeah, absolutely.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.560
Yeah.

04:45.560 --> 04:50.200
And then number three, number three, I think, due to its similar design, macOS can also

04:50.200 --> 04:54.500
attract many target users of desktop Linux.

04:54.500 --> 04:58.500
And this is the one I know has been bugging you in the back of your brain lately, at least

04:58.500 --> 05:00.320
with that shiny new M1 hardware.

05:00.320 --> 05:03.580
Yeah, it's not without some compromise, though, right?

05:03.580 --> 05:07.160
That's where I think Bill and I see things a little differently.

05:07.160 --> 05:12.360
To me, WSL represents a more direct threat to Linux because it's actually the Linux user

05:12.360 --> 05:17.840
environment and you can actually build Linux applications on Windows using WSL and Microsoft

05:17.840 --> 05:23.920
provides tools to allow you to create Linux applications all day long from the Windows

05:23.920 --> 05:24.920
10 desktop.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.960
And they've created documentation around that as well.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.480
And they have developer advocates that are helping people accomplish that.

05:31.480 --> 05:36.000
I mean, it's it's a much more direct assault at what desktop Linux is used for.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.120
And assault is a very extreme term here.

05:38.120 --> 05:42.640
It's really just about enabling their existing users and enterprise customers to create applications

05:42.640 --> 05:43.640
for the Linux platform.

05:43.640 --> 05:48.260
But with Macintosh macOS, it's not like Linux.

05:48.260 --> 05:51.000
It's not as nice to run Docker on there.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.160
It's not as nice to develop Linux applications.

05:53.160 --> 05:57.480
It absolutely can be done, especially when things are, you know, Ruby and Python and

05:57.480 --> 05:58.560
Rust even.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.560
But you know, it's not.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.560
Oh, yeah.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.560
OK.

06:01.560 --> 06:02.560
Thanks, Wes.

06:02.560 --> 06:03.560
Thanks.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.560
Hey, you know, Java runs there, too.

06:04.560 --> 06:05.560
OK.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.360
But it's not the same.

06:08.360 --> 06:10.500
And the Mac environment is more constrained.

06:10.500 --> 06:15.160
You're going to be more dependent on virtualization, especially now on the M1 platform.

06:15.160 --> 06:19.240
So while it is absolutely an appealing platform to a lot of people and they'll be motivated

06:19.240 --> 06:23.680
to make those compromises, it's not, I don't think, a one to one like it is with Windows

06:23.680 --> 06:24.680
and WSL.

06:24.680 --> 06:29.280
And also, you know, there's just the size factor like Microsoft is so dominant.

06:29.280 --> 06:33.480
And I think we talk a lot about Apple, but that's just because it's in our space, right?

06:33.480 --> 06:37.320
It is for people that are have enough money or are willing to spend a lot of their budget

06:37.320 --> 06:41.720
on computing devices or also folks who are maybe developers or sys admins are in this

06:41.720 --> 06:45.600
camp where that's kind of one of the tools of the trade.

06:45.600 --> 06:51.000
But Microsoft is this big enterprise imposed system and they dominated so much of the desktop

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
market.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.440
I do think this has changed in that now Apple controls how much of like the, you know, the

06:55.440 --> 07:00.920
USA phone market with their mobile platform, but the Linux community is much more attached

07:00.920 --> 07:01.920
to the desktop sphere.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.000
So I don't think we're as, I mean, we are threatened by it.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.840
Obviously there's a lot of developments in the Linux phone systems and where you have

07:06.840 --> 07:11.320
complicated feelings about Android, but it hasn't really tainted us in that same way.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.420
Mac sales right now are going crazy for the last three quarters.

07:14.420 --> 07:17.880
And since the M1 was announced, they have just skyrocketed.

07:17.880 --> 07:22.280
And according to Apple in their, according to Tim Cook in their latest quarterly results,

07:22.280 --> 07:25.960
50% of Mac buyers are first time Mac buyers right now.

07:25.960 --> 07:26.960
Oh, interesting.

07:26.960 --> 07:27.960
Yeah.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.360
But they're, they're not going after Linux.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.000
We mean, Apple's really going after windows.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.160
They, they, they're not targeting the Linux desktop where Microsoft kind of is with WSL

07:35.160 --> 07:37.760
and WSLG specifically.

07:37.760 --> 07:43.520
But I do think that we could have a serious reckoning that could come to the Linux community

07:43.520 --> 07:47.840
where we're going to have a bunch of geeks and technical people that have chosen that

07:47.840 --> 07:51.820
platform and they're going to want to participate in the same communities that we participated,

07:51.820 --> 07:56.880
just like we're going to have people who are entering the free software world via the WSL

07:56.880 --> 07:58.640
subsystem lens.

07:58.640 --> 08:03.560
You're going to have people on these M1 and M1X and M2 Macintoshes, and they're going

08:03.560 --> 08:07.040
to want to participate in some of the free software communities that we, we also travel

08:07.040 --> 08:08.040
in.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.040
Yeah.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.220
I mean, in both ways, it's in both contributions and just, you know, folks that are using those

08:12.220 --> 08:15.700
for development, but also in, you see a lot of projects working on support for this new

08:15.700 --> 08:16.700
platform.

08:16.700 --> 08:19.060
And that kind of just shows you that like, okay, we're taking this seriously because

08:19.060 --> 08:20.920
we have a user base that needs us to.

08:20.920 --> 08:25.080
So there you go, Bill, that is kind of why we, we take them both seriously, but the windows

08:25.080 --> 08:30.120
seems to be a little bit more of a probably pressing concern.

08:30.120 --> 08:35.840
And it's mostly just a concern of disincentivizing people to switch to Linux.

08:35.840 --> 08:41.440
However, I've been thinking on this issue a lot and, you know, I think back to the good

08:41.440 --> 08:48.280
old days, pre Ubuntu and I just good old days, loosely pre Ubuntu and what a weird landscape

08:48.280 --> 08:54.480
the Linux desktop was and how in my day job, I was always managing windows systems for

08:54.480 --> 08:57.960
the longest time, but I would still go home at night and play around with Gentoo.

08:57.960 --> 09:04.240
And it truly was a drive for the love of the technology and the thing that it was doing.

09:04.240 --> 09:09.920
And then it then later became about the social message and the community around it.

09:09.920 --> 09:13.620
And so those things are still there today.

09:13.620 --> 09:16.840
And I think they still appealing to people who are on windows and Mac OS that are looking

09:16.840 --> 09:20.040
for something a little more engaging.

09:20.040 --> 09:24.320
And a little more intellectually entertaining because it's, it can be kind of a toy too.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.720
Yeah, that's the for good and bad, right?

09:26.720 --> 09:29.560
Like I think a lot of folks get into points in their career or maybe they have, they have

09:29.560 --> 09:30.560
less free time.

09:30.560 --> 09:34.520
They have a family, they have a really demanding job where they want a platform that just works

09:34.520 --> 09:35.520
for them.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.120
And that's often what you hear from folks that like desktop Linux, but are on the Mac

09:38.120 --> 09:39.400
or windows situation.

09:39.400 --> 09:43.000
I'm not here to argue that desktop Linux can't just work because I think, I think it can,

09:43.000 --> 09:45.560
but it depends on your workflow and what you're comfortable with and where you want to spend

09:45.560 --> 09:46.560
your time.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.640
And the flip side of that is if you just want to have a computer to have fun or you can

09:49.640 --> 09:55.480
mess with anything, change anything, recompile your kernel, change how the software works,

09:55.480 --> 09:56.480
that's the Linux desktop.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.800
And it's pretty darn awesome.

09:57.800 --> 10:01.520
Well, we were having a chat recently, you know, you had a work Mac that you were on

10:01.520 --> 10:06.120
and it's not like you were paying close attention to it because it's not like, it's not your,

10:06.120 --> 10:07.120
not your main machine.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.160
I didn't shell out the several thousand dollars for it.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.160
Yeah.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.600
And you don't really think because when you, so when you don't actively buy this machine,

10:12.600 --> 10:15.400
you don't really kind of, you're not really kind of paying attention to how the culture

10:15.400 --> 10:17.100
of the OS works and all of that.

10:17.100 --> 10:21.280
So you rebooted the other day and then came back to your machine and it was like, well,

10:21.280 --> 10:25.040
I guess I have to burn 30 minutes now because it's just sitting here installing updates.

10:25.040 --> 10:29.840
And you and I then had a conversation from that about how, what appeals to us about using

10:29.840 --> 10:33.440
Linux as a workstation is those kinds of things are under our control.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.440
Right.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.360
It doesn't do a lot without me telling it to do it.

10:36.360 --> 10:42.520
And that means if I need to walk back to that and use it for work during my work day, like

10:42.520 --> 10:44.360
my machines available to me.

10:44.360 --> 10:45.460
That's the difference.

10:45.460 --> 10:48.880
If you were to go, if you were to go out of the computer world and you were to think about

10:48.880 --> 10:55.760
this in terms of tools or vehicles, that's the difference between a work tool and a consumer

10:55.760 --> 10:58.200
tool is those little kinds of control.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.200
Right.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.820
But it also kind of reminds me in some ways of say like owning versus renting a house

11:02.820 --> 11:06.080
is you get the control, but you also become responsible for it.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.080
True.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.600
Like in a way that, I mean, maybe not on the most sort of like well polished LTS desktops

11:10.600 --> 11:13.680
or something, but generally if something breaks, you're going to have to figure it out and

11:13.680 --> 11:15.000
there's not going to be as much support.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.600
That is a great counterpoint to it, but that's, that's the sort of balance that I'm more comfortable

11:19.600 --> 11:20.600
with.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
Yeah.

11:21.600 --> 11:22.600
Yeah, exactly.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.600
And it works for that and it is getting better.

11:23.600 --> 11:27.000
I mean, we should acknowledge that the degree for the things that, which that happens and

11:27.000 --> 11:30.920
how often and how difficult it is to remedy, that definitely improves over the years.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.520
And it seems like it, you know, with things like protons, I, that keeps happening.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.520
True.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.520
True.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.520
All right.

11:37.520 --> 11:38.520
Well, yet Linux writes in with a quickie.

11:38.520 --> 11:42.440
He says, what's your take for both of you on voice controlled digital assistants like

11:42.440 --> 11:44.160
the Echos or the Mycrofts?

11:44.160 --> 11:47.120
Do you use them in your home or the JB one studio?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.120
Curious.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.360
Wes, what's, what's your take on the voice assistants?

11:50.360 --> 11:51.360
Yeah.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.560
I'll leave the studio one to you over there.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.880
Um, yeah, I don't love them.

11:55.880 --> 11:59.520
They're not a huge part of my life, but I do have a pixel as my phone.

11:59.520 --> 12:03.480
So I've already kind of got Google assistant there and I'm, I'm certainly not, not going

12:03.480 --> 12:08.100
to use it to say to, uh, go open VLC, which I did earlier today when I was driving up

12:08.100 --> 12:09.800
to the studio.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.560
At home, I do a lot of things with Chromecast.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.800
So at the moment I do have some Google homes.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.440
I really, I don't use them for a lot of things.

12:16.440 --> 12:21.760
It's mostly for like my media devices, stopping, going back, like it's much easier to ask it

12:21.760 --> 12:25.160
to rewind for two minutes than it is to pull up my phone.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.960
Maybe you have to do the fingerprint thing, open, go back to the app that it was playing

12:27.960 --> 12:28.960
that media in.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.240
And then hopefully it has a decent size scroll bar.

12:31.240 --> 12:35.160
That's actually like, you can actually drag with your thumb decently.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.160
That's so frustrating.

12:36.160 --> 12:39.640
I did used to have one of the Amazon devices up for a while, but at that point, really,

12:39.640 --> 12:42.360
I just used it to play like a live radio stream.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.280
And I, now I just do that on the Chromecast.

12:44.280 --> 12:50.280
So I don't have like this super strong paranoia about these things because I have used them

12:50.280 --> 12:56.320
in the past and I've watched them from a network standpoint and like, you know, is it really,

12:56.320 --> 13:01.420
is it really only communicating when I use the, you know, wake word and besides a few

13:01.420 --> 13:06.000
heartbeat things here and there and like update checks, it basically truly is not transmitting.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Right.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.400
There are other like legitimate ways that they are using and taking and analyzing information

13:10.400 --> 13:12.040
that we're not comfortable with that.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.040
That particular one.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.040
I am not that worried about.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.040
Yeah.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.840
All these companies have all these other ways to mine our lives.

13:16.840 --> 13:19.200
They really don't need to hear me farting in my house.

13:19.200 --> 13:25.800
But so what I have done is I've used the studio as a testing ground and then what kind of

13:25.800 --> 13:30.580
passes my my sniff test then gets graduated to lady jupes.

13:30.580 --> 13:33.320
And that's been true for a lot of smart home technology.

13:33.320 --> 13:39.260
So for a while we had a Siri tube, an echo tube and a Google tube in the studio as I

13:39.260 --> 13:40.260
tested them.

13:40.260 --> 13:41.620
Just try to get an idea.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.920
Is this something we should be following as a network?

13:43.920 --> 13:47.720
Is this something that really is as bad as people say it is and are these something that

13:47.720 --> 13:48.720
provide value?

13:48.720 --> 13:53.200
And then over time I kind of whittled it down and I know this is going to seem like a crazy

13:53.200 --> 13:57.500
take from a Linux guy, but I got to say it really is true.

13:57.500 --> 14:02.960
The one that I find the the most appealing is the Siri one, the Siri tube from Apple.

14:02.960 --> 14:07.560
If you're going to use one of these things now, I'm going to say I'm not saying you should

14:07.560 --> 14:12.020
use one of these things, just making a point that if you are, if you are going to use one

14:12.020 --> 14:17.440
of these things, the Siri tube tries to do everything on your land that it can.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.320
So its first move is LAN.

14:20.320 --> 14:23.060
So if it's smart control, it's a LAN packet.

14:23.060 --> 14:26.520
It's not an API that triggers through a cloud provider.

14:26.520 --> 14:31.520
If it's streaming audio from a mobile device, it's over the LAN.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.840
It's not going through the cloud.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.920
It's interesting how the incentives work there, right?

14:34.920 --> 14:38.400
Like you can imagine being a developer at Google where it's like, well, you're architected

14:38.400 --> 14:40.760
where you just assume you rely so heavily on that.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.300
But I can also imagine on the Apple side, like, well, what's going to, what's going

14:43.300 --> 14:47.020
to do, I mean, even putting aside privacy for a moment, what's going to be the snappiest

14:47.020 --> 14:48.720
behavior for our consumer?

14:48.720 --> 14:49.720
And it's that.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.320
Yeah, that definitely is the fastest in that regard.

14:52.320 --> 14:56.140
But all of them require cloud connectivity for voice recognition.

14:56.140 --> 14:57.140
And that's a bummer.

14:57.140 --> 14:58.140
Right.

14:58.140 --> 14:59.140
That's just no good.

14:59.140 --> 15:03.320
And that's where I am hopeful that maybe something like Mycroft will come along because it is

15:03.320 --> 15:04.680
really nice.

15:04.680 --> 15:09.080
There is functionality when you're coming into a home, your hands are full of groceries.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.080
It's dark.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.080
You need some lights.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.080
It's really nice.

15:12.080 --> 15:17.540
The other thing that I love is I have a different routines for morning and nighttime.

15:17.540 --> 15:22.640
So we say, you know, hey, tube, it's last call.

15:22.640 --> 15:27.480
And when we say it's last call, it triggers a series of scripts that I have on Home Assistant

15:27.480 --> 15:31.120
that trigger sort of a gradual shutdown of the home.

15:31.120 --> 15:34.280
Lights slowly begin to fade out and shut down.

15:34.280 --> 15:38.480
Noisemakers come on, white noisemakers come on, kind of sending a signal that has trained

15:38.480 --> 15:40.480
everyone, including the dog, that it's bedtime.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.480
Beautiful.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.880
And you know, you've got a 20 minute window to go to bed once this process starts.

15:44.880 --> 15:45.880
Brush your teeth.

15:45.880 --> 15:46.880
Yeah.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.780
And then we have a good morning process that sort of reverses that.

15:49.780 --> 15:54.240
And it kind of turns off the noisemakers, turns things on, sort of lights things up,

15:54.240 --> 16:00.160
depending on if the sun has risen or not, and that I like being able to initiate those

16:00.160 --> 16:02.560
things by just invoking it from the air.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.040
Yeah, I really appreciate that.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.880
One thing I don't like about that, relying on the on the voice stuff, which is very handy,

16:07.880 --> 16:12.920
and I think is an interesting phase of technological development to watch and change how we interface

16:12.920 --> 16:15.680
with with computers.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.740
But the downside of having to be these sort of proprietary platforms that I don't have

16:18.740 --> 16:22.720
any insight or control into is often I'll have some like sort of quiet music similar

16:22.720 --> 16:26.400
to you like, you know, bedtime phase kind of cool things down before I get in bed, walk

16:26.400 --> 16:29.620
upstairs and it's nice to just sort of yell at the tube to say like, hey, turn things

16:29.620 --> 16:31.520
off now.

16:31.520 --> 16:35.480
That doesn't work after like midnight recently, it'll even it'll even on my phone, it'll prompt

16:35.480 --> 16:38.480
me with the like, I've recognized you've asked me to do this a lot.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.480
Here's a button you can click.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.900
So you don't even have to talk.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.400
But then it won't do the action.

16:42.400 --> 16:47.040
And it just reminds a good constant reminder of like, okay, you're relying on this, but

16:47.040 --> 16:48.340
don't rely on it too much.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.880
And that's when I go to the open source app that can like turn my TV off and stuff.

16:51.880 --> 16:56.460
I find the Google one when I was testing these pretty regularly did have the most variance

16:56.460 --> 17:00.020
in it would recognize something for a while and then at some point it would just stop

17:00.020 --> 17:01.600
recognizing it.

17:01.600 --> 17:06.500
And the nice thing about the Siri tube, and this is my last time I'll bring this up, is

17:06.500 --> 17:12.960
it talks over home kit directly to home assistant, which is my home automation software.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.800
So it's over the LAN talking to my home assistant.

17:15.800 --> 17:21.860
So anything I make like a button or a script, or like a temperature sensor, anything I put

17:21.860 --> 17:27.280
in home assistant, I can have the tube get or control.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.280
And it's really great.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.840
And I don't have there's no API, Apple's not involved at all.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.400
It's all over my LAN.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.840
I like it a lot like that.

17:33.840 --> 17:37.860
But I think ultimately, I'm really going to be looking for something where I can process

17:37.860 --> 17:41.680
everything 100% on my LAN, including the voice recognition.

17:41.680 --> 17:45.440
And I think that's going to be hopefully my craft, but we shall see.

17:45.440 --> 17:49.400
One of those, like many things in Linux and open source, just sort of wait, check in every

17:49.400 --> 17:52.140
couple of months or years and see where the project's at.

17:52.140 --> 17:56.920
My setup too is a little bit beyond, I'm not trying to brag, I have like all kinds of automation

17:56.920 --> 18:00.920
and pretty much everything is controlled by my home assistant in my home.

18:00.920 --> 18:05.240
So I had to come up with a family friendly interface to that.

18:05.240 --> 18:08.560
I couldn't expect them to open up the home assistant app on their devices all the time.

18:08.560 --> 18:12.240
It's almost like you're into this enough to have a whole show about it.

18:12.240 --> 18:17.680
You want to take our next email from somebody in our back of the woods, right here in Puget

18:17.680 --> 18:18.680
Sound.

18:18.680 --> 18:19.680
Yeah.

18:19.680 --> 18:25.520
I've been obsessing over the idea of solar storms knocking out power grids and decided

18:25.520 --> 18:28.380
to store some hardware just in case.

18:28.380 --> 18:34.920
What would be your ideal setup for running a battery powered LAN, client devices and

18:34.920 --> 18:36.400
media storage?

18:36.400 --> 18:41.440
Well, I think you are pretty well equipped to handle this one there, Mr. Chris.

18:41.440 --> 18:42.840
I mean, that's tricky though.

18:42.840 --> 18:43.840
Like what do you do?

18:43.840 --> 18:47.200
Like how do you, you could really drive yourself crazy worrying about a solar storm.

18:47.200 --> 18:52.200
What's weird about this is I just saw a news article recapping something that happened,

18:52.200 --> 18:54.440
I think in the 1920s or somewhere.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.440
Oh yeah.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.040
The last, the last solar storm.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.040
Yeah.

18:58.040 --> 19:02.240
It was like the telegraphs caught on fire and stuff like equipment actually caught fire.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.240
Yeah.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.180
That's kind of, there's like two parts of this question is like, are you worried about

19:05.180 --> 19:07.040
shielding your existing equipment?

19:07.040 --> 19:10.400
Because then, I mean, you need either a lot of shielding on it or some sort of like Faraday

19:10.400 --> 19:15.440
basement cage set up in your, in your, in your house.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.980
After that, so you've got your equipment to survive.

19:17.980 --> 19:22.240
You know, I, I think what I'm going to, that's my charitable pronunciation.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.240
Whoa, whoa.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.240
Whoa.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.240
Yeah.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.240
It's whoa.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.240
Whoa.

19:27.240 --> 19:31.520
Already has a raspberry PI four set up with sync thing and Samba as well as an Android

19:31.520 --> 19:34.020
device and a raspberry PI 400.

19:34.020 --> 19:37.480
So you know, there's some starts here, but like what are essential services and how do

19:37.480 --> 19:41.160
you, raspberry PI's are probably a good start, but how do you manage whatever power you've

19:41.160 --> 19:42.160
got?

19:42.160 --> 19:47.200
So one thing I've been thinking recently is a couple of lithium ion batteries.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.400
I'd love something like Battle Born batteries.

19:49.400 --> 19:55.080
You can go look those up, but smaller, but something like two Battle Born batteries in

19:55.080 --> 20:02.040
a Pelican case with a raspberry PI, with a switch, with some discs.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.040
Are you following me here?

20:03.040 --> 20:07.040
Like a Pelican case ready to go, like a go case of a battery go box.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.040
Yeah.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.040
Yeah.

20:09.040 --> 20:13.560
You could put a converter in there and maybe like a plug on the outside that was sealed

20:13.560 --> 20:17.360
up with some like sort of grommet that way you could actually charge the batteries too.

20:17.360 --> 20:20.700
This is where I go with something like this and then I'd want something that I could fit

20:20.700 --> 20:23.980
like in the back seat of my car so it can be too big.

20:23.980 --> 20:28.080
And I think all of that would be pretty doable if you're using a raspberry PI because that's,

20:28.080 --> 20:31.940
you know, minimal and you could just stick that to the inside of the, of the Pelican

20:31.940 --> 20:32.940
case.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.160
That'd be awesome.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.260
And I guess what you'd, I mean, you'd have to be relying on something like solar unless

20:37.260 --> 20:39.480
you had access to a hydro or similar.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.480
Yeah.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.200
And you'd also want to have a MiFi with some connectivity.

20:43.200 --> 20:47.800
I'd probably want to go with something like a Ting plan or a Google Fi plan where I could

20:47.800 --> 20:51.800
have data available to me if I needed it, but otherwise wasn't paying a big premium

20:51.800 --> 20:55.480
when I wasn't using it because you're going to need connectivity for sure.

20:55.480 --> 20:59.520
I'd love to hear what the audience, if you guys have any ideas out there, send it into

20:59.520 --> 21:03.080
us because that would be an interesting project just to build something like that, a Linux

21:03.080 --> 21:05.440
powered land that's disaster proof.

21:05.440 --> 21:07.720
Can you get portable Faraday cages?

21:07.720 --> 21:10.520
Cause that'd be even better if you could store it in some kind of Faraday cage.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.520
So it's like,

21:11.520 --> 21:14.680
you can pack it out of there once you need to and set it all up.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.880
Everything's like your real gear might be fried.

21:16.880 --> 21:22.100
Your regular gear is all fried, but your stuff in your Faraday cage is all preserved.

21:22.100 --> 21:25.040
Also Bo said something here that it really kind of touched me.

21:25.040 --> 21:28.080
He said, I just love Linux unplugged.

21:28.080 --> 21:32.240
I got to join the very first show with my baby son sitting on my lap.

21:32.240 --> 21:33.760
He's eight years old now.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.760
What?

21:34.760 --> 21:35.760
Isn't that awesome?

21:35.760 --> 21:36.880
That's so cool.

21:36.880 --> 21:42.040
And I know I sometimes think about our shows in the age of my kids.

21:42.040 --> 21:44.320
It's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty wild.

21:44.320 --> 21:46.700
And yeah, let us know what you think for blow there.

21:46.700 --> 21:50.080
How would you build a land that's ready to go after a solar storm?

21:50.080 --> 21:53.280
And what I'm also kind of curious as a second aspect, like what, what are the essential

21:53.280 --> 21:54.560
services you need on that?

21:54.560 --> 21:58.400
Well, you know, for us, if we were going to do it, it would be like the podcast continuity

21:58.400 --> 21:59.400
box, right?

21:59.400 --> 22:00.400
Oh yeah.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.400
Yeah.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.400
So they should have that.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.400
We should.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.960
We should be able to do it so that it could withstand a solar storm that after the new

22:05.960 --> 22:09.520
society is going to need some content and we might as well get them started with Linux.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.520
Well, they bet the new society better use Linux.

22:11.520 --> 22:12.520
Let's be honest.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.720
Let's not, let's not screw that up and we need to do our part.

22:14.720 --> 22:15.720
All right.

22:15.720 --> 22:21.320
So Joe from Pittsburgh writes and he says, are you guys using Nebula at all in your infrastructure?

22:21.320 --> 22:26.120
I started using it a bit after it was first mentioned on the flat network truthers episode.

22:26.120 --> 22:27.120
And you know what?

22:27.120 --> 22:30.160
I've loved the experience for the most part, a new release came out recently and I submitted

22:30.160 --> 22:33.240
a bug for it and everything seems to be pretty nice for the most part.

22:33.240 --> 22:34.240
Thanks Joe.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.240
That's awkward.

22:35.240 --> 22:40.240
Well, it's a mixed question.

22:40.240 --> 22:43.240
I'm still using it, but I don't think you are.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.880
No, I mean, I really, I really thought I would.

22:46.880 --> 22:50.920
I really thought that's how I was going to solve the carrier grade net thing, but I just

22:50.920 --> 22:55.480
had a little bit of too much trouble with it behind the double grade mutant net.

22:55.480 --> 22:58.540
And so I just kind of threw in the towel and said, you know, I'm just going to wire guard

22:58.540 --> 23:01.480
out and just call it good.

23:01.480 --> 23:06.480
But it has crossed my mind from time to time, especially like some sort of hybrid setup

23:06.480 --> 23:09.920
with like the studio and a couple of rigs up at Leno.

23:09.920 --> 23:10.920
Like that could be really cool.

23:10.920 --> 23:11.920
Yeah.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.600
That's where I think it really makes a lot of sense is if you can just drop it on all

23:14.600 --> 23:16.880
your devices and have it ready to go.

23:16.880 --> 23:22.640
And we do have some wire guards set up specifically, especially for if we're doing like fancy audio

23:22.640 --> 23:25.120
routing network stuff.

23:25.120 --> 23:29.400
But as just another way from a trusted network to get into the studio, Nebula works really

23:29.400 --> 23:31.600
great and I think it is still running on fake news.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.600
Yeah, maybe I should do it again.

23:32.600 --> 23:33.600
I give it a go.

23:33.600 --> 23:37.840
So for people who don't remember, it was a really neat new VPN that kind of branched

23:37.840 --> 23:43.680
out from the Slack folks and it creates a peer to peer VPN mesh network that can create

23:43.680 --> 23:49.200
essentially a flat network across maybe multiple cloud providers or multiple lands of your

23:49.200 --> 23:50.200
own.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.200
Right.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.200
Something that, you know, you can just assume every device is also on this network and it

23:53.200 --> 23:58.320
can bridge through over whatever actual land or coffee shop Wi-Fi it happens to be on.

23:58.320 --> 24:02.280
But it's got some nice sort of modern features where you can have multiple groups and control

24:02.280 --> 24:03.280
access.

24:03.280 --> 24:06.560
So like, oh, I'm a user over here in the staff group, I need to see the front of house servers,

24:06.560 --> 24:09.360
but I really don't need to see the, you know, the backup server over there.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.200
You can handle all that natively, which is nice.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.200
I really appreciate that, actually.

24:13.200 --> 24:17.500
The next one comes in from Clemens and he's asking us a question that I think I know the

24:17.500 --> 24:18.940
answer to.

24:18.940 --> 24:21.140
So let me bounce it off you and see if I got it right.

24:21.140 --> 24:25.400
He's having this problem when he's using his headset during video calls.

24:25.400 --> 24:29.480
It sounds like the crappiest audio ever, you know, like the low quality Bluetooth audio

24:29.480 --> 24:30.900
codec stuff.

24:30.900 --> 24:35.440
And he's wondering what he could do if he could replace his headset or do something

24:35.440 --> 24:37.120
to prevent that from happening.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.000
And you're going to say switch to PipeWire.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
I was going to say switch to PipeWire.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Oh, really?

24:41.000 --> 24:43.240
I thought you were going to pitch your whole don't use Bluetooth at all.

24:43.240 --> 24:44.240
Use my, you know, use right here.

24:44.240 --> 24:47.120
Yeah, that was going to be my, if you said no, Chris, the switch to PipeWire, because

24:47.120 --> 24:48.120
he's on 2004.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.120
He's on Ubuntu 2004.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.120
You can do PipeWire in 2004.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.120
I mean, it's worth a shot.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.120
Yeah, it might be.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.120
Take a backup first.

24:53.120 --> 24:57.760
If you're not comfortable fucking with your sound system.

24:57.760 --> 24:58.760
Who is though?

24:58.760 --> 24:59.760
Like, that's the problem.

24:59.760 --> 25:00.760
Who is?

25:00.760 --> 25:01.760
Nobody is.

25:01.760 --> 25:05.640
You know, like, so my thing is, like, does he risk that?

25:05.640 --> 25:11.080
Or does he just go get the like the Corsair RF headset, which the reason why Wes give

25:11.080 --> 25:12.780
me a hard time is because this is always my answer.

25:12.780 --> 25:15.380
But the thing is, it does just totally bypass Bluetooth.

25:15.380 --> 25:20.400
It's like, you know, those old like self old wireless phones you have around your house,

25:20.400 --> 25:22.480
like 900 megahertz phones or whatever they were.

25:22.480 --> 25:23.480
It's like that.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.480
It's like RF.

25:24.480 --> 25:25.920
It's good old RF.

25:25.920 --> 25:30.800
And what it's RF that goes into a standard USB audio codec that Linux has drivers for

25:30.800 --> 25:33.120
that looks like it's an always there sound card.

25:33.120 --> 25:35.760
And the reason why that matters, and then I'm going to stop talking about it, but the

25:35.760 --> 25:41.240
reason why that matters is if the sound card is persistent, then your video conferencing

25:41.240 --> 25:44.720
software doesn't get confused because the sound devices are changing all the time.

25:44.720 --> 25:46.000
That sound device is always there.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
It's always available.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.680
And then you just turn the physical power on the headset when you actually want it to

25:49.680 --> 25:50.680
work.

25:50.680 --> 25:54.560
And in the case of the Corsairs that I like, you can flip the mic up and it mutes it and

25:54.560 --> 25:56.040
you flip the mic down and it's unmuted.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.040
I like that, too.

25:57.040 --> 26:02.920
Now, you can do some fiddling with pulse audio and Bluetooth, but it's not particularly fun.

26:02.920 --> 26:07.140
And at least according to Neil, sounds like 2004 package version of PipeWire is pretty

26:07.140 --> 26:08.140
darn old.

26:08.140 --> 26:10.960
So if you're going to do that route, you'd probably have to go compile it yourself, which

26:10.960 --> 26:13.300
is a whole other ask.

26:13.300 --> 26:18.240
So if new hardware is in the boat, sounds like that might be the simplest option because

26:18.240 --> 26:24.320
Bluetooth just didn't work out great.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.040
Linode dot com slash unplugged.

26:26.040 --> 26:29.680
Go there to get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit and you go there to support the

26:29.680 --> 26:30.680
show.

26:30.680 --> 26:31.680
I mean, the hundred dollars.

26:31.680 --> 26:32.680
I suppose that's nice.

26:32.680 --> 26:33.680
I suppose.

26:33.680 --> 26:34.680
But I mean, you know, supporting the show.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.680
That's great.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.000
Linode is our hosting provider of choice.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.200
Everything I've built in the last couple of years, I've chose Linode.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.160
And for a bit, I was like Mr. Skeptic Pants.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.160
I really was.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.160
I shopped.

26:45.160 --> 26:48.640
And every single time Linode came up above the rest.

26:48.640 --> 26:53.100
And unlike entry level hosting providers or big cloud over at AWS, they don't try to tie

26:53.100 --> 26:55.040
your hands and lock you down.

26:55.040 --> 26:58.920
Linode gives you tools that are great and they really let you get the most out of their

26:58.920 --> 27:00.280
crazy fast systems.

27:00.280 --> 27:02.920
And when people ask me, Chris, why Linode?

27:02.920 --> 27:08.880
There's so many choices, Chris, I say because it's fast, because they support Linux and

27:08.880 --> 27:11.520
because they've been around since 2003.

27:11.520 --> 27:15.760
They're not some crazy VC funded company that has to go big or go bust.

27:15.760 --> 27:21.960
And they watch this stuff and built accordingly and have focused on that one thing in what

27:21.960 --> 27:26.160
is essentially forever, because like 2003 is basically like forever.

27:26.160 --> 27:30.220
I don't even know how they did it, because in 2003, I was struggling to keep a job because

27:30.220 --> 27:33.560
the dot com boom had gone bust.

27:33.560 --> 27:40.600
And somehow they got rolling and they built out a fantastic network, 11 data centers worldwide,

27:40.600 --> 27:44.640
MVME super fast drives, SSD speeds that are going to, you know what, you go benchmark

27:44.640 --> 27:47.320
them with that $100, you're going to see they're going to blow you away.

27:47.320 --> 27:52.280
And a dashboard for days that's easy to manage and has power options that are just a few

27:52.280 --> 27:53.280
clicks away.

27:53.280 --> 27:57.040
And, you know, Wes is always going on about the fact that Linode has great tutorials so

27:57.040 --> 27:59.960
he can sound really educated by reading everything Linode has written.

27:59.960 --> 28:00.960
I don't have to prepare at all.

28:00.960 --> 28:01.960
No.

28:01.960 --> 28:02.960
I just go check out their articles.

28:02.960 --> 28:03.960
Makes it sound like pros.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.440
How do you think I got a job?

28:06.440 --> 28:08.120
So anyways, go over to Linode and try it out.

28:08.120 --> 28:12.680
You can build yourself a $5 rig or get something just custom to just what your workload is.

28:12.680 --> 28:15.800
Like we we built ourselves something kind of nice for our matrix server.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.040
I'm really proud of it.

28:17.040 --> 28:22.080
And we take advantage of Linode's object storage for our next cloud back end instance and for

28:22.080 --> 28:23.900
our peer to back end instance as well.

28:23.900 --> 28:27.920
It's a great way when you think you're going to have storage that's a little unpredictable.

28:27.920 --> 28:29.960
Object storage can be a fantastic way to run that.

28:29.960 --> 28:35.080
Or if you need a static website for a portfolio or maybe a blog, you want it to look super

28:35.080 --> 28:37.880
pro and fast, go check out what they have to offer.

28:37.880 --> 28:41.080
So get started by going to Linode dot com slash unplugged.

28:41.080 --> 28:44.840
Get that $100 for your new account and try all this stuff out.

28:44.840 --> 28:48.680
There's a lot of ways to host something and a lot of various companies that'll do it for

28:48.680 --> 28:49.680
you.

28:49.680 --> 28:52.800
But none of them, none of them check all the boxes like Linode.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.400
Linode dot com slash unplugged.

28:55.400 --> 28:59.440
Oh, a little housekeeping time.

28:59.440 --> 29:00.740
Great idea.

29:00.740 --> 29:01.840
Great idea.

29:01.840 --> 29:06.480
Did you know that we have the Luplug on Sundays and every now and then this show pops in.

29:06.480 --> 29:08.520
Drink some cider and takes over the place.

29:08.520 --> 29:09.920
Sneaky devils.

29:09.920 --> 29:14.160
The Luplug happens every Sunday over at our mumble room.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.520
It's not a weird thing.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.620
It's not some algo social media hangout site.

29:18.620 --> 29:19.620
It's mumble.

29:19.620 --> 29:21.520
It's free software and it's happening right in our lobby.

29:21.520 --> 29:22.520
So head over there.

29:22.520 --> 29:25.720
You can get info at Linux unplugged dot com slash mumble.

29:25.720 --> 29:32.120
Hey, also little update on the Jupiter broadcasting garage sale while I'm gone, you know, out

29:32.120 --> 29:36.920
hunting, I mean, taking photos of penguins, we're going to get some new items in stock.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.480
Some really cool stuff.

29:38.480 --> 29:44.120
New stuff for the swag bags, going to upgrade the swag bags, get a new new batch of stuff.

29:44.120 --> 29:45.200
Very excited about it.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.640
And I should have proof copies on Monday of what I'm thinking about doing.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.460
And if I like them, I'm going to place the order.

29:50.460 --> 29:54.760
So when we get back from our penguin expedition, we'll have these ready to send out.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.280
So I'll have an update for you on that.

29:57.280 --> 30:01.080
And thank you, everybody, who's grabbed something over there at the Jupiter garage.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.200
Been a huge success.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.900
And it's also been a ton of stuff that we have learned and are still learning.

30:05.900 --> 30:07.960
And I really appreciate you helping us do that.

30:07.960 --> 30:11.480
And that, Wes, is all the cleaning.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.120
So let's get back to the questions.

30:13.120 --> 30:19.720
Eric from San Diego writes, I'm still relatively new to Linux, and I've got several Linux machines

30:19.720 --> 30:26.280
at home, including the ThinkPad, too many Raspberry Pis, amen, Eric, and an old laptop

30:26.280 --> 30:30.360
I brought back from the dead using Lubuntu.

30:30.360 --> 30:36.240
My question is, how does one go about checking the open source code of a program?

30:36.240 --> 30:39.120
Hmm, you want to do a little auditing, hey, Eric?

30:39.120 --> 30:41.920
Well, Wes, you got any tips for him?

30:41.920 --> 30:46.160
Because I'm not sure how to answer this one without saying it depends.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.520
Well, it does depend.

30:47.520 --> 30:51.360
You know, there's a lot of stuff now on GitHub for better or worse, depending on how you

30:51.360 --> 30:55.920
feel about Microsoft and GitHub and large proprietary SaaS platforms.

30:55.920 --> 31:01.320
But it's pretty much a one stop shop for a lot of things open source, even when it's

31:01.320 --> 31:04.120
not the canonical repo where everything's actually developed.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.180
A lot of projects mirror stuff over there.

31:06.180 --> 31:11.160
So it's a good place to get started if you're just looking for general open source stuff.

31:11.160 --> 31:14.820
Now for your particular distro, that's where it also gets more complicated because they've

31:14.820 --> 31:18.240
got their own systems in place, but they definitely have something.

31:18.240 --> 31:23.280
It might not be as discoverable as GitHub is, and it will depend on the distro.

31:23.280 --> 31:27.360
And that's where you might go reach out, go join a, you know, a matrix chat and IRC chat

31:27.360 --> 31:31.020
and ask about the stuff because, you know, you can go download the packages.

31:31.020 --> 31:33.800
But if you want to go find the repo where it's kept, that'll depend.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.400
But there will be people happy to point you in the right direction.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.400
Hmm.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.400
I like where your head's at, Eric.

31:39.400 --> 31:41.600
That's a great, that's a great thing to be thinking about.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.000
And it's something that we don't take as much advantage of as we could.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.520
We like to claim the benefits of it, right?

31:46.520 --> 31:48.380
We love to say that it's open source and all the things.

31:48.380 --> 31:51.720
But how many packages that you install have you actually looked at the code for?

31:51.720 --> 31:53.840
Mm hmm, something about eyeballs.

31:53.840 --> 31:59.820
So our next one comes in from Sint says, Hey, guys, about six or seven years ago, I got

31:59.820 --> 32:02.780
intrigued by Dragonfly's Hammer 2 file system.

32:02.780 --> 32:05.040
At the time, it sounded quite advanced.

32:05.040 --> 32:09.520
However, these days there's ButterFS, which I know you guys talk about, but do you have

32:09.520 --> 32:14.040
any experience with good old Hammer 2 or happen to know if there's any serious contenders

32:14.040 --> 32:15.040
in the future?

32:15.040 --> 32:16.800
Yes, it is Hammer time.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.280
Yes, it is.

32:18.280 --> 32:21.160
No, unfortunately, I mean, I've I've mucked about with it a little bit.

32:21.160 --> 32:25.160
I have not tried the the recent Dragonfly release, which sounds like it has some great

32:25.160 --> 32:30.040
performance improvements, at least according to Michael Airball over at Pheronix.

32:30.040 --> 32:33.480
Now I'm not sure we have anything quite as interesting as Hammer.

32:33.480 --> 32:38.840
The file system on Linux I follow and I'm most excited about is BcashFS, which is slowly

32:38.840 --> 32:39.840
cooking.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.480
We'll get here one of these days.

32:41.480 --> 32:45.640
Yeah, this one's that one's frustrating because it seems like all the major blockers have

32:45.640 --> 32:47.060
been resolved.

32:47.060 --> 32:51.400
But this just not really getting traction and heading towards Linus's tree.

32:51.400 --> 32:55.080
There's just a lot happening and it doesn't seem to be on its way to 5.13 either.

32:55.080 --> 32:58.280
But I agree with Wes BcashFS.

32:58.280 --> 33:04.780
Bill from North Carolina writes in, hey, guys, why are window managers so effing ugly and

33:04.780 --> 33:06.360
difficult to customize?

33:06.360 --> 33:09.160
He's specifically talking about the tiling variety.

33:09.160 --> 33:11.240
I don't know if I agree that they're ugly.

33:11.240 --> 33:15.880
I mean, if you go over to Unix porn on Reddit, it's like nothing but tiling window managers

33:15.880 --> 33:18.440
that admittedly look pretty good.

33:18.440 --> 33:23.680
But I think Bill does have a point here that some of these more advanced desktops, you

33:23.680 --> 33:28.800
could say they lack from a design focus team member or two.

33:28.800 --> 33:29.800
Yes.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.280
Well, it's multifaceted, though, right?

33:32.280 --> 33:36.260
It's partially that, but I think it's also partially sort of a keep it simple, stupid

33:36.260 --> 33:40.760
sort of mentality or a, you know, you are the user, we're empowering you to make these

33:40.760 --> 33:44.520
choices and we're not even going to bother with making a nice default config because

33:44.520 --> 33:47.640
we think you're just going to configure it yourself anyway and figure out what looks

33:47.640 --> 33:48.700
good to you.

33:48.700 --> 33:51.520
And that doesn't really work well for most people.

33:51.520 --> 33:56.720
But if you are compiling yourself a tiling window manager, maybe that's what you want.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.860
It's almost like sort of, you know, setting up an Emacs config versus these days they

33:59.860 --> 34:03.520
have some nicer distributions like Space Max or something that's doing that for you and

34:03.520 --> 34:04.920
hiding some of those details.

34:04.920 --> 34:08.840
But that's also maybe why we were so excited about some of the work that Pop was doing

34:08.840 --> 34:12.360
on their tiling extension, because it was kind of marrying those two worlds of like,

34:12.360 --> 34:14.920
we get some of the features without all the work.

34:14.920 --> 34:15.920
Yep, absolutely.

34:15.920 --> 34:20.520
And I think it does come down to maybe finding the right distro that stages the desktop environment

34:20.520 --> 34:21.640
the way you like.

34:21.640 --> 34:22.640
And there's a lot of choice out there.

34:22.640 --> 34:26.760
Hey, just a quick real time update from Sami Ken in the chat room regarding the Bluetooth

34:26.760 --> 34:28.800
headset issue.

34:28.800 --> 34:32.680
That's that profile step down thing, that lower audio quality codec that it does.

34:32.680 --> 34:36.400
I haven't tried this, but Ken says that if you disable the headset microphone in your

34:36.400 --> 34:38.960
OS and use an external one, it will sound a lot better.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.120
So you have to disable any other microphones.

34:41.120 --> 34:44.460
I don't I think what you have there is just pulse audio.

34:44.460 --> 34:48.960
That version of pulse audio steps down to a lower 80 Bluetooth audio quality.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.520
I think it's just a thing.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.880
It's been a thing for a little bit.

34:52.880 --> 34:55.240
NorCal Geek Dad writes in from Northern California.

34:55.240 --> 34:58.600
He says, I've got kids and I've got a gaming related question.

34:58.600 --> 35:02.280
My kids, my nine year old son in particular, have discovered Steam.

35:02.280 --> 35:03.600
Nice, nice man.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.600
That's great.

35:04.600 --> 35:09.200
He says, so far I've been able to keep them happy with my ThinkPad T430 running Steam

35:09.200 --> 35:13.120
on OpenSUSE.

35:13.120 --> 35:17.680
He goes on to say they play Portal and other games that are just totally fine on the integrated

35:17.680 --> 35:18.680
graphics.

35:18.680 --> 35:25.120
However, some of the games my son wants to play are only available on Windows.

35:25.120 --> 35:26.200
I have a dual Xeon server.

35:26.200 --> 35:30.960
I could put some more RAM in and then maybe pop in a decent video card and install Windows

35:30.960 --> 35:32.560
and do the Steam link thing.

35:32.560 --> 35:36.300
The containers it's running now could easily be put on a VPS so that really wouldn't be

35:36.300 --> 35:37.880
a big loss.

35:37.880 --> 35:44.120
Or I suppose I could option two, format the T430, install Windows and then let them use

35:44.120 --> 35:45.120
that.

35:45.120 --> 35:48.320
Get myself a newer or older ThinkPad for a daily driver.

35:48.320 --> 35:51.560
Or maybe even go the VM with PCIe pass-through route.

35:51.560 --> 35:54.360
What do you guys think would be the easiest, the cheapest or the best?

35:54.360 --> 35:58.120
Thanks, Matt from Northern California.

35:58.120 --> 36:01.880
The easiest is going to just be putting Windows on there.

36:01.880 --> 36:05.080
If you don't have time and you don't want to mess around with dealing with, I don't

36:05.080 --> 36:09.800
know, networked Windows installs or complicated pass-through, that's the simplest.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.960
Is it the most fun or most satisfying?

36:11.960 --> 36:12.960
No.

36:12.960 --> 36:18.040
I don't even know if it truly is the most simplest long-term because my big fear has

36:18.040 --> 36:22.160
been if my kids ever ended up on Windows, they would download like some Minecraft mod

36:22.160 --> 36:26.200
that was totally malware and mess up their Windows box and then I'd be right back in

36:26.200 --> 36:30.680
the bad old days of IT support cleaning up my kids' computers with malware and I was

36:30.680 --> 36:37.600
thinking maybe that wasn't such a big deal until my cousin's daughter downloaded what

36:37.600 --> 36:42.760
she thought was a newer version of like Fortnite or something like that, like an update, and

36:42.760 --> 36:44.960
totally trashed her Windows box.

36:44.960 --> 36:50.080
I guess you have a good point here, which is you're the family admin anyway, so minimize

36:50.080 --> 36:51.280
your own pain.

36:51.280 --> 36:56.160
I know what route I have been considering going, Matt, and that is just building my

36:56.160 --> 37:00.880
own Steam streaming setup in my land with the Steam link, and then the nice thing about

37:00.880 --> 37:04.560
that is there's a bunch of other ways you can get that Steam streaming with either the

37:04.560 --> 37:08.560
Steam client itself or Moonlight.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.420
On a Raspberry Pi, you could make it a Steam link, essentially, or if you have the physical

37:12.420 --> 37:16.680
Steam link controller, like it sounds like you do, you could do it that way, and it just

37:16.680 --> 37:19.560
means that you're done with the upgrade game.

37:19.560 --> 37:24.120
You upgrade one machine from that point on, and then you stream those Windows games to

37:24.120 --> 37:28.160
all of the other computers or even TVs, and you don't ever really have to worry about

37:28.160 --> 37:32.120
it, because it'll be an ongoing maintenance issue any other way as far as I see it, because

37:32.120 --> 37:36.880
a VM with PCI passthrough works until you do a distro upgrade or something, and then

37:36.880 --> 37:41.880
it's going to break, and there is nothing more fricking frustrating than when you finally

37:41.880 --> 37:46.400
get a moment to sit down and play a game with the kids, and you have to play tech support

37:46.400 --> 37:47.400
instead.

37:47.400 --> 37:50.680
The other option you could go, it would be even easier, would be something like Nvidia

37:50.680 --> 37:55.120
GeForce Now streaming, which streams Windows Steam games to Linux using Chrome.

37:55.120 --> 37:59.320
That would be an option, but I think you'd be a lot happier with just Steam link over

37:59.320 --> 38:00.320
the LAN.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.240
That'd be the way I'd go about it.

38:02.240 --> 38:09.520
Plasma Man from Iowa writes in, I've heard a lot of great career advice on this show,

38:09.520 --> 38:11.800
and I've got a sensitive question.

38:11.800 --> 38:17.440
If a person has average intelligence, drive to learn a new career path, and five plus

38:17.440 --> 38:23.860
years of general IT experience, but it's non-Linux, where do they stand to be up to

38:23.860 --> 38:27.960
speed as a Linux server administrator?

38:27.960 --> 38:31.960
A working adult, say, willing to put in one to two hours a night into learning Linux from

38:31.960 --> 38:34.200
online courses or similar.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.080
And this is where Plasma Man has a lot of humility, and I think that goes a long way,

38:37.080 --> 38:41.860
and we'll get into that, but I would not want to apply out and struggle not knowing enough,

38:41.860 --> 38:45.600
or worse, be dismissed because I thought I knew enough.

38:45.600 --> 38:50.000
How do you gauge if you're ready to present yourself as a person that can hit the ground

38:50.000 --> 38:52.800
running, administrating Linux systems?

38:52.800 --> 38:57.760
Well, Plasma Man, I can tell you that if I were interviewing you and we had had a conversation

38:57.760 --> 39:01.360
of the similar nature, what I would have gotten from you is that, like Wes said, you have

39:01.360 --> 39:06.720
a little humility towards this, and you also have a willing to learn and research attitude,

39:06.720 --> 39:10.160
which would be probably the number one thing that I'd be taking from the interview, and

39:10.160 --> 39:11.160
I think that's a positive.

39:11.160 --> 39:12.160
Yeah.

39:12.160 --> 39:16.280
And other than that, you mentioned online courses, but just playing around.

39:16.280 --> 39:20.080
Don't pretend to have done things that you haven't, but be honest about the experiences

39:20.080 --> 39:22.760
you have because there's a lot that's going to be portable, right?

39:22.760 --> 39:26.980
A huge percentage of IT stuff is just troubleshooting, and troubleshooting is troubleshooting.

39:26.980 --> 39:29.960
If you've got a good scientific approach, you know how to debug things and figure out

39:29.960 --> 39:35.220
where in the system stuff is breaking or you need to make a change, that is hugely valuable,

39:35.220 --> 39:39.440
and you can learn the details of how to look up stuff in a man page or what the flags are.

39:39.440 --> 39:40.440
Yep.

39:40.440 --> 39:44.520
I didn't say it during the Linode read, but it is true.

39:44.520 --> 39:49.280
You really could take that $100 credit the show has and use it to build something and

39:49.280 --> 39:50.280
learn something.

39:50.280 --> 39:54.120
It really is the best way to learn something like that is by doing.

39:54.120 --> 39:57.520
And so we have, you know, that's why Cloud Guru is also a sponsor, and they have a bunch

39:57.520 --> 40:00.320
of labs that can teach you there, and I think combining those two things could be really

40:00.320 --> 40:05.440
useful too, and it's not an accident that there's sponsors on this show.

40:05.440 --> 40:08.440
It's pretty much wise because people like you are looking to get into the field.

40:08.440 --> 40:12.480
Casey, in the IRC, it makes a really good point that, you know, part of this is you

40:12.480 --> 40:15.720
got to be able to sell what you're doing and talk about things, and a good way to practice

40:15.720 --> 40:19.680
that is sharing what you're doing, whether maybe that's on a blog or on your GitHub page

40:19.680 --> 40:25.280
or maybe you join some local Linux users groups or some online groups and, you know, be excited

40:25.280 --> 40:26.280
about this stuff.

40:26.280 --> 40:30.400
If you are, like, that's valuable too, just being able to share that, share some projects

40:30.400 --> 40:34.000
that you've done, contribute to open source with some documentation maybe, or just share

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
your neat homelabs.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
How about this?

40:36.000 --> 40:40.680
Get a blog, get a web server up and going, get a blog software package on there, and

40:40.680 --> 40:44.400
then start writing about what you're doing, and then include that in your resume.

40:44.400 --> 40:48.160
That's real experience, and I think if you have a few years, he says he has five plus

40:48.160 --> 40:55.200
years of IT experience, that is, a lot of that is a way of thinking, a way of communicating

40:55.200 --> 41:01.560
with end users, a way of researching and learning, a lot of that stuff is universal, man, and

41:01.560 --> 41:04.880
it's going to work regardless of the OS, and when you get on the other end of it, you'll

41:04.880 --> 41:09.920
realize how true that is, and kind of how trivial the OS actually is in the grand scheme

41:09.920 --> 41:14.080
of things, as long as you have those core skill sets, and then, yeah, it really comes

41:14.080 --> 41:18.640
down to how you communicate it, how you sell yourself, and how confident you are, you know,

41:18.640 --> 41:22.600
because that confidence, that confidence does kind of come through during those conversations,

41:22.600 --> 41:27.360
and in there, I'm also going to link in the show notes to a recruiter post.

41:27.360 --> 41:31.600
She wrote this up recently, but she was a recruiter for like nine years, and now she

41:31.600 --> 41:37.560
works for Microsoft, and it's a decent list of advice, it's like a, it's a top seven kind

41:37.560 --> 41:42.520
of list, but it's like an actually good list, so I'll include that in the show notes, that

41:42.520 --> 41:47.720
might help narrow it down too, but it is a, it's a question we get in all the time to

41:47.720 --> 41:51.920
code a radio as well, people that want to get into the development world, and a lot

41:51.920 --> 41:56.600
of times it's like, well, this is a great chance for free software, like find a project

41:56.600 --> 42:02.200
that needs somebody to do a little development for them, find a project, in the case of our

42:02.200 --> 42:06.180
of our writer here, find a project that could use a little infrastructure help.

42:06.180 --> 42:09.760
There's a lot of them, you know, a lot of them are just doing the infrastructure themselves

42:09.760 --> 42:12.300
because there's nobody else out there to do it.

42:12.300 --> 42:16.080
It can be a touchy thing, because you don't want to come across sounding like you're being

42:16.080 --> 42:20.160
judgmental about the state of their infrastructure, you know, you don't want to pop in the IRC

42:20.160 --> 42:23.800
and be like, hey, who's in charge of the server here, because this is set up wrong, when was

42:23.800 --> 42:28.840
the last time you did a release, come on, that will get you nowhere real quick.

42:28.840 --> 42:34.760
But if there, if there was, you know, a hypothetical community that maybe you could become a member

42:34.760 --> 42:41.700
of and help identify infrastructure that they need, web presence, or maintaining a back

42:41.700 --> 42:46.720
end repository or a mirror or something like that, that you could provide, that gives you

42:46.720 --> 42:53.440
an opportunity to, it's, it's, it's not no stakes, but it's not extremely high stakes.

42:53.440 --> 42:57.040
But it's enough that you're going to take it seriously, and you're going to learn and

42:57.040 --> 43:00.360
you're going to be put in positions where you have to adapt.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.200
And I mean, yeah, you got to do it for free.

43:02.200 --> 43:05.640
But man, think about that in the cost and value of training.

43:05.640 --> 43:07.480
It's really kind of invaluable.

43:07.480 --> 43:11.240
And in the modern day, we don't have a lot of apprenticeships and things like that.

43:11.240 --> 43:15.940
It's, but that is a, you can think of it in sort of similar terms.

43:15.940 --> 43:19.480
In a way, it's an apprenticeship for you to learn how to manage an infrastructure for

43:19.480 --> 43:25.640
something that's getting public use, and has some requirements around its availability,

43:25.640 --> 43:28.080
which is going to force you to learn and adapt.

43:28.080 --> 43:32.640
And the project also benefits from having somebody who's dedicated to helping them out

43:32.640 --> 43:33.640
a little bit.

43:33.640 --> 43:35.000
And so it's a win for the project.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
And it's a win for you.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.600
And even though you're not going to walk away a millionaire from doing it, you're going

43:38.600 --> 43:42.080
to walk away more confident, and you're going to be able to speak more clearly.

43:42.080 --> 43:45.260
And you're gonna be able to speak about these things in simple terms that demonstrate you

43:45.260 --> 43:46.260
understand them.

43:46.260 --> 43:47.260
Right.

43:47.260 --> 43:49.440
And just having been through some of those fires, right, having to figure out like, well,

43:49.440 --> 43:51.520
this wasn't ideal, and it kind of sucked.

43:51.520 --> 43:52.520
But we got through it.

43:52.520 --> 43:55.680
And here's how we dealt with it and made compromises because I mean, that's all that goes on in

43:55.680 --> 43:56.680
a business anyway.

43:56.680 --> 43:57.680
Right?

43:57.680 --> 43:58.680
Like, you got to make it work.

43:58.680 --> 43:59.680
It's never perfect.

43:59.680 --> 44:00.680
But if you get through it, that's valuable.

44:00.680 --> 44:03.720
Neil, do you have anything to add to what Wes and I have listed off?

44:03.720 --> 44:08.440
Yeah, actually, like one of the ways that I kind of got started doing all the, you know,

44:08.440 --> 44:13.400
infrared type stuff, like, you know, my I'm professionally a senior DevOps engineer, and

44:13.400 --> 44:18.800
I work on, you know, maintaining infrastructure for software delivery pipelines and stuff

44:18.800 --> 44:22.920
that my employer Datto and kind of the way I got started doing all this stuff was actually

44:22.920 --> 44:27.320
working in open source projects doing this kind of infrastructure work.

44:27.320 --> 44:33.720
So you know, and I can say that today, like the Fedora infrastructure team in the Fedora

44:33.720 --> 44:39.040
project actually has an awesome apprenticeship program for being able to get started with

44:39.040 --> 44:43.560
learning these kinds of things, working with things like OpenShift, Ansible, you know,

44:43.560 --> 44:49.480
all the all the modern technology that you tend to see in a in a real business environment.

44:49.480 --> 44:53.180
And same goes on the openSUSE side, they've got the openSUSE heroes team, which works

44:53.180 --> 44:58.720
with virtual machines uses salt, and works with a wide variety of different technologies

44:58.720 --> 45:02.140
and different stacks to be like, it's a very common thing.

45:02.140 --> 45:07.040
And like, as a real systems administrator, you wind up working with a lot of crazy things

45:07.040 --> 45:09.180
and having to work a lot of different technologies.

45:09.180 --> 45:14.440
And in in large open source Linux distribution projects, you wind up in the same boat.

45:14.440 --> 45:18.980
And they're great ways to like, get some hands on, get some experience, work with people

45:18.980 --> 45:24.900
who kind of know this stuff, and like build that intuition up that helps you be successful

45:24.900 --> 45:26.180
doing it professionally.

45:26.180 --> 45:31.100
So I absolutely would recommend, you know, if you want to get started with this, if you're

45:31.100 --> 45:36.740
a Fedora user, all the better, like check out Fedora's infrastructure team, and hang

45:36.740 --> 45:39.380
out with them and see, you know, how you can get started there.

45:39.380 --> 45:42.380
Or if you're an openSUSE user, do the same with the openSUSE heroes.

45:42.380 --> 45:45.940
Yeah, there's probably if you think about the projects and software you use, there's

45:45.940 --> 45:48.380
probably something out there that speaks to you.

45:48.380 --> 45:52.140
Casey, I know this kind of touches on an experience that you've had.

45:52.140 --> 45:58.100
Yeah, I got my dream job just, you know, being out there in a community I was I was commenting

45:58.100 --> 46:02.180
in a blog post for a software engineering group.

46:02.180 --> 46:07.420
And just like professionals consume the same things that you're excited to, and participating

46:07.420 --> 46:14.340
in it is a huge way to be able to point to on your resume, hey, you know, I'm already

46:14.340 --> 46:17.500
thinking about this stuff a lot, I'll be thinking about it just as much when I'm working for

46:17.500 --> 46:18.500
you.

46:18.500 --> 46:21.420
It'll also help teach you some of the jargon I expect, you know, like learn how do the

46:21.420 --> 46:25.100
people in the industry refer to these things, and you'll kind of learn some of the things

46:25.100 --> 46:27.420
of like, what do they expect on the job?

46:27.420 --> 46:30.580
And what can I go learn ahead of time to make sure that I at least have a little of the

46:30.580 --> 46:39.420
context mail route.net slash Linux try out mail route today and get 10% off the lifetime

46:39.420 --> 46:43.580
of your account and start with a 30 day free trial, no credit card required to see it really

46:43.580 --> 46:44.860
works great.

46:44.860 --> 46:48.580
And part of the reason, maybe not just part, but a big part of the reason is they've been

46:48.580 --> 46:52.580
around for 24 years, and they have focused on their core competency.

46:52.580 --> 46:57.440
And I think you guys know something about me, there's a theme, I like independent companies

46:57.440 --> 47:02.360
that focus on something for a long time and try to make it real good.

47:02.360 --> 47:03.960
That's definitely mail route.

47:03.960 --> 47:08.840
And you can get started at mail route.net slash Linux, you know, really, the core value

47:08.840 --> 47:12.100
of mail route goes beyond just removing spam and viruses.

47:12.100 --> 47:15.860
But really, it helps you prevent downtime.

47:15.860 --> 47:20.340
And it helps with compliance to the downtime part is essential.

47:20.340 --> 47:23.380
We knew we wanted to use that for our mail server, we wanted something where if we want

47:23.380 --> 47:26.600
to take it down and upgrade it, we don't lose out on email.

47:26.600 --> 47:29.860
mail route will automatically queue it up for us and we can go in and we can have it

47:29.860 --> 47:32.960
keep it up to 15 days or whatever you tell but like by default, it's gonna keep it up

47:32.960 --> 47:34.180
to 15 days.

47:34.180 --> 47:37.940
And then when your mail server comes online, it just just forwards it right along like

47:37.940 --> 47:39.440
it was like it was never gone.

47:39.440 --> 47:43.260
Just Oh, mail starts coming in your inbox like you were never offline.

47:43.260 --> 47:44.940
It's brilliant.

47:44.940 --> 47:46.460
I love that about it.

47:46.460 --> 47:51.460
And if you want to host somewhere where maybe you have an issue with the IP, or you have

47:51.460 --> 47:55.340
to work with a different port, mail route is flexible there as well.

47:55.340 --> 47:57.700
And getting set up is so simple.

47:57.700 --> 48:02.300
If you're on Office 365, if you're on Google Apps, it's all one click, which seems like

48:02.300 --> 48:04.260
some kind of magic.

48:04.260 --> 48:05.260
But it works.

48:05.260 --> 48:06.840
And it works really well.

48:06.840 --> 48:11.260
You get security, you get speed, you get uptime, and you get a streamlined workflow along with

48:11.260 --> 48:13.880
real time logs.

48:13.880 --> 48:16.620
mail route is email magic.

48:16.620 --> 48:20.100
They are one of the first to really build in this kind of email filtering service back

48:20.100 --> 48:25.940
in 1997. that's so awesome.

48:25.940 --> 48:29.480
That's basically as long as I've been using Linux mail route has been around.

48:29.480 --> 48:30.480
That's amazing.

48:30.480 --> 48:31.480
Wow.

48:31.480 --> 48:33.960
They have an API that you can integrate with as well.

48:33.960 --> 48:38.340
If you like to do some automated tasks and build up your infrastructure through code,

48:38.340 --> 48:40.180
somebody tells me that's a great idea.

48:40.180 --> 48:44.700
And of course, I love the real time log searching when we were setting up our email server.

48:44.700 --> 48:47.900
And the fact that that downtime prevention is there is just really nice.

48:47.900 --> 48:50.780
It gives me the confidence to put this thing into production.

48:50.780 --> 48:51.940
So go try it out.

48:51.940 --> 48:56.260
Get 10% off the lifetime of your account and start with a 30 day free trial by visiting

48:56.260 --> 49:05.980
mail route.net slash Linux go there to protect your business mail route makes email better.

49:05.980 --> 49:09.860
Now we have our last batch of questions we're going to get to this episode we have more

49:09.860 --> 49:12.780
we'll try to do in the future, but we just have this last batch.

49:12.780 --> 49:14.260
Oh, here's a good one.

49:14.260 --> 49:20.180
Bill from somewhere on the eastern seaboard writes, I would love to hear the story behind

49:20.180 --> 49:24.380
the intro music of the various current JB podcasts.

49:24.380 --> 49:25.820
Oh, yeah.

49:25.820 --> 49:26.820
Okay.

49:26.820 --> 49:28.520
The story of the song.

49:28.520 --> 49:31.980
If Chris can remember, yeah, it has been a long time.

49:31.980 --> 49:37.100
So the thing that always felt off about a lot of podcasts was the music like the music

49:37.100 --> 49:40.060
was never great because of all the licensing issues, right?

49:40.060 --> 49:43.680
You can't use the music you want because you can't afford it right unless you want to be

49:43.680 --> 49:45.140
dedicated only on Spotify.

49:45.140 --> 49:48.380
Now, if you do that, they'll let you play any music you want, but I don't think that's

49:48.380 --> 49:50.180
going to happen.

49:50.180 --> 49:55.800
So you know, I wanted something in the thing to guys you gotta you gotta know is you gotta

49:55.800 --> 50:00.660
appreciate the fact that a long time ago, podcasts have like long intros when the show

50:00.660 --> 50:04.380
first started, like we had a really long intro and that was normal.

50:04.380 --> 50:08.420
And then we realized, hey, dummy, somebody's gonna listen to 100 of these, they're gonna

50:08.420 --> 50:13.660
get a little sick of waiting a minute for the show to start the same music every time.

50:13.660 --> 50:19.660
So we shorten it and shorten it and the music is less less in the show now, but it used

50:19.660 --> 50:20.980
to be in there for a much longer.

50:20.980 --> 50:22.940
So I wanted it to sound damn good.

50:22.940 --> 50:27.760
And I just knew I was going to need something that was better than the rest.

50:27.760 --> 50:36.580
And so I came across Ronald Jenkes and he had this song that helped my son fall asleep.

50:36.580 --> 50:41.540
He was just a little baby boy and he had an upset tummy most nights and he'd be swaddled

50:41.540 --> 50:47.260
while I was editing and I needed music I could play on a loop that he would fall asleep to.

50:47.260 --> 50:51.100
But you know, it wasn't it wasn't boring, it just had to be something for he loved it

50:51.100 --> 50:53.300
and he so put it relaxed him.

50:53.300 --> 50:57.740
And it was the it was Ronald Jenkes outer space song, which is great.

50:57.740 --> 50:59.780
And I still love it to this day.

50:59.780 --> 51:04.020
And so I contacted Ronald and I said, Hey, man, you know, I just love your music.

51:04.020 --> 51:06.160
I'm doing these podcasts here.

51:06.160 --> 51:09.780
What would you think about me using some of your songs?

51:09.780 --> 51:12.860
And he said, Hey, man, I listened to your shows.

51:12.860 --> 51:14.400
I love your shows.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.620
How about I license my music to you?

51:16.620 --> 51:18.340
And I'm like, that would be great.

51:18.340 --> 51:20.860
And so we've had access.

51:20.860 --> 51:26.920
And I really, I really just so grateful we have that we have that access licensed access

51:26.920 --> 51:29.180
to Ronald Jenkes music for years.

51:29.180 --> 51:32.980
And all of the songs all of our shows are just standard tracks of his on his albums

51:32.980 --> 51:35.140
that you can go buy and download and listen.

51:35.140 --> 51:38.980
And you can search for him on your streaming service of choice as well.

51:38.980 --> 51:43.180
And so we picked different parts of the songs that we think make great intros and outros.

51:43.180 --> 51:45.260
And we have used them across a lot of our shows over the years.

51:45.260 --> 51:47.180
Yeah, they get like crunched down or remixed.

51:47.180 --> 51:50.700
I mean, Joe did some nice work on the current variant for this show.

51:50.700 --> 51:51.700
Yep, yep.

51:51.700 --> 51:55.580
We've tweaked it a little bit here and there and made it you know, a little shorter or

51:55.580 --> 51:57.460
taken out just a part of a song.

51:57.460 --> 52:01.860
And so what's neat about that is a lot of our shows actually have much longer versions

52:01.860 --> 52:02.860
of the intro.

52:02.860 --> 52:06.380
So if you really were into the song, you can actually go find like a three minute version

52:06.380 --> 52:07.380
of it.

52:07.380 --> 52:08.380
And they're amazing.

52:08.380 --> 52:09.940
He's done incredible work.

52:09.940 --> 52:15.040
And you can find some video of his on YouTube and the man it's like watching commander data

52:15.040 --> 52:17.740
in Star Trek work the L cars interface.

52:17.740 --> 52:22.380
He just Ronald Jenkes just flies across the keyboard like you just wouldn't even so that's

52:22.380 --> 52:23.500
pretty neat.

52:23.500 --> 52:27.880
And I am forever grateful for him for him letting us use his music.

52:27.880 --> 52:30.620
Will writes in with a second question over there on the eastern seaboard.

52:30.620 --> 52:33.500
He says what is your Linux origin story?

52:33.500 --> 52:34.500
All right.

52:34.500 --> 52:35.540
Well, I I went online.

52:35.540 --> 52:36.980
So what's your Linux origin story with

52:36.980 --> 52:38.700
Linux origin story?

52:38.700 --> 52:41.500
Yeah, when did you start using Linux?

52:41.500 --> 52:42.500
You know, I'm not okay.

52:42.500 --> 52:46.340
It must have been it was probably about 2005.

52:46.340 --> 52:47.340
I think.

52:47.340 --> 52:48.340
All right.

52:48.340 --> 52:49.340
All right.

52:49.340 --> 52:50.340
Do you remember what brought you over?

52:50.340 --> 52:52.660
It was actually that there was Linux at my high school.

52:52.660 --> 52:53.660
Oh, cool.

52:53.660 --> 52:54.660
Yeah.

52:54.660 --> 52:55.660
This will date me terribly.

52:55.660 --> 52:57.020
But for some reason they were it was already installed.

52:57.020 --> 53:02.460
It was it was like, can home to I think they were running Debian.

53:02.460 --> 53:03.460
Yeah.

53:03.460 --> 53:05.020
That sounds like a typical school setup.

53:05.020 --> 53:06.020
Yeah.

53:06.020 --> 53:07.020
It was kind of great.

53:07.020 --> 53:08.020
None.

53:08.020 --> 53:09.020
None of the students really paid attention.

53:09.020 --> 53:12.800
We're all just playing risk online in the library instead of doing any kind of research.

53:12.800 --> 53:16.500
But they had these like nice computer labs doled out with Linux was I'm sure was much

53:16.500 --> 53:21.380
cheaper for them and actually an active IT staff, which I did not take advantage of.

53:21.380 --> 53:25.100
I didn't really get interested in the computer science until a little bit later.

53:25.100 --> 53:29.040
But I remember having used GCC to compile something but like left it running on the

53:29.040 --> 53:30.740
network with the network mount.

53:30.740 --> 53:34.460
And then someone pulling me out of class later being like, hey, what's going on?

53:34.460 --> 53:36.260
What are you doing here?

53:36.260 --> 53:38.940
So clearly they had people that cared and, you know, like we're really taking care of

53:38.940 --> 53:40.780
these systems, which was which was pretty neat.

53:40.780 --> 53:44.400
And so that got me to install some, you know, a version of Debian at home and then later

53:44.400 --> 53:46.700
Ubuntu and start playing it with it from there.

53:46.700 --> 53:49.580
And I was interested in it really since then.

53:49.580 --> 53:52.620
And at college, of course, I pretty much just ditched Windows.

53:52.620 --> 53:53.620
That's great.

53:53.620 --> 53:54.620
I love I love that.

53:54.620 --> 53:57.380
I played a lot of old Quake, like Quake one.

53:57.380 --> 53:58.380
Yeah.

53:58.380 --> 53:59.380
Yeah, that was good.

53:59.380 --> 54:01.260
That was good times.

54:01.260 --> 54:06.580
The stupidest thing I ever did, I can't believe I did it now, but the absolute dumbest thing

54:06.580 --> 54:12.580
I ever did was I hung a modem off of my desk because I was I was the computer kid that

54:12.580 --> 54:15.460
had his own dedicated computer in the computer lab in the back.

54:15.460 --> 54:20.380
I was that kid because I had kind of put one together based on fixing all the other computers.

54:20.380 --> 54:26.060
And the dumbest thing I did is I hung a modem off there to create my own ISP, which not

54:26.060 --> 54:30.340
only it sucked because because of the way the school's phone system worked, I couldn't

54:30.340 --> 54:31.860
get a 56K connection.

54:31.860 --> 54:35.340
So I was I could only get like thirty three six.

54:35.340 --> 54:38.500
So just like thirty three K. But it was my own ISP.

54:38.500 --> 54:39.500
Right.

54:39.500 --> 54:44.940
But of course, now looking back, I just created a back door because they had a T1, which was

54:44.940 --> 54:46.160
a big deal back then.

54:46.160 --> 54:47.560
That's what I wanted access to.

54:47.560 --> 54:50.900
And so I would queue things to download on my computer there and then transfer them over

54:50.900 --> 54:51.900
my modem.

54:51.900 --> 54:52.900
Brilliant.

54:52.900 --> 54:53.900
Oh, my gosh, Wes.

54:53.900 --> 54:58.400
You know, it's ironic is I'm essentially doing the equivalent today in Lady Dupes over cellular

54:58.400 --> 55:00.300
connections transferring from the studio.

55:00.300 --> 55:05.620
So there's that my origin story is long and I think I want to do an interview with it

55:05.620 --> 55:12.020
because it involves a leak of a series of Red Hat this from a Microsoft employee.

55:12.020 --> 55:15.580
Well, sounds like many might have an origin story to take your place.

55:15.580 --> 55:16.580
All right.

55:16.580 --> 55:17.580
I love that.

55:17.580 --> 55:18.580
Minimac, what's your Linux origin story?

55:18.580 --> 55:21.480
I became bored of windows.

55:21.480 --> 55:22.480
That's it.

55:22.480 --> 55:29.180
And all of a sudden I was in a store and I saw a box with, say, six point one.

55:29.180 --> 55:32.060
Oh, that was like nineteen ninety nine, I think.

55:32.060 --> 55:37.620
I loved those those multifold boxes that had all the discs in the sleeves and artwork inside.

55:37.620 --> 55:38.860
You could expand it out.

55:38.860 --> 55:44.980
You had like seven disc and like a four hundred page booklet with it.

55:44.980 --> 55:47.280
And then I bought that one.

55:47.280 --> 55:51.580
So that came with KDE and GNOME one point zero.

55:51.580 --> 55:57.500
And you had that x eighty six config where you had to configure everything from the mouse

55:57.500 --> 55:58.500
to everything.

55:58.500 --> 56:01.820
You even had to configure the printer.

56:01.820 --> 56:03.380
But that was my first experience.

56:03.380 --> 56:07.100
I love that classic version where you have all those discs and you had to swap the disc

56:07.100 --> 56:08.380
during the installation.

56:08.380 --> 56:09.460
I still have that one.

56:09.460 --> 56:10.460
It's lying.

56:10.460 --> 56:11.900
Yeah, it's lying around here.

56:11.900 --> 56:17.340
And then I used it like I had like some kind of server where I started playing around with

56:17.340 --> 56:22.060
it and then like two or three years later, I switched completely to Linux.

56:22.060 --> 56:24.540
That was like two thousand and one, two thousand and two.

56:24.540 --> 56:29.220
I'll tell you this, my like core origin story with Linux, because it is quite the interesting

56:29.220 --> 56:31.660
story, I didn't even really appreciate it until I was reminded of it a little while

56:31.660 --> 56:32.660
ago.

56:32.660 --> 56:33.660
I thought, you know, we should tell it sometime.

56:33.660 --> 56:39.220
But the thing that the thing that I the moment I remember, I remember the moment I fell in

56:39.220 --> 56:41.820
love, the moment I fell in love with Linux.

56:41.820 --> 56:45.580
I could really tell it was different and I could really tell it was more powerful when

56:45.580 --> 56:47.120
I deleted my own file system.

56:47.120 --> 56:48.380
And I mentioned this on the show before.

56:48.380 --> 56:54.700
It's the moment the moment I did a classic rookie mistake way back in the day of deleting

56:54.700 --> 56:58.740
my root file system with RM, which was easier back then.

56:58.740 --> 57:03.580
And then that I didn't realize it had happened for about 40 seconds.

57:03.580 --> 57:05.940
So I deleted my file system.

57:05.940 --> 57:09.580
And then the thing that made me really, truly, truly fall in love is that not only could

57:09.580 --> 57:14.200
I delete my file system, but I kept using my active applications for like almost a minute

57:14.200 --> 57:15.580
before I ran into a problem.

57:15.580 --> 57:16.580
It's fine.

57:16.580 --> 57:17.580
It's all in memory.

57:17.580 --> 57:23.060
And I sat there and went, wow, this son of a bitch just let me delete myself and it didn't

57:23.060 --> 57:24.580
even stop me.

57:24.580 --> 57:26.780
Windows would never do that.

57:26.780 --> 57:27.780
This is amazing.

57:27.780 --> 57:28.780
All right.

57:28.780 --> 57:31.180
So there we went on way too long.

57:31.180 --> 57:32.740
What's our what's our next email, Mr. Payne?

57:32.740 --> 57:34.580
Yeah, that was a little bit too much fun.

57:34.580 --> 57:37.660
Let's take things a bit more serious.

57:37.660 --> 57:42.860
Daniel from Ohio writes in, how's your health going, Chris?

57:42.860 --> 57:47.220
I know you've complained about RSI in the past and mentioned it on the show.

57:47.220 --> 57:50.220
And of course, there was that time that you had to go to the hospital.

57:50.220 --> 57:53.860
I just wish the best for you, the team and your family.

57:53.860 --> 57:54.860
Oh, thank you.

57:54.860 --> 57:58.020
Yeah, that trip to the hospital, that was crazy.

57:58.020 --> 58:02.620
That was really wild that I still have a big old scar from that.

58:02.620 --> 58:05.380
My appendix, it ruptured.

58:05.380 --> 58:14.540
And the thing about that is I have a hard time taking time off because it's really hard

58:14.540 --> 58:17.500
from a lot of reasons when you run a small business to take time off.

58:17.500 --> 58:22.580
And so I was I was right in the middle of preparing the public announcement that Linux

58:22.580 --> 58:25.720
Academy acquired Jupiter Broadcasting, just a little busy.

58:25.720 --> 58:28.060
We had a live stream with a public date.

58:28.060 --> 58:29.520
Everything was locked in and set.

58:29.520 --> 58:32.740
People were flying into Texas for the announcement.

58:32.740 --> 58:37.320
I just not proceeding was literally not an option.

58:37.320 --> 58:40.660
And you can imagine this was something that was multiple months in the works.

58:40.660 --> 58:46.500
And so I attended a fair and I ate a hot dog and I thought, oh, I got food poisoning is

58:46.500 --> 58:47.500
what I thought.

58:47.500 --> 58:49.940
I kept rationalizing that I had food poisoning.

58:49.940 --> 58:53.800
And so as I got progressively sicker to the point where I couldn't keep any food down

58:53.800 --> 58:59.420
for about three weeks, I figured, well, it's probably time to go in and see a doctor.

58:59.420 --> 59:03.020
It was probably about two weeks past time to go see a doctor in retrospect.

59:03.020 --> 59:06.900
But then that's that's the point is I thought I just had food poisoning and it happened

59:06.900 --> 59:09.300
before I had rough food poisoning before.

59:09.300 --> 59:12.680
So I go in, the doctor says, no, you definitely had an infection.

59:12.680 --> 59:16.220
But good news is it looks like things are on the mend.

59:16.220 --> 59:18.740
You're good to go for travel to Texas.

59:18.740 --> 59:19.980
I say, thanks, doctor.

59:19.980 --> 59:20.980
I've never met before.

59:20.980 --> 59:23.640
I'm going to go to Texas.

59:23.640 --> 59:28.700
So I fly down for the announcement and I fly down the Thursday before the Tuesday we were

59:28.700 --> 59:30.460
going to make the announcement.

59:30.460 --> 59:31.660
And I'm not doing real well.

59:31.660 --> 59:35.260
I'm not feeling so I go into Linux Academy's office for like a few hours and then I figured

59:35.260 --> 59:37.200
maybe I should go home and sleep it off.

59:37.200 --> 59:42.260
So I go back and I grab myself a beer and I drink a beer and I chat.

59:42.260 --> 59:45.380
I make nice with the with the bartender for about a half hour.

59:45.380 --> 59:50.940
And then I go up to my office, I go up to my room and I just crash and wake up the next

59:50.940 --> 59:52.480
day and I feel real bad.

59:52.480 --> 59:54.700
And I think, oh, man, that beer really screwed me up.

59:54.700 --> 59:57.100
I shouldn't have had that beer.

59:57.100 --> 01:00:03.360
Well, it turns out I was not able to make it out of my bed that day because my appendix

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.700
had ruptured and then all of the crap in there had eaten away over the about a three week

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:12.800
period at the muscles that connected my my like hip muscles to like my bones.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:18.540
And so I had lost functionality of my leg and couldn't get out of bed and thought maybe

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:22.740
what I should do to kind of fix this is maybe I should just sleep a little bit.

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:26.460
So I thought, I'll just sleep it off and then I'll wake up on Monday and I'll be good to

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.460
go.

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.460
And then Tuesday we'll make the announcement.

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:29.460
Everything's going to be fine.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.180
I just need a little more sleep.

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:34.900
And my wife thought, well, I'll fly down and surprise him with a nice romantic weekend

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.940
because, you know, we're about to make this big public announcement.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.140
I'll take him out because he's just been down there working.

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:41.060
He's got no nothing to do.

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:45.820
She flies down and finds me in this totally incapacitated state and is like, are you kidding

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:46.820
me?

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:47.820
We're taking you to the hospital right now.

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:49.100
I'm like, poor idea.

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.420
I get into the hospital and of course they won't let me leave because they've taken me

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:53.760
into emergency surgery.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.660
They tell me it's going to be two little incisions.

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:56.940
We're going to get that appendix out of there.

01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:58.740
You're going to be fine, Mr. Fisher.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:04.300
I wake up and I have an incision from my crotch to my chest that they had to cut me open and

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:08.740
splay me way open and go in there and clean everything out, carve out a bunch of stuff.

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:16.620
And I have this ginormous incision that took five to six months to heal with daily care

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:17.620
and maintenance.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.460
It was awful.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.900
And thankfully during all of that I had health coverage because, you know, I was part of

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:25.340
Linux Academy and they had a really good health plan.

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:31.180
And so they covered the $200,000 bill that was to have all that happen.

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:36.820
I think I ended up paying maybe seven grand total out of pocket.

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:37.820
Wow.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.820
Yeah.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:41.180
And that was thankfully just because some of the stuff that, you know, I just had a

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.500
few things that are out of network and stuff that I had to cover.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.340
So you know, other, so from there my health has gotten much better.

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:48.740
It's gotten much better.

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:55.260
I I've gained more weight over the COVID lockdown than I'd like, except for one.

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.260
Yeah.

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:59.560
But I'm working on that and we're about to take a little time, you know, to go penguin

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.560
hunt.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.900
I mean take pictures of penguins.

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:03.940
So we're getting out there, going to get some air.

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.940
Yeah.

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.940
You know, just a high fat diet.

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:06.940
It's going to be great.

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:07.940
All right.

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:10.660
Well, let's, let's take things lighter again.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:13.700
What's the deal with so many new domains for everything?

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:14.700
Yeah.

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:15.700
Yeah.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:16.900
It's jupytergarage.com.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.780
We've got asklup.com.

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:20.660
This anonymous writer?

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:21.660
Yeah.

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:22.660
Anonymous wrote in, I guess.

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:23.660
Yeah.

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:28.180
I have only a few domains and it feels like that's too many to juggle.

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:29.180
I mean, yeah.

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.180
I feel you there Anon.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:33.500
I mean, how many name chibi reminder emails do I need?

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.500
Boy, yeah.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.020
Thankfully that kind of stuff is a business expense.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.280
It's a legitimate expense for the business.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.420
So why so many domains?

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:43.800
Sometimes I get a domain just because it's like, it feels like getting a little piece

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.020
of real estate, but honestly it's so that way it's easy to communicate with you guys

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:50.500
and it's easy to remember.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.340
It's just simpler if I say asklup.com, right?

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:58.260
It's just easier to communicate and you're listening and I need to say something that

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.580
you'll remember when you get back to your desk or whatever.

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.020
So a domain is often the way to do that.

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:07.940
I just saw an email come in reminding me of a prank domain that I have.

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:08.940
What was it?

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:09.940
What was it?

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:10.940
You don't want to say?

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.060
No, I'm not going to say because it's not relevant to the show.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:17.940
It's just an amusing thing between friends, but I have several of those.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:20.340
It must be really good if you don't want to say it on air.

01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:23.780
I have an embarrassing one, but you might know what it is, but I have an embarrassing

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:24.780
one I'll admit to.

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:25.780
Oh yeah?

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.780
But you got to admit to yours.

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.780
Is it active?

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:29.780
Will it lead people somewhere?

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:30.780
Is that why you don't want to say it?

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:31.780
Yeah, I know.

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:32.780
Okay.

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:33.780
All right.

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:34.780
Okay.

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:35.780
I have a second one.

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:36.780
Okay.

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:37.780
Yeah.

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:38.780
What is it?

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:39.780
Turdkey.com.

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:40.780
That's good.

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:41.780
Here's the idea, right?

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:47.700
It's a lot of, you go to Airbnb's or similar setups, you've rented some place and it's

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:52.100
not great, but you don't want to ruin your account over there by leaving a bunch of negative

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:54.460
comments and getting negative comments back.

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:58.780
Head on over to turdkey.com, leave your stinker right there.

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:00.260
That's great.

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.260
That's great.

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.260
Mine is not nearly as funny.

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:06.780
I mean, I do have some really crazy ones because I actually think the crazier ones are easy

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:07.780
to remember.

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:08.780
Yeah, that's fair.

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.940
So if I can drop a.ninja or something in there, I'm doing it.

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.940
The pizza.

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:13.940
Yeah.

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:18.740
I'm fond of star trek.sexy because I always thought it would be like a great domain to

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:22.700
take advantage of is something about star trek.sexy and I feel like it's going to be

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:24.320
more valuable as time goes on.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.500
So that's mine.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.500
Yeah.

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.500
It is too many domains.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.340
You are absolutely right about that.

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:34.260
Jared from Memphis writes in, love you guys, but I have no sense of your tastes outside

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:36.580
of this wonderful free software world.

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:38.860
Would you name a favorite film, movie or book?

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:42.300
Well, I think we just got insight into you, Wes.

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:43.300
Sure did.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:44.300
Hmm.

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:47.420
I mean, I talk about Star Trek all the time.

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:48.420
We both do.

01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:52.740
I just got done watching The Expanse.

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:56.060
That is such a great world builder sci-fi series.

01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:00.740
And then when you get hooked and you want more, they have books that give you an even

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:04.860
expanded version of the universe, which I think is very complimentary to actually watch

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.700
the TV show first and then listen to the books.

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.580
I'm onto the second book now.

01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:10.380
I've really been enjoying The Expanse.

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:15.100
It's complex, detailed, well thought out sci-fi.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:21.980
And just recently there is like an astronomer or a physics expert that watches and reacts

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:26.600
to The Expanse and she was very impressed by the way they handle low gravity situations

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.600
and whatnot.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.600
What about you?

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:29.600
Got anything?

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:30.600
Yeah.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.700
I mean, there's like probably too many things.

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:37.200
I do think The Expanse is just fascinating from a sci-fi enjoyment perspective.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:42.060
Another sci-fi I've liked lately has been the Culture series by Ian Banks, which I just

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:46.340
find fascinating and a lot of fun to read and is really sad that he's passed because

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:49.500
I would love more of those books.

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:54.580
I also just like totally unrelated to anything here, I really enjoy jazz.

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:58.180
That's one thing, jazz, classical music, and really all music on the side.

01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:03.220
I don't know if I have a favorite, but there is a particular jazz station here in the Pacific

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:07.020
Northwest KNKX that I listen to and they just really crush it.

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.340
Yeah, they are pros.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.940
I think also you guys know me for loving the road trips.

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:16.300
I've got three kids and so we love going on little trips and doing stuff like that.

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:20.420
So there's those elements of life.

01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:24.060
I spent a little bit of time and I've just recently picked back up getting into drone

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.060
videography, which I really liked.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:27.060
Oh, great.

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.060
Yeah, it's so fun.

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:31.060
It's so nice to get up there and get those high perspective views and really get a sense

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:32.660
of where you're at when you're traveling.

01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:35.820
So thanks for asking, Jared, we appreciate it.

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:38.220
And the last one comes in from PyCrash.

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:39.220
That's right.

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:44.060
What do you like most about being an independent network?

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.600
Well that worked out really well.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.380
So we got a bunch of emails in and we got to this is essentially the halfway mark right

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.380
here.

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:51.380
And so that's a great one to end on.

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:54.540
So PyCrash asked what we like most, huh?

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.780
You have an answer?

01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:56.780
Before I get into it?

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:57.780
Because I know I have one.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:01.740
But I'm curious from your perspective, what's the best thing now about JB being independent?

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:04.380
Oh boy, that's a good question.

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:07.060
Because in some ways it's been a lot more work.

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:09.660
So from a work standpoint, it's kind of been harder.

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:10.660
Right.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.420
And there's more constraints in different ways.

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.420
Yeah.

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:16.900
There's different concepts and constraints for sure.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:17.900
But in other ways.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:18.900
Oh yeah.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:19.900
No, in other ways it's great.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:23.100
I mean, I think it's just the focus is nice.

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:27.700
It's JB can just be about the show content.

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:32.580
Like when you're part of a company, and this is true for my day job, there's just a lot

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:39.820
of compromises and other things, housekeeping, if you will, that you have to deal with.

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:45.500
And that was certainly true in the previous JB era, for better or worse, at different

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:46.500
times.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.500
Right.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.500
Like that just changed with how the organization was.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.060
It's a whole team that you have to update.

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:51.060
Yeah.

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:52.060
I think about LAN.

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:55.860
In the small tweaks we've been making since you joined me on LAN, kind of like little

01:07:55.860 --> 01:08:00.000
tiny of adjustments here and there, or we try, like right now we're kind of experimenting

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.820
with kind of quickly going through some stories that you should know about, but don't require

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:08.220
a lot of discussion and then leaving time at the end of the episode to really kind of

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:10.260
just go deep into something.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:15.140
That's a change you and I just made in the last few weeks, just on our own, didn't really

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:19.180
like talk about it first, like in a team meeting and then kind of, you know, give an outline

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.420
of how it would work and like we just did it.

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:22.420
Yeah.

01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:24.820
Before there was a lot of process, which was often very supportive.

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:25.820
Yeah.

01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:26.820
It was good and bad.

01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:31.420
But now there's a lot of freedom to just sort of tweak it as needs right in the moment.

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:32.420
Yeah.

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:40.180
I think it's like, and sometimes with some types of media that's good and bad, like with

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:46.420
LAN, Linux action news, it's good because you kind of, you need to every now and then

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:51.500
be willing to reformulate when the news presents a curve ball that week.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:57.260
Sometimes there's just a mix of stories where a standard approach doesn't work and you got

01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:58.620
to go, how can we adapt?

01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:02.020
And having the ability to say, as we're both sitting right there at the mic, how do we

01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.180
adapt to this right then and there?

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.180
That's really nice.

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:08.260
And so it means that we don't have quite the support.

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:12.660
It means that Wes and I are spending more time on a Sunday making that happen instead

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:16.980
of just hitting record, doing our bit and then walking away.

01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:24.780
But independent means really for me that content is our core product.

01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:28.860
So when you're part of a larger organization, you have more money, you have more support,

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:33.920
you have access to more resources and you have access to people who have maybe managed

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:37.860
other projects and can give you guidance to manage a project that you want to do right

01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:39.460
now.

01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:45.420
But there is one sort of truth that is unavoidable.

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:51.820
And that is the job of making content for a large organization is almost never the core

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:54.740
focus of the organization.

01:09:54.740 --> 01:10:00.060
The organization makes its money selling a widget or a service and the content maybe

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:04.760
is part of the sales funnel to drive people to the service or the widget.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:09.820
But the business does not breathe, live, eat and die on the content alone.

01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:16.680
And unless the business is wholly dependent, its success is absolutely dependent on the

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.820
quality of its content.

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:24.180
Unless the business must survive by its content, the content will always suffer because it

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.260
is not the top priority.

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:28.120
It's just human nature.

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.540
It's just how you organize things.

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:32.140
It's not, it's not malicious.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:33.140
It's just what it is.

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:40.980
And content has to be the main focus of everyone's efforts if the content is going to be competitive

01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:41.980
and high quality.

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:42.980
Yeah.

01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:45.460
But what about quarterly returns and those OKRs you were working on?

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:46.460
Right.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:50.100
And there are places for that, especially when you're trying to build other kinds of

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.620
products.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:57.860
But when the product you're trying to build is media and content, it needs to be the,

01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:02.220
it needs to be the thing that determines if the business is successful or not.

01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:06.300
Otherwise the content will never be as good as it has to be.

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:10.200
And it requires just absolute focus like that.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:16.740
That means so for now that we're independent, there is only one job, really, and it's make

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:18.080
good shows.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:23.200
There is a ton of stuff that you guys would never even believe we'd have to do and spend

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.620
time managing in service of that goal.

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:32.060
But the company, the business has a singular goal and its content.

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:37.220
And the reason why I emphasize that is because, well, how many businesses can you name that

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:40.900
have a singular focus, a singular goal?

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:42.900
Some but they're probably smaller ones, right?

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:46.100
When you start thinking about bigger companies, all of a sudden they only got like maybe three

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.400
goals or they got like a dozen goals, right?

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:53.100
You need one goal when you're making content and that needs to be good content.

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:59.100
You need to have laser focus and I think the only way to do that is to be independent right

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.100
now.

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:02.300
I don't know if it's always, I think it's probably the only way to ever do it, but maybe

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.300
I'm wrong.

01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:07.740
But right now it seems the only way to accomplish that is to live and die on the content.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:12.940
So the business has to be at a scale where that's conceivable and that means being independent.

01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:14.940
Then that's just the realities of the business.

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:18.980
I think there's also an element that you just like being your own boss.

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:23.460
All right, I got a pick just for you, Wes.

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.460
What for me?

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:27.420
It's a little behind the scenes explainer here.

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:30.540
I should have, I should have got the rap option.

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:35.860
Whenever Wes and I need to transfer a file across the land, Wes just wants to use Netcat.

01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:36.860
That's all that's wants to you.

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:40.060
I was going to say sorry, but I'm not sorry.

01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:43.740
So check out termbin.com.

01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:50.260
It is a terminal pastebin and this is a great way because you can actually get information

01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:53.380
in and out of this using Netcat.

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:56.980
There's a couple of different ways you can use Netcat to actually get stuff up here.

01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:00.100
And I just thought this was perfect for you because it's one more way to take advantage

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:02.780
of software you already have installed on your machine.

01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:05.180
Oh, it's even used port 9999.

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.180
That's one of my favorites.

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:07.700
I know it is.

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:08.700
It is.

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:10.780
That is always, that's always the one you use.

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:12.220
So I just thought that was perfect for you.

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:16.820
So it's at termbin.com and it's, it's actually pretty neat.

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:19.700
It's pretty slick and it's very simple to use to move stuff around.

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.660
I'm using it right now.

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:22.780
There you go.

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:25.860
Also thank you to our members at unpluggedcore.com.

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:28.080
You know, you get a special thank you.

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:33.860
Every week we release two versions of the show just for you, a completely, totally inclusive

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:38.100
version of the recording that is every time I mess up or the pre and post show that doesn't

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:39.380
get recorded.

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:40.380
All of that's in there.

01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:41.380
It's a stream capture.

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:42.820
So you get the full experience.

01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:43.820
But you know what?

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:45.060
Maybe you want something tighter, shorter.

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:46.380
You got limited time.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:49.700
We also have the limited ad feed available to our members.

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.040
Two choices for you.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.040
And thank you for being a member.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.540
It keeps us independent, helps reduce the ad load needed.

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:59.800
And then from time to time you get extra little perks like discounts on the garage sale at

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:02.260
unpluggedcore.com.

01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:05.980
If you do the Twitter thing, you can follow the show at linuxunplugged.com.

01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:10.700
Wes is over there at Wes Bain and I'm at Chris LAS and the whole network for like news and

01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:14.700
stream information and log information at Jupiter signal.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:20.380
And then there's a whole network of fantastic shows over at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:24.160
And I'm going to just specifically, well, you know, really you can go to radio, self-hosted

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.160
Linux action news.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.960
They are all such great companion shows to Linux Unplugged.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:34.820
Maybe save yourself some time, get the all shows feed, pro move, pro move, or really

01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:36.620
get the fire hose and join us live.

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:38.340
See you next week.

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.780
Same bad time, same bad station.

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:41.860
Join us on a Tuesday.

01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:46.580
We're typically live unless we're out hunting, taking photos of penguins and there's a calendar

01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:47.580
for that.

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:48.580
Yep.

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:51.220
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar links to everything we talked about today, how to

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.820
contact us, the mumble, the matrix info, all of it.

01:14:54.820 --> 01:15:00.660
What we've done is we've got a crack team to put it all together at linuxunplugged.com.

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:04.700
Now it's a team of 15 at a cost of a hundred thousand dollars each.

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:05.700
So it's a great expense.

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:10.260
In fact, we're millions of dollars in the hole, but we have linuxunplugged.com for you,

01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:11.760
just for you.

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:12.760
Thanks so much for joining us.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.760
That might not be true.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:14.940
In fact, none of that may be true.

01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:15.940
Go there, won't you?

01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:16.940
Find out.

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:17.940
Thanks so much for joining us.

01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:44.180
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:15:47.940 --> 01:16:01.620
Oh, I can't wait to see Drew.

01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:07.240
We are thinking about going to Colorado in August, and if we do that, we'll have a meetup

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:08.240
while we're out there.

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:13.260
So we can do so safely, which I think we'll probably be able to, and I am so looking forward

01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:14.260
to it.

01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:15.260
Oh man.

01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:16.260
Really just.

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:17.260
It's going to be good.

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:18.260
It really is.

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:19.980
It's going to be, it's going to be so great to see them.

01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:24.980
And the other thing I'd love to do while we're in Denver is I'd love to sneak over to the

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:28.860
system 76 factory and see them put together one of those new launch keyboards since we've

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:29.860
been there.

01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:32.780
I, you know, they, they gotta have the launch keyboard like all like, right?

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:35.660
I mean, they could go in there and probably see everything, take a few pictures, have

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:39.620
some secrets, maybe sneak a keyboard or two in our vests because I think I'll still be

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:40.620
rocking the vest.

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:41.620
Let's be honest.

01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:47.740
I'm only wearing some extra vests just to fit the keyboards.
