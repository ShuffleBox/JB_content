00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,180
A really big happy birthday to VLC, the Videolan, champion of open source, reached 20 years

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,180
old.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,100
That's really all we have to say.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,820
Happy birthday to VLC.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:25,300
The project was released to the world on February 1st, 2001, and I've had that traffic cone

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,860
on my desktop ever since.

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,920
And sometimes it's Christmas and it gets a cute little hat.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,920
I do love that.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,920
I do love that.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,000
So really, we're kind of laughing and joking, but we have a lot of appreciation for good

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,720
old VLC.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,040
Hello friends and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,040
My name is Chris.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,040
My name is Wes.

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,720
Hello, Wes.

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,000
Thanks for bringing in the slow cooker to the studio today.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,380
That's going to be delicious.

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,760
And this episode is brought to you by the all new, a cloud guru, the leader in learning

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,660
for cloud Linux and other modern tech skills, hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on

20
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,580
labs, get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru.com.

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:15,860
So here we are gathered together today on episode 391, and we have some really interesting

22
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,980
big community news that actually impacts our local community as well this week that we're

23
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,580
going to get into.

24
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:28,920
And then later in the show, we've spent some time on Gnome Shell 40, and there is a lot

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,480
to talk about here.

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,100
And maybe something you should be aware of, especially if you're a multi-monitor user,

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,480
we're going to get into that a little bit into the show.

28
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,760
We got some pics, we got some feedback, but we really do have some great community news

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
to get through.

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,400
So I want to start by saying holler over at our virtual log, time appropriate greetings

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
mumble room.

32
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Hello Chris.

33
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Hello.

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Howdy.

35
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Hello.

36
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:58,380
So last week we recorded early, and we still showed up and hung out live on the stream,

37
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,100
and that's up on our PeerTube instance over at Jupiter.Tube.

38
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,960
If you want to see that, I don't know, I'm just experimenting.

39
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,880
And people still show up, even if we're pre-recorded, they don't know, they still show up.

40
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,280
So we figured we'll be there.

41
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,820
And we just did a little hangout, it was great, and that's up on Jupiter.Tube if you'd like

42
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,820
to see it.

43
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,800
So let's get into changes coming to Ubuntu, and some of them are quite significant.

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,380
We'll start though with the refreshed Ubuntu installer.

45
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,560
It's a new installer, and it's looking quite different than what we're familiar with.

46
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,760
With the key takeaway being that it's built with Flutter.

47
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,200
That is of course a project that Google works on, and Canonical and Google work together

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,600
to bring Flutter to the Linux desktop as a snap.

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,720
Wimpey writes on the development discourse that the development process for the new desktop

50
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,400
installer is being led by the Canonical design team and the Ubuntu desktop team.

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,480
Both teams have a wealth of experience navigating the challenges presented when installing a

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,600
modern operating system.

53
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,080
Don't worry though, the Ubiquiti installer will remain available in the Ubuntu archive

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,400
for official flavors, remixes, or derivatives to continue using in their images.

55
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,440
You don't have to change just right now.

56
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,640
These timing couldn't be better because in the chat room right now returning to the show

57
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,000
is Mr. Martin Wimperis.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hello, Wimpey.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hello, how are you?

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hello.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,400
So we have lots to talk about today, but why don't we start with this one?

62
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,120
This seems like a big endeavor that the project's starting with, and I would imagine hoping

63
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,760
to land before the next LTS.

64
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,640
Yeah, that's the plan to land this in time for 2204, and in fact, land it in time for

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
2110.

66
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:44,320
For people that like to be on the cutting edge and something you can tinker with later

67
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,560
in this 2104 cycle.

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,940
Now is the intention that essentially main Ubuntu desktop will use this and then flavors

69
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,680
like Ubuntu mate will use the traditional Ubiquiti installer?

70
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,040
Yeah, I mean, we're not going to force people over to a new installer all at once, but we're

71
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,960
definitely going to give them the opportunity to use the new stuff and get involved in that.

72
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,680
Okay, so if they want to, they can, but the old one is essentially available.

73
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,080
There's been thought to that in the development, or there will be anyway, to support all these

74
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
other users.

75
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,560
Indeed, and that initial announcement is not just sort of outlining broadly our intentions,

76
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,920
but also a call for what's your feedback, how do you want to get involved?

77
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,480
So if I'm an Ubuntu user, I should expect to see this not in this next release, but

78
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,920
the one in October, the first version of this?

79
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Correct.

80
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,360
We didn't just want to like throw it over the wall, you know, in a release.

81
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,520
We wanted the opportunity for the community to get involved in a conversation and make

82
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,100
sure that all of that's accounted for early on.

83
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,320
What are your thoughts around the selection of Flutter?

84
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,960
Well, I mean, it's no secret that we've been working with Google to enable Flutter for

85
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,440
the Linux desktop, and we're not doing that for no good reason.

86
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,200
You know, we're doing it for several reasons.

87
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,080
One is it's the fastest growing developer community right now, and there's lots of momentum

88
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,280
and interesting applications being developed in Flutter, and we want to invite those developers

89
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,680
and software vendors to bring their applications to the Linux desktop.

90
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,280
So that's sort of mission one, and mission two is we have a host of interesting projects

91
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,400
that we want to work on internally, and they're not just for the desktop, but the desktop

92
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
as well.

93
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,120
We wanted to pick something that could, you know, cover all of those bases.

94
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,600
Yeah, it seems like there's a lot of the advantages that, and I hate to even associate this word

95
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,160
with it, but go with it for a second, a lot of advantages that you get by using Electron,

96
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,160
but without the downsides.

97
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,920
It's a native application that's produced, it's built in support for GTK3, so it's going

98
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,840
to look and act and run like a Linux app.

99
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,400
Yeah, I mean, Flutter applications, regardless which platform you're running them on, you

100
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,000
know, whether it's a mobile device or Mac OS desktop or Windows desktop, they are highly

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,480
optimized native applications.

102
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,880
So it's not a tool like Electron.

103
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,980
They are optimized OpenGL, optimized 3D accelerated apps.

104
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,240
It's interesting, just some of your comments there, it almost makes it sound like some

105
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,960
of this work is a kind of dogfooding, you know, develop more in Flutter from Canonical

106
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
directly.

107
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,960
And that just sort of smooths out the issues for other folks that want to use Flutter on

108
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
the platform.

109
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,440
Yeah, and there are other projects at Canonical that are using Flutter that, you know, you

110
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,880
won't have seen yet, but you will do in due course.

111
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
Ah, very good.

112
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,000
And then do you have any details on this repair function that it looks like the screenshots

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,400
are showing for the new installer?

114
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,760
Well, I don't have any hard details about how it's going to work, but the fact that

115
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,840
that icon is presented, there is no accident.

116
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,160
That seems like I can just, I don't know, the possibilities there seem like there is

117
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,840
something that could be developed over time, but like a good one.

118
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,080
Like that's a great, that's going to be a great option for end users.

119
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,320
Well, you know, if you've used things like Chrome OS, it has a power wash feature, for

120
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
example.

121
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,920
So it would encompass things like that, you know, that you don't have to go back to the

122
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,520
very beginning with a stick in something on a USB flash drive in order to sort of do a

123
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,200
clean install or a fresh install.

124
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,880
You can do that from an installed system as well.

125
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,400
Am I getting the implication that maybe this is taking advantage of some of the ZFS plumbing

126
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,000
that's been happening under the hood?

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,280
I can't comment on that, but there are a number of technologies that this is going to be leveraging

128
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,080
that have been developed elsewhere in the Ubuntu ecosystem.

129
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,080
All right.

130
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,840
Well, let's change topics.

131
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,160
You're going to, you have a habit you're going to have to break and it's that we habit because

132
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,000
breaking news.

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,160
Just moments ago, Wimpy, you announced that you are taking a new opportunity and moving

134
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,480
on from Canonical after a long time.

135
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,520
And first, I just want to say congratulations and tell me a little bit about the change.

136
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Thank you very much.

137
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Yeah.

138
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
I've not gone yet.

139
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,560
I'll be around for a little, don't quite get rid of me just yet.

140
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,860
I'll be around for a little bit longer, but yeah, I'm moving on.

141
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,480
You will know this.

142
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,560
One of the areas of work I've enjoyed most at Canonical is developer advocacy.

143
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,000
You've seen that firsthand.

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,680
You got to join us at the Ubuntu rally in New York in 2017 and then a SnapCraft summit

145
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,600
in Seattle the following year, 2018.

146
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,320
So you know the sorts of things that Alan and I have been involved in and I've loved

147
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
that work.

148
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:40,840
So I've been looking to do something where I focus on dev rel, developer advocacy and

149
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,520
community building.

150
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,740
So I'm moving to an organization called Slim AI and I'm going to be working exclusively

151
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,400
as a developer advocate for them and I'm really looking forward to it.

152
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Congratulations.

153
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
That's wonderful.

154
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
That is really good.

155
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,040
Yeah, that's an area of work that you can drive a lot of passion for and get a lot of

156
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
return from.

157
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,560
So Slim AI is an open source platform that automates the creation of fast and flexible

158
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,760
containers for cloud native applications.

159
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,720
And they've recently gotten some funding, so it seems like they've gotten some people

160
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,360
that think they've got a workable and potentially successful product.

161
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,600
Are they in your neck of the woods?

162
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Is it remote work?

163
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,080
What's the details there?

164
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,760
It's a remote position.

165
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,160
The whole company is remote, although the sort of the core of the company are based

166
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,320
in Boston, Massachusetts.

167
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,880
Well I know a lot of us in the community will be sad to see you leave Canonical because

168
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,280
I think a lot of us felt really good about having you there in that position at the top

169
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,900
of the Ubuntu desktop.

170
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:49,660
But at the same time, I know that when you are available to interact more with the community,

171
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:58,680
when you are in there as part of the conversation, it has a lot of net benefits that are really

172
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,720
also going to be positive.

173
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,420
And so part of me is sad to see you go, but part of me is actually really happy for you

174
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,720
because I know this is kind of like unleashing you and letting you do what you do best too.

175
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,000
And the net benefit of that is also going to be really good.

176
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,360
We all ultimately will win, but ultimately I'm just happy for you Wimpy.

177
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Congratulations.

178
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
Thank you very much.

179
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,920
Now, do you know when we would expect to hear who may be stepping into your old position?

180
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,320
Do you have any kind of indication of when Canonical traditionally makes those types

181
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
of announcements?

182
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,040
Well, I don't think Canonical ever announced positions that get filled.

183
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,160
It was a bit weird last time because when Will left, he was well-liked and well-known

184
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,280
in the community.

185
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,520
And I was obviously also well-known in the community.

186
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,280
So there was a little bit of, let's say, a news cycle around that.

187
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,440
But we're not in the position of announcing when people leave and join the company.

188
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,800
Yeah, it's kind of a weird thing, I suppose, in a way, isn't it?

189
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,560
It's not something companies generally like to do.

190
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,600
Well, thank you for letting us know.

191
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,800
And thanks for helping answer some of those questions around the installer.

192
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,440
And on your run here, you got, I think, one of the best LTSs out under your run.

193
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,920
And you'll always have that, regardless of what projects you go on to.

194
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,960
2004 is a hell of a release, and 2010 is really great, too.

195
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,280
Does that mean we can never update?

196
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Dang it.

197
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
Yeah.

198
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,520
From henceforth, they'll be called Wimpy Edition.

199
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,920
And we'll run them until the very end.

200
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
But yeah.

201
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Well, very good.

202
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,160
Our friends will be hearing more from you.

203
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,400
Yes, you most certainly will.

204
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,120
This will free up a little bit of time for me.

205
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,440
So I'm looking forward to taking up a regular seat on Linux Unplugged again.

206
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,560
Fantastic.

207
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,680
Let's talk about OnePlus 6 and the OnePlus 6T, which may end up receiving mainline Linux

208
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,140
kernel support in the near future.

209
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,460
And you can imagine the long term benefits that could have.

210
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,880
It's been nearly three years since the launch of the OnePlus 6 series, so it's not like

211
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,220
it's the latest.

212
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,020
But if you still have one or want to pick one up used, it may soon be possible to boot

213
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,440
that with good old stock Linux.

214
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,320
And that's thanks to the work of an independent developer named Caleb Connolly, who's been

215
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,480
working hard to include the OnePlus 6 and 6T in the mainline Linux kernel.

216
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:24,320
Now with the OnePlus 6 and 6T being built atop Qualcomm Snapdragon 845, the upstreaming

217
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,200
effort shouldn't be too hard, mostly just adding all the appropriate device tree bits

218
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,960
for the kernel.

219
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,440
And thanks to the existing minimal mainline support for that platform, things like Bluetooth,

220
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:42,240
Wi-Fi, 3D acceleration are already working right now, which is great.

221
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,480
What's more interesting maybe though, is that users should be able to dual boot postmarket

222
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,720
OS and Android on the OnePlus 6 and 6T using the installer that the developer has already

223
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
created.

224
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
So you can try it out now.

225
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,160
You can start using it.

226
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,400
It's probably not daily driver ready or anything, but the results are already promising.

227
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,480
It's a solid, I mean, it's not the latest phone, but that's a solid phone.

228
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,080
Previously, there had been a build of Windows 10 ARM that they got bootstrapped for the

229
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,520
OnePlus 6T by a separate developer, but just nobody really seemed to care.

230
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,040
It just didn't get any interest.

231
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,040
And so it kind of just whittled away, which I guess that tells you something right there.

232
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,000
When Linux is on there, it's headlines, when Windows is on there, it's quickly, quickly

233
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
forgotten.

234
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,320
All is as it should be.

235
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,360
All right, Mr. Westpain, you know what time it is?

236
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,160
It's been weeks since an Arch upgrade, and we have committed to keeping our Arch server

237
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,000
up to date here live on the show.

238
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,180
And so we figured enough time had gone by, let's do it again.

239
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,040
Probably should have done it weeks ago, but this time it seems like package creep has

240
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,560
snuck in, and there's a lot more packages than I remember being on the system.

241
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,880
125 packages need upgraded, Wes, how you feeling?

242
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,960
Yeah, no kidding.

243
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,840
You posted a little screenshot in an internal channel, and Drew was up in there making fun

244
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,200
of us for all the weird stuff on our server, and I think rightfully so.

245
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,080
Why do we have the Adobe source code pro fonts on here?

246
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,200
It's a server.

247
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,160
Why is Wayland on there?

248
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
How did that happen?

249
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,280
Like, how did Wayland get on there, dude?

250
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,640
Thankfully though, it's not too bad.

251
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,120
I mean, this is most of the system, and I think by and large, it's a pretty minimal

252
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,880
install list, which was one of our design goals with this thing.

253
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,160
We've got 500, 600 ish megs to download.

254
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,040
That's an install size of over two gigs.

255
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,760
Hey, look at that nice, fancy compression, but still just a net upgrade size of 10 MB.

256
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
I love that.

257
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,820
I love a two gig download.

258
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:51,120
Normal install size is two gigs, but net upgrade disk space is going to be 10 MB for 125 packages.

259
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,560
That's just fantastic.

260
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,760
So this is essentially absolutely everything on the system, and I'm thinking where we have

261
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,600
this package creep come in, my guess is net data, but I can't say for sure.

262
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,360
But that's the only thing we installed via a script that automatically installs dependencies

263
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,040
and everything else we've installed by hand or it runs in a container.

264
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Yeah, you're right.

265
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,360
That's one of the few things on the system that's not running in a container.

266
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,600
All right, Wes, are you ready to kick off the upgrade?

267
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Standing by.

268
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,440
I've already even put in the Y into the terminal, so I'm just waiting for the go ahead on hit

269
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
and enter.

270
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Okay, let's just be clear.

271
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,080
Are you doing Pac-Man or are you doing Yay?

272
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
I'm doing Pac-Man.

273
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,160
Okay, so we're not going to do the AUR, which I think is, well, what about ZFS?

274
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,560
Doesn't ZFS come from the AUR?

275
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,680
Yeah, we'll get there.

276
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,120
I mean, we still got the LTS kernel.

277
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
We'll do the AUR next.

278
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
No, I think that's fine.

279
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,320
I just want to make sure that was your plan.

280
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,440
All right, kick it off, Wes.

281
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Let's do it.

282
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,140
That'll take a little bit to run, so we'll let that go, and then we will come back and

283
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,920
check how it's doing, and then maybe also keep an eye on it to do the AUR.

284
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,960
Just let me know when it's going to reboot.

285
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,440
My God, I can't believe we do this live, and you know that we use that damn server more

286
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
than ever now.

287
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,760
Well, there's no going back now.

288
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,440
The new kernel just downloaded.

289
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,160
That's always what makes me nervous.

290
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,360
How was I thinking?

291
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,960
You know what you should do is you should go to linode.com slash unplug.

292
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:15,080
Don't be like Chris and Wes and run a server out of your garage slash data center.

293
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,400
Go to linode.com slash unplug and receive a $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

294
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,640
This is really where I go when I need infrastructure.

295
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,800
We have a bunch of servers that run the backend of JB 3.0.

296
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,120
They are our cloud infrastructure, and we like to be strategic.

297
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,120
We pick from Linode's 11 different data centers depending on what job we think that box is

298
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
doing.

299
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,880
A lot of times, if it's an internal tool that doesn't face the audience, we deploy it in

300
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,000
California because we are on the West Coast after all, but we can be strategic about that,

301
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,520
and you can too, and Linode's been doing this for a long time, since 2003, so they've been

302
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,760
able to secure really great data center contracts, really great connectivity contracts, super

303
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,860
fast connections coming into the hypervisors, really fast native SSDs.

304
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,520
You bring it all together with their great interface, and it's just the obvious way to

305
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,300
deploy infrastructure.

306
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,640
This is now my also go-to for making a safe environment for my kids to game.

307
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,160
I've deployed Minecraft and a Rust server, the game, Rust, on Linode.

308
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,440
They make these one-app click deployments for a lot of stuff, including really great

309
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,480
full stacks for getting your website up and running, but they also do them for game servers.

310
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,200
I just deployed a couple, chose the boxes.

311
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,200
It wasn't until just yesterday that I ever needed SSH into one of them and change a config

312
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,520
at the command line, but the way they deploy it, it works the way you would think it would,

313
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,340
so I didn't even bother checking the docs, because I'm that guy, and I thought, let's

314
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,560
see if I can just figure out how Linode deployed this, and so they set up the Rust server.

315
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,640
Well, they set up a Rust user, and in the Rust user's home folder, and that Rust user,

316
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,160
by the way, is what runs the process, not root, and in there, it's simply laid out.

317
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,040
It's a nice, clean layout for a Rust server.

318
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,500
I was able to get to the config, change the option I needed, so that way I could connect

319
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,260
to a custom server under Linux from the client, which is essentially turn off the copy protection,

320
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,800
and saved it, and the performance is fantastic.

321
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,800
I played it from my desktop, and I played it from the G4 streaming, connected into the

322
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,120
server, running off of Linode, and it's just so great, because now I've created an entire

323
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,120
world that runs on our Linode server, and you can deploy anything you need.

324
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,140
Maybe it's a website, maybe it's a portfolio, maybe it's a gallery, or maybe it's the backend

325
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,240
infrastructure for your team's communication.

326
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,320
Linode costs 30 to 50% less than major cloud providers like AWS, and with that $100 credit,

327
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,320
you can really see what I'm saying without having to put anything on the line.

328
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,040
I mean, $100 lets you deploy some serious infrastructure and see how it works.

329
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,120
And I get emails, and thank you for people who send those in, because it's really great

330
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
to hear that.

331
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,800
I get emails from people that tell me this is what they're doing now by testing it with

332
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,240
that $100 credit, convincing themselves or convincing management that it works, and then

333
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,580
deploying.

334
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,560
For yourself, for your business, for your company, it's great.

335
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,040
They've been around since 2003, they're going to get it right.

336
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,200
So go to linode.com slash unplugged.

337
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,820
Get that $100, 60-day credit, support the show, help us stay free, and get yourself

338
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:11,640
that credit, linode.com slash unplugged.

339
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,760
Let's do a little housekeeping while Wes is updating the server.

340
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,080
I think that'll help, give him some time.

341
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,920
You haven't rebooted yet, right?

342
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,480
No, no, of course not.

343
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Okay.

344
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
All right, okay, all right.

345
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,040
We've got DKMS modules to build.

346
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
Come on, son.

347
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,320
Oh, what's being installed via DKMS?

348
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
I'm curious.

349
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,240
Well, we've got a new kernel, so that triggers things to rebuild for ZFS.

350
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
Yeah, sure.

351
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
Okay.

352
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
So maybe we don't need the AUR.

353
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Oh, we'll find out.

354
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,160
In the meantime, just want to give a shout out to the Luplug.

355
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,000
Join our community that gets together and talks about Linux every Sunday.

356
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,420
Also a chance to play around with Mumble.

357
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,960
So if you ever had a chance to join us on the show, you could try it out on Sunday.

358
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,080
We have all the information at our website for Mumble, and we have the calendar at jupyterbroadcasting.com

359
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,060
slash calendar with our live times and also the Luplug on there.

360
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,840
You don't want to miss anything because, I mean, on Minimac, I don't know if you want

361
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,520
to put anything on the record yet, but there's some great stuff coming up.

362
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,480
There is, in fact, some great stuff coming up.

363
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,080
So we scheduled the next recording and I would pass the microphone to Byte Bitten because

364
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,760
he will talk about that a little bit.

365
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
Thank you.

366
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:20,340
So we all have usually our tools as an alternative for the big paid packages.

367
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,960
But sometimes we just want an overview of what is available or what others use and what

368
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,920
is the pros and cons.

369
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:35,300
So with the next recording, we will create an overview of all the available packages

370
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,760
that are mostly used within our community.

371
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
Interesting.

372
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,600
That could be a good way to learn about new apps and stuff that people are using.

373
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Yes.

374
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,720
And later on with other recordings, we will go more in depth on some of those packages

375
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,840
like Nextcloud, Mycroft Assistant, you name it.

376
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,080
So that's every Sunday.

377
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,080
You can join them.

378
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,560
Sometimes Wes and I pop in too, sometimes we even do the show with the Luplug.

379
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Check that out.

380
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,160
Details at linuxunplug.com.

381
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,240
For Mumble, there you go.

382
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,120
That's just about all the delaying I can do for you, Wes, before we check back in.

383
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Where are we at over there?

384
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
All right.

385
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,040
Well, no AUR updates yet, but we've gone through Pac-Man.

386
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,560
We've got a new ZFS build.

387
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,320
I say we give her a restart.

388
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,720
Okay, Wes, kick it off.

389
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,780
Let's do it.

390
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,520
No going back now.

391
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
Okay.

392
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,760
We'll let that reboot.

393
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,880
We'll check back in.

394
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:38,600
We'll see how it goes.

395
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,300
I tell you, we really should just do these offline more often.

396
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,400
We shouldn't wait until we do it on air because what happens is we have a busy show and then

397
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,600
we try to stick this in here and then we're trying to do it live when really it just doesn't

398
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
work out.

399
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
We should just do it once a week.

400
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,800
Maybe what we ought to try for a while is a cron job.

401
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,240
No, this is a horrible idea.

402
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,840
Don't let me talk us into that.

403
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,360
Don't make me take your SSH privileges away.

404
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,160
Now, I wanted to talk about Gnome Shell 40 on the show today, but I want to give a chance

405
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:13,500
for Carl to jump in and he's going to be joining us a little bit in the show.

406
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,800
So in the meantime, I think we'll jump ahead to feedback.

407
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Let's do the email now.

408
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,840
Let's just do it out of order so that way we give Carl time to join us later in the

409
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,840
show.

410
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
How do you feel about that?

411
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,840
How do you feel, Charles?

412
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
Yeah, good idea.

413
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,320
Well then, shifting gears to the feedback here in the podcast, out of order, Zach writes

414
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,080
in with a surprising solution for recent Chromium woes.

415
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,680
I'll take this one, Wes.

416
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,200
He says, hey, Chris and Wes, I shared your frustration regarding the recent news that

417
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,720
Google was going to cut off Chromium from Google's sync API.

418
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,480
I'm also in the same boat as you, waiting for Chromium Edge to get built in sync from

419
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,240
Microsoft whenever that comes around.

420
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,160
But in the meantime, I've stumbled on a browser that's hiding in plain sight this

421
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,040
whole time, Epiphany or Gnome Web.

422
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,080
I know what you're thinking.

423
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,920
You've probably used Epiphany in the past and it wasn't quite there really.

424
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,160
But I was there too, until I recently gave it a shot again.

425
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,920
I had a fresh install and I needed to check the Arch Wiki real quick, by the way, he runs

426
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,760
Arch, and I was blown away by how snappy and lightweight it feels when being still quite

427
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,680
feature complete.

428
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:25,080
And it supports Firefox sync out of the box so you can migrate most, if not all of your

429
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,080
Chrome settings over to Firefox sync service.

430
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,040
They let you import, by the way, and it blows away all of the other browsers.

431
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,640
By the way, it's great for video playback now, but for a while I've had to choose between

432
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:44,480
X11 and smooth 4K video, but a choppy desktop or Wayland with a smooth desktop, but drop

433
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,960
frames on video playback.

434
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,600
I no longer have to choose.

435
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,840
Epiphany can handle multiple 4K streams running in different tabs on different monitors on

436
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,080
Wayland, and on an integrated Intel GPU, no less.

437
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,720
More than that, I tested my quiet profile on my XPS 15, which disables turbo boost and

438
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,280
maxes my clock at two gigahertz, and I had no slowdowns, not one drop frame.

439
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,480
And it has an unobtrusive UI that gets out of your way.

440
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,160
I could go on, but the bottom line is if you haven't tried Epiphany recently, give it

441
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,240
a chance over the weekend.

442
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,960
I think you're going to be really surprised.

443
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,360
Wow, it really sounds like it's already been Chris tested there.

444
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,280
I agree that, you know, where he's got me is the Firefox sync.

445
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,440
That to me is a killer feature because I like having, I'm a two browser kind of guy.

446
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,880
You know, I don't just stick with one browser.

447
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,200
I got to have multiple browsers.

448
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,320
I could even be a three browser guy.

449
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,700
It's just a lot of effort.

450
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,720
So I stick with two browsers primarily, and that's generally, I divvy up like work or

451
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,520
different account stuff between the different browsers, or if one browser is better at doing,

452
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,560
you know, a Google app or something, I'll use that browser.

453
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,820
But the downside to that is there isn't something like X marks anymore that would sync my Chrome

454
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,720
browser with my Firefox browser.

455
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:06,500
So I end up having some bookmarks or some whatever extension history, whatever it is,

456
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,680
something in Firefox that isn't in Chrome or vice versa.

457
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,680
And it, it stinks.

458
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,700
This would solve a lot of that, and it would give me that, that two browser lifestyle that

459
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,760
I prefer while completely cutting Chrome out.

460
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,280
And I don't know if I'm there yet, but I like that this is there as an option, and I think

461
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,420
I am going to start using Epiphany a little bit more.

462
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,420
Try it out.

463
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,200
It's probably an option I wouldn't even thought of.

464
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,800
I mean, despite having easy access to it, but to hear that it performs so well and,

465
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:41,760
you know, is up to stuff with modern CSS and JavaScript features, I guess, why not?

466
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,920
Danny Mac, you point out that it has a really handy app mode.

467
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
It really has.

468
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:55,160
So I'm using Epiphany or Nomweb as my default web app browser, so I have a lot of sites

469
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,360
that I use like Gmail or everything like that.

470
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,280
I lose it in app mode with its own icon.

471
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,840
It shows up in the program list and everything.

472
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,160
And you know that it has a profile separate, stored separated.

473
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:14,400
So if you have a password, something is separated in a different profile, so it's really handy

474
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,480
and it's really lightweight, so you can have multiple of these apps open and really, really

475
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
love it.

476
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,640
It's a good alternative to the Chromium app mode or the Google Chrome app mode.

477
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,040
That is a good tip.

478
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,240
I think I knew that, but I think that's one of those things I've totally, totally forgotten

479
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
about.

480
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,320
While we are in this kind of community discussion section, I wanted, and I've been trying to

481
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,720
think about how to bring this up on the show because it's pretty supercharged.

482
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,600
Drew DeVault has a blog that we've covered before on the show.

483
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:53,200
Drew is a developer behind Sway and has a lot of experience working with Wayland.

484
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:00,080
And he wrote a post that is titled, I am tired of this anti-Wayland horseshit.

485
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,080
And I'm going to read parts of it.

486
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm going to censor some of it because I want this to be available to kids as well.

487
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,320
But he starts with, what do anti-vaxxers, flat earthers, 9-11 truthers, and anti-Wayland

488
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,720
activism all have in common?

489
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,140
All of them are characterized by a belief rejection of facts to embrace a narrative

490
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,840
of victimization by a vague authority.

491
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,240
In the case of Wayland, the vague authority are a bunch of volunteers who have devoted

492
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:32,200
tens of thousands of hours of their free time towards making free shit for you.

493
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,640
Wayland sucks is a conspiracy theory with no basis in truth, and its supporters have

494
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,100
spent years harassing Wayland maintainers, contributors, and users.

495
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,360
It's time for this to effing stop.

496
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,360
He doesn't say effing though.

497
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,220
A little more explicit in the full post.

498
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,140
Maybe Wayland doesn't work for your precious use case.

499
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,560
More likely it does work, and you've swallowed some propaganda based on an assumption which

500
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,640
you might have been correct seven years ago.

501
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:06,040
Regardless, I simply don't give a blank about you anymore.

502
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,720
I've tried appealing to reason and rationality and trying to debunk each lie that some Wayland

503
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,680
detractor flavor of the week is touting to toe the party line, but it hasn't worked.

504
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,320
So my new approach is eff you.

505
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,320
None of the Wayland detractors have a clue.

506
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,520
They don't understand Wayland, they don't understand X11, and they don't understand

507
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,800
Linux Graphics or OpenGL or Vulkan or anything else in the stack.

508
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,600
They don't even understand what it's like to use Wayland because at most they might

509
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,440
have spent five minutes installing it, realized that something was gasp different than X11,

510
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,160
and then uninstalled it and wrote their angry Reddit comment.

511
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,860
This is a great reason why I advocate for developers and content creators to never read

512
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,860
the comments.

513
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,080
I think this entire rant was triggered by some comments on Hacker News and obviously

514
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,680
some comments on Reddit.

515
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,880
And you can tell Drew's really, he's burned out here.

516
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,020
He's really kind of sick and tired of the armchair comments that kind of just repeat

517
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,360
crap that has been said online a thousand times.

518
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,920
And we've all seen it, experienced it in some form or another.

519
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:17,800
But this obviously isn't going to serve to improve the situation.

520
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,320
And I think unfortunately, and I'm going to leave it to the listener to read the rest

521
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,440
if they'd like, because it actually gets even more incendiary as it goes.

522
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,040
But the key point here, I think, the key takeaway is don't be a dick to maintainers and it's

523
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,240
hard on their mental health.

524
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,640
And I think this demonstrates it right here in front of all of us.

525
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,560
I think it's unfortunate though that Drew will be associated, these comments will be

526
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,840
associated, rather Drew intended or not, with the Wayland project and Wayland developers

527
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,840
in general.

528
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,480
And it'll be generic and it'll just be nebulous as part of the Wayland developer attitude.

529
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,440
That kind of stuff, those sort of associations happen with these sort of posts.

530
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,880
Wimby, I noted you're still here and I'm wondering if you have any thoughts in general on pushback

531
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,040
around Wayland adoption and where Drew's coming from.

532
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,660
Do you feel he's got a point or do you feel that he is essentially seeing it as too black

533
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,660
and white?

534
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,660
No, he's got a point for sure.

535
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:17,980
I mean, it's been a while since Ubuntu last tried on Wayland to see if it worked for them.

536
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:25,320
I think it was 2017 and you may have seen that we're implementing Wayland by default

537
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:32,200
in 2104 because some of those issues from a few years ago no longer exist.

538
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,280
So now's the time to make the change.

539
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:41,800
And Drew's comments about X11 are inflammatory but accurate.

540
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,680
We can't continue to kick that can down the road.

541
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:52,300
Each time Ubuntu chooses to stick with X11, Canonical and the desktop team are basically

542
00:30:52,300 --> 00:31:00,360
taking on the maintainership of X-specific bugs in Gnome Shell, for example.

543
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,260
And we can't continue to lift that on our own.

544
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,400
So it's better to be a part of a whole and a group moving forward together.

545
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,740
Yeah, that I totally agree with.

546
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,320
And it is getting so much better than it used to be.

547
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,280
And I was really, I was really happy to see that the next release is going to try it again

548
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
of Ubuntu is going to try Wayland by default.

549
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,640
I was also extremely disappointed because the guys talked me out of making that one

550
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,240
of my predictions for 2021 and I was sabotaged.

551
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
So I was also upset.

552
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Yeah, I know.

553
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,040
Here we are in February and already you've been, you've been scuppered by your own team.

554
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,040
I know.

555
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,040
How unfortunate.

556
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,640
Pipewire's baked in now already to 2104.

557
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,120
Oh, see, now you're talking my language.

558
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,880
Because also I think sticking with Gnome Shell 338 is also going to be a feature, but we'll

559
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,080
get there.

560
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
We'll get there.

561
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,360
I'm going to leave this, I'll leave this link to Drew's post.

562
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,440
Again, it's not, it's not Drew R. Drew who comes on the show and edits.

563
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,120
It's, it's Drew Duvall, the Sway developer, not, not R. Drew.

564
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,620
Different Drew, same first name, different Drew, just want to make that disclosure, disclosure.

565
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,920
And I guess buy a Whalen developer a beer when we can start seeing them in public again,

566
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,180
because they are doing the people's work here.

567
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,780
It is a great experience.

568
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:26,960
And with a few exceptions, I run it at least, you know, on a couple of my machines and the

569
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,920
ones I don't really are the one that has an Nvidia driver.

570
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,200
That's sort of self-evident.

571
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,300
And I don't think my desktop at the moment with plasma, with the multiple monitors, I'm

572
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,680
not generally having a great Whalen time, but it's getting really close and the projects

573
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
are doing a lot of work.

574
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,040
Plasma 521 is putting a ton of work into that.

575
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,140
Good Home Shell has been doing so for quite a while.

576
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,440
So the situation, the situation is, is changing, but it, it, if your assumptions are, it's

577
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,560
sort of like, you know, the same thing we run into with ButterFS.

578
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,880
If your assumptions are from your experience from a few years ago, then you're kind of

579
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,520
out of date and you kind of need to, you know, the thing, the things keep improving.

580
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,620
The code gets done.

581
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,200
More people, more people join.

582
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,640
One last email before we move on and talk about GNOME 40.

583
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:21,160
Ed wrote in, he says, Chris and Wes, you talked about Ventoy last episode, which is that USB

584
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,340
solution that lets you just drop ISOs on the USB thumb drive and then it'll boot any of

585
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,340
those ISOs.

586
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,680
Wes and I have been using the crap out of that already.

587
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
No kidding.

588
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,840
He says, thanks for featuring it.

589
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,920
I've been using it for a few months and I think it's a great program, but you guys actually

590
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,120
told me a few more things that I knew you could do with it.

591
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,480
I want to give you a tip.

592
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,800
I first tried it with a normal USB thumb drive.

593
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,320
That's what Wes and I are doing.

594
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:50,160
He says it works, but I decided to grab an M.2 SATA SSD that I had laying around that

595
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:58,920
I could install into a USB 3.0 stick and boy, do I see a difference in boot times.

596
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:03,360
So he links us, we'll have a link in the show notes for this, to an enclosure that is a

597
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,680
USB, it's a big, it looks like a big thumb drive, but you stick an MVME SATA disk into

598
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,680
there.

599
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,680
That's important.

600
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,740
It has to be SATA compatible, but you install that into there and then close it up and it

601
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:22,240
becomes essentially a super fast thumb drive and it looks really like a great solution

602
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,240
for booting.

603
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,720
And I was, I've been running Gnome Shell 40 a lot and I've been doing a lot of live sessions

604
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,760
to get there and the speed has been something that I have not been satisfied with.

605
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,960
So I picked this up because the price is actually, is really quite reasonable.

606
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,440
So we'll put a link to this and the SSD that I got.

607
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:50,400
The drive itself is $15.99, 16 bucks for this thing and you just pop it open and you put

608
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:57,320
the MVME SSD, SATA SSD in there and you're off to the races and it just shows up as a

609
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,320
thumb drive.

610
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,480
So I paired that with just a cheapo $32, so it's not like it's a performance monster,

611
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,600
but it's faster than a USB thumb drive, a $32, 256 gigabyte SATA M.2.

612
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,480
That is plenty for all of the VMs and ISOs you can name.

613
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
For sure.

614
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,220
I'm just thinking, Ed, that's a great tip.

615
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,800
And so I wanted to pick it up before a bunch of the audience went and bought one and they

616
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
went out of stock.

617
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Yeah.

618
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,440
You know, we should also mention too that just Ventoy can do so much, like yes, it's

619
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:29,800
good for this, yes, it's also good for, you know, if you get fancy with SATA and SSDs,

620
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:36,720
but you can also use your little USB to boot from files or VHDs or raw image files from

621
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,000
a VM that are directly on your hard drive, just on your main hard drive and they've even

622
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,920
got a nice little thing you can chain load in your bootloader if you don't want to have

623
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,280
to have an actual Ventoy USB involved at all.

624
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,200
So there's a ton of options included in that project.

625
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,520
That's more for us to play with.

626
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,520
Odear.

627
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,480
Odear.app used promo code Linux for a $10 discount on any plan.

628
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,840
Odear was co-founded by the author of the Cron.Weekly newsletter, listener of the show,

629
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,320
a community member, just a great example of somebody who I think is a perfect sponsor

630
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,480
because they're from the community offering a product to the community.

631
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,080
It's complete website monitoring from multiple locations and it goes deep into the site with

632
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,000
broken link and mixed content detection, advanced SSL reporting.

633
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,520
It'll watch all aspects of your site for performance.

634
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,520
It'll give you an idea of performance is trending downwards or give you a snapshot of a certain

635
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,520
point in time.

636
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,200
Of course, the idea here is to be the first to know if your site's unavailable.

637
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,660
Before your users or your customers, you want to know.

638
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,060
So Odear has global uptime checking with servers worldwide that report a problem from around

639
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,580
the world whenever they see it.

640
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,400
And that deep checking means that if something shows up on the site that you may be broke

641
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,520
because somebody else that you link to went away, you're going to find out about that

642
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,520
kind of stuff.

643
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,520
But something that makes Odear very special is their API and lets you configure everything

644
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
about the application.

645
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,760
They have a great dashboard, but what's even better about it is everything you see in that

646
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,200
dashboard can be controlled with an easy to use restful API.

647
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,400
And as a bonus, all the changes you make via the API show up immediately in the dashboard

648
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,420
because they've built it around that.

649
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,160
The idea is they wanted to embrace automation.

650
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:27,040
So they made a feature complete restful API, and they paired that with kickass documentation.

651
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,800
So you can embrace automation with Odear monitoring.

652
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,080
And that API also means there's already a lot of third party integrations that are totally

653
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:40,720
possible and ready to go, a CLI client, Telegram chatbot, JavaScript SDK, Terraform provider,

654
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,480
which come on, how great is that?

655
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,560
Talk about building into your automation.

656
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,320
So right now, head over to odear.app and start your 10 day, no strings attached trial, no

657
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,320
credit card required.

658
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,280
You can get set up in less than a minute.

659
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,920
And then when you do sign up for a plan, use the promo code Linux for a $10 discount.

660
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,360
And if they ask you via email or something, or when you're chatting with support at some

661
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,520
point, tell them you heard about it right here on the Linux Unplugged program.

662
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:12,800
It's odear.app and this promo code Linux for a $10 discount on any plan, odear.app.

663
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,920
So we've been trying to wrap our heads around how to talk about GNOME Shell 40 because it's

664
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,800
a pretty big change.

665
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:25,120
And in retrospective, I kind of understand why they are calling it GNOME 40 and not GNOME

666
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,160
4.0.

667
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,840
They wanted, I think, the space.

668
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,280
It's kind of like when Star Trek Discovery went 1,000 years into the future, they needed

669
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,240
the canon space to do what they needed to do here.

670
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,760
But with that means that those of us who have used GNOME Shell in its current iteration

671
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,200
for a long time are going to have our workflow changed.

672
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,220
Primarily it's this horizontal workspace.

673
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,280
That's the main change that we're going to be talking about today.

674
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,800
There's other improvements.

675
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,760
It's looking like in a lot of ways a very good release.

676
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,080
The team is really coming together.

677
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,520
Canonical even though they're sticking with GNOME Shell 338 in their next release is still

678
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,320
working upstream.

679
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,880
They're still contributing patches upstream.

680
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,880
Right.

681
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,520
It's not like they're going to stay there forever.

682
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,100
It's just going to take a little while before that all gets integrated.

683
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,400
But what's been recently merged now, and so we've had a chance to actually play with it

684
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,200
because the great thing about, quote unquote, journalism in open source, and I think more

685
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,080
people should be doing this, is we can get our hands on the code.

686
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:26,060
A lot of times it's in a state where we can build it and we can try it ourselves.

687
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,600
We can go beyond just reading what people write about it.

688
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,160
We wanted to try it.

689
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,680
Wes and I did just that.

690
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,560
There's various methods to get it up and running at this point, GNOME Shell 40 with a new UI.

691
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,080
We both used Fedora as a base.

692
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:44,920
I used Rawhide and then a script that Wes found, I think from the GNOME team, to build

693
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,080
the latest GNOME Shell 40 on top of Rawhide.

694
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,160
And Wes, I think you did it via copper at one point, and then you also did the build

695
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
script as well.

696
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,560
So you had a pretty fresh install.

697
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,560
Yeah.

698
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
There's a couple of things.

699
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,860
I think early on there was a copper that got some updates to it.

700
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,720
There's even now just a VM image you can boot and use out there, so we had to go the hard

701
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
way.

702
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,840
We went from the latest Fedora, pulling down the development right out of the repos and

703
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,840
building it.

704
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:13,140
And thankfully, since a lot of this stuff happens on Fedora oftentimes anyway, you can

705
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,260
just use DNF to install the build depths.

706
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:20,000
That takes care of a lot of the complexity for you and just run the Ninja and away you

707
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
go.

708
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yeah.

709
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,520
And you are Ninja Go.

710
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,840
The changes are significant enough that I thought it was appropriate to try it on hardware,

711
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:34,040
but while there is a way to get it working on VM, it just felt like this needed to be

712
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
experienced with hardware.

713
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,260
I wanted to try it with multiple monitors because I think that's one area that this

714
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,600
needs a lot of discussion.

715
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,560
And so that was the route I took.

716
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,400
So a lot of this code's just really fresh, and there is more work being done upstream,

717
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:53,040
but there are ways to try it out right now to see this new horizontal workflow.

718
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:59,800
And I'm going to provide in the show notes a link to a very short, like 28-second video

719
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,940
I put up on our PeerTube instance of my three monitor workstation so you can get a visual

720
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,940
of this.

721
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,920
That link is in the show notes, and you can see what that looks like while we're talking

722
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,600
about this.

723
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,640
Because it's a hard thing to explain, but if you can picture the way the elementary

724
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:23,760
desktop works, or not the same degree, but the way the Mac OS multiple desktops used

725
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,400
to work where the desktop zooms into the background, the dock comes up from the bottom, a search

726
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:35,400
launcher along the top, and then your workspaces are laid out horizontally to the right.

727
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,080
And they are dynamically generated as you launch applications and place them on there.

728
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,120
And this is all demonstrated in that PeerTube link.

729
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:49,680
And also, our buddy Carl did a great job of writing this up in what I think was just sort

730
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:57,920
of started as a bit of a tweet vent, but actually developed into some solid observational feedback.

731
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,360
And Alan Day got involved on Carl's observations about where GNOME Shell 40 is going.

732
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,920
And what I love about this, Carl, is you are through and through a GNOME guy.

733
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,840
I know you've been using it for a long time.

734
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,560
You've often rolled with what the project is doing.

735
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,080
This is the first time where it's kind of, they're changing the default and it's leaving

736
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,080
you behind.

737
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:23,040
And you're one of those particular, a thorn in the sides of the GNOME developers because

738
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,240
you're doing this thing where you want your virtual workspaces to span all of your monitors.

739
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,480
By default, GNOME Shell leaves your second or third monitor static, and only the primary

740
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,880
display actually changes workspaces.

741
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,840
But you can change that.

742
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,160
Until now, that's kind of going away because it just sort of falls apart.

743
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,320
So Carl, I think you do, I should let you explain it from here because you did such

744
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,320
a great job on Twitter.

745
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,800
But can you kind of break down what the problem is and kind of why you feel like you're being

746
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,920
left behind as a GNOME Shell user?

747
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,920
Sure thing.

748
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,640
I mean, you already summarized it really well.

749
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,640
Not sure what else I can say.

750
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,640
Oh, did I?

751
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,680
I thought I was, I thought I struggled, so I'm glad I kind of got it right.

752
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,680
No, that's it.

753
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,480
I mean, like I said, I like GNOME a lot.

754
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,840
I've used it for a while.

755
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,160
I was so, so to it in the GNOME 2 days.

756
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,640
GNOME 3 was weird at first, but eventually after I started trying it again, I was like,

757
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,640
okay, I see what they're doing.

758
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,760
You know, they got me hooked on the vertical workspaces and now they're taking it away.

759
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,760
Why vertical?

760
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,440
Why vertical instead of horizontal?

761
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,920
So for me, I'm a multi-monitor guy.

762
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,160
I use three monitors spread horizontally across my desk.

763
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,800
And whenever you have three monitors horizontally like that, physical monitors, adding a new

764
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,720
virtual workspace vertically just gives you rows of three underneath each other as you

765
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,720
keep adding them.

766
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:42,800
So you just get this three by whatever grid of however many virtual workspaces you have.

767
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,480
But in the horizontal layout, they get added side by side.

768
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:52,440
So you go from a one by three to a one by six to a one by nine to a one by 12.

769
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:57,120
And it just quickly, I mean, I routinely have five to 10 virtual workspaces going for different

770
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,480
tasks that I'm doing.

771
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,640
And I like having three fresh displays every time I start a new workspace up.

772
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,800
And now that just gets very unmanageable very quickly.

773
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,480
Yeah, it gets really kind of awful too on my setup where I have three displays and two

774
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,940
of them are vertical and then the center is horizontal.

775
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,380
When I start to get multiple desktops, it's really awkward to navigate.

776
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:24,680
This to me doesn't really like disrupt my workflow because I switch desktops all the

777
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,680
time.

778
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,800
I'm used to things changing on me.

779
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,560
But it does seem like a bit of a downgrade in overall efficiency.

780
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,040
And I know, Wimpage, it's great that you're here today because I know that Canonical was

781
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:40,420
looking at this for the next release of the Ubuntu desktop and decided not yet, not no,

782
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,420
but not yet.

783
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:45,080
Yeah, and that decision has nothing to do with the design changes as it happens.

784
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,080
Oh, really?

785
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,240
I thought it was actually 100% about the design changes.

786
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,240
No, it's not.

787
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
Well, aside from GTK4, right?

788
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,280
So, you know, it's not to do with the design changes at all.

789
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,520
It's to do with where we are in the release cycle and when feature freeze happens for

790
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,520
the next release, which is later this month.

791
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:07,300
And there's simply not enough time for us to do the main inclusion request processing

792
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:13,080
for the new stuff that needs to be in the main archive, which has to be security reviewed

793
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,760
before we can introduce it to meet our deadlines.

794
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,680
So we're purely putting it off because we can't get there in time.

795
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:31,440
And in fact, I met with the Yuru team last night to discuss GTK4 and GNOME 40 and some

796
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,280
of the design changes and how we could accommodate all of that.

797
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,860
And they were very clear that it was business as usual.

798
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,720
This wasn't going to present any major road bumps.

799
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,440
So yeah, our move forward is for very different reasons.

800
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,520
Curious what your personal opinion is about the design change.

801
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,880
So I was quite fortunate to be invited to a session with the GNOME Foundation at the

802
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,800
back end of last year.

803
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:03,740
They recently commissioned some user acceptance testing to look at a number of different prototypes

804
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:11,360
and different ways that the GNOME shell had been presented to users in different distributions

805
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:16,080
to sort of inform some of the changes that they were going to make in GNOME 40.

806
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:21,560
So it's really good to see that, you know, the changes that they are introducing have

807
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:27,640
been sort of, you know, user tested and there is data to support the direction that they're

808
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,640
going in.

809
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:36,040
Now, from a personal point of view, the business of switching workspaces and leaving a screen

810
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,800
behind, I'm really not a fan of.

811
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,480
I know that's a configuration option right now.

812
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,880
And it's a configuration option that I personally enable.

813
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:51,360
But you know, in the great scheme of things, I think the direction that they're going in

814
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,600
is is a wise one.

815
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,880
Certainly they've got data to support what they're doing.

816
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:01,980
I could see how spatially it makes more sense for new users because you see it laid out

817
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,640
and everything's next to each other and you're kind of moving to them.

818
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,040
What I don't like about it from an efficiency standpoint is with the current vertical stack,

819
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,200
you can see everything in the overview mode.

820
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,640
You can see all of the desktops at once.

821
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,200
That goes away with this.

822
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:21,520
But additionally, it scales a lot better when you have multiple screens where this really

823
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,520
falls apart.

824
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,560
Say you have three monitors.

825
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,960
You have like three squares you have to move through to get to the new desktop.

826
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,680
It's it really kind of doesn't scale properly.

827
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,880
And I think, Carl, there's two issues here.

828
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,320
The issue is workspaces should be spannable across multiple monitors, which right now

829
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,440
they're not designing for.

830
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,440
Right.

831
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,440
That's not the default setting.

832
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,440
That's issue number one.

833
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,440
Right.

834
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,920
And the question there is, are we ever really going to see traction on that?

835
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,920
Because it doesn't seem like Fordy's being designed at all with that consideration.

836
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,920
Right.

837
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,000
And the thing that gets me, I know they're doing a lot of user testing with this, but

838
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,440
I honestly I'm speculating here, but I don't think that they're doing any user testing

839
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,040
on multi monitor, at least.

840
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,040
No, they're not.

841
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,200
Yeah, that's a that's a huge oversight in my mind.

842
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:11,180
There is a reason for that as well, which was explained, which is that they did the

843
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:18,120
user testing remotely and there's no way to simulate multi monitor user testing under

844
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,480
remote conditions.

845
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,360
So it was a known sort of gap in the way that they were testing things.

846
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,400
That's unfortunate because even using sort of the latest builds, I'm not going from copper,

847
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,820
I was building it and there's pretty obvious bugs moving stuff around in multi mon.

848
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,120
It's not smooth yet.

849
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:40,000
And I understand it's alpha and I actually have every confidence that a lot of the stuff

850
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,080
will be worked out.

851
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,080
It's a really solid, you know, it's it's it's changed, but they're going to they're going

852
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,080
to fix it.

853
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:50,120
But it is troubling when I hear that, that it's not being tested on multi monitor is

854
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:55,200
a major shift and to and to make that major shift without the user testing experience

855
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,280
of a multi monitor, that's going to leave a large portion of the of the user base just

856
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,280
out in the cold.

857
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,280
Yeah.

858
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,280
Yeah.

859
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,120
Just so that we're clear, Carl, that's really two main issues again.

860
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,320
One is workspaces that span all the monitors.

861
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,920
But what's the second issue here?

862
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,160
From what Manuel, one of the known developers was discussing on Twitter with me about he

863
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,360
says that, you know, that is one issue, just the desire to have workspaces span across

864
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,200
all monitors, which, to be clear, that's not a default.

865
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,960
That's something you have to go in with either tweaks or decomp settings and change.

866
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:30,000
The other thing is once you do enable workspaces across all monitors, things are messy in the

867
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,280
horizontal layout, because by default, the horizontal layout isn't a problem and it works

868
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,280
well for them.

869
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,040
So they kind of want to classify it as two separate problems there.

870
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,800
And I can kind of appreciate that when just trying to break it down from how do we address

871
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,800
this?

872
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,800
And that may actually be the first part of figuring this out.

873
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,800
Right.

874
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,800
Yeah.

875
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,760
Establish that there is value in having, you know, spanning workspaces across all monitors,

876
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:56,980
not just as a hidden decon for gnome tweaks setting, but something that perhaps is even

877
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,520
right directly in gnome settings to allow people to do and set up.

878
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,560
I'd even take something in gnome tweak, put it in tweaks.

879
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,760
I guess the reason that Carl and I were, we were talking about this off air and I thought,

880
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,860
you know, after chatting with him and after trying it myself, I think the takeaway we

881
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:18,860
have is if you're on a laptop or you're a single monitor set up, it's probably not going

882
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,600
to be a big change for you.

883
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:25,780
If you're on a multi monitor set up, this first release may be one to sit out and stick

884
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:31,720
with gnome 338 and upgrade to gnome 41 or 42 when they get some of this other stuff

885
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:36,480
worked out, because I tried it here on my ThinkPad and it's actually really not bad.

886
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,480
It works pretty well.

887
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,960
It does, I feel like it's, it's a bit of a loss because the way I could move windows

888
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:47,480
around it was like a much smaller and it doesn't quite work right and it seems a little buggy,

889
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,400
but I can see where they're going with it.

890
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,840
And on a single screen on a laptop, it's pretty usable.

891
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,840
Yeah, same.

892
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,840
That was kind of my experience.

893
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,960
Like, okay, yeah, I could get used to this on a single screen.

894
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,960
I mean, that would be, I would have forgotten about it in a week's time.

895
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,960
Yeah.

896
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,560
On multiple monitors though, this is where we kind of wanted to put a bit of a disclaimer

897
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,520
and say, hey, you might want to think about skipping this one.

898
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:11,960
But it's not to, you know, to be disrespectful to the gnome team or anything like that.

899
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,720
It's just having tested it.

900
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,120
I think that's something you guys should know about.

901
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,440
And we all have links to all this stuff so you can see what the hell we're talking about

902
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,160
and get a visual when you're listening to this in the show notes there.

903
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,360
I'm sure they'll get it, right, Carl?

904
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:28,680
I mean, you, you, you see the thing with the gnome, with the gnome shell team is like they,

905
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,760
God, I feel horrible even like criticizing them because I know eventually they're going

906
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,760
to work it out.

907
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:38,200
As it is right now, it, it just doesn't seem very usable, but I have the faith, I think.

908
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,200
I want to have faith.

909
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,200
Yeah, exactly.

910
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,960
I definitely think they have good intentions and I can understand a lot of them have mentioned

911
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:49,960
how the, the gesture support in gnome 40 with a touch pad on a laptop with a single screen

912
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,960
is so good.

913
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,960
They can't go back.

914
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,680
And I can understand and respect that that's something that a lot of people will find valuable,

915
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,720
but the multi-monitor thing is just at some point you have to realize that that is, I

916
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,920
don't know, maybe the best possible outcome is that they actually make optional vertical

917
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,680
workspaces, not just an extension, but like a built-in native supported thing where you

918
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,280
choose, do you want them horizontal or vertical?

919
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,080
Minimac, perhaps they could take inspiration from another desktop environment.

920
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,080
Yeah.

921
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:22,560
We were laughing about in the pre-show, there is always a solution and it's called enlightenment

922
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,140
because enlightenment has that for decades because it treats the desktop.

923
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:31,560
Every screen is treated independently and that is so gorgeous.

924
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:38,520
I can have four virtual desktops on my left screen and three on the right one, and I can

925
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:45,500
just skip these workspaces just on the left screen and on the right screen independently.

926
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,320
That would be the solution, right?

927
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:52,960
That would mean you would have to rethink gnome shell, that it treats the screens independently.

928
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:59,520
So imagine you would have just these possibility as you have now in, apparently you're having

929
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,960
in gnome 3.38, that you can just have a window overview for your left screen and the window

930
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,600
overview for your right screen.

931
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:14,720
That is so gorgeous and enlightenment has that for decades and that was my primary thing

932
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,160
because I switched to enlightenment.

933
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:21,200
A point that you, of course, wanted to make sure we did not miss.

934
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,680
So thank you for adding that.

935
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,660
And of course, I think, Carl, I'm supposed to tell you to try plasma.

936
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,120
Has that crossed your mind?

937
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:35,880
I still haven't seen any way to do dynamic workspaces in plasma or enlightenment or any

938
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,880
other desktop.

939
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,360
If I'm missing something, please let me know.

940
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,320
I'll try other desktops.

941
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,440
I like gnome, but I'm not married to gnome.

942
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,680
If there's something else that does it, then I'm all ears.

943
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,240
You just got to preallocate like three times more than you'll ever possibly need.

944
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,800
Just get a giant grid.

945
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,800
That's right.

946
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,800
There you go.

947
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,800
That'll take care of it.

948
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,800
Hashtag Marte desktop.

949
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,800
Oh, yeah.

950
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:02,400
Also, I think just to allay concerns, Ubuntu Marte remains under your stewardship with

951
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,880
this transition, right, Wimpy?

952
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,880
Yes, indeed.

953
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,840
That is my passion project.

954
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:12,440
It's the thing that I love doing in my spare time and I will continue to do so.

955
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,440
That's good to hear.

956
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,440
All right.

957
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:19,160
Now, before we run and before we update, before we get an Arch server update.

958
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,160
It's not the distro.

959
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,160
It's how you use it.

960
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:25,600
I want to mention that if you want to follow your stonks in the terminal, we've got an

961
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,280
app pick for you.

962
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,280
It's called Ticker.

963
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,100
It's a terminal stock ticker with live updates and position tracking.

964
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:36,440
Why wouldn't you want to have that in your drop-down terminal?

965
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,640
It's not written in Rust, is it?

966
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,560
Because that would be really perfect, but it doesn't look like it is, unfortunately.

967
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,160
So we won't be able to play the Rust horns.

968
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,440
It does look like you could probably run it in Docker.

969
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,440
So I mean, maybe if we had some sort of...

970
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,520
It is written in Go.

971
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,520
That's got to be a close second.

972
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,520
Okay.

973
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,840
I just don't have any theme music for Go.

974
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,840
Yeah.

975
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,840
Yeah.

976
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,560
Also, it'll track cryptos, I believe, as well.

977
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:58,240
So if you're investing big in the Doge over there, like Wes Payne is, you can keep an

978
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,680
eye on that as well.

979
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,680
We had to.

980
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,120
I mean, with all the news going on, that had to be our pick this week, right?

981
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:07,520
You need a nerdy desktop terminal client to keep track of things.

982
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,520
Yeah.

983
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,240
If you don't have an option for every possible single use case so I can avoid a web app,

984
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,240
what are we even doing here?

985
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:18,080
I want to say a special thank you to the scientifically confirmed most awesome people in the world.

986
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,040
That would be our Unplugged Core contributors at unpluggedcore.com.

987
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,720
Keeping this show indie, helping us reduce the ad load, and getting yourselves not one

988
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,700
but two different feeds.

989
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,240
Limited ad feed, just the same full production, but limited ads.

990
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,480
So it's a little bit shorter runtime.

991
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,880
You get just what you want in there.

992
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,880
Not a little bit too much.

993
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,880
I appreciate.

994
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:42,720
I appreciate the busy, busy core contributor, and we value their time.

995
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,620
If you're on the other end, maybe you want a little more content.

996
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,720
Maybe you like the bootleg kind of music.

997
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,720
You're one of those people.

998
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,120
You like the live tracks, well, that's feed two.

999
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,120
Live stream.

1000
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,120
All our screw ups.

1001
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,960
All the stuff that Joe cuts from the show, because thank God he makes it sound better.

1002
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,760
But we leave it in for you.

1003
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:04,220
Transparency is the name of the game with full pre and post shows.

1004
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,880
It's basically an extra show.

1005
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,880
It's right there.

1006
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,560
You just don't even know about it.

1007
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,520
So I'm jumping around the room.

1008
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,520
I'm so excited about it.

1009
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,520
It's unpluggedcore.com.

1010
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:23,000
And I think if we could get 15 new members for next episode, I'm going to get Wes Payne

1011
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,480
to drink three beers before the show.

1012
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,480
That's fair, right, Wes?

1013
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,480
That's fair.

1014
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,480
Yeah.

1015
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,480
All right.

1016
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,480
I will sacrifice my body for the show.

1017
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,960
I think that's a bad idea, because I had three beers before this show, and I've been

1018
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,960
having to dash to the toilet.

1019
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,960
Oh, there is that.

1020
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,960
Yeah.

1021
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:40,960
Yeah.

1022
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,960
Yeah.

1023
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,960
Well, you know, we'll just give him a wireless mic.

1024
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,960
Right?

1025
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,960
Yeah.

1026
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,960
Podcast from the potty.

1027
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,960
Yeah.

1028
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,960
I know how to mute appropriately, I think.

1029
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,960
Yeah.

1030
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:49,960
Yeah.

1031
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,960
It's all about appropriate muting.

1032
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:51,960
Exactly.

1033
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:52,960
Like a pro.

1034
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,960
All right.

1035
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:54,960
Well, I want to mention you can join us live.

1036
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,240
You may hear us mention mumble rooms and chat rooms and stuff like that.

1037
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,960
Well, we do this show live every single Tuesday at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1038
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,000
See you next week.

1039
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,560
Same bat time, same bat station.

1040
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,460
And wouldn't it just be great if you could join us for that?

1041
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,900
So do make an effort one of these days if you can, or maybe on a Sunday.

1042
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,720
We just love hanging out with you.

1043
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,720
It really it really does feel like one of the happiest, best communities on the Internet.

1044
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,680
And we'd love for you to be a part of it.

1045
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,940
Thanks to everybody who goes over to linuxunplug.com slash contact and sends in feedback or tips

1046
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:30,000
to the show, helping it make it better that way as well, or shares it with a friend.

1047
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,840
All of that is very, very much appreciated.

1048
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,960
The entire network of Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter broadcasting.

1049
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,960
Easy for me to say.

1050
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,280
Jupiter broadcasting shows that's over at Jupiter broadcasting dot com links to everything

1051
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,640
we talked about today as at linuxunplug.com slash three nine one.

1052
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,880
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the unplug program.

1053
00:57:51,880 --> 00:58:17,960
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1054
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:36,040
All right, everybody, let's go pick our title.

1055
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,040
JBtitles.com

1056
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,040
JBtitles.com

1057
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,040
Head on over there.

1058
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,040
There's only one place to vote.

1059
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,560
JBtitles, JBtitles.

1060
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,120
Now you all got to go boat.

1061
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,800
Hey, Wes Payne, just real quick.

1062
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:55,040
Just curious, how did it how did it go over there?

1063
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,180
We are back online.

1064
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,600
So the update was done.

1065
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,600
Yeah, flawless.

1066
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,600
ZFS mounted.

1067
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,600
No problem.

1068
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,600
Yeah.

1069
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,600
Docker containers are up.

1070
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,600
I'm right back on the box.

1071
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,480
So that's pretty anticlimactic then.

1072
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,040
Well, congratulations.

1073
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,200
I will say we didn't have any ZFS updates this time.

1074
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,200
So that kept things simpler.

1075
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,200
Ah yes.

1076
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,600
And that's because the AOR package has been flagged out of date.

1077
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,960
There's been actually just a point release out I think today or yesterday and another

1078
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:24,320
one a little bit earlier this month to two point zero point one and two point zero point

1079
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,320
two.

1080
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,860
That was from yesterday.

1081
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:28,880
So presumably those will be there soon.

1082
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:50,280
And maybe we can do this whole thing again next time.
