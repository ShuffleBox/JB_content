00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 229, a very special holiday edition.

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,440
Oh, hello, everybody, and welcome to Linux Unplugged.

3
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,040
This is your off-schedule weekly Linux talk show, where we're going to get together

4
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,360
and have a very special holiday edition. I'm joined by the one, the only, Mr. Wes Payne.

5
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,160
Hey, Wes.

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,400
What?

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,800
Hello, Wes. Hello, Wes. Sorry, I was stepping on your mute button.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,760
That's right, you were.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,440
You know, it's a holiday edition. I do those kinds of things.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,440
I like to talk. You got to shut me up sometimes.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,920
But you know what I was really doing is I was busy unmuting the only kernel Linux of the team.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,040
Hello, Noah. Welcome.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,560
Hey, as it turns out, I have my own mute button too, so.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,720
Well, you know what? Happy holidays. It's like it's a holiday extravaganza.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,360
We ended up getting together and saying, what could we do that we would actually

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,960
like to talk about for the holiday special? Because we've got special holiday music.

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,080
We've got a special holiday just us.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,440
We're all in our Christmas garb.

19
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,080
You know, as we sit here and record the show,

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,920
there's a little elf in the background too that is going around and moving out of the studio.

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,040
So it's a very special holiday episode. We thought we would look back at the year in Linux

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,120
and talk about some of the top moments that affected us and affected the show,

23
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,440
affected the course of Linux and all of those kinds of things.

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,480
So it's a it's a wide range of things.

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,760
And we just got done doing a little holiday celebration here in the studio.

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,480
We did a little holiday burger, some holiday booze.

27
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,840
Yeah. Oh, that's important.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,280
Noah, are you doing anything special for the holiday version over there in Grand Forks?

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,080
Is it snowing yet?

30
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm not doing anything. Yeah. Jesus, it's snowing.

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,600
We live. We have we you know, we got dumbed on five or 10 inches.

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,800
And I finally ended up blowing my driveway out.

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,080
And the there's a there's a big rigmarole with the trying to get the city out to plow the streets

34
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,240
because there's been like, you know, there's people running here.

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,120
No, no, seriously, I can't even make this up.

36
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,520
There are people running into the back of the snow plows.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,000
Only in Grand Forks, dude.

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,440
Gigantic yellow snow plows with big flashing lights on the top of them.

39
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,720
Like, apparently they missed that.

40
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,160
Yeah. You know, I mean, not to make you angry, but what it's like here in Washington for the holidays

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,600
is I had my window open in my bedroom last night because I got too warm.

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,520
So that was so there you have it. All right.

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,560
Well, you know, I know it's perfect that you're able to join Wes and I for this episode because

44
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,160
some of the biggest moments this year that we all experienced were together.

45
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,760
The three of us had a huge year.

46
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,480
This show and the other shows that we do gave us the opportunity to experience some significant

47
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,000
moments up front.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,560
So I thought we would start with the most self-serving.

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,080
Absolutely.

50
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,000
This was the year that we ended the Linux Action Show at Linux Fest Northwest 2017.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,080
It was our last episode of Linux Action Show.

52
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,040
Rest in peace, Laz.

53
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,760
What do you think, Noah?

54
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,200
Like, like post-mortem.

55
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,800
Now, here we are almost it's been, what, 10 months, 11 months since then post-mortem.

56
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,760
It doesn't feel that long.

57
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,320
No, it doesn't.

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,920
It doesn't feel that long.

59
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,880
I guess there's obviously things I miss about it.

60
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,520
There's obviously things I like doing about the show and things I miss about it.

61
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,600
But, you know, it's interesting because it has given the network and me personally,

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,840
and you personally, a bunch of different new directions that we're able to do things in

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,320
a different way and in a lot of ways, better ways.

64
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,600
And I think that's a really good thing.

65
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,560
And I also think it has kind of future-proofed Jupiter Broadcasting because it really feels

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,520
like the content we're producing now is sustainable.

67
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,480
And I'm not sure that I necessarily believe that was true about Laz.

68
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:50,560
Right.

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,760
This kind of proves it out, right?

70
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,280
That this is the post-Laz era.

71
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,360
We weren't just riding in the tailcoats of Laz.

72
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,640
There's original stuff here.

73
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
That is a good point.

74
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,240
Yeah, really, it does sort of, was it all just because of Laz or was it where the other

75
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,520
show is also holding up the tent?

76
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,720
Whether or not that was a tenable argument, you could definitely make it because it was

77
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,920
the anchor.

78
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,680
And it somehow, even though all the rumors are going wild that Noah and I were at each

79
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,400
other's throats, here we are all these months later still hanging out.

80
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,840
You know, one of the things I think we did right was after Linux Action Show wrapped

81
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,440
up, you and I packed up our families and we went to Montana and just had like some unwinding

82
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,520
just like, we're not podcasting.

83
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,240
We're not, you podcasted, I vlogged, but it didn't feel like a work trip, you know?

84
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,520
No, yeah.

85
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,560
I don't know.

86
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
Here's the thing, that was one of those things.

87
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,840
People were saying we were at each other's throats long before Laz ended.

88
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,240
That's true.

89
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,040
So I mean, it was like...

90
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,360
That's just because you could just catch us on a bad day.

91
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,640
It might actually be true.

92
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,680
I'm wondering, Noah, do you feel any different relationship with the network?

93
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,120
You know, like before it was kind of like you and Chris were here on this anchor show

94
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,800
and I mean, obviously you're still a big part of it, but you're off in your own Ask Noah

95
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,520
world in a way.

96
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah, it's true.

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,960
Yeah, I definitely feel less connected to Jupiter broadcasting the network.

98
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,680
However, I'd say Chris and I probably talk more now than we did...

99
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,400
Oh, interesting.

100
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:08,880
Yeah.

101
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,200
You know, maybe because there's a lot of stuff we would save for...

102
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,040
Well, there was a lot of this stuff we'd say, oh shit, we got to save that for the show.

103
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,440
Where now we can just, we can have like a 15 message telegram thread about it.

104
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,400
Right.

105
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,280
So I think, I think, I think personal wise, I think Chris and my personal relationship

106
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,320
has grown, but I think definitely I've wandered astray, not wandered astray, but I've become

107
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
less involved with the network as a whole for sure.

108
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,120
Right.

109
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,160
Although it's like, you know, we listen to every episode, Noah and I almost always talk

110
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,160
about every show of Ask Noah afterwards.

111
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,600
Like we compare notes and stuff, but in a way...

112
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,360
Earlier today we were talking about Tech Snap.

113
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

114
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,680
But in a way it also feels like it's Noah's best work.

115
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,320
Like not to take away from what you did with Last, but there is an aspect to Ask Noah that

116
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,400
is sort of, if you give somebody some rope, they can either hang themselves or they can

117
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,600
really do, they can do like some impressive acrobatics.

118
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,720
And that's what Noah has done now is like, because there's a bunch of behind the scenes

119
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,640
stuff I know about too, but you know, I've also, I've also seen Noah incorporate some

120
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,440
harsh criticism into a show, back into the show in a way that improved it too.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,240
So part of it is, and I feel like you'll really understand this and anyone out there that

122
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,680
creates content will understand this, the ability to at a moment's notice say...

123
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,240
Change your mind.

124
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,920
Yeah, change your mind.

125
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,000
And then it doesn't matter because it's only you.

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,320
And there have been, there's been plenty of episodes where three hours, four hours before

127
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,000
I've gone on the air, I've dumped a week's worth of prep and said, nope, we're doing

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,560
this instead.

129
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,680
And it usually, it works out to work out really well.

130
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,440
Yeah, I've enjoyed then when we do get together, it's like we sort of have pent up things to

131
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,080
talk about.

132
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,040
So I think it's helped.

133
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,320
Yes, yes.

134
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,680
And you know, the other thing is, yeah, well, I guess this kind of, this kind of says the

135
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,080
same thing.

136
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,720
But the other thing is, is that we have different experiences then too, where if, you know,

137
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,880
when you're prepping a show all weekend together and agreeing on the topics and doing it, which

138
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,640
means we're both using the same operating system.

139
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,920
We're both using the same software.

140
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,440
We're both doing the same things.

141
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,720
And so when you get together and you go, well, I've been off here doing these things and

142
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,920
you've been off doing those things.

143
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,640
Now let's talk about how they intermingle.

144
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,280
Yeah.

145
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,880
And so that was sort of the weight that Linux Fest last year had.

146
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,800
And now we're just around the corner going to Linux Fest again.

147
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,480
And I feel like it's going to be one of our best ones ever just because we're going to

148
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,320
go, we're going to do some show stuff there, but we're going to go more as just people

149
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,680
to hang out, talk about open source, talk to other Linux users.

150
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,920
I almost feel like Linux Fest Northwest 2018, I hope, will be more like Linux Fest was for

151
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
me a decade ago, but we'll see.

152
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:48,960
Yeah.

153
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,400
And being able to attend that stuff as an attendee is way better, way better than doing

154
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,760
it as a, well, I have to sit behind this booth the entire time because people are going to.

155
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah.

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,560
Although we are going to do, like you're going to try to do Ask Noah there, right?

157
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,760
Absolutely.

158
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,880
But what I'm saying is there's a difference, there's a difference between, there's a difference

159
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,000
between going, setting up a booth and me doing Ask Noah for an hour and you doing Linux Action

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,280
News and Westcoming to do Unplugged and that's different than you and I anchoring the entire

161
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,320
thing from start to finish.

162
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,440
All right.

163
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,160
Well, while we are talking about things that sort of played a big role in the rest of the

164
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,840
year towards the beginning of the year, in January, January 10th, 2017 on Linux Unplugged

165
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,840
episode 179, we had a show called Project Sputnik Interview where Barton George from

166
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,680
Dell came on to talk about some of the new hardware for Project Sputnik.

167
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:47,280
This was a bit of a snowball effect that eventually led to Noah and I at Dell in Austin, Texas

168
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,800
later on in the year.

169
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,600
And it took some behind the scenes setup, but this was for me one of the biggest shifts

170
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:04,080
that I've had in years because I went in with pretty open-minded expectations and walked

171
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,480
out of there seeing a company grappling with deploying Linux to a certain subset of users

172
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,960
and like really learning how to do it.

173
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,480
Watching a company that's gone through a transition and it really shifted my view of the Linux

174
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,920
hardware market and the Linux user base that are actually buying hardware, like new hardware

175
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,960
and not building PCs.

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,600
I mean, there's so much in that Dell visit for me, Noah, that I feel like I almost can't

177
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
even give it justice just talking about it.

178
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,920
But I feel like if you got the ball rolling on our visit to Dell, I could probably, you

179
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,880
could probably get me going.

180
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,600
But what do you think?

181
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,720
Like looking back at our visit to Dell, it seems like it was a big moment of 2017.

182
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,160
Yeah.

183
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,120
So we, if you think about it, what people saw, what people know, what people experienced

184
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,080
of our visit probably represents less than one percent.

185
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,320
Wow.

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,720
We took three or four days worth of footage and condensed that.

187
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,520
And I can, well, us together, we condensed it down and down and down and down and down

188
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,320
and down.

189
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,400
And then you'll remember like we were literally sitting there and I was like, it was as bare

190
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,160
bones and I was like, man, we barely used anything.

191
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,320
And you're like, we got to make that tighter.

192
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,560
And then we cut a whole bunch more out.

193
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,840
And so, yeah, it really represented a tiny fraction.

194
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,960
But and the thing that we couldn't really explain and part of it was our bad as content

195
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,960
creators for not finding a way to capture this or explain this better was you had recurring

196
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,000
themes and ideas that were shared among everyone in the company.

197
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,840
And it would come up in passing conversation enough that we were able to say, OK, these

198
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,040
people really care about Linux.

199
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,920
It's not just an act.

200
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,000
It's not just numbers for them.

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,360
They're really passionate people here.

202
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,040
And that's something that I don't think the video really did justice.

203
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,400
But when you're there and you experience that kind of energy, it changes you.

204
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,400
And like you said before we started recording, it gives you a whole different perception

205
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,960
of the company.

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,480
Yeah, it seems like that's the narrative has changed or like how I think about it before.

207
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,920
It was like, yeah, OK, Project Sputnik.

208
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,320
That's cool.

209
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,680
Dell has this like small little thing on the back burner now.

210
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,200
It also is just in the larger community.

211
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,880
People people are aware of it.

212
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,920
Dell doing Linux computers is a thing now.

213
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,760
Now, do you remember around this time?

214
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,880
So while we were going, you had to like backfill coverage in the show.

215
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,400
Oh, yeah, that's right.

216
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,000
That is absolutely how is that?

217
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,800
How did that go for you?

218
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,240
Like, because I remember while we were gone, I think you did a show with Joe from.

219
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,880
I did.

220
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,440
Yeah.

221
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,920
And I think maybe a code of radio somewhere in there, too.

222
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,880
Well, how do you feel like that particular aspect of it all went good?

223
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,400
Do you feel like we could improve?

224
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,040
I mean, you're the you were the one in the in the middle of it all.

225
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,360
Well, I think I think well, overall, we could definitely stand to improve.

226
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,760
But there's a certain aspect of just kind of being thrown in, figuring it out.

227
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,480
I really I guess I really enjoyed working with Joe.

228
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,240
You know, he's obviously a fantastic friend of this here this here network.

229
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,160
He's a he's a not only is Joe a great like on air talent, but Joe's really good at like

230
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,960
the back end, like producing to get it all lined up.

231
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,320
And so, yeah, that's it's always nice working with Joe because he's always got all his ducks

232
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,880
lined up.

233
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,400
And it was really interesting for me to just having seen a small subset of the stuff here,

234
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,280
obviously watching a lot of the shows, but getting to participate more in the back end

235
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,520
and understand like, what are the different constraints here?

236
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,960
Because I my whole worldview was kind of skewed through up for a long time.

237
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,240
So looking at it from a different perspective, it's been it's been really, really helpful.

238
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,240
You know what else is going on in the background while you and Joe were doing a show and no

239
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,680
one I are down in Texas at in Austin, Texas.

240
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,800
There was also kill disk, which I don't know if you guys remember, but it was it was the

241
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,880
first really popular ransomware that actually went after Linux users.

242
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,360
Right.

243
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,880
And it had a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar U.S. greenback ransom, but it will

244
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
not decrypt your files even when you pay it.

245
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,960
Oh, and at the time there was speculation like, oh, is this Linux's moment?

246
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,840
Are we going to go after Samba servers and NFS servers and desktop Linux users with ransomware?

247
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,280
Oh, man, it's finally here.

248
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,240
Kill disk.

249
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,080
And then that was basically it.

250
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,600
And we talked about it ever again.

251
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,200
No, it didn't go anywhere.

252
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,400
Thankfully, very much.

253
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,360
Thankfully.

254
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,240
So kill disk.

255
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,560
Wow.

256
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,600
You know, there are so many things that have come up over the year as we wrap up the year.

257
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,520
The Intel management engine is a continuing story.

258
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:29,200
But if you had to give it to one story in just like the desktop Linux unplugged space.

259
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,280
I mean, you'd have to say it's canonical dropping Unity and switching.

260
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,840
It really has to be.

261
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,640
Yeah, right.

262
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,080
Hundred percent, hundred percent.

263
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,800
It was huge.

264
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,920
And that was back.

265
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,800
The actual announcement hit us while we were in a conference room with the people at Dell

266
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,560
that were shipping Ubuntu laptops.

267
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,200
Wow.

268
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,120
It could have been crazier timing.

269
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,000
And so it was April 11th, episode 192 of the unplugged program, where we just took a huge

270
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,800
section of the show when I got back from Texas and Noah joined us and the three of us with

271
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,640
the mumble room just went through like, what does this mean?

272
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,160
What is going on?

273
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,360
And that's all in 192.

274
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,000
And then it was a it was a six month build up to the 1710 release.

275
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,920
And and it was it was weird.

276
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,560
It was we didn't know exactly how far canonical was going to go with their customization of

277
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,680
their Ubuntu version.

278
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,040
Were they just going to ship stock?

279
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,760
Gnome was marked done with the community.

280
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
You couldn't tell what their motivations were.

281
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,560
Like, are they in the desktop game at all anymore?

282
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,160
Or are they just a cloud company?

283
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,120
And then and the commentary ran the whole spectrum from this is canonical, ejecting

284
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,640
the desktop to canonical is going to be more involved than ever before.

285
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,800
And it just ran the whole damn spectrum.

286
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:56,160
And it all sort of I just I saw a lot of like 80 20 to of the a bunch who no longer cares

287
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,680
about the desktop to 20 percent of oh, this is where how they're going to rejuvenate

288
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,720
the Linux desktop.

289
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,120
We do the we we tend to go the doom and gloom route these days.

290
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,000
They just you know, I think people are getting a little bitter.

291
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,520
We're used to companies announcing now we're dropping the Linux version.

292
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,960
Ah, screw Linux users.

293
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, I can't make any money.

294
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,240
I you know, and it's a neglected third operating system not to not to make this about Red Hat.

295
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,480
But if you think about it, it kind of does start when Red Hat announced they were done

296
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,840
making a desktop distro and they were going to have this fedora thing.

297
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,480
And some of us were like, awesome fedora.

298
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,280
It's like the leading edge of the enterprise version.

299
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,560
Like, I'm going to stay ahead of the trend.

300
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,520
This is great.

301
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,240
And then other people were like Red Hat no longer cares about the desktop and kills their

302
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,440
desktop version.

303
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,200
And that really, if you think about it, has set the tone for all of the future conversations

304
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,200
in a in a weird way.

305
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,520
It seems to me and there are a lot of parallels there in terms of corporate strategy and.

306
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,000
Go ahead, but it is well, it's just it is weird because if you if you go to Red Hat,

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,720
there's probably more people in Red Hat using their own than most other advocates of linear

308
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,000
and not canonical necessarily, but a lot of other I know a plenty of other projects where

309
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,520
you go and then a lot of the people they're not using their own distro full time.

310
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,360
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,200
And and one of the ways I got started in Linux way, way, way back in the day before I even

312
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,760
realized what Linux was, was a family member who was a Microsoft employee giving me a rack

313
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,200
of Red Hat CDs.

314
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,760
Really?

315
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,400
Yeah, here you go.

316
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,280
And it was one of these like four quad fold or trifold.

317
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,320
I don't remember how many folds it had had multiple folds of CDs in like the little slots.

318
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,360
A hefty little package.

319
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,920
Yeah, yeah.

320
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,160
And then you were supposed to go through all six tests as you install this thing because

321
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,840
there was no online repo.

322
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,960
Sounds worse than Gentoo.

323
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,520
It was it was it was a different time because there was this sort of like it was there was

324
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,280
sort of this new world that when Red Hat first emerged that seemed like an impossibility

325
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,320
that Red Hat was going to come along and tame this crazy GPL software and ship an enterprise

326
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:13,840
product was honestly it was I used to work with these mainframe guys and they told jokes

327
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,360
about like it was such a joke.

328
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,840
They would say you're going to install your Red Hat on your Mattel processors and pretend

329
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,480
like it's a real PC like they would they would ridicule me about it.

330
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,840
And now you look at it and they're a multi-billion dollar company.

331
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,200
It gobbled up the whole world.

332
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,280
And Canonical is racing towards an IPO with their server side.

333
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,600
It really has the whole thing is the whole thing has really shifted from when I first

334
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,000
got that like that that trifold or that quad fold.

335
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,960
But it does seem like a lot of the conversations that we've had the proto conversation was

336
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,840
when Red Hat.

337
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,640
Is it the same Linux?

338
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,140
Killed it.

339
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,020
Hmm.

340
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,880
No, I don't think so.

341
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,480
I don't think so.

342
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,080
It was a simpler Linux back then.

343
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,040
It was a more innocent Linux.

344
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,520
It was I could wrap my head around Linux in a different way back then than I can now more

345
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,680
fully right now that I not that Linux hasn't exceeded my ability to comprehend it yet.

346
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,400
But system D was like the first time like I had I had a choice like Chris you're going

347
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,920
to learn system D or you're never going to understand this part of Linux.

348
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Like I had a choice to make there.

349
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,000
And so it got close.

350
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And so I totally understand why people resent system D to a degree because it takes something

351
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,880
that you could conceptualize and visualize in your head in its totality and adds a black

352
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,840
box aspect to it.

353
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah.

354
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,760
Like when you write bash scripts all day.

355
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,160
You know.

356
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,320
Yeah.

357
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,120
What do you think though?

358
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,680
Is it different?

359
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,720
Is it a different Linux now?

360
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,760
I think it is for a number of reasons.

361
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,520
But as it relates specifically to system D, what I have found because this discussion

362
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,400
comes up at basically every conference, basically any group.

363
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,120
Yeah, there's somebody that was and here's here's what I found.

364
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,200
The people that really love to dig into system D ask them one question.

365
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,960
Have you ever used it in a large scale enterprise environment?

366
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,480
And the answer every single time is no.

367
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,600
Because if they had, they would understand what the benefit if you're just talking about

368
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,920
home or on your desktop or even five or 10 servers, nobody cares and you won't see a

369
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,040
huge benefit to it.

370
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:18,880
It's when you have a large cluster of servers or you're working with the medical institution

371
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,200
and that you've got somebody leaning on the back of your chair, swearing at you, asking

372
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,200
you how long it's going to be before this thing comes back up and you've gone from minutes

373
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,520
of boot time to seconds of boot time.

374
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,560
That's when it matters.

375
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,160
And if you haven't seen that and if you haven't experienced it, no wonder you don't get it.

376
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,040
Yeah, absolutely.

377
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,160
Or like from my experience, I've worked a lot with people in like operation centers who

378
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,920
have to go to a server they've never seen before, try to find out the status of a system.

379
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,200
Well, good luck with the old style sys5 system.

380
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,280
Did they implement a status command on your service?

381
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,840
Who knows?

382
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,960
But systemd is right there.

383
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,680
You've got the top of the logs all in that.

384
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,320
It's really nice.

385
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,200
I do.

386
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,160
I do like the fact now that there's a standardized way to get status and like I get the PID

387
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,200
information.

388
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,160
I appreciate all of that.

389
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,920
You can even add like doc strings to it and just like a whole bunch of info.

390
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,840
The number one thing I hear from the audience is, hey, I'm kind of new to Linux and unit

391
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,160
files on systemd make way more sense to me than anything I've ever seen before.

392
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,200
And so when we're bringing on new users, new admins, new sysadmins, I know that's something

393
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,440
that has resonated well with them.

394
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,480
But for me, the bigger picture item is a truly standardized syntax across all the distros

395
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:36,240
that to me, that was the most valuable thing because like a dummy, I ran for a period of

396
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,120
time Debian and Gentoo and SUSE Enterprise all in production.

397
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,560
And there was very little commonality back then across all of those.

398
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,600
So you learned all three different methods to just do the same stuff.

399
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:47,840
Oh, man.

400
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,000
Different package managers, different status commands, different names for all the packages,

401
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,920
different syntax for the init scripts.

402
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,080
Everything was different across the board.

403
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,720
It was all on me to manage it.

404
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,960
And it was all fine for Chris.

405
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:08,400
And then if you go figure, auditors came along and said, excuse me, your IT guy is a maniac

406
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,280
and deployed three different Linux distributions.

407
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,320
And that's not maintainable.

408
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,360
So you better standardize on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or fire that guy.

409
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,440
Yikes.

410
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,080
Yeah.

411
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:27,680
So systemd offers like to me, it offers something that Chris in a very, very, very difficult

412
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,200
situation a decade ago could have really used.

413
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,000
If I could have come and said, well, look, my maintenance scripts all use SSH and systemd

414
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,880
commands or whatever, there's not really an issue here.

415
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,400
Like if I could have demonstrated commonality across the platforms, I could have nullified

416
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,200
their argument.

417
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,920
But because they had a completely accurate technical argument and management argument,

418
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,000
I had nowhere to go.

419
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,360
I had to get rid of all the Gentoo.

420
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,920
That's what forced me to get rid of all of my Gentoo.

421
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:56,880
Wow.

422
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,480
Yeah, it really speaks to that.

423
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,320
One of the things we love about Linux is there's so much choice.

424
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,480
There's so many different forks and all kinds of things.

425
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,320
Where is that a value add or where does it just create an extra work for us?

426
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:18,080
Yeah, I suppose in a lot of ways, canonical moving back to Gnome has added a standard

427
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,520
to the Linux desktop.

428
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,040
It's not great for plasma lovers.

429
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,760
It's not great for the Qt platform.

430
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,560
But it is really great for the enterprise platform.

431
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,960
Gnome, GTK, and if I target flat packs or I target snap packages, I can nail all of

432
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,320
these distributions now.

433
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,200
From SUSE to Debian to Ubuntu to Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS, it's all targetable now.

434
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:48,560
The Gnome platform from 320 on has now become a target.

435
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,360
And you can write applications to Gnome 320 and later.

436
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,040
For how long have we been wanting to be able to have one story to tell outside developers?

437
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,320
Like, look, you can target Linux.

438
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,760
And 2017 was a really good year for the Builder project, for Gnome Builder.

439
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,800
So there's a tool set, there's a distribution mechanism, and there's a common API now with

440
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,240
Gnome 320 and beyond.

441
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,120
And canonical being in that is a very good thing for the corporate desktop.

442
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,000
I don't know if it's great for the home user, but it's great for the corporate desktop.

443
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,640
How have your clients taken to it?

444
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,440
Yeah, so I'll get to that in one second.

445
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,000
I would argue that what is good for the corporate user is ultimately, in 99% of cases, good

446
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,720
for the home user.

447
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,760
And here's why.

448
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,680
Because the corporations have the checkbooks to develop and work out the kinks that bother

449
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,320
them.

450
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:41,200
And so if you can get a desktop environment that you're going to have large corporations

451
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,960
using, they're not going to deal with LibreOffice crashing, for example, right?

452
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,320
They're going to want that fixed.

453
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,480
And so if you can get some of those bugs fixed, then that trickles down to the home user.

454
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,160
How have my clients been working out?

455
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,200
Fairly well, although there's very few of them that have really been affected by the

456
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,800
change, mainly because we keep most of those users on the LTS.

457
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,960
And I've recommended that people switch.

458
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,680
And I say, this is the one exception when I wouldn't do that.

459
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,680
And every time I've had that conversation, and they say, well, but for sure, we're going

460
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,640
to have to end up re-upgrading in April when the LTS comes out.

461
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Of course, my answer is yes, because that's a responsible thing to do.

462
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,040
Well, we're not going to do it.

463
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,120
We're not going to upgrade all these machines now, only to come back and revisit it in four

464
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,600
or five months.

465
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,480
Sure, yeah, of course.

466
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,360
So most of them haven't done it.

467
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
Yeah, they haven't even had to deal with it yet.

468
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,200
That's something we should keep in mind.

469
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,200
It's going to be years.

470
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,080
It's a big deal for us on the edge here, Linux users.

471
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,960
But LTS users, people that are known as clients, it'll be years before they deal with this.

472
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
How long is 16 supported?

473
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,560
Before we wrap up talking about Ubuntu and the Switch and the 17.10 release, we've got

474
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,080
to mention the trip to New York.

475
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:57,920
We've got to mention that October 3, 2017, we got back from New York.

476
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,680
So obviously, a big moment, a big moment for the show, a big moment for our understanding

477
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,880
of Ubuntu.

478
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,760
So I'll talk about that just as we, you know, I've got to tease it a little bit.

479
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,960
But first, let me talk about Ting.

480
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,360
Go to linux.ting.com.

481
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,040
Ting is mobile that is done right.

482
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,160
All of us sitting here on the show right now are Ting customers for one clear reason.

483
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,280
You pay for what you use.

484
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,120
And if you're savvy, even just a little bit, you can make it work in your advantage.

485
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,680
The average Ting bill is $23 a month.

486
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:33,760
Every time I tell people the way Ting works that are outside the US, they go, Chris, Chris,

487
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,880
you know that that's just how it should work.

488
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,320
That's just how we do it here.

489
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,240
And they usually like the insert name of countries that is not the United States.

490
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,720
Yeah, that's how Ting is.

491
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,800
Ting is if you had to reboot the mobile industry and start over again, you get Ting.

492
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,640
You pay for what you use nationwide coverage, no contracts, no determination fees.

493
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,480
If you just want to use data, you just pay for data.

494
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,480
If you just want to use text messages, get a few alerts from Nagios, you use text messages,

495
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,000
pay for what you use.

496
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,920
Like April, maybe I got I spent 18 bucks in May, maybe I spent 34 bucks in June 23.

497
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,840
And then back in July, I'm back to 18 bucks.

498
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,040
It's it is unbelievable how much money you will save in a two year contract period for

499
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,160
me like being able to just tether whenever I need it, right?

500
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,280
Because I'll just pay for the data.

501
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,280
I'm not like sneaking around my ISP.

502
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,240
I'm not doing anything like that.

503
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,240
It's just we're like troubleshooting problems.

504
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,840
Have someone plug their Android phone in.

505
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,760
I can remote in over that done.

506
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,360
Absolutely.

507
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:37,280
Linux.ting.com no contract nationwide coverage pay for what you use CDMA and GSM Linux.ting.com.

508
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,040
So this whole trip to New York was very exciting.

509
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,120
I didn't know how the hell I was going to pull it off.

510
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,240
I had heard rumors that it was coming, but I didn't know for sure.

511
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,040
So I couldn't I couldn't like put it on a calendar and say I'm going to be gone during

512
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,320
this time period.

513
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,160
Everybody plan on this because I didn't really know when it was going to be until it got

514
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,760
just about a month out.

515
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,240
Life it does.

516
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,000
Life's not that easy for us.

517
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,080
And then and then I had to do the math.

518
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,800
Do I drive the RV?

519
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,640
Do I fly?

520
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,000
Do I take his car?

521
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,440
Do I take my truck?

522
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,040
Do I go buy a camper van and move into the camper van and then take the camper van to

523
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,440
New York and sleep on the streets of New York?

524
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,360
All of these things were considered.

525
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,560
And what I ended up with was driving his car, which gets about 35 miles to the gallon, which

526
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,920
is pretty good here in the states.

527
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:32,400
And that turned out to be the cheapest way because I had the RV, which gets around six

528
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:39,040
to eight miles per gallon, the truck, which gets around 15 to 20 miles per gallon, or

529
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,640
his car, which gets around 35 to 40 miles per gallon.

530
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,880
And in each each one of these options, there was this huge savings of gas money.

531
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,400
So the most expensive aspect of that New York trip was the hotel, which I think was like

532
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,920
360 a night.

533
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,480
So Noah and I decided to shack up together.

534
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,880
So Noah and I decided to shack up together, always looking for an excuse.

535
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,800
Here's where that camaraderie comes right back in here.

536
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,040
So to be fair, first of all, I did like the very first.

537
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,520
Well, I think the very first thing I said was, yeah, that'd be really fun.

538
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:11,920
Let's do it.

539
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,280
Then the second thing I said was New York is like the most insanely expensive city I've

540
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,960
ever been to, and it's going to cost us a lot of money.

541
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,080
We're both going to go broke.

542
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,360
Yeah, that's true.

543
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,080
That is true.

544
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,560
I mean, that's why.

545
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,000
So that's why I ended up driving because I just needed to save as much money as possible.

546
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:32,560
And as I headed out and the news of my adventure sort of trickled out through the J.B.

547
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:38,880
audience, people started emailing me offerings to like stay at their house, crash on their

548
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,440
couch or even park the RV in their like driveway.

549
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,120
And so as we got going, like it was like one email and then it was a couple of tweets and

550
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,720
then it was a few telegrams.

551
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:57,040
And then it was five, five, ten, fifteen, thirty five emails offering me places to stay

552
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,200
along my road, people watching the live tracker.

553
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,520
I just you know, the audience is so awesome because that is the idea that I could have

554
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,960
I could have probably taken the RV and just not even planned on a single place to stay

555
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,120
and just had the safety net of the audience offering me places as I went along.

556
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,600
It makes me think that maybe one day if I get a wild hair and I want to go off and do

557
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,760
something just totally crazy, the audience would totally have my back.

558
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,400
And as I'm going down the road, I'd be getting offers of places to stay because, you know,

559
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,760
we've got offers at places I thought we had nobody listening.

560
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
So I never even bothered asking.

561
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,800
And I just got these invitations coming in constantly.

562
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,360
I felt bad.

563
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,880
I was telling people, no, people people like, please, we'll come over.

564
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,840
We'll make you dinner.

565
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,680
I'm like, that dude sounds amazing.

566
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,600
Yeah, I'm like, one of these years and it needs to be soon.

567
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,920
I just need to like go off on a road trip just to do that and take the microphone with

568
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,400
me.

569
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,760
But we got all the way to New York all the way, like literally on the other side of the

570
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,240
country.

571
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,120
We're still getting emails the entire time about offers of places to stay.

572
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,720
We drive across the entire country.

573
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,760
We get in New York and I didn't expect the the the I don't know what I expected.

574
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,920
It's the it was the Grand Hyatt Hotel.

575
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,560
And I guess I expected a parking garage.

576
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,680
That's what I expected is I expected a parking garage.

577
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,400
Now I understand there was a train station underneath the hotel.

578
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,480
So there was no room for a parking garage.

579
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,200
I did not have that knowledge before I arrived at New York.

580
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,680
So I guess they thought I'd be arriving at a parking garage.

581
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:36,640
So we spent a week living out of a compact Ford Focus.

582
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,040
Production equipment, everything.

583
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,240
Sounds roomy.

584
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:47,040
A DC powered cooler, food, clothing, everything we needed was in this car.

585
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:55,920
And we get to New York after a week of driving and it all came down to about 27 seconds.

586
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,040
We we will we arrive at the Grand Hyatt.

587
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,960
And you pull up and the valet, you know, you get out of the car and they welcome you and

588
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,480
they grab your bag and they put you to the door and they say thank you.

589
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,680
Here's the ticket for your car.

590
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,520
And you go, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

591
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,800
What if I need something out of my car?

592
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,640
Well, you just you just you just go in there and you just tell the desk that you need a

593
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:16,960
car.

594
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,360
You need your car back and we'll bring you whatever you need.

595
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,640
Oh, so I can just get whatever I need whenever I need it.

596
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,600
Yeah, you just go in there, you tell the bellhop you need your car and they'll they'll call

597
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,200
up the car service and they'll bring you your car.

598
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,160
OK, yeah, well, I got my bag.

599
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,360
I grabbed my laptop.

600
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,000
You know, Hadia grabbed one of her bags, didn't grab her insulin kit or anything like that.

601
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,800
And they took the car.

602
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,280
And then we get in and we get up to our room and we're like, well, we should probably grab

603
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,480
your insulin so that way you can, you know, not die.

604
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,760
And I could, you know, maybe use my toothbrush.

605
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,480
So we go down to the bellhop and we're like, yeah, we'd like to get our cars that way we

606
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,040
can unload it.

607
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,840
OK, well, you know, that's seventy five dollars every time we bring your car out and you're

608
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,320
probably going to want to and then like this is like over five minutes.

609
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,840
He also says you're probably going to want to tip these guys, too, because they hate

610
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,720
doing this.

611
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,360
So I would tip them pretty good and there's a seventy five dollar charge every time we

612
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,800
want to every time you bring your car out.

613
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,120
Wow.

614
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,360
And that was when I was like, oh, man, I was not prepared for New York.

615
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,960
That was like the most like, oh, shit.

616
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,480
It used to be called nickel and diming, but these days it's larger bills.

617
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,440
I was really glad I had grabbed all the recording gear.

618
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:25,920
Right.

619
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,480
It's like I had that so long.

620
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,240
Hadia, I'm going to make some podcasts.

621
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,960
Will you wither away?

622
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,840
She eventually she eventually used the live tracker to hunt the car down herself.

623
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,320
Really?

624
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:38,560
Yeah.

625
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,760
She got to where the car was at and got into it and told her, hey, I need my insulin and

626
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,960
like grabbed a few other things and took off.

627
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,520
But it was really interesting to watch how canonical works to go inside a company for

628
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,400
a little bit.

629
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,520
A company that we talk so much about, but really from the outside.

630
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,320
I walked away with a lot of insights.

631
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,080
I don't know.

632
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,280
Any of them stand out to, you know, about, you know, when you go inside, like you've

633
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,440
gone inside Red Hat now, we've gone inside Dell and we went inside canonical this year.

634
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,160
So a lot of different inner workings.

635
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,200
Does anything stand out at you?

636
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,680
I guess the thing that stood out to me the most was how laid back everyone was.

637
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,480
Like, if you think about look at the workshops that we were sitting in, right?

638
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,640
Like these people are there, they're paying atrocious amount of money to be at this hotel.

639
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,640
We split it, thankfully.

640
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,720
And it was still over a thousand dollars.

641
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,400
Yeah.

642
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,400
But you think about this.

643
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,600
So you and I, two yahoos walk in there with some cameras and, you know, people like Martin

644
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,280
Wimperis, they just stop what they're doing.

645
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,640
Hey, meet Chris and Noah.

646
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,240
Hey, these are guys from JB.

647
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,320
They're here to, you know, hang out and whatever.

648
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,360
Well, is there anything we can shoot?

649
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,400
No, shoot whatever you want.

650
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,280
You're welcome here.

651
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,000
And then, you know, we sit down and obviously I got a chance to, I got pretty close to Neil

652
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,760
Gomba, who was one of the fedora guys that was there that was working with the development

653
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,240
team.

654
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,680
And so, you know, he would sit down and I'm like, yeah, I don't really understand development.

655
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,040
So he'd walk me through at a very elementary level, what they were doing and stuff like

656
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,540
that.

657
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,440
And the fact that they are not only comfortable, but encouraged to do that.

658
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,680
It was really interesting.

659
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:23,280
You can see how you can hire a lot of really smart people and how they can get a lot of

660
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,040
really great work done working under those kind of, under that environment.

661
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,320
Yeah, the other thing that really struck me about it is you hear a lot of people debating,

662
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,320
is it possible to get remote work done?

663
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,240
Can you have a remote workforce?

664
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,360
Is this a thing that could even be possibly accomplished?

665
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,640
Three years ago, there was huge news when Yahoo announced that all remote workers were

666
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,140
coming.

667
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,680
Oh, yeah.

668
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,180
Right.

669
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,300
Right.

670
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,620
Canonical is a company that was launched post-internet.

671
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:55,060
And so it's just an assume that with a lot of these different tools, you can just work

672
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,580
remotely and then you have get togethers.

673
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:02,500
So what you see when you go to this event is a company built around the concept of we

674
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,180
don't need to be region specific.

675
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,700
For some jobs, we do.

676
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,580
But for other jobs, we can just grab the best talent all over the world.

677
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,540
Especially when you have this like open source pool, you have people who are interested from

678
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,380
other regions, you need some flexibility.

679
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:27,220
Yeah, and I don't want to ruin everybody's holiday spirit, but there is an awkward element

680
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:27,940
to this.

681
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,100
And they really handle it with grace.

682
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:36,180
And it is you have a bunch of different cultures all coming into one space.

683
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,700
Some people, a good portion of them are not even native English speakers.

684
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,180
Sure.

685
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,860
And they all come together.

686
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,740
And all of that doesn't matter because this sounds so corny, but it's really true.

687
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,580
And it's actually how it feels like at Fest too.

688
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,620
All of that doesn't matter because it's the Linux and the open source stuff that matters.

689
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,300
And they're so busy debating all of the nerdy aspects.

690
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,340
That drive is there.

691
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,940
The stuff that we talk about every single week, they're all having that conversation

692
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,180
there.

693
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,940
And that's what they talk, that's what they care about.

694
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,060
They don't care about somebody that might have a disability.

695
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,900
They don't care about somebody that doesn't speak English.

696
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,900
Like what they care about is the conversations that we all have here.

697
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:20,100
And so it's really interesting because that adds like an immediate commonality to everybody

698
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,380
who doesn't normally work together.

699
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,100
And it kind of makes that whole remote, everybody's remote, and then we come together every now

700
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,660
and then.

701
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,900
It kind of makes it all click because not only have you had a bunch of online conversations,

702
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,220
but you have this common ground that you can immediately have a discussion about.

703
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,980
So I think it really works for Canonical in a way it might not work for some other companies.

704
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,420
That's my theory at least.

705
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:44,420
Because I haven't really seen it, I mean, I think it's an underplayed aspect of Canonical

706
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,500
because I haven't really seen a lot of other companies pull it off.

707
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,740
It was cool to see it.

708
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,260
I think there's other companies that do it.

709
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,340
I think they're just, size comparison wise, I think you might be onto something.

710
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,780
Like, you know, if you look at like, obviously Google has tons of people that work remotely.

711
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,940
Red Hat, they don't care if you work remotely or not.

712
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,700
So I think it's being done.

713
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,540
But I think what's interesting about Canonical is the size and what they're able to do.

714
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:11,060
Because, you know, they just got recently done pairing the entirety of their company down big time.

715
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,620
Right.

716
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:16,340
And hit the button, hit the button, we lost you, hit the button.

717
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,500
Oh God, oh God, there you go, yeah, you're back, you're back.

718
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,100
Yeah, but anyway, yeah, they have done a particularly good job, as you said,

719
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,860
finding the best talent wherever they exist.

720
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:30,180
Yeah, and I'll say this, the 1710 release ended up being pretty solid.

721
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,060
Like that was the real rubber meets the road aspect to all of this.

722
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,140
We could say all this stupid shit about it with a, you know, you can have your big blog post,

723
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,740
you can have your big conversation, end of the desktop, their biggest investment ever.

724
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,780
Like all of these people can have all of these different discussions.

725
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,700
But the reality was the rubber met the road when 1710 shipped.

726
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,660
Ship it or shut up.

727
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,780
And we all looked at it and went, not only was that a pretty decent release,

728
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:57,060
just in general, like stability and performance and bug fixes, but it was done the right way.

729
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,380
It was polite light forks of the dock.

730
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,380
It was a Gnome session implementation of their customization instead of just a whole bunch of

731
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,620
extensions stacked on top of Gnome.

732
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:09,540
Right, we haven't spent a whole bunch of time talking about all the drama between Ubuntu and Gnome.

733
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,060
Like it just hasn't been a thing.

734
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:16,500
No, now they're on the advisory board and they had a big banner up saying that Gnome loves Ubuntu.

735
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:22,740
In some ways, like the best things that we had hoped for or speculated on way back when that was announced kind of came true.

736
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,100
Okay, so I have a theory on the biggest loser of the year as a result.

737
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:31,380
And loser is a harsh term because I just mean loser in terms of user exodus.

738
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,220
So we'll get to that in just a moment.

739
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:33,700
You ready?

740
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,260
Are you guys with me?

741
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:34,820
Well, I'm excited.

742
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,420
Because you might disagree.

743
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,460
You may disagree.

744
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,260
Yeah, all right.

745
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,460
So before we go there, let's talk about DigitalOcean.

746
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,180
DigitalOcean.com, go over there and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

747
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,860
It's one word, DOUNPLUGGED.

748
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:54,420
You get a $10 credit, you spin up a droplet, you can install Linux, you can get working with something that really matters really fast.

749
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,060
You ready to get off Dropbox, fire up Nextcloud.

750
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:06,260
If you're out of family events and the whole family is looking for a way to share the photos from the event, maybe have a shared calendar for people's birthdays, why not spin up a Nextcloud instance?

751
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,180
You also get file sync with that.

752
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:22,740
If you're ready for a blog or something that's unique in yours, you could build it from scratch or you could deploy an entire stack with Ubuntu LTS, NGINX, a database and Ghost, which is an awesome Markdown based blogging platform that's really simple.

753
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:29,460
And the nice thing about DigitalOcean is the price point, especially when you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, means that you could just use it for an education.

754
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:42,100
You could just use it to learn, get started with something, test, but their infrastructure with all SSDs, the dashboard, the API and data centers all over the world means you can put it in production and leave it in production.

755
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,180
That's a really unique combination.

756
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:52,500
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, get a $10 credit and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring this holiday edition.

757
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
of the Unplugged program.

758
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:00,500
So I think the biggest loser may be, and it hurts deeply for me to say this, Arch.

759
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
I thought that's what you were going to say.

760
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
Yeah, and do you agree?

761
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,500
That is not what I thought you were going to say.

762
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,500
Really? What did you think I was going to say? The biggest distro that lost out this year on users?

763
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
I don't know, but that is just not the answer I was expecting.

764
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Well, you know, when I announced that I was going to switch to 16.04 and just sort of stabilize there, I mean, this is anecdotal information, but I probably heard from a hundred and something people who said, yeah, I'm doing the same thing.

765
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
I've been running Arch for years.

766
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Some people even said I've been running it since your Arch challenge.

767
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,500
And I love it.

768
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
I love it too.

769
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,500
The software availability can't be matched.

770
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:48,500
And I, even before the show, Wes, we're talking about how whenever you use Discord, you're always using the web app version now because you're not keeping your Arch installation up to date enough for Discord to even work anymore.

771
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:54,500
Because some of these packages, you've got to stay on top of it like a madman for it really to be a smooth Arch system.

772
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
We're talking daily updates.

773
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
And I was all on board with that for years.

774
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:08,500
And then something slipped, and then it just slipped more, and it slipped more, and then it got two months, three months, and then that is really negligent Arch use.

775
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
And that's when I realized, oh, I got to go to an LTS.

776
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Right.

777
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
Well, and I think there may have been somewhat of an Arch bubble, right?

778
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,500
And that it hit this time where like lots of people using Linux, you want that software.

779
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
There's a lot of good software you can get.

780
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
And there was, you know, flat, no snaps.

781
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
They hadn't matured.

782
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,500
Exactly.

783
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
And that's not the problem anymore.

784
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
So I think there will always remain this core Arch.

785
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,500
I mean, I still want to put it on systems, especially systems that I really want a lot of control and understanding of the system.

786
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
Because like, I mean, I use Ubuntu all the time.

787
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
I use it at work.

788
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
But it's a fatter OS than an Arch OS that you make for yourself, right?

789
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,500
And it has some things that I don't agree with that are harder to change.

790
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:52,500
But if all your goal is like run these three systems and do so in production, there's a lot of reasons not to use it.

791
00:41:52,500 --> 00:42:00,500
I don't know about you, Noah, but I have not installed a single Arch system since Ubuntu 17.10 came out.

792
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:06,500
Oh, so really what it has come down for me is, and I've said this for years, this is nothing new.

793
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:14,500
But I just don't believe personally that Arch has the same amount of polish that a distro like Ubuntu has.

794
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,500
And what do you have?

795
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,500
What does polish mean?

796
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,500
I could disagree and call you a jerk, or I could totally agree, depending on your definition of polish.

797
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:38,500
So when you look at Ubuntu with Unity, for example, you can tell that somebody, so one person or a group of people have sat down and gone left to right, top to bottom and said, what is this experience going to be like?

798
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:44,500
And if when you get to Arch, obviously you install Arch, particularly with GNOME, because that's really the only experience I have.

799
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,500
So you install Arch and you install GNOME. And the first thing that you sit down and go, this is terrible.

800
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,500
And then the answer you get is, well, GNOME is designed to be extensible.

801
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,500
So it's just kind of the core thing. And then you add the things that you want. Okay, so let's go with that.

802
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:02,500
So you go out and you start installing extensions and you install a dock because you want a dock and you install this top icon thing because you want that and you try and do this.

803
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:07,500
And then you find out that sometimes certain icons don't show up at the top.

804
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:15,500
Sometimes they still go down to that bottom drawer thing and the dock doesn't really quite work because it kind of overlays over the website because it can't really tell where the web browser edge is.

805
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:21,500
And then you go back and you complain to people and you say, but you told me to use this extension, this dock doesn't work.

806
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:29,500
And then they say, well, yeah, I just kind of gave up on the dock. Well, you gave up on the dock because it sucks.

807
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:45,500
If I was back on Ubuntu, not only does the dock work functionally properly and doesn't create five different telegram icons on the left hand side, it also it does little things like it changes the color of the transparency of the dock depending on what the underlying background is.

808
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,500
Or progress bars.

809
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:52,500
And yeah, right, right. It has a little progress bar underneath and the little dots to tell you which application is running.

810
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:59,500
There's so many little things that Ubuntu has done because they have just beat and hammered this thing home.

811
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:06,500
And no, it's not pretty and flashy and not much has changed from 1204 to 1610.

812
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:11,500
But the little things have gotten just really, really clean.

813
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:17,500
And I still have yet to find a Linux distribution that has the insane amount of multi monitor support that Unity has.

814
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,500
And I was talking to you about this earlier before the show.

815
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:29,500
I have a machine that's running Arch and I need it to run OBS and I go to open OBS and OBS just doesn't open up.

816
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:40,500
That's just a frustrating thing as a computer user, because the reality is I know if I go to the Arch wiki or the AOR, I know that somebody has the answer in there and I have to roll back a package or install this or do that.

817
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,500
But here's what I also know.

818
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:49,500
If I had Ubuntu 1710 on there, I wouldn't be asking those questions. They would just work. It would just work. I'm 100% sure it would.

819
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,500
So it all depends on what you want to do with the computer. Do you want to play with it? Is it a toy to you or is it a machine to get work done?

820
00:44:54,500 --> 00:45:17,500
So it seems like to me the ideal would be that Gnome 3 itself as an upstream project is so polished, is so well done, is so refined that when you install Arch or Fedora or SUSE or Bangero or whatever, or Solus and you chose Gnome 3 Shell as the desktop, you would just get this great refined experience.

821
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:22,500
And then you have systemd underneath that and then you have the Linux kernel under that and you're good to go.

822
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:33,500
Right, I think it speaks to that part of that polish and the advantages. You do have this company with like, we have an end goal in mind, whereas Arch is really maybe the best of, but an assemblance of open source software.

823
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,500
You assemble it yourself.

824
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,500
And so maybe part of the Ubuntu thing that's really good about this is you're right.

825
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:44,500
Instead of having this weird Unity with a bunch of forked libraries that no one wants to bother to install on a different operating system, now we do have that in an upstream.

826
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:57,500
I do agree with what Noah's saying though, man. When I logged into Unity 7, and I don't even remember, I think I started using Unity 7 more and more because that's what Noah put on the Skype machine.

827
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,500
Oh yeah, right.

828
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:07,500
Yeah, that's right. We were just trying out all the different, everything from Plasma to Mate to XFCE and Gnome 3.

829
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:18,500
And each time we would hit these walls and be like, well shit, I can't use this now, fuck. And then the entire time this Unity 7 machine was just sitting here like a jerk, not doing anything wrong.

830
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,500
And I thought, well, wait a minute, why aren't we talking about this?

831
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:30,500
And so I tried out another system, it was great, because when I started to use it, I had that experience that Noah was talking about where it's like, oh shit, somebody really thought about this.

832
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:45,500
They really gave some time, and they changed the way this thing behaves to make it better. And it's nice, but it is getting old. It is a limited time option.

833
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,500
It's great right now, but in a year, in two years, in three years?

834
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:59,500
I feel like I'm that polar bear on a melting ice cap right now, and I'm floating down the water. I'm like, I'm going to have to jump to another ice cap soon, but I probably have another year's worth of ice cap.

835
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,500
And you know you're going to get wet and frigid cold in the process.

836
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:13,500
And the problem is the ice really started melting. It's been kind of stagnant since 2012. The ice hasn't really grown at all since 2012, and so now we're just rapidly shrinking.

837
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:22,500
But what gives me hope is if Canonical can put that much effort and get that kind of experience out of Unity that they're developing themselves,

838
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:38,500
if we really believe what we always talk about on these shows about open source and open source development, there is no reason, absolutely no justifiable reason, why Gnome shouldn't be as good and exceedingly better because you have both Canonical and Red Hat working on the same thing.

839
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Yeah, right.

840
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,500
Yeah, I hope. Maybe in 2019 that's what we'll be talking about.

841
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Maybe at the end of 2018 it'll be like, wow, how do we ever even exist without it being like this?

842
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:59,500
In the meantime, I can't get past a spooky concept that is one of the reasons I'm not on Gnome if I'm being completely honest with you guys.

843
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:12,500
If you look at what has been super successful in terms of desktop platforms, like the desktop that has persevered the longest, I think a lot of people would agree is Windows XP.

844
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,500
Yeah.

845
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,500
Oh, yes.

846
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,500
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

847
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:26,500
And now on the Linux side, it's going to be Unity 7 because you have this Unity 7 remix that's already in the works for 1804.

848
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:31,500
You have people running 1604 that I'm hearing from over – I mean, think about it.

849
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:36,500
If I'm getting over 100 emails about one topic, this can't be a small thing.

850
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,500
Right.

851
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,500
To me, I know it's an anecdotal thing, but to me that's a pretty big bellwether.

852
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:50,500
And so you're going to have Unity 7 without the negative connotations is the XP of the Linux desktop.

853
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,500
But what do we take –

854
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,500
I'm trying to decide if I agree with that or not.

855
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,500
What do we take away from that?

856
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,500
What we take away from that is users like stability.

857
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,500
They like to know where the gas pedal is at.

858
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,500
They like it when the gas pedal remains in the same place for years.

859
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:11,500
And developers like multiple years to work on something and iterate on something and ship something so they like super stable,

860
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:17,500
super easy to target platforms like Windows and like Unity 7.

861
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:23,500
There is a true user advantage to having something stay the same.

862
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,500
Look at Mac OS.

863
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:31,500
For all of the hype they get, it's been basically the same since the Mac OS.

864
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,500
For like 10 years.

865
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,500
Yeah.

866
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,500
Right.

867
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:41,500
And like we get really excited here on the show about new features, but Jane Doe out there doesn't care because you can still just open your window,

868
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,500
go to Facebook and use your computer.

869
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,500
What do you think, Noah?

870
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,500
I think the best thing about Linux is that we can have both.

871
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:55,500
I think that the people that want the latest and greatest thing, I think those people are more than welcome and able to stay on Arch.

872
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:03,500
But what you're saying and I think the really important thing here that even the people that want to be on Arch have to understand is when Microsoft goes to package Skype,

873
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,500
they don't sit down at the Grand Hyatt with a bunch of Arch users.

874
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:11,500
They sit down with Canonical and have a conversation about how they can target snap packages.

875
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:19,500
And if you can give Microsoft a here you go, target this particular thing, make this package and you'll get all of the Linux peoples.

876
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:26,500
If you can make it that simple for them instead of, well, we're going to target Ubuntu, but that changes every five years.

877
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,500
And then this happens.

878
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,500
And then there's a lot of people that use Arch because they don't have this problem with Canonical and some people don't like Unity.

879
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,500
So they're over Red Hat.

880
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,500
Right.

881
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,500
That just you get lost.

882
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,500
And it just and no, forget it.

883
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,500
We'll just not do Linux.

884
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,500
That's a mess.

885
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,500
We're not touching it.

886
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:47,500
I think things like everyone with Ubuntu or Canonical agreeing on GNOME and I think with the advent of universal packages,

887
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:51,500
I think we have a real shot at getting some some really great industry support.

888
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,500
And that will trickle down to Arch.

889
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:59,500
You know, those Arch guys are going to find a way to make anything that somebody targets for Ubuntu work on Arch.

890
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
And if it snaps, it's a done deal.

891
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,500
Yeah. You know how you know this is true.

892
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:14,500
If you want another interesting example you could cite is there is a likely reason that Valve chose Ubuntu 1204 and not Manjaro Linux for their Steam runtime.

893
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,500
You know, there's a reason there.

894
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:22,500
There's a reason why they chose Debian for Steam OS and not something that's like Fedora.

895
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,500
There is today as we record this.

896
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,500
Well, I shouldn't say that, but this is going to date a little bit.

897
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,500
I don't know if you guys saw this.

898
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,500
You know what?

899
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,500
Maybe we'll make this news.

900
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:39,500
This is a little newsy, but there is a major company that just announced their own Linux distribution.

901
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
And you guys know the company.

902
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
I have not seen this bit of news.

903
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,500
I guarantee you've never used their distribution.

904
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,500
I'm betting.

905
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,500
Actually, I can't guarantee it, but I'm betting because it's so new.

906
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,500
I bet you've never used their Linux distribution.

907
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,500
All right. Is that a good tease?

908
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,500
I'm excited.

909
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,500
A holiday tease, Wes.

910
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,500
All right.

911
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,500
You got me all excited.

912
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,500
Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,500
You go there, you support the show, and you sign up for a free seven day trial.

914
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,500
This is a good chance to try out the Linux Academy platform.

915
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Bang it around a little bit.

916
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,500
See what it can do.

917
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,500
Download some of the guides.

918
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
Listen to some of the study audio.

919
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,500
It's like a podcast that you can listen to to teach you about Linux.

920
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,500
Plus, they'll spin up virtual servers if you're ready to do that.

921
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,500
And one of the things I love is you choose very early on.

922
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:27,500
I want to base it all around Debian or Red Hat or Ubuntu.

923
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,500
There's more than seven distros you can choose from.

924
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,500
You choose the distribution, and then it will then modify the courseware.

925
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,500
So all the syntax and all of the language matches the right distro.

926
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,500
But behind the scenes, they also spin up the virtual servers on the backend

927
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,500
as the courseware dictates, and they match the distro you've chosen.

928
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:49,500
All these things that happen in the backend are all centered around that

929
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,500
because they truly get Linux users.

930
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,500
And they have human beings that are ready to help whenever you need it.

931
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,500
They're constantly adding new courseware to make your subscription more valuable.

932
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,500
And they have flashcards that are forked by a community.

933
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,500
So there's new things that are being contributed there to help you study constantly.

934
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,500
If you're going for certs, they've got courseware just for that.

935
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,500
And if you just want to learn more, they've got a really good system

936
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,500
where you can say how much time you've got, what you kind of want to go for,

937
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,500
and they'll work around all of that.

942
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,500
You have a guess?

943
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,500
I think you could guess this.

944
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,500
I'll give you a hint. I'll give you a hint, Wes.

945
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,500
It's a Seattle-based company.

946
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,500
So I was going to say Amazon.

947
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,500
Yeah, Amazon launched Amazon Linux 2.

948
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,500
I was going to say, I was like, they already have one, so that's not new.

949
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:49,500
So what they had before was their Linux AMI instance,

950
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,500
which you could deploy on Amazon infrastructure.

951
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Amazon Linux 2 is based on Red Hat Enterprise 7.

952
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,500
Hey, that's nice.

953
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,500
And I actually have a copy of it running upstairs

954
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:03,500
because they are distributing it for local on-premises deployment.

955
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,500
VMs, Docker, they're not releasing in ISO.

956
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,500
There's no website you go to download this.

957
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,500
You can't go to the Amazon website and download an ISO

958
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,500
and burn it to a thumb drive.

959
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,500
That's not who this is for.

960
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,500
No. You can go to Docker Hub and you can grab it.

961
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:21,500
This is a new way for companies to distribute Linux.

962
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,500
It is designed to run in a virtual environment

963
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,500
for on-premises development.

964
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,500
They're creating a VirtualBox, VMware, and a Hyper-V image.

965
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,500
So you can build locally.

966
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,500
You can run it in Docker or build on your VM,

967
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,500
and then you can deploy up on EC2, obviously,

968
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,500
using Amazon Linux 2.

969
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:43,500
Now, it is quote-unquote based on Red Hat Enterprise 7,

970
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,500
but I played around with it a little bit,

971
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:49,500
and it is so basic, bitch, you can't do anything.

972
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,500
Like, it doesn't even have PS, top, nothing.

973
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,500
All of the repos are pointed at Amazon servers,

974
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,500
so all of the updates, all of the packages,

975
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:01,500
and then they have like an Amazon Linux Extras repository,

976
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,500
which is going to have partner software,

977
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,500
like current partner software, whatever that might be.

978
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,500
That must be a feature, right, so that you can be like,

979
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,500
hey, we're an Amazon partner, you can get the latest software

980
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,500
if you're running the Amazon Linux.

981
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,500
Yeah, and then the other thing they're doing

982
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,500
is they're basing it around the Linux kernel 4.9,

983
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,500
which is an LTS release,

984
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,500
so this is going to be supported for five years.

985
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,500
This is an Amazon version of CentOS that's been pared down

986
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,500
with more up-to-date versions of GCC, bin utils,

987
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,500
Node.js, Python, like a bunch of the stuff.

988
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,500
It's making RHEL 7 relevant for right now.

989
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,500
RHEL 7 with modern application libraries and whatnot.

990
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,500
Interesting.

991
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,500
Yeah, available for on-premises deployment.

992
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,500
It's funny, too, because this is, like,

993
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,500
out of the Linuxes out there,

994
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,500
I'm sure Amazon Linux accounts for a huge number

995
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,500
and we just don't ever talk about it.

996
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,500
Oh, yeah, well, and think about this, too.

997
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,500
Like, you're sitting in some big meeting,

998
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,500
and you've got your CTO there and your CEO

999
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:00,500
and your developers and your art people,

1000
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,500
and you're all talking about this big application you're building.

1001
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,500
I have been in these meetings, and you're like,

1002
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,500
well, we got to definitely, like, back then,

1003
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,500
it was we got to run it on the Facebook platform.

1004
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,500
This is how old I am.

1005
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,500
We got to make sure this application runs on the Facebook platform.

1006
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,500
But today, you'd probably be talking about

1007
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,500
how you're going to be a huge success

1008
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,500
and you got to be able to scale

1009
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,500
and you got to be able to meet demand,

1010
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,500
and so you got to deploy it on EC2.

1011
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,500
So you can now write your applications on your LAN

1012
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:29,500
running in, like, I have it on my stupid Linux box upstairs in Docker.

1013
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,500
I've got Amazon Linux running right now.

1014
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,500
I could write applications on that,

1015
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,500
and then when I'm ready to deploy to the world,

1016
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,500
I upload the whole damn thing to Amazon,

1017
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,500
and it's the same exact thing I was running on my local machine.

1018
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,500
I wonder how much of an impact, like,

1019
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,500
I wonder what Ubuntu feels about this,

1020
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,500
because that's one of their big selling points, right?

1021
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,500
It's like you can run this everywhere,

1022
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,500
and they want to have that huge cloud presence.

1023
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,500
Noah, picture yourself for a moment.

1024
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,500
Like, this is years down the road.

1025
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,500
This is actually not going to happen,

1026
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,500
but picture for a moment you're down the road,

1027
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,500
and you're like, yeah, we're going to install Amazon Linux for you,

1028
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:04,500
because it is a free Amazon-backed version of Red Hat Enterprise 7.

1029
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,500
There's no way.

1030
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,500
I'm not seeing this at all.

1031
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,500
So here, there's a number of problems I see with this.

1032
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:14,500
The first is the reason why Amazon AWS is as big as it is

1033
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,500
is because people were able to download Ubuntu,

1034
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,500
get comfortable with it, build applications in it,

1035
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,500
and then that was a really easy way.

1036
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,500
It was way easier back in the day to run Ubuntu in the cloud

1037
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,500
than it was to run a Microsoft Windows server,

1038
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,500
and that accounted, I think, for a huge number of people

1039
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,500
that came over to things like AWS.

1040
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:37,500
Right, but that was pre-containers.

1041
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,500
That was also pre-AWS dominance, right?

1042
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,500
Like, if you're a startup.

1043
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,500
I'm not disagreeing with you fully.

1044
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,500
I'm just playing devil's advocate.

1045
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,500
I mean, if you think about it, like,

1046
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,500
you think about it in the terms of I'm going to deploy an application,

1047
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,500
a container.

1048
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,500
This application is going to be a container,

1049
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,500
and I'm going to put it up online as a container.

1050
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,500
You don't want all of Ubuntu in there.

1051
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:04,500
Dent, but what is the advantage of taking on the overhead

1052
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,500
of maintaining a software distribution

1053
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,500
if you're just going to run the software in a container anyway?

1054
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:13,500
Like, containers run just fine on Ubuntu stock,

1055
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
and that's somebody else's headache.

1056
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:19,500
But you need a Linux inside the container environment.

1057
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,500
You need, like, a minimal Linux in the container.

1058
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,500
The container itself is also, right?

1059
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,500
What do you think, Gwyn, right?

1060
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,500
Yes, that's true.

1061
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,500
I mean, I will also say Ubuntu does have pared down,

1062
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,500
you know, cloud versions.

1063
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,500
I will also say that, like, the overhead, I think,

1064
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,500
to Amazon is just so negligible,

1065
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,500
and I think it's also interesting to think about, like,

1066
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,500
here's Amazon employing, like, they have people doing this.

1067
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,500
Like, there are people employed to develop this Linux version.

1068
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,500
Yeah, yeah.

1069
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,500
I do kind of follow what Noah's saying, though.

1070
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,500
It's, like, what makes Ubuntu popular?

1071
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,500
I'm talking about the advantages.

1072
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,500
Well, I think the advantage is it's, like, a target.

1073
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,500
Also lock-in.

1074
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,500
Well, for Amazon, that's the advantage.

1075
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:59,500
But the advantage for a developer is this is an Amazon-backed target,

1076
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,500
and if I write to this and then I deploy on EC2,

1077
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,500
I'm almost guaranteed to have a good time.

1078
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,500
Imagine there'll be a lot of documentation.

1079
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,500
Right, exactly.

1080
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,500
So what's the advantage to Amazon?

1081
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,500
Well, if you're already going to deploy on EC2,

1082
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,500
you see what I'm saying?

1083
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,500
Like, say you were, like, building an application

1084
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,500
with the intention to host it on EC2, which is common.

1085
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,500
Oh, yeah.

1086
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,500
Once you've, like, management decided we are an AWS shop,

1087
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,500
and that's where you're at.

1088
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,500
Yeah, we're not running our own servers.

1089
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,500
We're not building a data center.

1090
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,500
We're an AWS shop.

1091
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,500
Very few companies, less than they should,

1092
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,500
but, like, very few are doing both Google or Azure.

1093
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,500
Most of them are all in on AWS, which we have seen from time to time.

1094
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,500
We have all witnessed that from time to time.

1095
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,500
And so this, to me, seems like it's, like, an insurance policy.

1096
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,500
Think about it from a business predictability standpoint.

1097
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:48,500
This is the Amazon Linux, which is actually called that,

1098
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:54,500
the Amazon Linux, which I'm going to run on the Amazon infrastructure.

1099
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,500
There probably also are actual optimizations.

1100
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,500
Like, already there are extra packages, extra drivers

1101
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,500
that you install when you run on AWS.

1102
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,500
This will come with those pre-shipped.

1103
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,500
They can tailor for their environment.

1104
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,500
And then you go one geek layer down, and you discover

1105
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,500
it's actually based on Red Hat Enterprise 7,

1106
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,500
which is also a super solid Linux.

1107
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,500
So, like, when you go down the stack, and then you go even further,

1108
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,500
and you go, oh, well, and then on top of that,

1109
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:21,500
it's based on the Linux kernel 4.9, which is an LTS release,

1110
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,500
and it ships with modern versions of Python, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, et cetera.

1111
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,500
It seems like there's a lot of vertical integration.

1112
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,500
So it's like Red Hat Enterprise 7, backed by Amazon,

1113
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,500
built for EC2 with modern backend packages.

1114
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:39,500
Jared, I guess I just keep hearing vendor lock-in.

1115
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,500
I guess that's what comes out to me.

1116
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Yeah, 100%, yeah.

1117
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,500
But I feel like the reality is there are corporations now

1118
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,500
that just, we decide we're a Google Apps company.

1119
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,500
We're an Amazon Web Services company.

1120
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,500
You and I, I don't know if you know who it is, Noah,

1121
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,500
but you and I have a listener of Ask Noah and this program,

1122
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,500
and their entire business, their entire desktops,

1123
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,500
all are hosted on Amazon.

1124
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,500
Like the management just said,

1125
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:08,500
we're going to do the Amazon remote desktop system,

1126
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,500
and everybody's just going to have a remote desktop powered by Amazon

1127
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,500
here at our company, and that's the entire fleet.

1128
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,500
Huh, that's interesting.

1129
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,500
Yeah, I guess I'm having a hard time seeing it,

1130
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:24,500
but I understand conceptually what you guys are saying.

1131
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,500
I wouldn't want to do it.

1132
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,500
I wouldn't want JB to do it.

1133
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,500
I'm not saying it's a good idea.

1134
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,500
But with the amount of developers that are going to be getting there,

1135
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,500
because people don't start on AWS, right?

1136
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,500
That's what the whole light sale thing was supposed to be about,

1137
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,500
was to try to get people started, because there's a lot of people that,

1138
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,500
like you said, unless they're already an AWS shop,

1139
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,500
the guy who has an idea, that guy isn't on AWS.

1140
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,500
He's on DigitalOcean, or he's on Voltaire.

1141
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,500
Or he's got a Ubuntu box or a Fedora box at home.

1142
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,500
Absolutely, spinning it up on his home.

1143
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,500
Or she, yeah.

1144
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:05,500
So, we've just about gotten to a discussion about pronouns.

1145
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,500
So then they...

1146
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,500
That's what I was going to say.

1147
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,500
If you're going to say she and he, then we'd better get in re and they and them.

1148
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:16,500
But anyway, so what you wind up with then is,

1149
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,500
where is the start of this?

1150
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,500
That only is going to apply to people that are starting with AWS.

1151
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,500
And maybe AWS has grown to the point that that's just the de facto standard now

1152
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,500
for any large scale thing.

1153
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,500
And so any company that's looking to host in the cloud is going to go,

1154
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,500
well, you know what, I can just start with this light sale thing,

1155
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:34,500
and if I need to scale, I can go from my $5 up to full on AWS.

1156
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,500
Maybe that's the thing.

1157
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,500
Like, I wonder how many times you're the person with the idea,

1158
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,500
and then you go to get VC funding.

1159
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,500
They're like, oh, you're on this DigitalOcean thing.

1160
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,500
You should probably build that on AWS, so we're not giving you the money.

1161
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,500
Or maybe, I mean, it feels like DigitalOcean is probably big enough.

1162
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,500
Any of your rack spaces, your DigitalOceans, they would probably be big enough.

1163
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,500
But like, oh, you've rolled your own infrastructure?

1164
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,500
Yeah, no way we're funding that.

1165
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,500
That definitely feels like a thing.

1166
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,500
I mean, I don't have a lot of personal experience with that.

1167
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,500
And they get you right.

1168
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,500
See, the other part about Amazon is they have all these managed services.

1169
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,500
So instead of like, you can be a guy with an idea,

1170
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,500
instead of hiring a DBA, you're like, well, we'll just pay money

1171
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,500
to have Amazon be our DBA.

1172
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:14,500
There is a, from the conversations I've had with a lot of different listeners,

1173
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:18,500
the situation they end up in is they need to get confidence

1174
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:23,500
in either an investor or a CTO or somebody who says,

1175
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,500
there's no way in hell that's going to work.

1176
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,500
And if you put a name on there, sometimes that name is IBM.

1177
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,500
Sometimes that name is Microsoft.

1178
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,500
And now more and more that name is Google or Amazon.

1179
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,500
The name changes, but it's that same idea.

1180
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,500
Oh, God, if that isn't true.

1181
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,500
Yeah.

1182
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,500
And when you put, yeah, well, we're going to be running this on Amazon's infrastructure.

1183
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:47,500
What that is shorthand for is we're going to be able to answer every web request,

1184
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:50,500
everything's going to be fast, and it's going to stay up all the time,

1185
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,500
and somebody else is going to manage all of the IT aspects.

1186
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,500
That's shorthand for we're running on EC2, it's not our problem.

1187
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:02,500
And that is predictable risk to investors and to companies and to small businesses,

1188
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,500
and that's why it's appealing.

1189
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,500
I'm not saying it's a good idea.

1190
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,500
Right, whether or not that's true or makes sense for particular cases or not.

1191
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,500
Yeah, because all that could be true with just Ubuntu stock.

1192
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,500
All that could be true with...

1193
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,500
100%.

1194
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,500
Yep.

1195
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:18,500
Dude, if you had a great IT team that had been obviously rocking it for years,

1196
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,500
where you could even just like quoting tickets or bug fixes,

1197
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,500
where you could say, look at our team, they're just crushing it for years and years and years,

1198
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,500
it doesn't matter to these people.

1199
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:31,500
That's been my take, is there is value in the brand name.

1200
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:36,500
There's value in going with the trend, even if it doesn't ultimately work out,

1201
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,500
which is a sick, perverse aspect of this industry.

1202
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,500
It's really kind of gross.

1203
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,500
Well, we see it.

1204
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,500
We see it in programming languages, we see it all over the place, right?

1205
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,500
Whatever is hot now, if that's not what you're doing, you should not trust it.

1206
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,500
Yeah, yeah.

1207
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:51,500
I don't like it.

1208
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,500
All right, well, let's talk about something positive.

1209
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,500
Let's wrap this up on like a more positive aspect of it.

1210
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:01,500
So this year, I think, if I'm doing my math right, you and I will hit 250,

1211
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,500
where we have a lot of things...

1212
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,500
Oh, boy.

1213
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,500
We have a lot of things in store.

1214
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:10,500
No, I know that when you and I were doing the last Linux action show,

1215
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,500
I think you and I both agreed like we finally filmed last the way we would like to film it,

1216
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:17,500
where we had a camera on Noah, we had a camera on me.

1217
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:21,500
We just sat back and we just did whatever the F we wanted to do,

1218
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,500
and the cameras were just rolling.

1219
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:29,500
What's funny, if you go ask audience members, they will agree with this.

1220
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:35,500
The best episode was probably the least planned Linux action show we ever did,

1221
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,500
at least you and I together.

1222
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,500
We ever did the least planned one.

1223
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,500
We had like a general idea what we were going to talk about,

1224
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,500
and you prepped the news stories, but that was it.

1225
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:47,500
Then we sat down and the entire main segment, it was second to last.

1226
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,500
I don't know if you remember this, but after we got done with the very last one,

1227
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,500
we went back and said, man, we almost should have just called it at the second to last one,

1228
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,500
because that was such a good episode.

1229
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,500
I do remember.

1230
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,500
You're right.

1231
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,500
It was just that completely laid back, let's just have a discussion,

1232
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,500
not necessarily unlike what we're doing today, and it wound up a great episode.

1233
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:09,500
We're working on... I don't know if we'll get there.

1234
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,500
250 may be too ambitious, because I want to crowdfund it.

1235
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:16,500
I want to crowdfund it, if possible, because it's always been...

1236
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:22,500
I always want to... this is... for me, I don't do this for the money.

1237
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:26,500
I do it because I want to make content, and I want to have a connection with the audience,

1238
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:33,500
and I just always feel like crowdfunding is sort of the third piece to that.

1239
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,500
It's this ideal of it makes sense in the feedback.

1240
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,500
So I set 250 as sort of our goal to see if we could get there.

1241
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:43,500
Put a couple of cameras in here, and you and I just hanging out.

1242
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,500
Today we're drinking... what is this?

1243
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,500
I'm drinking a Black Butte porter from Deuces.

1244
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,500
And what are you drinking?

1245
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:54,500
We also have Pray for Snow, a winter ale from Ten Barrel.

1246
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,500
So we'll be sitting back, maybe drinking a beer, hanging out.

1247
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,500
It'd be a really nice behind-the-scenes kind of version,

1248
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,500
not like the green screen, not with the studio lights.

1249
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:06,500
That's what we're trying to get with Linux unplugged and 250,

1250
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:11,500
to keep the low-key audio show, but give people something to watch

1251
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,500
if they're watching on their Kodi Vox.

1252
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,500
Feel closer to us.

1253
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,500
They're watching on YouTube, something like that.

1254
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,500
So that's kind of our goal.

1255
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,500
I'm kind of curious, Noah, if we could get a little preview

1256
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,500
of where you've thought about Ask Noah going in the next year.

1257
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,500
I mean, I know you're moving to a new lifetime.

1258
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,500
You're going to be following up.

1259
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,500
Is that right?

1260
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,500
Yeah, it's going to be us and then Noah.

1261
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,500
So if you come in on Tuesdays, you're going to get up and ask Noah back-to-back.

1262
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,500
That's going to be killer, I think.

1263
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,500
It's going to be like a Linux Tuesday.

1264
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,500
So that's coming down the pipe for Ask Noah.

1265
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,500
But what else do you feel like is coming down the pipe for 2018

1266
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,500
and the Ask Noah program?

1267
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:46,500
Anyone that knows me or has been around me more than a week

1268
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,500
has probably figured this out.

1269
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,500
If you're looking for somebody that's going to change a lot of stuff,

1270
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,500
I'm not the guy for that.

1271
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:57,500
I'm very much a once I get into the swing of something, I'm fine.

1272
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:01,500
Now, interestingly enough, I have moved the entire Ask Noah studio

1273
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,500
into my basement.

1274
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,500
Really?

1275
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,500
Yeah.

1276
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,500
I had a hint of that when we took five and you're like,

1277
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,500
oh, little Noah just came down here to hang out with me.

1278
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:12,500
And I'm like, what?

1279
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,500
What?

1280
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,500
You're not at the office?

1281
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,500
You didn't go across like five miles of snow?

1282
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,500
What's going on?

1283
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,500
Yeah.

1284
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:24,500
So what happened was I broke down and the guys that worked for me

1285
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:28,500
did a really fantastic job kind of setting up a studio

1286
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:29,500
and programming all the stuff.

1287
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:30,500
And they can handle all the technical stuff.

1288
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,500
That's great.

1289
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:35,500
What they don't understand, what they don't know how to do,

1290
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:39,500
the acoustics and the psychoacoustics.

1291
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,500
So when you speak into a microphone...

1292
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,500
I'm sorry.

1293
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,500
I'm sorry.

1294
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,500
What?

1295
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,500
Okay.

1296
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,500
Okay.

1297
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,500
Acoustics and psychoacoustics.

1298
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,500
That's a new field of science.

1299
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,500
Noah has a...

1300
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,500
I'm just a podcaster.

1301
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,500
No, I'm not a radio guy.

1302
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,500
Right.

1303
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,500
Well, no, it's anyone that likes audio.

1304
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,500
You're in a high quality audio, so you understand this.

1305
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:00,500
So there's a difference between saying and found that the right

1306
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,500
compression ratio is two to one and the gate should be this

1307
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,500
and the trim should be this and this should be this.

1308
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,500
That's one way to do it.

1309
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,500
And you can make something sound reasonably good.

1310
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:13,500
It's entirely different when you have a studio engineer

1311
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:17,500
that has spent his entire life training his ears to have you

1312
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,500
sit down in front of a microphone and talk into that microphone

1313
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,500
and say the EQ needs to be adjusted just a little bit here.

1314
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,500
Oh, yeah.

1315
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:25,500
I see what you're saying.

1316
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,500
I'm like 10 years into that process.

1317
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:28,500
I think I've got another 10 years to go.

1318
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,500
There's the tech side and there's the actual end result quality.

1319
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,500
I've got to be like 20, 30 years deep into this business.

1320
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,500
So I don't want to wait 20 or 30 years to be able to actually

1321
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,500
do that, and so I just hired somebody.

1322
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,500
And so these guys are coming in.

1323
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,500
What they're doing right now, why I had to get the studio out

1324
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,500
of the studio, is first they are treating the wall.

1325
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,500
So they're putting things in the corner and they're putting

1326
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,500
things over flat walls and they're using special paint and they

1327
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,500
are putting in special ceiling tiles and we're getting special

1328
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:57,500
lights and stuff that are aimed specifically at the control

1329
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,500
surfaces and they don't reflect onto the VU meters.

1330
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:04,500
We have an overbridge, I think they call it.

1331
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:08,500
Basically, the meters go left to right instead of up to down.

1332
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,500
So I'm looking at them straight on.

1333
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,500
Oh, nice.

1334
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,500
So I can keep my audio level consistent.

1335
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,500
But to do all of that, we had to take everything out of the studio.

1336
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,500
They are running special conduit in the ceilings for all of the

1337
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,500
audio lines and they're running a line to my office.

1338
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,500
So I can have a microphone and a set of headphones in there.

1339
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,500
That way, if I'm busy or doing something, I can just dial into

1340
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,500
the studio and say, okay, I'll just do the show from here tonight.

1341
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,500
I'm getting worked up.

1342
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,500
I'm getting turned on right now, dude.

1343
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,500
You are turning me on right now.

1344
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,500
This is hot, dude.

1345
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,500
This is great.

1346
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,500
So they're dealing with all this and obviously they're going

1347
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,500
through and showing how to use my audio console that I bought.

1348
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:49,500
So all of those things are happening and we're hoping that it

1349
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,500
was only going to be done for two weeks.

1350
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,500
Now with Christmas and I'm going to be gone for this funeral and

1351
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,500
it's looking like it's going to be closer to like a month.

1352
01:10:56,500 --> 01:11:00,500
So that's probably not be done until after the New Year and after

1353
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,500
the time change and all of that.

1354
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,500
Can I ask you something?

1355
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,500
Yeah.

1356
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,500
I mean, before you tell me before it's done, I mean, just to

1357
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:09,500
lead up, like as a tease, I mean, it's a holiday special.

1358
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,500
Will you share with the class?

1359
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:13,500
Like, I mean, what does this cost if I wanted to do something

1360
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,500
like this, like for the main studio here?

1361
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,500
Like, what am I looking at?

1362
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,500
Is it a Bitcoin?

1363
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:21,500
Put it in the terms of Bitcoin.

1364
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,500
Is it a Bitcoin?

1365
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,500
It's not cheap.

1366
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,500
Is it a Bitcoin?

1367
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,500
It's not.

1368
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,500
It's not quite a Bitcoin.

1369
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:30,500
It was a couple thousand to have to have them come in and do that.

1370
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,500
And then the engineer just said to have him come in and for his

1371
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,500
time, I think he was charging me 250 an hour or something like

1372
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,500
that to help programs, which it wasn't.

1373
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,500
I wasn't terrible.

1374
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:44,500
The thing I spent far more money in equipment that I have.

1375
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,500
You know, it's funny, too.

1376
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,500
I get requests all the time.

1377
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,500
People are like, oh, show me the inside of the studio.

1378
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,500
I'm scared.

1379
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,500
I'm scared to show.

1380
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,500
People will think because here's the thing.

1381
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,500
I look nuts.

1382
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:55,500
Well, it changes all the time.

1383
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,500
It's like you do it.

1384
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:59,500
If you did something two weeks ago or a month ago, it's a totally

1385
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,500
different studio now.

1386
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,500
I mean, that happens here.

1387
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,500
And this is a fairly static setup.

1388
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,500
Really, at least equipment wise, really hasn't changed much at all

1389
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,500
since I started.

1390
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,500
But I didn't mean to interrupt you.

1391
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,500
Go ahead and finish up.

1392
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,500
Where were you going with this?

1393
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,500
Because I mean, I just this is a remarkable investment that you're

1394
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,500
doing.

1395
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,500
And we're going to have to move to North Dakota ASAP.

1396
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,500
I mean, as soon as the snow melts, I'm going to be out there to do

1397
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,500
all my podcasting, basically.

1398
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:26,500
It's actually funny you say that because one of the things that we

1399
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,500
did when we built the studio.

1400
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,500
So the second for those that don't know, we had I have I have two

1401
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:32,500
studios.

1402
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:36,500
I had one that I put together myself and I set it up as specific.

1403
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,500
It was the entire thing was constructed top to bottom to centered

1404
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,500
around the Linux action show.

1405
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,500
So everything that I tried to match the dimensions that.

1406
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,500
On me, so I would have the same amount of space behind me as your

1407
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,500
single camera has on you.

1408
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,500
And we know we talked early on, we said, OK, dark backgrounds are

1409
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,500
very difficult for the encoder to process.

1410
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:59,500
So I went with a plain white wall and just hung some pictures like

1411
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,500
everything was designed around last.

1412
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,500
Well, the problem with that is because I was on camera because I

1413
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:06,500
wanted to look like it's similar to you as possible.

1414
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,500
That meant that the audio board and everything was on the other side

1415
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,500
of the room.

1416
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,500
And so when you're doing a radio show and you have people that are

1417
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:14,500
calling in or I want to bring somebody out on mumble or I want to

1418
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,500
mute somebody who has their car horn.

1419
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,500
Hey, this is you and I just went through this for Linux Fest Northwest.

1420
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,500
We redid the whole studio around audio.

1421
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,500
Yeah, right. I totally know what you're doing better.

1422
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,500
Yep. Yep. Yes.

1423
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,500
And what's funny was actually that was a large inspiration for this.

1424
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,500
In fact, if you notice, that's when I decided to do a second studio

1425
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:35,500
because once we completed your studio, I just found myself wanting

1426
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,500
to sit down there and work all the time.

1427
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,500
In fact, you got to be a joke with Rick.

1428
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:39,500
I can ask him about this.

1429
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,500
I for whatever reason.

1430
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,500
The first word I say on the air, what's the first word I say when I

1431
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,500
start the as no show?

1432
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,500
I don't know. That's the first word.

1433
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,500
So I don't know what the first word I'm trying to think of it.

1434
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:53,500
I'm trying to think of you always have to say, yeah, you live from

1435
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,500
Alta speed, right?

1436
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,500
Live.

1437
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:56,500
It's always live.

1438
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,500
Sometimes it's Alta speed.

1439
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,500
Sometimes it's somewhere else.

1440
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,500
Oh, the first word is always left.

1441
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:04,500
And so when I started to when I was testing live, live, live,

1442
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,500
live, right, right.

1443
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,500
And so I was doing all the different stuff.

1444
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,500
Check, check, check.

1445
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:13,500
I started making fun of me because he'd come into the studio and there

1446
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,500
I am.

1447
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,500
And I just I used to say like a little, you know, the first intro,

1448
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,500
whatever, just as something to say that I could test it with.

1449
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:21,500
And then it just got shortened to live.

1450
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:26,500
So then he started coming in, walking up to Mike and going live.

1451
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,500
Oh, man.

1452
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,500
You know what I do?

1453
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,500
I do too, too.

1454
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:34,500
I used to be one, two, three, one, two, three.

1455
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:39,500
But the thing is, is that to two has the loudest punch, right?

1456
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,500
And that's really that's all I needed.

1457
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,500
So I just shorten it now.

1458
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,500
And I sit down and I sit.

1459
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,500
I get to the mic and I get my headphones on.

1460
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,500
I get the mixer turned on.

1461
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:50,500
I go to to to ever live.

1462
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:53,500
I sound ridiculous.

1463
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:56,500
The engineer that I'm working with says to use the word toast because

1464
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:00,500
it apparently contains all of the things that you would all of like the

1465
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:04,500
A and the O and the A and the and then like you said, the plosives at the

1466
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,500
beginning and the end.

1467
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,500
So apparently toast is a really good.

1468
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,500
I got to give you one of these.

1469
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,500
I got it.

1470
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:12,500
I have been thinking about hiring a consultant from Guitar Center to come

1471
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:16,500
in just because I mean, otherwise what I end up doing is I end up

1472
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,500
stacking all of these project was all like I'll have like 10 projects

1473
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,500
when Noah gets here for Linux fast.

1474
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,500
And we just we don't really hang out.

1475
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,500
We just go crazy.

1476
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:29,500
And I'm like, what if I hired a consultant and I had this guy come in

1477
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,500
and he just solved all these problems and Noah showed up and there was

1478
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:33,500
nothing to do.

1479
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,500
Like what would we do?

1480
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,500
Wow.

1481
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,500
You know, we do.

1482
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,500
We don't know.

1483
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,500
You and I would hang out.

1484
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,500
First thing we do is we get Indian food.

1485
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,500
That's the first thing we would do is we go get the helium Indian food

1486
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,500
of taste of Indian taste of India.

1487
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,500
Mount Vernon, Washington.

1488
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,500
Go there is the best food of your life.

1489
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,500
It'll heal your body.

1490
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,500
Taste of India.

1491
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,500
Mount Vernon, Washington.

1492
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,500
Go there.

1493
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:52,500
Even if you don't go there.

1494
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,500
Go on Yelp and give them a good review, please.

1495
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:58,500
Because it is it is necessary for Noah and I to continue doing these shows

1496
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,500
that that place exists.

1497
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,500
Can I?

1498
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:01,500
Hey, Noah.

1499
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:02,500
This is not related to the show at all.

1500
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,500
But I really have been wanting to tell you this because I feel like

1501
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,500
you'll understand.

1502
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:10,500
I have developed a new routine that I think you will completely agree with

1503
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,500
Thursday or Friday.

1504
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,500
Can we go back to your can we go back to your ad for the Indian place and

1505
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,500
just do they have a dashboard?

1506
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,500
No, they don't have a dashboard for days.

1507
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,500
They have a menu.

1508
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:23,500
They they do have a menu, but they don't even take online fashion.

1509
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,500
I got a couple of other sponsors.

1510
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,500
They could build that dashboard this Friday.

1511
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,500
I called them.

1512
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:32,500
And as the phone is ringing, I mouth I say to Hadi, I'm like, this is the

1513
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:36,500
only restaurant I'm willing to call if they don't like if like today we got

1514
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:39,500
burgers before the show and we got burgers because I could order the burgers

1515
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,500
online.

1516
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:45,500
I just the thing is, if I order over the phone, it adds more possibility for

1517
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,500
air.

1518
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,500
I don't have a problem with talking to people on the phone.

1519
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,500
I'm fine with talking to people.

1520
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,500
It is the the back and forth.

1521
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:56,500
The bandwidth of the phone is not sufficient for the resolution is not

1522
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,500
sufficient for people to hear my order sufficiently.

1523
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,500
And so they often screw it up.

1524
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:04,500
I mean, I'm being generous, but I assume this is the problem is that phones

1525
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:05,500
are low bandwidth.

1526
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:09,500
And so if I ordered online, there's the onus is completely on them to fuck it

1527
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:09,500
up.

1528
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,500
You know what I'm saying?

1529
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,500
And it's very easy for you to review, ensure everything is correct.

1530
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,500
In fact, which we did.

1531
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:17,500
I reviewed with you in the beard before we placed the order today on the

1532
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:17,500
phone.

1533
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:21,500
So Taste of India is the only place I'm willing to actually call because it

1534
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,500
is restorative food that actually heals my body.

1535
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,500
So I'm willing to call them.

1536
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,500
So I call them up and I have a typical order now.

1537
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:30,500
And I think you'll appreciate this, Noah, as I order three butter chicken,

1538
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,500
two garlic naan and one chicken tiki masala.

1539
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,500
And I eat one of them that order.

1540
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:41,500
I like at lunch and then I save the rest for like the whole weekend.

1541
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:44,500
I'm eating Indian food, but it's all in the fridge.

1542
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:47,500
And I just go to it as necessary.

1543
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,500
And I'll even go breakfast.

1544
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:50,500
I'll even do breakfast.

1545
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:55,500
Noah about Indian food is it fills you up and you stay filled up like

1546
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,500
anyone that eats Chinese.

1547
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,500
You know how you eat it and then like four hours later, you're hungry

1548
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:58,500
again.

1549
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,500
That never happens to me with Indian food.

1550
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:04,500
Like if I eat if I get filled up, I'm full for a day.

1551
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:04,500
Yeah.

1552
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,500
Yeah.

1553
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,500
There's actual anti-inflammatories in Indian food as well.

1554
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,500
So depending on the ones you get.

1555
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,500
So if you get butter chicken, there's anti-inflammatories in there.

1556
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,500
That seems like a good thing to me, Wes.

1557
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,500
And, you know, when you're sitting there typing all the time, you get

1558
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,500
the carpal tunnel, eat some Indian food.

1559
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,500
I'm just saying maybe it helps drink a little beer.

1560
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,500
Indian food could be the perfect recipe for the Linux user.

1561
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:28,500
I could be wrong, but I suspect it's true.

1562
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:32,500
So here's what I decided is next time Noah comes out, we got to have

1563
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,500
the least amount of work possible.

1564
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,500
No projects here.

1565
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,500
And well, that's never going to happen.

1566
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,500
I don't think.

1567
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,500
But maybe you can do the projects you want to do.

1568
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:43,500
If I came out there and there was nothing to do, you and I would invent

1569
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,500
something to do like we would start a new project.

1570
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,500
That's what happened.

1571
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:49,500
Yeah, like build an audio studio in the RV.

1572
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,500
And the other the other project that I wouldn't mind now that we're now

1573
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,500
we're now this is really a holiday special.

1574
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,500
We're going off the rails here.

1575
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,500
But the other project I wouldn't mind is building an audio studio at

1576
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,500
Wes's house.

1577
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,500
Oh, yeah.

1578
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,500
Because Wes is doing more and more stuff.

1579
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,500
It's more and more of an ask for Wes to come up to Arlington because

1580
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,500
he lives in Seattle like a maniac.

1581
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,500
That's right.

1582
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:10,500
So, you know, a little sound booth with like a nice dynamic microphone.

1583
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,500
That sounds really great.

1584
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:12,500
Yeah.

1585
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,500
So there's got that down to us.

1586
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,500
We could bang that out here.

1587
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,500
So anyway, I want to I just want to finish one last thing up and then

1588
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,500
then we can move on.

1589
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,500
But so you were saying you're saying, I want to come to North Dakota.

1590
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,500
So interestingly, one of the things I made sure to do when we were

1591
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:29,500
putting this together was we built it future proof.

1592
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:33,500
So we I only need four channels realistically to do the show.

1593
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,500
I need my mic.

1594
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,500
I need the phones.

1595
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:41,500
I need the if I have a remote guest and I need the the music bed stuff.

1596
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:47,500
And but but we built it with 16 16 inputs.

1597
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,500
And I think we've got eight.

1598
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,500
No, we got 12 outputs.

1599
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,500
So we can do basically an unlimited.

1600
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,500
And then with the software drivers that allow us to pull audio in and out,

1601
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,500
we can do basically an unlimited amount of mixed minuses.

1602
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:04,500
And so and the reason that I we splurged to get the extra capacity was if

1603
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,500
the day ever comes where you call me up and say, I'm going to do shows

1604
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,500
from the road and beer doesn't live in the studio anymore.

1605
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:15,500
So I need some place to remote into to put all of the people together or whatever.

1606
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,500
We can accommodate.

1607
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,500
Oh, man, we're halfway there already.

1608
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:20,500
Right, right.

1609
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,500
So you want to come to Grand Fork.

1610
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,500
Not only can you come to Grand Forks, you come to shows from here.

1611
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,500
You know, well, it's nice and warm.

1612
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:25,500
We go to the lake, whatever.

1613
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,500
You can do shows on the road on the way here.

1614
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,500
Oh, man.

1615
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,500
Man, isn't that going to be something, Noah?

1616
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:31,500
That'll be that's great.

1617
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:32,500
That's great.

1618
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,500
Because Beard's actually as we record the special holiday edition of the

1619
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,500
Unplugged program, he's over there packing up right now.

1620
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:42,500
The Beard's moving out and it's a new era for the studio.

1621
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,500
I mean, it's a little empty nest syndrome here.

1622
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:47,500
So it is, it is.

1623
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,500
Your baby has grown up and moved out.

1624
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,500
Yeah, yeah, man.

1625
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:51,500
Yeah, it's true.

1626
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:52,500
It's true.

1627
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,500
You're going to show up here in the morning, getting a bunch of work done all alone.

1628
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,500
No one to complain to, no one to gripe about.

1629
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:58,500
That's actually been so nice.

1630
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,500
Just off the record.

1631
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:04,500
But at the same time, like it's lonely.

1632
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,500
Pantsless in the studio.

1633
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:10,500
Like now, now I go from like, you know, home to here and I don't talk to anybody.

1634
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,500
I just have my dog, Levi, me and Levi at the studio.

1635
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,500
So I'm going to have to come visit Noah.

1636
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,500
Good thing you got him.

1637
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:19,500
I'm glad Noah built all this because I'm going to have to go, I'm going to have to either

1638
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,500
hit the road to visit with listeners or I'm going to have to go move to Grand Forks.

1639
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,500
If it wasn't for Wes coming up here every now and then to do this show, I'd just, I'd

1640
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,500
be totally alone.

1641
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:30,500
And yet I'm perfectly okay with that.

1642
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:37,500
I am not a big, I'm not, I've never been big on like the walk and talk at work and bumping

1643
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,500
people into the, into the hallway.

1644
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,500
Because when I was-

1645
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1646
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,500
Okay.

1647
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:43,500
You must have not worked in a big office because-

1648
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,500
Oh, I did.

1649
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,500
Bump into people at work.

1650
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,500
It's bump into people at the copier.

1651
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,500
Or, or-

1652
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,500
Or the water thing.

1653
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:50,500
Or the water thing.

1654
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:54,500
Or just the hallway from the lunchroom to the IT room was the, I just, it was the land

1655
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,500
mine of IT requests that were never documented.

1656
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:02,500
So, I developed this instinctual like, I don't want to have a conversation.

1657
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:06,500
I want to walk from the lunchroom to my desk and sit down and get my job done because if

1658
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,900
you talk to me, you're not putting in a ticket and then I can't track it.

1659
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,540
I can't account for it and I'll forget to do it.

1660
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:21,500
And so I developed like this, this weird anti like, like bump into each other and just hang

1661
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,540
out and chat at the workplace.

1662
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:26,580
And yet at the same time, I find it to be one of the most valuable sources of creative

1663
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:28,420
inspiration and discussion.

1664
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:31,780
And so it's, it'll be like something I miss the most and something that'll be the most

1665
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:36,720
like, not beneficial, but like I've been missing it.

1666
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:41,340
Like just the total solitude, no, like nobody interrupts my thought process.

1667
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:44,980
At the same time, I will miss the creative exchange of ideas and all of that.

1668
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:47,660
So I'll just have to come hang out with you at work, Wes.

1669
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:48,660
Yeah, absolutely.

1670
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:49,660
That feel good?

1671
01:22:49,660 --> 01:22:50,660
That feels good?

1672
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:51,660
Yeah.

1673
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:52,660
All right.

1674
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,100
Oh, well, I think that's it.

1675
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:56,060
I think, I think we've done our holiday due diligence.

1676
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:57,060
Yeah.

1677
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:58,780
I hope you've had a good, did you enjoy your holiday burger?

1678
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,260
Oh, very much so.

1679
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:01,260
What about you Noah?

1680
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:04,020
Did you do any holiday related festivities over there in Grand Fork?

1681
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:07,020
Did you have some mistletoe or something in the office?

1682
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:09,020
I mean, come on, I need something.

1683
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:13,100
I actually, I have a new thing that I'm implementing at UltraSpeed this year and it's called Mistle

1684
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:15,100
Foe instead of Mistletoe.

1685
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:19,420
And so basically what we're going to do is we're hanging mistletoe up and you have to

1686
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:20,420
fight.

1687
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:23,580
If you find yourself under the mistletoe, then you have to fight.

1688
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:29,300
Well, I think it's, it's just in the, you know, in the spirit, you get, get all your

1689
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:32,820
rage and aggression out and you go into the new year friends again.

1690
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:35,740
We have the worst Christmas music ever right here.

1691
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:36,740
There you go.

1692
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:37,740
Boom.

1693
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:38,740
Actually, sorry.

1694
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:39,740
It's not Christmas.

1695
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:40,740
It's holiday music.

1696
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:46,060
It's, we have the worst holiday music ever and we have you, we have me, we have Noah.

1697
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:47,060
It feels pretty good.

1698
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:49,620
The only thing that's missing is the lug, but yeah, this was a special edition.

1699
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:50,820
I hope they're all at home.

1700
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:51,820
They're all.

1701
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:52,820
Yeah.

1702
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,700
Having to go put themselves out and help us.

1703
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:55,700
Yeah.

1704
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:56,700
They get to relax with their family.

1705
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:57,700
Put on some Linux.

1706
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,820
And totally enjoy a random show they never expected.

1707
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:02,260
It's just been recorded to, to just.

1708
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:03,260
Our little present.

1709
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:04,260
Nobody knows.

1710
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:06,220
It's our present from, from us to the audience.
