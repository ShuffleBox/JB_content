WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Actually, you know what I got that's a really interesting...

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
I wonder if anybody in the Mumba Room has any experience with any of this crap.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I got one of these, uh...

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Logitech Harmony...

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Logitech Harmony Hub.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
My dad got this for me for my birthday last week.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
And, uh...

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
So it's a puck-looking thing.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
And it has...

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Basically like a thousand IR blasters in it that shoot off in every direction.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
And you then pair it with a...

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
Whatever. You could just use the app or you pair it with like an Alexa or you can actually control it from a Roku or...

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Lots of things.

00:43.000 --> 00:52.000
And it allows you to voice control your television and your DVR and your...

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Internet media set-top box, whatever it might be.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
And, uh...

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I don't know how much it is because like I said it was a gift.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
But, uh...

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I just got it.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
And now I'm wondering how the hell I set it up.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Here, they've got a little thing on it.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Yeah!

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
One-touch control because everyone wants touchscreen.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Who wants to use touchscreen controls for their...

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I do, I do.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Hello, Wes!

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
We've got to get, like, oily fingerprints on the screen. Come on.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
Like, I want to be able to control my TV with physical buttons.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Like, I want to be able to feel them.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Or my voice, I would take that.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
If the thing had good enough mics to pick me up.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
So this would use the Alexa to...

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
So the Alexa would be the front end of the Harmony Hub.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
I just got the Harmony Hub as a gift.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
And it does basically...

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
It is like this huge IR blaster.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
And so you kind of put it in the middle of your entertainment system.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
And it blasts out all directions to control your different devices and stuff.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
When it comes with a bunch of apps that you can use.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.000
You know when someone doesn't have an Amazon Echo or an Echo Dot is when they're quite confident in saying Alexa out loud.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Oh, you're right.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
No, I've got one in this room.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I've got one in this room.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
I should know better.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
I'm working on it.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
I really am.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
I'm trying to say Echo.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I'm also trying not to say, okay, googs.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
You know, I'm trying...

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
And also, hey, s-word.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I'm trying not to do any of that stuff because...

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
I find myself saying it like prudes from the past say the word sex, like under their breath.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
That's what I do too, usually.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
My son...

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
My daughter's...

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
I was just going to say my daughter's been figuring out where she can use the word so that it doesn't trigger.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Yeah.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
My son's been...

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
And she's figured out if it's mid-sentence, she can get away with it.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
But it can't be at the beginning or the end of the sentence.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Yeah.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
And when she's talking about it, she calls it Lexi.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Oh, that's good.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
I have noticed that my kids have adopted the a-word.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
They say the a-word, which is funny because that could mean other things.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
But to them, it means Alexa.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
You know what I mean?

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
Wouldn't it be cool if Amazon had thought of this beforehand and called it a different name than Alexa?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Well, I mean, how common is that name?

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
I had the most fun with this, though, because I successfully trolled a friend of mine by giving him an Echo Dot.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
And his wife's name is Alexa.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
No!

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
That's awesome.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
No!

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
What are the chances?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
I didn't think it was that common of a name.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
No, neither did I.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
But as soon as I...

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
I was like, hang on a minute.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
And he's also called Martin.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I was like, Martin's wife is called Alexa.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
This is too much fun.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
That's incredible.

03:27.000 --> 03:44.000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 182 for January 31st, 2017.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's so awash in new Linux hardware,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
we're not sure where to start the reviews first.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
My name is Chris.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
My name is Wes.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Hello there, Wes.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Hello.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
What a nice piece of shiny hardware you have sitting next to you.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
We'll be talking about later on in the show today.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
It's very nice.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Yes.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
Yes, and we've got a good show today later on, too, with the part that I'm looking forward to the most.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
We're going to hack Popey's server live on the show.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
We're going to hack Popey Riot live on the show.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
We're going to do that.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
And, of course, we'll do some open source project updates, chat a little new hardware.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
There's some big, big things on the horizon that I'm working on that I want to talk to you guys about.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Pick your brains about a little bit.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Ryan's here from System76 to make us drool over one of their new rigs.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Nice.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
I know.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I'm drooling already.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Whoops.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
You know what, Wes?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
It's good to have you back.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
I missed you last week.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
It is a pleasure to be back.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
I was sad to be gone.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
You always give me.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
You always give me.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
So, yeah, we've got a whole bunch of good stuff to go over.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Plus, we've got the hack, and we've got the new hardware.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
But bigger than all of that, Wes is back, and he brought us an Oaked Maple hard cider.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
I don't even know what that is.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
I'm not.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Yep.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I think it's apples, right?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
It's got to be.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
But it's so delicious.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
It's a semi-sweet Seattle-based cider he brought us.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
Oaked chips and back sweetened with pure Vermont maple syrup.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Okay.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Interesting.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Shut up.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
It really is maple syrup.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Yeah.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
So it's a Vermont maple syrup beer that we're drinking from Seattle.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I'll take it.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I'll take it.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
All right.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Well, we have many things to get into this week here on Yard Linux Unplugged.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
So let's bring in our virtual lug.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Time-appropriate greetings, Mamoru.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Hello.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Hello.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Oh, man.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Hello, guys.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
That's amazing.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Yes.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Good.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Every time.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
It gets it every single time.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
You can have cider made out of other things, Sweetland.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
You can have...

05:32.000 --> 05:34.160
In fact, hard cherry cider is a real thing.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.160
It is real.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.160
Oh, yeah.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.160
I'm just used to apple cider.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.160
Yeah.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.160
Apple cider, I think, is probably...

05:39.160 --> 05:40.160
Yeah.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.160
Pear cider.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.160
That's another one.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.160
Yeah.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.160
Yeah.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.160
But that's not what we're here to talk about today.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.160
We've got some Linux things.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.160
We do.

05:47.160 --> 05:48.160
We do.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.160
I've had a very interesting week in Linux.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.880
I've been going on and on and on about this building this bulletproof Linux workstation

05:52.880 --> 05:53.880
for me.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.240
Just one or two of my systems that I want to last for like five years.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.600
I'm trying not to talk about it too much because I know not everybody cares, but it's really

05:59.600 --> 06:06.640
been what I've been living for almost two, three weeks now, actually, because it started

06:06.640 --> 06:08.640
when I had an Arch crash.

06:08.640 --> 06:09.640
Ooh.

06:09.640 --> 06:10.640
Yeah.

06:10.640 --> 06:11.640
Right in the middle of a project.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.800
And then it just sort of got me down this path of, well, how would I build a system

06:13.800 --> 06:15.980
if I never wanted it to crash again?

06:15.980 --> 06:20.840
And there's so many different ways to split this up.

06:20.840 --> 06:27.320
I kind of begun to land on sort of a Solus or Arch with Budgie desktop combo.

06:27.320 --> 06:31.120
And then that crazy guy Aiki right after last week's show, like we get off the air with

06:31.120 --> 06:32.120
Aiki last week.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.120
Just chatting.

06:33.120 --> 06:37.500
And he runs off and announces to the entire world that he's switching the Budgie desktop

06:37.500 --> 06:43.280
over to Qt, which I think is probably a good long-term move because there's a lot of things

06:43.280 --> 06:47.080
they've had to do to make it sort of pretend like Gnome over the years.

06:47.080 --> 06:51.400
And there's a lot of crazy folks out there that are rewriting their desktops over to

06:51.400 --> 06:52.400
Qt these days.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.400
There seems to be a trend.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.400
Yeah.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.400
Well, and I think there's a reason for it.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.560
It's not just because it's a trend, but also because there's some real technical merits

06:58.560 --> 07:04.720
to Qt versus GTK when you're building something that's not Gnome and Gnome applications.

07:04.720 --> 07:08.880
And I thought that was all great and good except for the fact that it leaves me all

07:08.880 --> 07:12.840
of a sudden with the Budgie desktop about to go through this large transition.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.880
A lot more change than you maybe otherwise would have expected.

07:14.880 --> 07:15.880
Right.

07:15.880 --> 07:16.880
Even change for the better, you might argue.

07:16.880 --> 07:17.880
Yeah.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.600
And I'm sure that they will only release it when they feel like it's ready for the end

07:19.600 --> 07:20.600
users.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.000
But even still, I'm building a five-year workstation here, right?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.800
And so really it was Aiki's fault.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.360
It got me thinking.

07:27.360 --> 07:33.280
Aiki and also producer Michael, I blame producer Michael also quite a bit for this too, really,

07:33.280 --> 07:37.060
really got me seriously thinking about the Plasma desktop.

07:37.060 --> 07:41.840
And so I installed Plasma 5.8 a week and change ago.

07:41.840 --> 07:42.840
On top of Solus?

07:42.840 --> 07:43.840
On top of Arch.

07:43.840 --> 07:44.840
Arch.

07:44.840 --> 07:45.840
Okay.

07:45.840 --> 07:46.840
Yeah.

07:46.840 --> 07:50.440
I figured, I fixed my core Arch issue, which was a stupid infidelity font issue.

07:50.440 --> 07:53.520
And I got the Plasma desktop set up.

07:53.520 --> 07:58.880
And it has been, it has been, it has been 5.8 has been, that didn't mean to turn this

07:58.880 --> 08:04.000
into a quick Plasma review, but I have never used a more stable rock solid version of the

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Plasma desktop.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.840
I mean it, every day, the week it's been installed on my system, and it's been a little more

08:09.840 --> 08:17.160
than a week, every day for that entire time has met the, as my butt is entering the cushion

08:17.160 --> 08:23.800
of the chair, as it's grabbing my butt, my keys are already being flicked by my fingers

08:23.800 --> 08:26.520
and I'm already working and every time it's ready to go.

08:26.520 --> 08:27.520
It's ready to go.

08:27.520 --> 08:28.520
I don't have to fuss with nothing.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.520
Nothing gets in my way.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.440
I immediately start working the moment I, and I've set everything up, dude.

08:32.440 --> 08:36.400
I've even got an echo in there so that way as I'm walking into the room, I can activate

08:36.400 --> 08:37.400
all the devices I want.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.400
So it's like this.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.400
There's zero latency.

08:39.400 --> 08:43.240
I just go to the computer, I spin around, I sit down and I start working and I issue

08:43.240 --> 08:44.240
it.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.240
The spinning's really important.

08:45.240 --> 08:46.240
A lot of spinning.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.240
You gotta twirl.

08:47.240 --> 08:48.240
You gotta take time to twirl and skip.

08:48.240 --> 08:52.160
And then I issue an echo command, it powers up all my devices and as I'm sitting down

08:52.160 --> 08:53.680
at my keyboard, I'm working.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.760
There is zero friction to getting to work.

08:56.760 --> 09:01.800
And that's kind of necessary when sometimes I'm running into the studio, I got a live

09:01.800 --> 09:02.800
show in five minutes.

09:02.800 --> 09:03.800
I gotta get this thing done.

09:03.800 --> 09:04.800
Finish this thing.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.800
Yes.

09:05.800 --> 09:09.560
You don't want the silicon screen to just twirl at you for a while.

09:09.560 --> 09:17.720
And I have been extremely impressed with how snappy plasma has been, like just super snappy,

09:17.720 --> 09:24.320
with how reliable, I have noticed, it's been extremely reliable, I have noticed a slight

09:24.320 --> 09:27.800
continuous uptick in memory usage.

09:27.800 --> 09:33.000
So I'm now using about a gig at resting more than I was a few days ago, but that can be

09:33.000 --> 09:34.800
explained by a lot of things.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.640
And how much, what did that peak at?

09:37.640 --> 09:41.920
Well so far it's just sort of been steadily increasing, because you know, who's got time

09:41.920 --> 09:42.920
to reboot West?

09:42.920 --> 09:43.920
Yeah, rebooting.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.000
Who's got time, right?

09:45.000 --> 09:49.640
So I was really excited when Plasma 5.9 was announced.

09:49.640 --> 09:55.880
And the KDE project says they're kicking off 2017 in style with Plasma 5.9.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.920
Now producer Michael, you're not by any chance running it already, are you?

09:58.920 --> 10:00.920
Because I know you on Neon.

10:00.920 --> 10:03.560
Yeah, I got it.

10:03.560 --> 10:09.440
Yeah, alright, without any further ado, are you ready for this?

10:09.440 --> 10:10.440
Oh I think I am.

10:10.440 --> 10:14.840
I'm very excited, the Plasma guys once again contacted me and had me record the video,

10:14.840 --> 10:15.840
I'll just play a little bit.

10:15.840 --> 10:16.840
Awesome.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.320
I just do the voice work, they do everything else, so it's great, it's perfect.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.320
They make the cool stuff work.

10:19.320 --> 10:20.320
Yep.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.400
After a few months of intensive work, the KDE community is pleased to announce Plasma

10:23.400 --> 10:29.480
5.9, which brings many improvements and features to your desktop.

10:29.480 --> 10:33.240
Global menu bars for applications have returned and can be used with either a desktop panel

10:33.240 --> 10:38.560
showing the menu or neatly tucked away in the window bar.

10:38.560 --> 10:42.800
Due to popular demand, we implemented switching between Windows and Task Manager using the

10:42.800 --> 10:48.560
new MetaKey plus a number key shortcut for heavy multitasking.

10:48.560 --> 10:52.640
It is now possible to create comprehensive look and feel desktop themes that will download

10:52.640 --> 10:57.920
all the extras needed from the KDE store, such as color schemes and Plasma themes.

10:57.920 --> 11:02.880
I can never win, Wes, because they just released Plasma 5.9 and here I'm thinking, I'm gonna

11:02.880 --> 11:09.320
go Plasma 5.8 LTS, I'm gonna go 5.8, I'll stick with 5.8, and then they ship 5.9, like

11:09.320 --> 11:10.320
days later.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.320
They get you all excited about these features and improvements.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.320
What are they doing to me?

11:12.320 --> 11:13.320
Yep.

11:13.320 --> 11:14.320
What are they doing to me?

11:14.320 --> 11:16.840
So I don't know, does anybody in the mumble room want to jump in on Plasma desktop before

11:16.840 --> 11:17.840
we move on?

11:17.840 --> 11:22.160
I think it's a fantastic release, lots of improvements, little things that make theming

11:22.160 --> 11:26.240
nicer and whatnot.

11:26.240 --> 11:34.800
It's not, well, I have been using Plasma 5 since 5.4 and it has only gotten, it's more

11:34.800 --> 11:38.320
stable and more awesome every single release.

11:38.320 --> 11:44.240
I have, I'll have one machine that's gonna stay on 5.8 just to keep testing it, but 5.9

11:44.240 --> 11:49.560
is a solid option and I think it's actually a fantastic thing that they have an LTS version

11:49.560 --> 12:01.080
of their DE and with Neon LTS, you basically get both LTS for Ubuntu and LTS for Plasma.

12:01.080 --> 12:05.000
But if you don't want to have, if you want to have the latest version of Plasma, you

12:05.000 --> 12:10.480
can also just use the regular Neon and you'll still have Ubuntu LTS, but you'll have Plasma

12:10.480 --> 12:13.080
will keep rolling, which is awesome.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.080
Yeah.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.560
Yeah, I've been tempted by it, it's on my short list now.

12:17.560 --> 12:21.200
Especially if you have the Ubuntu stuff so you can do snaps or PPAs as well for that

12:21.200 --> 12:22.200
software availability.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
Yeah.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.200
We're gonna talk more about-

12:24.200 --> 12:25.200
I've tried snaps in it and it works for parent-to-parent desktops.

12:25.200 --> 12:30.280
Yeah, you see, so we're gonna talk more about that coming up a little bit in the show because

12:30.280 --> 12:35.920
that is, I think honestly it's getting to the point where that is a genuine consideration,

12:35.920 --> 12:38.400
especially for, like I said earlier, a five-year distribution.

12:38.400 --> 12:45.380
So it's really nice, I think it's one of their best releases yet and if anybody else wants

12:45.380 --> 12:48.720
to comment on it, you can, but otherwise I'll just leave a link in the show notes.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.480
The video covers pretty much everything.

12:50.480 --> 12:54.800
I really like, I think a lot of more open source projects should do that and if I have

12:54.800 --> 12:58.960
the time, I'm making myself available to open source projects that want to make a video

12:58.960 --> 13:01.560
but they don't have somebody to do the voice work, maybe they don't have a good audio set

13:01.560 --> 13:02.560
up or whatever.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.560
Totally willing to do that for people as long as I can fit it in, like in a couple of hours

13:05.560 --> 13:07.360
on a Friday, I'll do it for you.

13:07.360 --> 13:11.120
And it really seems like that's the kind of fit and finish that kind of goes the extra,

13:11.120 --> 13:14.320
you know, you're like 90%, the software's awesome, they have a good website, but that

13:14.320 --> 13:17.040
makes it seem like a very professional organization, which it is.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.960
I think Gnome's been doing it for a while, right?

13:18.960 --> 13:20.640
So it makes sense at the Plasma desktop.

13:20.640 --> 13:21.640
Yeah.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.840
Gnome started it and then all of a sudden they released, KDE released a video that was

13:25.840 --> 13:30.200
terrible, you made fun of it and all of a sudden they're like, oh, maybe we should fix

13:30.200 --> 13:31.200
that.

13:31.200 --> 13:36.600
Yeah, and Wimpy, I know you've got a lot of community members that make spotlight videos

13:36.600 --> 13:43.160
of the Mate desktop and of Ubuntu Mate, is this an area you've considered going down

13:43.160 --> 13:46.000
to help promote the distro or do you feel it's not necessary?

13:46.000 --> 13:54.120
It is something I've considered doing, yes, but it's a matter of having time and having

13:54.120 --> 14:01.500
something that's demonstrable and, you know, usable for something like that, so we haven't

14:01.500 --> 14:03.460
done anything professional.

14:03.460 --> 14:09.040
Maybe we will in the future, we're just getting to the point where we've got enough crowdfunding

14:09.040 --> 14:12.720
coming in that maybe over the course of a year we could put a little bit aside each

14:12.720 --> 14:19.720
month and do something like that, but I'd rather use the money that's coming in to work

14:19.720 --> 14:21.120
on the development stuff.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.120
I agree.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.120
I think that makes sense.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.120
Mate 2.0 is a great opportunity.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.120
We've got these community members.

14:25.120 --> 14:28.720
Yeah, it seems like every now and then there might be a few banner releases or features

14:28.720 --> 14:30.800
where it might be worth the effort or the trouble.

14:30.800 --> 14:34.320
As if I wasn't doing enough on organizing something like that.

14:34.320 --> 14:37.000
We need to just have somebody do it, you know actually Wimpy, not that you have all the

14:37.000 --> 14:40.160
free time in the world, but you'd be really good at voicing a video like that too.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.160
Oh yeah, I'd watch that.

14:41.160 --> 14:44.040
Yeah, it's another thing I have all the time in the world for.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.040
Yeah, I know.

14:45.040 --> 14:48.040
I'll just do a British accent myself.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.600
Yeah, that's pretty good.

14:49.600 --> 14:55.160
All right, so Ajax, you had a question about Plasma versus other desktops.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.160
Are you in the Mumba room?

14:56.160 --> 14:57.160
Yeah, you are.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.160
Go ahead, Ax.

14:58.160 --> 15:04.440
Yeah, I'm not a new Linux user, but I've been using Ubuntu for a while and I'm just kind

15:04.440 --> 15:09.380
of looking to branch out and I'm wondering how better is Plasma and what's the best way

15:09.380 --> 15:11.680
to go and why do you think it's better?

15:11.680 --> 15:14.540
Well, I'll just tell you my personal, and I'm not going to say anything's better than

15:14.540 --> 15:18.240
anything else, but I'll tell you what I like about the Plasma desktop.

15:18.240 --> 15:21.120
First and foremost, it's very smooth.

15:21.120 --> 15:25.200
Everything renders very smoothly, the windows open really smoothly, but what I think I really

15:25.200 --> 15:32.660
enjoy now about the Plasma desktop the most is all of the like the tons of crazy ass configuration

15:32.660 --> 15:38.600
options that were wrong by default for so many years with the Plasma desktop are basically

15:38.600 --> 15:41.200
all set to sane defaults now.

15:41.200 --> 15:46.560
And so you can get one of the most incredibly powerful desktops and everything is powerful.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.600
The terminal is one of the best terminal apps.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.560
I love the way, I love console.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.480
It is such a great terminal app.

15:53.480 --> 15:59.080
The way it handles tabs, the way I can easily send input to multiple tabs at the same time.

15:59.080 --> 16:03.200
Dolphin is a super fast file manager where I have directories that have tens of thousands

16:03.200 --> 16:04.200
of files.

16:04.200 --> 16:07.440
It just simply renders them and loads them better than files does, even though I like

16:07.440 --> 16:09.200
files still.

16:09.200 --> 16:13.500
Dolphin also has like great features like side by side pane support with a terminal

16:13.500 --> 16:17.720
built into the file manager, which is great for me when I'm working on a filter.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.640
So I really like the file management aspects of Dolphin.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.720
I like the KIO slaves.

16:22.720 --> 16:27.480
For example, I have a KIO slave where I take a screenshot of something, it automatically

16:27.480 --> 16:31.240
uploads it to Imgur and copies the link to my clipboards and I just toss it right in

16:31.240 --> 16:32.240
the show notes.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.240
And it's slick.

16:33.240 --> 16:36.680
Little things like that that I can automate that are really nice.

16:36.680 --> 16:44.360
There's things I miss about GNOME, but for me, each little application you go down, they're

16:44.360 --> 16:46.040
generally more feature rich.

16:46.040 --> 16:49.360
There are things about the Plasma desktop that I miss that I feel like I could probably

16:49.360 --> 16:50.360
work around.

16:50.360 --> 16:56.360
The biggest thing I really like on Unity and GNOME and really anything that uses the files

16:56.360 --> 17:02.600
or GTK file browser, even Thunar does this, is when I click on a Samba share, it uses

17:02.600 --> 17:04.600
GVS to mount it to my file system.

17:04.600 --> 17:07.480
And then I can use VLC and whatever else I want to watch.

17:07.480 --> 17:08.480
Video files.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.480
And even go to the terminal and interact with it.

17:10.480 --> 17:11.480
Yes, exactly.

17:11.480 --> 17:12.840
It's just a path on my terminal, which is huge.

17:12.840 --> 17:17.880
I don't know how to accomplish that in Dolphin because Dolphin uses the KIO slaves and it's

17:17.880 --> 17:21.120
uploading and downloading files to my server, saving them in attempt directory and then

17:21.120 --> 17:22.120
trying to save them back up.

17:22.120 --> 17:26.560
So if I try to watch a video in MPV, it tries to pull down the entire video first and then

17:26.560 --> 17:29.960
open it up in MPV, which is a disaster.

17:29.960 --> 17:34.180
There are some things I don't know how to fix yet, but so many other things are either

17:34.180 --> 17:38.020
so much easier to set like one of my big frustrations used to be used to have to go to three different

17:38.020 --> 17:42.840
places to configure when the screen went to sleep, when the screen locked out and if the

17:42.840 --> 17:44.360
screen saver was turned on.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.720
Now it's one spot.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.640
So it's streamlined, it's nicer.

17:47.640 --> 17:53.720
And also, honestly, the breeze theme has just gotten a lot of nice iterative updates.

17:53.720 --> 17:59.400
It looks really good and GTK applications now look really good on the plasma desktop

17:59.400 --> 18:02.740
and breeze has a very good dark theme.

18:02.740 --> 18:05.080
And I like a dark theme on my desktop.

18:05.080 --> 18:10.420
And so it's breeze again, and a lot of the white space issues I had with the plasma desktop

18:10.420 --> 18:16.320
in the past, those have either been cleaned up, like Dolphin compared to Conquer is such

18:16.320 --> 18:17.800
a night and day difference.

18:17.800 --> 18:22.120
If you're coming at the desktop from the days of Conquer and you sit down at Dolphin, it

18:22.120 --> 18:26.620
looks like they ripped off the GNOME desktop to some degrees, but only the best parts.

18:26.620 --> 18:31.680
And the thing that I really like about it now is with a nice universal dark theme, plasma

18:31.680 --> 18:36.800
widgets that don't crash all the time when I try to edit them, some same defaults, great

18:36.800 --> 18:42.080
performance, super reliable so far, and a file manager that's super capable in actually

18:42.080 --> 18:44.440
getting new features and not features removed.

18:44.440 --> 18:46.840
Let's check on my boxes.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.800
Let's check on my boxes, Wes.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.320
I really like what you said about the defaults there because there's a lot of laptops or

18:52.320 --> 18:56.000
other things where it's like I can kind of install GNOME and just, you know, even if

18:56.000 --> 18:58.320
I don't have time to perfect it, it's very usable by default.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.060
And for a while it didn't feel like plasma was.

19:00.060 --> 19:02.520
But now, I mean, that sells me right there.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.520
Yeah.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.520
Yeah.

19:04.520 --> 19:09.100
So I think if you're going to play with it, probably play around with Neon just to get

19:09.100 --> 19:13.500
a sense of it and then pick your distribution of choice that matches your use case.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.720
There's a lot to consider out there.

19:15.720 --> 19:20.120
Neon's one of them, but I hear a lot from the SUSE camp.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.600
I know Kubuntu is still an active project.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.480
There's still a lot out there that you can pick and choose from.

19:25.480 --> 19:26.480
So yeah.

19:26.480 --> 19:27.480
All right.

19:27.480 --> 19:28.480
Well, there you go.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.560
We've got a new update.

19:31.560 --> 19:36.120
Brand new version 5.90 is out today as we record this episode.

19:36.120 --> 19:38.400
So you did see the story actually.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.960
I saw the story come across the newsfeed too.

19:39.960 --> 19:42.800
I'm really glad you tagged it for the show, Wes.

19:42.800 --> 19:46.000
This gives me an unsettling feeling because I don't feel like we're getting the full story

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
here.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.760
But Blackphone, remember the people that make like the super secure Android device with

19:50.760 --> 19:51.760
silent OS?

19:51.760 --> 19:52.760
Yeah, like VPN, SGP technology.

19:52.760 --> 19:53.760
Yes.

19:53.760 --> 19:54.760
Yeah.

19:54.760 --> 19:55.760
Silent Circle.

19:55.760 --> 19:56.760
Silent Circle.

19:56.760 --> 20:02.240
Silent Circle has been sending out an update to some devices that bricks them to devices

20:02.240 --> 20:05.480
they say that are counterfeit devices.

20:05.480 --> 20:10.280
And it looks like, I'm not sure if they're counterfeit, but they weren't bought from

20:10.280 --> 20:11.280
a reseller.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.600
They were bought off of eBay.

20:12.600 --> 20:17.080
They may, I actually, I believe they may actually be legitimate used devices.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.040
That at least seems possible, right, from what we know.

20:19.040 --> 20:23.880
So a reader in Germany contacted ours after the update bricked one of his phones, which

20:23.880 --> 20:24.960
he had purchased through eBay.

20:24.960 --> 20:28.720
The Blackphone 2 he said he received in the retail packaging, it looks just like the one

20:28.720 --> 20:30.760
that was reviewed on ours.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.700
It worked up to silent OS version 307.

20:33.700 --> 20:39.840
When silent OS 308 came out, it intentionally bricks the baseband on the device.

20:39.840 --> 20:44.680
When contacted, the Silent Circle technical support responded by saying, upon review of

20:44.680 --> 20:50.220
the IMEI number you provided, it's been determined that the device is not a genuine Silent Circle

20:50.220 --> 20:51.220
Blackphone 2.

20:51.220 --> 20:56.480
The device was not sold by Silent Circle or an improved vendor of Silent Circle, and therefore

20:56.480 --> 20:58.840
we are unable to provide any further assistance.

20:58.840 --> 21:02.320
So hang up, basically.

21:02.320 --> 21:06.660
This is, now of course, the Silent Circle folks contacted after this story contacted

21:06.660 --> 21:14.320
ours and the project management VP said, Silent Circle's aware of unauthorized devices and

21:14.320 --> 21:20.160
we're working aggressively to stop the sale of those as we've counseled, as we've counseled,

21:20.160 --> 21:23.800
oh, as we've, oh anyways, it's imperative for our consumers and companies that we work

21:23.800 --> 21:27.360
with directly to use authorized sales partners when purchasing Blackphone 2.

21:27.360 --> 21:30.400
I'm not clear if this is used, I'm not clear if these are rip-off phones.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.400
Right, exactly.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.680
Do you know what bothers me about this story at the core of it?

21:34.680 --> 21:37.760
Can you guess?

21:37.760 --> 21:38.760
It's Android.

21:38.760 --> 21:39.760
Well, there's that.

21:39.760 --> 21:44.720
No, it's the, it's the, the aspect of the story that bothers me is the, well, we'll

21:44.720 --> 21:47.360
just issue an update and brick it.

21:47.360 --> 21:48.360
The hell is that?

21:48.360 --> 21:52.000
Like if, you're, like fine if I can't use your software, but.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.360
Don't allow me to click to your cloud servers, don't allow me to get updates from your Silent

21:55.360 --> 21:56.360
Circle.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.800
Maybe I want to still flash something else once I realize that it was a fraudulent phone,

21:58.800 --> 21:59.800
but it's still a phone.

21:59.800 --> 22:03.180
Maybe I still want to call 911 when I get in a car accident.

22:03.180 --> 22:07.800
It's unbelievable how we have no sovereignty over our own devices anymore.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.320
Samsung, bricking notes.

22:09.320 --> 22:14.160
I really think that highlights the different way we think about mobile devices and Android

22:14.160 --> 22:15.160
phones than a regular PC.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.160
The mistaken way.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.160
Yeah.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.680
The mistaken way, the way we've been tricked.

22:18.680 --> 22:19.680
It's a whole product.

22:19.680 --> 22:22.600
It's not like composable things that you could maybe repurpose.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.040
We've been bamboozled.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.040
We've been bamboozled.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.040
We really have been bamboozled.

22:26.040 --> 22:31.000
Like, we just accept it like, like it's a toaster or something.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.520
These devices are sometimes the most important devices people have in their lives.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.840
Get ready for this, Wes.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.840
More important than their PC.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.320
Shocker.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.320
This is Linux on point.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.320
How dare you?

22:42.320 --> 22:45.960
And, and if you're somebody out there buying a black phone, you probably like really care

22:45.960 --> 22:46.960
about this stuff.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.000
You're not an extra, you're not like your average consumer.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.880
Like this stuff's important to you.

22:50.880 --> 22:55.040
And so to have it be disabled, even if it's a knockoff, that doesn't justify bricking

22:55.040 --> 22:56.040
the device.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.320
It's still a useful Android device.

22:58.320 --> 23:05.640
Push an alert message, send me some sort of unauthorized, like even Microsoft with illegitimate

23:05.640 --> 23:08.400
versions of Windows doesn't go this far.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.880
They might force you to reboot.

23:09.880 --> 23:15.440
They might put a watermark in your lower corner, but they won't nuke your PC.

23:15.440 --> 23:19.320
And if they did, I mean, that would be crazy.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.680
It's a monster, Wes.

23:20.680 --> 23:24.640
This what we have created as consumers, and it's our fault, it is our fault.

23:24.640 --> 23:30.880
What we have allowed to be created as consumers, what we let Steve Jobs bamboobles us all into

23:30.880 --> 23:31.880
is our own fault.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.160
I really believe it.

23:33.160 --> 23:37.760
Because if we as consumers would stand up and say something or refuse to buy devices

23:37.760 --> 23:41.040
that can be remotely bricked, this wouldn't be happening.

23:41.040 --> 23:44.900
Instead we have devices that have God knows what on the baseband, can't even be controlled

23:44.900 --> 23:45.900
by the operating system.

23:45.900 --> 23:46.900
Full of the thing.

23:46.900 --> 23:52.220
The vendor who buys it can choose to brick it whenever they want, Samsung, now Black

23:52.220 --> 23:54.760
Phone.

23:54.760 --> 23:58.600
Who's the next Android vendor who's going to just remotely disable a phone?

23:58.600 --> 24:01.360
Maybe that'll be the new thing, you know, oh, no more security updates, you're out of

24:01.360 --> 24:04.320
service anymore, oh, you've had your phone for more than two years, it's just going to

24:04.320 --> 24:05.320
stop working entirely.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.320
Yeah.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.320
Yeah.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.320
Fader says he prefers it.

24:08.320 --> 24:12.280
And I think the argument would be that these are supposed to be ultra secure phones.

24:12.280 --> 24:13.280
And so if there...

24:13.280 --> 24:14.280
Yeah, there is an argument there.

24:14.280 --> 24:15.520
Yeah, I...

24:15.520 --> 24:16.520
So this is...

24:16.520 --> 24:19.780
But I feel like I've addressed that in my proposal.

24:19.780 --> 24:22.120
My proposal is this.

24:22.120 --> 24:25.760
Disable connecting to TCP IP.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.360
Disable the TCP IP stack.

24:27.360 --> 24:33.280
My proposal is send an alert in the Android notification that says this device is not

24:33.280 --> 24:37.900
an authorized device, it is not to be considered secure.

24:37.900 --> 24:44.160
But reflashing the baseband so that it simply just doesn't work, that could cost somebody

24:44.160 --> 24:46.080
their life.

24:46.080 --> 24:49.080
Somebody could be stuck in a car accident and not able to call for help.

24:49.080 --> 24:52.040
Like, that is a step too far.

24:52.040 --> 24:56.800
And I don't blame Blackphone, I don't blame Samsung, because they're really in these horrible

24:56.800 --> 24:57.840
situations.

24:57.840 --> 25:01.480
Like Blackphone doesn't want counterfeit products out there, Samsung doesn't want no devices

25:01.480 --> 25:04.260
blown up in your pockets so you can sue them and give them more bad press.

25:04.260 --> 25:05.920
So they're really in a rock and a hard spot.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.840
It's not like they're evil, go ahead.

25:08.840 --> 25:13.400
How many people while they're drowning in a car do a firmware update on their phone?

25:13.400 --> 25:17.880
No, you do the update, you get in the car to go to work, and you get in the car accident.

25:17.880 --> 25:21.360
It's not that crazy of a scenario, right?

25:21.360 --> 25:25.160
No, and I agree with you, this is lunacy.

25:25.160 --> 25:30.400
I think it's small company arrogance that they think they can do this.

25:30.400 --> 25:37.300
A large company like Amazon tried this, tried reaching into Kindles many years ago, deleting

25:37.300 --> 25:42.840
files from other people, from consumer devices, and look where that got them.

25:42.840 --> 25:45.000
They've never done it since.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.440
But this seems like the small company arrogance of, we've made a fantastic product and you

25:50.440 --> 25:56.080
should appreciate the support we're giving you.

25:56.080 --> 26:03.240
Not the Chinese method, which is throw a bazillion devices out there and we don't really give

26:03.240 --> 26:06.160
a crap about them once they've left the factory.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.680
It's the opposite.

26:07.680 --> 26:12.820
They're caring too much about devices, whether they know about them or not.

26:12.820 --> 26:14.360
That's a great point.

26:14.360 --> 26:18.720
I also like the idea from the chat room that that could be a new action movie cliche, like

26:18.720 --> 26:23.560
somebody drives off a bridge, their car is sinking but their phone is in the middle of

26:23.560 --> 26:28.680
installing an update, the monthly Android update.

26:28.680 --> 26:29.680
It's the new cliche.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.720
It's like a really boring black mirror.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.360
Even the car could be doing an update.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.360
Yeah, that's true.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.440
It could be the car itself doing an update.

26:37.440 --> 26:44.440
Then someone has an Alexa dot or echo in the car and they have to do an update on that

26:44.440 --> 26:45.440
as well.

26:45.440 --> 26:50.920
Ajax, you want to take the devil's advocate position.

26:50.920 --> 26:51.920
Go ahead, Ajax.

26:51.920 --> 26:57.720
No, I think you guys are generally right, but the thought occurred to me as well.

26:57.720 --> 27:02.280
Say you're a big company or a small company, an employer giving this to your employees

27:02.280 --> 27:07.240
and you're working against corporate espionage and doing some really important stuff.

27:07.240 --> 27:10.520
Do you want your employees to be able to override that?

27:10.520 --> 27:13.680
Maybe as an employer you bought the black phone because you want it to break if it's

27:13.680 --> 27:15.000
not completely secure.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Right.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.040
If I'm the company that owns the devices, I get to say that.

27:19.040 --> 27:23.600
It's not the manufacturer of the device that gets to say whether my employees can use their

27:23.600 --> 27:24.600
devices or not.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.120
It's me as the employer, the owner of the device.

27:27.120 --> 27:32.040
It's always the owner of the device that should have control over the device, not the manufacturer

27:32.040 --> 27:33.040
of the device.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.040
That's my line.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.480
That right there, that's my line in the sand.

27:35.480 --> 27:36.480
That's exactly it.

27:36.480 --> 27:43.480
It is, I feel like I should have root access over every device I own whenever it's feasible.

27:43.480 --> 27:50.000
Maybe I could understand the car, maybe, but that's even like the Echo.

27:50.000 --> 27:55.040
I feel like I should be able to go into some sort of settings mode, activate developer

27:55.040 --> 27:58.080
mode and SSH into my Echo and be able to control it.

27:58.080 --> 27:59.080
Tweak things.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.080
Yeah.

28:00.080 --> 28:04.360
There's a, we talked about it in the Linux Action Show, there's some state laws that

28:04.360 --> 28:08.760
could help in the US, but I don't know how optimistic I really am.

28:08.760 --> 28:09.760
I don't know.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.880
I see cars as like a lethal weapon.

28:11.880 --> 28:16.880
It can be used as a missile on the road, but I don't see a phone as being a lethal weapon.

28:16.880 --> 28:21.040
I can see how someone might argue that the phone might shout out while you're throwing

28:21.040 --> 28:22.040
it.

28:22.040 --> 28:24.600
Don't throw me, don't throw me.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.720
It's against the end user license agreement to use it as a missile.

28:27.720 --> 28:28.720
I don't know.

28:28.720 --> 28:29.720
Yeah.

28:29.720 --> 28:30.720
Yeah.

28:30.720 --> 28:33.240
If it's a node, it's okay.

28:33.240 --> 28:37.880
BitMux, BitMux, you want to go, go ahead.

28:37.880 --> 28:38.880
BitMux.

28:38.880 --> 28:39.880
Yeah.

28:39.880 --> 28:40.880
I'm here.

28:40.880 --> 28:45.720
I was thinking, you know, maybe we could reverse engineer the breaking system and just intentionally

28:45.720 --> 28:47.360
do the Galaxy Note 7 thing.

28:47.360 --> 28:49.520
Someone steals your phone and just blow it up in their pocket.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.520
Right.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.520
I actually think that'd be great.

28:51.520 --> 28:52.520
Like remote destruct.

28:52.520 --> 28:53.520
Sure.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.120
I'm not saying don't have it.

28:55.120 --> 28:56.120
Let me control it.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.120
Ooh.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.120
Yeah, there you go.

28:58.120 --> 28:59.120
I like that BitMux.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.120
That's good.

29:00.120 --> 29:01.120
What if a kid takes it?

29:01.120 --> 29:02.120
Now you think it's with a burglar.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.120
Now it's a weapon.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.120
Now you think it's going to blow up the kid.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.120
No, that's no good.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.120
That's no good.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.120
That is no good.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.120
Yeah.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.120
You got to eat.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.120
You got to eat.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.120
With great responsibility comes great explosions.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.120
I'm not quite sure how that saying goes.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.120
It was something my uncle once told me.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.120
This is not a morality podcast.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.120
All right.

29:15.120 --> 29:19.000
Well, while we're still talking about mobile, even tangently, let's take a minute and mention

29:19.000 --> 29:20.800
our sponsor, Ting.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.640
In fact, I'd like to mention linux.ting.com.

29:23.640 --> 29:24.640
Why?

29:24.640 --> 29:27.160
Oh, I'll tell you why.

29:27.160 --> 29:32.640
Because you get to save $25 off a device or $25 in service credit if you bring a device.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.920
And speaking of voting with your wallet, this is how you do it.

29:35.920 --> 29:42.120
Ting's no contracts, no early termination fee, and you only pay for what you use.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.600
Ting keeps rates simple.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.960
We don't make you pick a plan.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.600
Instead, you just use your phone as you normally would.

29:47.600 --> 29:50.680
How much you use determines how much you pay each month.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.520
You can have as many devices as you want on one account.

29:53.520 --> 29:57.680
That's good because when you use more, you pay less per minute, message, or megabyte

29:57.680 --> 29:58.680
of data.

29:58.680 --> 30:03.880
Your usage plus $6 per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill.

30:03.880 --> 30:04.880
Simple.

30:04.880 --> 30:08.720
That's what we mean when we say mobile.

30:08.720 --> 30:09.720
That makes sense.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.560
You know what Kyra doesn't mention?

30:11.560 --> 30:12.560
Really great customer service.

30:12.560 --> 30:13.560
Oh, yeah.

30:13.560 --> 30:14.560
Top notch customer service.

30:14.560 --> 30:15.680
You speak to a human.

30:15.680 --> 30:16.680
They talk to you.

30:16.680 --> 30:17.680
They fix your problem.

30:17.680 --> 30:18.680
They stick with you.

30:18.680 --> 30:19.680
They follow up.

30:19.680 --> 30:24.860
I know it sounds like almost ridiculous and unbelievable to say, but they, Wes, by God,

30:24.860 --> 30:25.860
they actually care.

30:25.860 --> 30:26.860
They do.

30:26.860 --> 30:29.680
It's like that's what their job is, and they take it seriously.

30:29.680 --> 30:30.680
It's remarkable.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.040
They're passionate about building a business that helps people.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.540
What's great about it is they're backed by Two Cows, which has been around since before

30:35.540 --> 30:36.720
the dot com crash.

30:36.720 --> 30:39.700
These guys have really dialed it in and figured out how to do this stuff.

30:39.700 --> 30:42.880
Two Cows also runs Hover, another company I'm a huge fan of.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.640
I use them for all my DNS registration now.

30:45.640 --> 30:50.240
They've really figured out how to build sustainable companies that feature the customer first.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.400
They have a great control panel.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.640
They have CDMA and GSM you can choose from.

30:53.640 --> 30:56.120
They don't mess around with early termination fees.

30:56.120 --> 31:00.920
No contract shenanigans, $6 a month for the line and your usage, plus whatever Uncle Sam's

31:00.920 --> 31:02.000
going to take.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
That's it.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.920
Linux.ting.com.

31:04.920 --> 31:05.920
Go there.

31:05.920 --> 31:06.920
Check them out.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.040
You cord cutters out there, check out their blog.

31:09.040 --> 31:12.120
Also you tweeters out there, check out their Twitter feed.

31:12.120 --> 31:16.480
They are following some of the rumors about Android One coming to the US on their Twitter

31:16.480 --> 31:20.000
feed, amongst other things, like sometimes giveaways and whatnot.

31:20.000 --> 31:27.760
They are at Twitter.com slash Ting FTW if you'd like to follow them.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.760
Check them out.

31:28.760 --> 31:29.760
They also have a subreddit.

31:29.760 --> 31:30.760
Yes they do.

31:30.760 --> 31:31.760
They're all over the web.

31:31.760 --> 31:32.760
They're so hip over there.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.440
YouTube channels, Google Plus pages, they got it all.

31:34.440 --> 31:37.880
You start by going to Linux.ting.com.

31:37.880 --> 31:42.280
That supports the show and saves you some money, Linux.ting.com.

31:42.280 --> 31:46.040
Thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.520
Let's pick up the pace and keep moving.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.800
We've been talking about a lot of stuff.

31:49.800 --> 31:54.320
One of the things that is in my hot little, actually it's in Wes's hot little hands right

31:54.320 --> 31:58.360
now is a rig that we have in for review at this moment.

31:58.360 --> 31:59.360
Go ahead, Wes.

31:59.360 --> 32:00.360
Open her up.

32:00.360 --> 32:01.360
Oh, this is beautiful.

32:01.360 --> 32:06.320
So Wes right here has got himself the new XPS 13.

32:06.320 --> 32:07.920
Who needs it when I got this new band?

32:07.920 --> 32:08.920
I know.

32:08.920 --> 32:09.920
Yeah.

32:09.920 --> 32:10.920
The XPS 13 Kaby Lake.

32:10.920 --> 32:11.980
It's got an i7 in it.

32:11.980 --> 32:15.860
It's got the PCI SSD 4K screen.

32:15.860 --> 32:20.160
It's currently running Ubuntu 16.04 with Unity as the desktop and just kind of using it in

32:20.160 --> 32:22.720
the default configs.

32:22.720 --> 32:23.720
What are your first thoughts?

32:23.720 --> 32:24.720
When you pick it up, you look at it.

32:24.720 --> 32:25.720
What do you think?

32:25.720 --> 32:29.960
And you have which edition XPS Sputnik thing?

32:29.960 --> 32:30.960
You have like a...

32:30.960 --> 32:31.960
It's one of the first.

32:31.960 --> 32:32.960
Yeah.

32:32.960 --> 32:36.280
You have like the first and I have like the second or third.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.920
And this is the sixth.

32:37.920 --> 32:38.920
This is the sixth.

32:38.920 --> 32:39.920
Wow.

32:39.920 --> 32:40.920
Yeah.

32:40.920 --> 32:41.920
It's well made.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.080
I mean, and they've like not radical departure from the one that you have in terms of the

32:44.080 --> 32:48.280
body, but it feels very sturdy.

32:48.280 --> 32:51.240
I haven't done much on it, but Wi-Fi connected.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.240
It's very snappy.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.240
Yeah.

32:53.240 --> 32:54.240
The screen is nice.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.020
The screen is very, very nice.

32:57.020 --> 33:02.520
There is a sort of a premium build feel about it too.

33:02.520 --> 33:03.520
This is just...

33:03.520 --> 33:04.520
Listen to this.

33:04.520 --> 33:05.520
You feel it?

33:05.520 --> 33:07.000
That's a nice, solid thud when it closes, right?

33:07.000 --> 33:11.360
I was immediately impressed by the amount of resistance, adjusting the display.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.360
Right.

33:12.360 --> 33:13.720
The display is on there.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.560
I like the way it goes back.

33:15.560 --> 33:16.560
And yeah, it is...

33:16.560 --> 33:17.560
Look at that.

33:17.560 --> 33:18.560
Look at that.

33:18.560 --> 33:19.560
I'm sitting there bouncing it, buddy.

33:19.560 --> 33:20.560
I'm bouncing it up and down.

33:20.560 --> 33:21.560
That is not moving.

33:21.560 --> 33:22.560
No, it's great.

33:22.560 --> 33:26.840
And also a touch screen, which you may or may not use, but it's there.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.800
And Unity does work pretty well with that.

33:28.800 --> 33:33.080
Interestingly, so I've had my family, I've had Hadia using this, I've had Dylan using

33:33.080 --> 33:34.080
this.

33:34.080 --> 33:38.620
And interestingly enough, both of them just sort of intuitively when they're like browsing

33:38.620 --> 33:42.720
Amazon or in Dylan's case, YouTube, reach out and scroll.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.760
Or when Dylan and I are sitting here both using this computer together and there's something

33:45.760 --> 33:48.240
he wants to look at, he just reaches out and touches it.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.240
And he doesn't...

33:49.240 --> 33:50.240
He didn't even know it was a touch screen.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.080
I don't think I said anything to Hadia either.

33:52.080 --> 33:55.120
I saw them both sitting there on their lap and they're using it to scroll through web

33:55.120 --> 33:56.120
pages.

33:56.120 --> 33:57.120
So the touch screen...

33:57.120 --> 33:58.120
I can see that for the consuming side, you know?

33:58.120 --> 33:59.120
Yeah.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.120
Like when you don't have it docked already.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.120
So what's the port situation like?

34:01.120 --> 34:02.120
Well, so here's what we got, Wes.

34:02.120 --> 34:04.880
You got yourself a Thunderbolt USB-C style port.

34:04.880 --> 34:05.880
I think...

34:05.880 --> 34:06.880
I don't know.

34:06.880 --> 34:07.880
I haven't really tested it yet.

34:07.880 --> 34:08.880
But yeah, it's USB-C shaped.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.640
Then you've got USB 3.0 headphone jack out.

34:10.640 --> 34:12.840
It's also got a little battery gauge on the side so you can...

34:12.840 --> 34:13.840
Does yours still have that too?

34:13.840 --> 34:15.120
Is that something they've had since the beginning?

34:15.120 --> 34:16.120
Oh yeah.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.120
Mine has that as well.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.120
Yeah.

34:18.120 --> 34:19.120
Yeah.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.120
Mine does too.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.120
Which I just like.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.720
I like being able to hit a button on the side of the laptop and see what the battery is.

34:22.720 --> 34:26.680
It's got an SD card reader and then it also has another USB port on the other side.

34:26.680 --> 34:31.760
So two USB 3.0 ports, SD card reader, USB-C, which has the Thunderbolt icon on it.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.280
Although I have not tested that under Linux.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.280
But it's...

34:34.280 --> 34:36.880
I have used USB-C. So I know that works.

34:36.880 --> 34:37.880
That's awesome.

34:37.880 --> 34:40.480
But I have not used Thunderbolt because I don't have any Thunderbolt stuff that has the USB-C

34:40.480 --> 34:41.480
plug.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.480
But it has...

34:42.480 --> 34:43.480
Oh yeah.

34:43.480 --> 34:44.480
I guess I don't either.

34:44.480 --> 34:45.480
But you see it has that little Thunderbolt icon, little logo next to it.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.480
Oh yeah.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.480
The plug there.

34:47.480 --> 34:48.480
So yeah.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.480
That's interesting.

34:49.480 --> 34:50.480
What is this weird future we live in?

34:50.480 --> 34:51.480
I know.

34:51.480 --> 34:52.480
USB-C future, man.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.480
It's something.

34:53.480 --> 34:54.480
I got to say though.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.480
That is a handsome device.

34:55.480 --> 34:56.480
I would be proud to take it anywhere.

34:56.480 --> 34:57.480
Yeah.

34:57.480 --> 34:58.480
Yeah.

34:58.480 --> 34:59.480
It is.

34:59.480 --> 35:00.480
Exactly.

35:00.480 --> 35:02.680
It's not like the old Dells where you're like, well, yeah, I mean I bought it.

35:02.680 --> 35:05.840
It wasn't that expensive and it works for me but it doesn't look that great.

35:05.840 --> 35:06.840
It's not like that.

35:06.840 --> 35:07.840
Yeah.

35:07.840 --> 35:08.840
Yeah.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.320
My first impressions are pretty good in all those regards.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.400
So I've been getting my family's impression.

35:13.400 --> 35:14.400
I've been using it.

35:14.400 --> 35:18.440
I'm going to reload it pretty soon with a different distro and just different desktop

35:18.440 --> 35:22.320
environment and see what that's like because I always like to, you know, both in a lot

35:22.320 --> 35:23.320
of...

35:23.320 --> 35:24.320
I don't actually...

35:24.320 --> 35:26.800
I can't think of anybody that doesn't ship the hardware preloaded with Ubuntu.

35:26.800 --> 35:27.800
I mean they all...

35:27.800 --> 35:28.800
Everybody does, right?

35:28.800 --> 35:30.800
I mean the ones that obviously come to mind are System76.

35:30.800 --> 35:35.400
They ship it with Ubuntu but all my System76 rigs, I've generally at some point loaded

35:35.400 --> 35:36.800
other distributions on there.

35:36.800 --> 35:41.720
Even if I go back to Ubuntu or specifically Ubuntu Mate, I still sometimes run Arch for

35:41.720 --> 35:44.040
a little bit or Fedora or anything else.

35:44.040 --> 35:49.280
And so it's nice to know the general compatibility with Linux 2, not just the Ubuntu compatibility

35:49.280 --> 35:51.920
but so far the out of the box stuff, top notch.

35:51.920 --> 35:52.920
That's awesome.

35:52.920 --> 35:53.920
Yeah.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.680
And I came across this for the previous version of the XPS.

35:56.680 --> 35:57.680
Last year.

35:57.680 --> 35:58.680
Which is...

35:58.680 --> 35:59.680
Actually, no.

35:59.680 --> 36:00.680
Did I come across this or did you?

36:00.680 --> 36:01.680
Because you and I found some of the same links.

36:01.680 --> 36:02.680
We might have both.

36:02.680 --> 36:03.680
Yeah.

36:03.680 --> 36:09.320
But this is getting Mac OS on the XPS 13, the 9350 edition.

36:09.320 --> 36:10.600
So I thought I'd just drop this in there.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.800
For those of you who are crazy enough to do that, that's a thing.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.760
I look at those K extensions.

36:15.760 --> 36:16.760
Yeah.

36:16.760 --> 36:19.000
Have fun with that after the next update comes out.

36:19.000 --> 36:26.040
Then also what showed up on Reddit slash R slash Ubuntu is a review of the XPS 15 KabyLake

36:26.040 --> 36:31.240
with the NVIDIA 1050, which is now starting to get into the range of like an actual computer

36:31.240 --> 36:33.520
I'd really want to consider.

36:33.520 --> 36:37.840
And this is not an official Dell supported configuration, I don't believe.

36:37.840 --> 36:43.000
But I think our local resident Wimpy has messed around with the XPS 15 running Linux and has

36:43.000 --> 36:45.360
had some good success, right Wimpy?

36:45.360 --> 36:46.360
I have.

36:46.360 --> 36:51.880
I've got the fifth generation 13 and the XPS 15.

36:51.880 --> 36:52.880
Okay.

36:52.880 --> 36:53.880
Okay.

36:53.880 --> 36:56.780
So and have you had any problems running Linux on the XPS 15 even though Dell doesn't ship

36:56.780 --> 36:58.280
in that config?

36:58.280 --> 37:07.120
No, because the Dell reseller I got it from offered configuration options that included

37:07.120 --> 37:12.840
the exact same Wi-Fi card as is in the XPS 13.

37:12.840 --> 37:18.440
So it just everything else is the same apart from the Wi-Fi chipset in that model and therefore

37:18.440 --> 37:19.440
it just works.

37:19.440 --> 37:20.440
Huh.

37:20.440 --> 37:21.440
Okay.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.520
So that was what you kind of have to take away from that I think is make sure you get

37:24.520 --> 37:25.520
the...

37:25.520 --> 37:26.520
This is the thing.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.560
I think that was then though.

37:28.560 --> 37:35.120
I think now they only sell the models with both models of Wi-Fi chipset compatible with

37:35.120 --> 37:36.120
Linux.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.120
Yeah.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.120
Okay.

37:38.120 --> 37:39.360
It looks like in this review this guy didn't have to fight with wireless either.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.600
Ww, you had a question about the 13?

37:41.600 --> 37:42.600
Yeah.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.540
Have you used it under a heavy load?

37:44.540 --> 37:50.760
Because I've heard people in our own IRC room that have used it under a heavy load and had

37:50.760 --> 37:57.000
a coil whine issue because when the fan kicks up so fast and high that you hear kind of

37:57.000 --> 37:58.160
a whining from it.

37:58.160 --> 37:59.160
Yeah.

37:59.160 --> 38:02.420
I'm actually going to specifically test that because I've heard that from the community

38:02.420 --> 38:03.420
as well.

38:03.420 --> 38:05.000
So it's interesting that you picked up on that too.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.340
So the only real heavy load I've put it under which did kick the fans a little bit is we

38:08.340 --> 38:10.560
watched a 4K YouTube video.

38:10.560 --> 38:11.560
Oh, okay.

38:11.560 --> 38:12.560
HTML5.

38:12.560 --> 38:15.880
Didn't hear any whine then but it was literally for like three minutes.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.960
So I'm going to do like some extensive testing.

38:18.960 --> 38:24.320
What is a good way other than like Prime95 or something from like the ancient days?

38:24.320 --> 38:28.400
Is there like a really solid like run this command and it generates a lot of CPU usage

38:28.400 --> 38:32.080
besides building software?

38:32.080 --> 38:37.440
I think there's a version of the Heaven's Engine benchmark for Linux that you could

38:37.440 --> 38:38.440
possibly use.

38:38.440 --> 38:39.440
Yeah.

38:39.440 --> 38:40.440
I will check it out.

38:40.440 --> 38:43.740
I can definitely figure out ways to cause CPU usage but I would like to do sustained

38:43.740 --> 38:45.040
like minutes.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.520
Just keep compiling that kernel for your MacBook.

38:47.520 --> 38:48.520
Yeah.

38:48.520 --> 38:49.520
Yeah.

38:49.520 --> 38:50.520
Right.

38:50.520 --> 38:51.520
So that's something to try.

38:51.520 --> 38:52.520
But yeah.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.560
Worth noting.

38:54.560 --> 38:55.560
There's two things.

38:55.560 --> 39:01.640
There's a good benchmark for Onyx test suite which will like run a whole bunch of games

39:01.640 --> 39:02.640
and all kind of stuff.

39:02.640 --> 39:03.640
Yeah.

39:03.640 --> 39:07.840
But the thing to note is the coil whine is nothing to do with the fan.

39:07.840 --> 39:08.840
Okay.

39:08.840 --> 39:14.920
Even under no load whatsoever, the coil whine in the really old ones was it would just whistle

39:14.920 --> 39:20.520
just gently enough to be really annoying but under no load at all.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.520
Oh boy.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.760
I've not experienced this on either of mine.

39:22.760 --> 39:23.760
Oh boy.

39:23.760 --> 39:24.760
I just add as well.

39:24.760 --> 39:25.760
I guarantee you.

39:25.760 --> 39:28.360
I guarantee you I would be hypersensitive to that.

39:28.360 --> 39:29.360
So if I…

39:29.360 --> 39:31.740
It's one of those things like the first time you hear it and then you're done.

39:31.740 --> 39:33.120
Before it was fine and then…

39:33.120 --> 39:34.120
Yeah.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.120
Yeah.

39:35.120 --> 39:36.120
Yeah.

39:36.120 --> 39:37.120
Because you know I even…

39:37.120 --> 39:39.120
I know a lot of you are like this.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.560
I'm not trying to brag but I can walk in.

39:40.560 --> 39:45.160
I'll walk into a room and I can tell you if a TV screen is on just by the coil whine

39:45.160 --> 39:46.160
of the TV screen.

39:46.160 --> 39:49.240
It's less prominent now with LCDs but it's still a thing.

39:49.240 --> 39:52.960
And so it's one of those where I would be one of the people in the room going like what

39:52.960 --> 39:53.960
is that noise?

39:53.960 --> 39:55.560
And everybody else would be like what are you talking about Chris?

39:55.560 --> 39:57.800
I'm like there is something ringing in here.

39:57.800 --> 40:00.080
I'm really sensitive to that.

40:00.080 --> 40:03.560
And there are entire machines I have stopped…

40:03.560 --> 40:04.560
Leave room.

40:04.560 --> 40:05.800
Leave room 15.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.760
There are entire machines I've stopped using because of the noise they make.

40:08.760 --> 40:09.760
So we'll see.

40:09.760 --> 40:10.760
That whine…

40:10.760 --> 40:12.200
I've not heard any whine yet.

40:12.200 --> 40:15.680
I would absolutely tell you if I did though.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.680
Yeah.

40:16.680 --> 40:17.680
I don't know.

40:17.680 --> 40:20.480
I got to figure out what the price config is on this one too to give the…

40:20.480 --> 40:23.840
So I haven't done the whole price to performance ratio yet stuff either.

40:23.840 --> 40:27.360
So if you're out there and you have one of these machines I'd like to know what you thought,

40:27.360 --> 40:31.240
what you run into specifically if you've had any issues around Kaby Lake, any guy kind

40:31.240 --> 40:32.240
of stuff.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.240
Yeah.

40:33.240 --> 40:34.240
Because I…

40:34.240 --> 40:35.240
New chips?

40:35.240 --> 40:36.240
Yeah.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.240
I used to for years was like oh yeah.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.440
No it's no problem with Intel stuff.

40:38.440 --> 40:44.640
But then you know Skylake came around and there was some problems.

40:44.640 --> 40:48.840
Speaking of problems, are you just trolling me with this next one Wes?

40:48.840 --> 40:49.840
Yeah I think so.

40:49.840 --> 40:50.840
Are you really?

40:50.840 --> 40:51.840
Yeah legit?

40:51.840 --> 40:52.840
Yeah good man.

40:52.840 --> 40:53.840
I did.

40:53.840 --> 40:56.880
I saw it and I was like okay well I have to at least send this to Chris and then put it

40:56.880 --> 40:57.880
in.

40:57.880 --> 40:58.880
Yeah.

40:58.880 --> 40:59.880
No I mean that's true.

40:59.880 --> 41:00.880
At the end of the day I guess I decided…

41:00.880 --> 41:01.880
It was still low.

41:01.880 --> 41:03.280
This is so awesome.

41:03.280 --> 41:08.280
So we got an update on the ButterFS RAID 5 and RAID 6 status.

41:08.280 --> 41:10.880
This is on the Linux ButterFS mailing list.

41:10.880 --> 41:11.880
Yeah.

41:11.880 --> 41:13.840
And their update goes like this.

41:13.840 --> 41:19.320
They believe and this is coming from Jan and also it's an email thread between Jan and

41:19.320 --> 41:27.040
Hugo and others and they think what they probably should be doing is updating the Wiki to reflect

41:27.040 --> 41:30.920
the fact that things are way more broken than they initially thought.

41:30.920 --> 41:35.240
Like RAID 5 and 6 don't even go near them.

41:35.240 --> 41:40.400
Just some examples, no in some respect it's really great they found this stuff.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.880
So there's that.

41:41.880 --> 41:47.540
In other respects the RAID 5 or 6 scrub will repair data while corrupting parity.

41:47.540 --> 41:49.200
Kind of ironic.

41:49.200 --> 41:52.560
So while you're fixing your data you will corrupt your parity.

41:52.560 --> 41:54.120
Trade one corruption for another.

41:54.120 --> 41:59.160
RAID 6 scrub can report false alerts on CSUM errors.

41:59.160 --> 42:04.000
The dev replace cancel sometimes can cause an entire kernel panic of your system.

42:04.000 --> 42:10.800
And they also are seriously considering re-implementing ButterFS's entire RAID 5, 6 configure the

42:10.800 --> 42:15.780
entire thing using device mapper which is tried and true but old.

42:15.780 --> 42:19.720
So they may be rewriting the entire RAID 5, 6 aspect of ButterFS.

42:19.720 --> 42:24.060
Does that make you want to build a nice big RAID 5 array right now?

42:24.060 --> 42:25.840
Just go all in on ButterFS right now.

42:25.840 --> 42:28.560
I am so stoked about this.

42:28.560 --> 42:31.280
When you saw this Wes did you laugh?

42:31.280 --> 42:32.280
Were you disappointed?

42:32.280 --> 42:36.440
I was like what was your, because my initial reaction was actually a little sad.

42:36.440 --> 42:39.320
We're never going to get there.

42:39.320 --> 42:40.320
We're never going to get there.

42:40.320 --> 42:42.880
Yeah it was a little, I think it was all of those things right.

42:42.880 --> 42:46.840
I was like it was kind of funny and I was thinking of you and just some of the quotes

42:46.840 --> 42:49.840
from the mailing list.

42:49.840 --> 42:53.560
But the part of me that's like I still have a ButterFS RAID 1 system so I'm glad that

42:53.560 --> 42:55.280
they aren't mentioning that in here.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.600
There's some mention of it later.

42:56.600 --> 42:58.960
Yeah there was two links you sent me.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.400
What was the second link you sent me?

43:00.400 --> 43:05.120
The second one was just talking about the Chris over at Facebook who has given.

43:05.120 --> 43:08.920
The one that, the use case that is always mentioned for ButterFS right.

43:08.920 --> 43:09.960
The singular use case.

43:09.960 --> 43:15.080
So they just kind of talk about how they've focused in the past on single drive use cases.

43:15.080 --> 43:17.200
They may change that this year.

43:17.200 --> 43:21.420
Performance stability and then maybe RAID 5, 6 are on their list.

43:21.420 --> 43:22.420
So we'll see.

43:22.420 --> 43:25.880
Maybe if there is a rewrite Facebook will be involved but who knows right.

43:25.880 --> 43:31.960
And that's the thing is like really ButterFS has been relegated to hey Intel XFS has snapshots

43:31.960 --> 43:33.560
that are like fully worked out.

43:33.560 --> 43:35.880
Here's some snapshots for your root file system.

43:35.880 --> 43:41.000
Don't trust data in any serious NASA RAID.

43:41.000 --> 43:48.200
XFS everybody XFS if you don't need all the features of ZFS please consider XFS for your

43:48.200 --> 43:49.200
home partition.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.680
It's just a few letters less than Z.

43:50.680 --> 43:51.680
It's almost there.

43:51.680 --> 43:52.680
It's close.

43:52.680 --> 43:54.120
It's damn near close.

43:54.120 --> 43:56.240
Or maybe your VAR I don't care.

43:56.240 --> 44:00.480
Hey I'm honey badger about it but XFS my friends please consider it.

44:00.480 --> 44:05.080
And then if you want a grown up file system that's used in production ZFS.

44:05.080 --> 44:07.920
I don't mean I'm not even saying that to be antagonistic.

44:07.920 --> 44:10.080
It's just the reality now.

44:10.080 --> 44:13.000
And oh this hurts so bad.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
This hurts.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.840
And remember I know I know we are now like a year into Chris bashing ButterFS but the

44:17.840 --> 44:20.700
year before that I put all my shit on ButterFS.

44:20.700 --> 44:21.700
Like my actual.

44:21.700 --> 44:25.840
In fact I mean I still have root partitions on ButterFS.

44:25.840 --> 44:26.840
You do as well.

44:26.840 --> 44:33.120
The VM server that runs a bunch of the local servers here at Jupiter Broadcasting is all

44:33.120 --> 44:35.720
of that stuff is stored on ButterFS.

44:35.720 --> 44:41.200
Like the back end data storage is ZFS but the server itself is running all that stuff.

44:41.200 --> 44:44.960
We are ButterFS all up in this business still to this day.

44:44.960 --> 44:49.080
And we have arch machines in those VMs running on ButterFS.

44:49.080 --> 44:51.840
We heard you like ButterFS.

44:51.840 --> 44:54.520
Jeez and I'm not using any of the RAID features though and it's really been fine.

44:54.520 --> 44:55.520
Yeah exactly.

44:55.520 --> 44:57.080
And the systems don't feel the dis a lot.

44:57.080 --> 45:01.040
They're running kind of the same thing the same jobs the same tasks all the time and

45:01.040 --> 45:02.500
it's actually been fine for that.

45:02.500 --> 45:05.440
So while I've been spending a year kind of trash talking about our fest it's just simply

45:05.440 --> 45:09.240
because I really I want us to be competitive.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.240
Exactly yeah right.

45:10.240 --> 45:13.200
That's what it comes down to is like we it would have been great if ButterFS was the

45:13.200 --> 45:18.040
project that could have built a new GPI license ZFS that we could use and could be in kernel.

45:18.040 --> 45:19.040
That's not what's happened.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.040
Amen.

45:20.040 --> 45:21.040
Exactly.

45:21.040 --> 45:22.040
That is exactly how I feel about it.

45:22.040 --> 45:23.040
That's exactly what I wanted.

45:23.040 --> 45:25.000
And that's why now I say XFS wimpy.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Do you agree.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
Yep.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.960
I've done for a long time.

45:28.960 --> 45:34.360
I've had good success with B3FS on root file systems.

45:34.360 --> 45:40.320
This was some time ago but you know for out and out performance with the compression it

45:40.320 --> 45:48.120
was brilliant but then not because of the issues that have since come to light with

45:48.120 --> 45:56.000
B3FS but I started using F2FS because I've moved to SSD so F2FS for root file systems

45:56.000 --> 45:59.840
and then XFS for volumes of data.

45:59.840 --> 46:01.000
Will you de-nude me?

46:01.000 --> 46:02.840
What is what is that?

46:02.840 --> 46:08.620
F2FS is a file system developed by Samsung and it's specifically for flash and solid

46:08.620 --> 46:15.400
state devices so it's hot rocking fast on anything from memory cards, USB sticks and

46:15.400 --> 46:16.400
SSDs.

46:16.400 --> 46:17.640
How did you come across this?

46:17.640 --> 46:18.640
It's been around for years.

46:18.640 --> 46:19.640
Yeah I imagine.

46:19.640 --> 46:22.880
I imagine it just doesn't ring a bell for me.

46:22.880 --> 46:30.380
Yeah well it was one of the things I was tinkering with when I was trying to build an OS based

46:30.380 --> 46:37.720
on Arch for the Raspberry Pi years ago and this was a way to get better performance and

46:37.720 --> 46:43.920
the only drawback with F2FS is that it doesn't have all of the user space tools.

46:43.920 --> 46:48.840
So for example there's no file system resize capability at the moment.

46:48.840 --> 46:50.280
Get it right the first time.

46:50.280 --> 46:54.120
So yeah you get it right the first time.

46:54.120 --> 46:55.120
Been there.

46:55.120 --> 46:57.600
Will you put a link to that in the show notes West because I saw you just found that there.

46:57.600 --> 46:58.600
Yes I will.

46:58.600 --> 47:06.040
Yeah I am very fascinated by these and Bcache, FS and others that.

47:06.040 --> 47:11.200
Yeah and that's the one that I tinker with on a spare machine and you know that's my

47:11.200 --> 47:16.040
little hobby file system that I like to keep up to speed with here.

47:16.040 --> 47:21.640
I fantasize about the position that folks like yourself Wimpy and folks like Ryan at

47:21.640 --> 47:27.520
System 76 and System 76 are in where I all of a sudden have to make the decision what

47:27.520 --> 47:36.240
potentially thousands upon tens of thousands of users may use as their default and that

47:36.240 --> 47:42.120
is such a head job for me like when it comes to the like the responsibility of choosing

47:42.120 --> 47:47.920
a file system like there is not when it comes to your core foundation once you've chosen

47:47.920 --> 47:53.080
Linux you made the hard choice now it's like what distro and what file system and you choose

47:53.080 --> 47:57.640
a generally people choose Ubuntu or Ubuntu Mate and then you choose your and that's like

47:57.640 --> 48:03.920
those are the three big choices in my world and I can't imagine I can't imagine like every

48:03.920 --> 48:07.560
time I get in that position I think well you just do extended for because nobody gets fired

48:07.560 --> 48:10.960
for shipping extended for that's that's yep that's the way to think about it or your Sousa

48:10.960 --> 48:14.920
and you do butter fs and then you spend the rest of the year defending butter fs into

48:14.920 --> 48:21.000
oblivion but I digress I think that's an interesting I think that would you ever consider.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.120
Okay let me what would be what would it take before you would flip the bit to make XFS

48:26.120 --> 48:33.000
the default file system for future like 1810 say it's it's Ubuntu Mate 1810 what would

48:33.000 --> 48:37.160
it take to convince you to flip the bit to XFS for the default file system.

48:37.160 --> 48:41.520
It wouldn't take anything to convince me but it's not a decision I could make alone because

48:41.520 --> 48:46.800
it would be something that would affect all of the flavors so they would have to be a

48:46.800 --> 48:51.080
consensus of opinion. Oh it's a flay it's all Ubuntu's that would choose that would

48:51.080 --> 48:52.080
switch.

48:52.080 --> 48:57.000
Yeah yeah because I didn't know that a feature it's a feature of ubiquity yeah we have we

48:57.000 --> 49:04.400
have kernel developers who are quite anti butter fs for for good reason they've done

49:04.400 --> 49:08.680
a lot of testing like pulling out the cable while it's running kind of do you mean do

49:08.680 --> 49:15.880
you mean v3 fs or XFS butter fs sorry fine yeah yeah uh that that's that's interesting

49:15.880 --> 49:21.520
Poby that's that and so I guess the flip side of that is so you could frame it as well we

49:21.520 --> 49:26.680
can't do XFS until all Ubuntu's do XFS but the flip side of that is once Ubiquity has

49:26.680 --> 49:32.040
dropped down checkbox support for ZFS then all of the flavors get it right Wimpy?

49:32.040 --> 49:38.640
Yeah and there is a capability to put plugins into ubiquity so you can have additional steps

49:38.640 --> 49:47.160
in the install installer and the only flavor I'm aware of that ever did that was Mythbuntu

49:47.160 --> 49:52.960
so that you could configure the the back end and front end components individually during

49:52.960 --> 49:58.540
the install so it might be possible that using a plugin that could be overridden I'm not

49:58.540 --> 50:03.440
sure anything like choosing the file system is exposed in the plugin or not I think that's

50:03.440 --> 50:09.880
a separate a separate piece but yeah I'd I'd happily go with with XFS I mean it's proven

50:09.880 --> 50:13.220
itself over many many years now.

50:13.220 --> 50:17.840
I didn't really think about that that that is a that is interesting because you'd really

50:17.840 --> 50:21.960
come down to having to either do a plug-in if they didn't and if they didn't have plug-in

50:21.960 --> 50:25.960
support for the file system and you really were you know you were really serious about

50:25.960 --> 50:30.520
this you'd essentially have to fork ubiquity to pull this off you know those are the kind

50:30.520 --> 50:34.240
of things I don't I haven't thought about but so the choice is sort of made for you

50:34.240 --> 50:38.600
in some sense but the net gain overall is totally worth it.

50:38.600 --> 50:44.680
Yeah but when I when I install my machines I just do the manual partitioning and just

50:44.680 --> 50:48.240
set everything up with XFS anyway.

50:48.240 --> 50:50.480
Yeah I usually do the same.

50:50.480 --> 50:55.940
Ryan do you know if anybody over there at System76 has ever you know kicked around the

50:55.940 --> 51:01.040
idea of switching around the default file system or switching around something like

51:01.040 --> 51:02.040
that?

51:02.040 --> 51:06.080
Is there is there any kind of like a like a skunk works where people try out new file

51:06.080 --> 51:08.560
systems at System76?

51:08.560 --> 51:14.840
Well we do try them out but we typically end up shipping whatever Ubuntu ships by default.

51:14.840 --> 51:16.680
Yeah that kind of seems like a good bet.

51:16.680 --> 51:18.480
Yeah it's safe.

51:18.480 --> 51:24.440
Yeah and also you you get the advantage of a huge user base that's all sort of has the

51:24.440 --> 51:28.440
same common set of configurations and that makes it much easier for people that are looking

51:28.440 --> 51:30.940
for support after the fact.

51:30.940 --> 51:35.480
So we kind of end up this is one of those defaults that truly reign supreme.

51:35.480 --> 51:41.080
So we end up with the extended for and I suppose if if the market came along one day and really

51:41.080 --> 51:45.440
wanted something else we would see a change but for right now for what we need it's getting

51:45.440 --> 51:46.440
the job done.

51:46.440 --> 51:47.440
It's working yeah.

51:47.440 --> 51:48.440
It's getting the job done.

51:48.440 --> 51:50.920
All right well speaking of getting the job done let's talk about Linux Academy.

51:50.920 --> 51:54.800
Talk about a really great way to get the job done and learn more Linux Academy dot com slash

51:54.800 --> 51:56.600
unplugged.

51:56.600 --> 52:01.520
That's where you go to support the show and you sign up for a free seven day trial Linux

52:01.520 --> 52:03.400
Academy dot com slash unplugged.

52:03.400 --> 52:09.160
Take advantage of a platform built by Linux users for freaking Linux users.

52:09.160 --> 52:11.040
That makes all of the difference.

52:11.040 --> 52:15.280
Linux and open source isn't one of the many things they cover.

52:15.280 --> 52:19.360
It's the only thing they cover and that really makes a huge difference.

52:19.360 --> 52:24.480
I'll tell you one of the things I've really liked about Linux Academy is I talked to them

52:24.480 --> 52:30.760
before they were really publicly known and what I want what I worked at what I walked

52:30.760 --> 52:35.400
away from the conversation was what we watched you put a broadcasting and we thought what

52:35.400 --> 52:39.040
if we did a podcast network but we made money and I thought that's a great idea.

52:39.040 --> 52:40.040
I should.

52:40.040 --> 52:45.980
Like well then we kind of kick that idea around and this is what we came up with because they

52:45.980 --> 52:49.800
wanted to spread Linux they wanted more people using it and they recognized there was this

52:49.800 --> 52:55.940
total total gap in the industry for getting you credible good Linux training that the

52:55.940 --> 53:00.800
rest of the industry would get behind and recognize and that to a T is Linux Academy.

53:00.800 --> 53:03.600
They got course schedulers for your busy schedule.

53:03.600 --> 53:07.640
They got video courses they got self paced study guides they got downloadable comprehensive

53:07.640 --> 53:10.080
stuff you can take offline listen in the shower.

53:10.080 --> 53:11.080
That's amazing.

53:11.080 --> 53:15.380
A community full of Jupiter broadcasting members learning paths which are very specific tracks

53:15.380 --> 53:17.680
for your career that are planned out by their instructors.

53:17.680 --> 53:18.680
Oh instructors.

53:18.680 --> 53:19.680
Yeah.

53:19.680 --> 53:24.320
They've got those two full time humans who are happy to advise and answer questions nuggets

53:24.320 --> 53:28.720
are just little teeny bits of wisdom when you're busy and study guides and audio you

53:28.720 --> 53:33.800
can take with you and a notebook you can keep fold out filled out and here's the best part

53:33.800 --> 53:38.000
note cards take advantage is one of the best things of open source that is people forking

53:38.000 --> 53:39.920
stuff and making it better.

53:39.920 --> 53:43.920
They got those with the note cards they integrate little things like that some concepts from

53:43.920 --> 53:46.120
the open source community into the platform.

53:46.120 --> 53:47.120
It's genius.

53:47.120 --> 53:50.320
They've also got IOS and Android apps now and they're building out content like a mo

53:50.320 --> 53:52.080
add and stuff all the time.

53:52.080 --> 53:56.680
I think it's probably one of the coolest companies I've watched grow up over the last few years

53:56.680 --> 54:00.680
and one of the nicest things about Linux Academy is legitimately every single week there's

54:00.680 --> 54:02.400
something cool and new to talk about.

54:02.400 --> 54:07.280
I love how much stuff they're doing I love how hard they're hitting it and I love the

54:07.280 --> 54:09.740
results our community is getting.

54:09.740 --> 54:16.880
You start by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged sign up for a free seven day trial

54:16.880 --> 54:20.640
try it out yourself see how useful it is.

54:20.640 --> 54:23.620
Look at the public profiles see how you can use that to tell management what you've been

54:23.620 --> 54:29.360
working on and then when you're all done at the end of the day just sit back and play

54:29.360 --> 54:30.600
around their lab servers.

54:30.600 --> 54:35.680
That's what I would do linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy

54:35.680 --> 54:40.400
for sponsoring the unplugged program what are you doing did you go to sleep and have

54:40.400 --> 54:41.400
to wake back up again?

54:41.400 --> 54:43.920
Yeah that's right I did.

54:43.920 --> 54:44.920
What does that solve?

54:44.920 --> 54:47.400
What problem did you fix by sleeping in your laptop and rewaking it?

54:47.400 --> 54:48.400
Sadly nothing.

54:48.400 --> 54:49.400
Nothing.

54:49.400 --> 54:50.400
What's wrong?

54:50.400 --> 54:51.400
Does it lock up on you?

54:51.400 --> 54:54.440
Chrome was just being weird wasn't like clicking with the mouse at all so.

54:54.440 --> 54:59.360
What distro I just tried out a distro recently oh man I can't remember I just recently tried

54:59.360 --> 55:05.240
out a distro that had Chrome and Chromium installed oh no it was it was wait a minute

55:05.240 --> 55:09.920
no no no no no no hold it it was the XPS 13.

55:09.920 --> 55:13.880
It came out of the box from Dell with Chrome and Chromium installed like what the hell

55:13.880 --> 55:19.160
is this about like why why do you have why do you have Chrome and Chromium like you just

55:19.160 --> 55:25.200
do one or the other and and not Firefox not Firefox.

55:25.200 --> 55:34.420
This is a privilege of an OEM that works with Canonical to produce their images.

55:34.420 --> 55:37.720
A privilege they can they can install three web browsers?

55:37.720 --> 55:41.720
They can they can they can work with Canonical or they can install three browsers but they

55:41.720 --> 55:48.360
can work with Canonical to change what's on the image they don't have to use the vanilla

55:48.360 --> 55:51.240
image they can actually make customizations.

55:51.240 --> 55:56.480
Oh yeah one of the other things I noticed is a pretty slick actually really slick boot

55:56.480 --> 56:04.200
up animation music animation it makes Ubuntu really feel like a you remember when Mac OS

56:04.200 --> 56:08.720
way back in the day had like these welcome to Mac OS animations kind of okay yeah this

56:08.720 --> 56:14.640
is like those only way better it's really well done yeah yeah so so you boot it up you

56:14.640 --> 56:18.520
get like this you get this whole full screen video presentation but yeah you do get Chrome

56:18.520 --> 56:25.800
and Chromium and so does is there so when we might understand that there is like a back

56:25.800 --> 56:31.520
and forth like we will we will like how does that work like how do they how are they able

56:31.520 --> 56:35.440
to add something today did they like carve out a deal with Google to redistribute Chrome

56:35.440 --> 56:37.320
is that what I'm to understand?

56:37.320 --> 56:44.240
I don't know what the arrangement is regarding Google but I know that what they're able to

56:44.240 --> 56:48.680
negotiate as to what deviations they want to make from the vanilla image so this doesn't

56:48.680 --> 56:53.200
make like still be recognized as Ubuntu and supported so it's not like it doesn't become

56:53.200 --> 56:55.960
like a Dell Ubuntu?

56:55.960 --> 57:01.760
No Canonical will still recognize it as Ubuntu and it is supported okay that's nice okay that's

57:01.760 --> 57:05.960
that's nice I want to just two stories and then I want to get into some new hardware

57:05.960 --> 57:11.720
that's coming out of system 76 that's going to mine all the bitcoins did you know that

57:11.720 --> 57:19.200
kernel.org back in 19 well they shut it down in 98 but until 1998 you could mount kernel.org

57:19.200 --> 57:25.880
via NFS or Samba over the internet yep that's fun yeah yeah I think I'm

57:25.880 --> 57:31.320
you might have done it once maybe and I didn't even know what the hell I was doing back then

57:31.320 --> 57:34.960
and they were just you ran a magic command and then like a kernel popped out and it was

57:34.960 --> 57:38.080
just the worst though Wimby did you ever do this?

57:38.080 --> 57:45.800
I remember trying to get it working through our company firewall over NFS once and about

57:45.800 --> 57:52.320
that time then figured out this was a really bad idea yeah and just worked out how to write

57:52.320 --> 58:01.120
a script to make FTP recursively grapple there you go not NFS and SIFS not known for their

58:01.120 --> 58:06.120
tolerance of high latency connections not what they're strong at yeah FTP much better

58:06.120 --> 58:13.720
but it is 2017 and 19 years later kernel.org is announcing that they are terminating their

58:13.720 --> 58:20.560
FTP services no more FTP for you Wes there's a good discussion just about like that FTP

58:20.560 --> 58:24.840
can be tricky with firewalls and some good highlights like they can be sent to random

58:24.840 --> 58:29.960
port numbers they may originate from server or client destination addresses are

58:29.960 --> 58:34.800
negotiated on the fly so I can see why it's just like a lot more of a burden to maintain

58:34.800 --> 58:44.120
than just use HTTP yeah but not for them in a way like well yeah I guess as long as they

58:44.120 --> 58:50.760
keep our sync up I'm happy really to be honest with you but an HTTP I'm good yeah I I don't

58:50.760 --> 58:58.680
know though because you know I I still have muscle memory for FTP kernel.org FTP kernel.org

58:58.680 --> 59:03.960
yeah that's fair that's gonna be weird that's gonna be weird but time time moves on also

59:03.960 --> 59:07.680
moving on I thought this was sort of interesting and I'll just link it up in the show notes

59:07.680 --> 59:11.760
for you guys but super quick if you're like me and you're on a super limited bandwidth

59:11.760 --> 59:15.860
connection at home or or maybe you're on a LAN with tons and tons of workstations running

59:15.860 --> 59:22.440
steam I don't know steam pipe and other utilities like NGINX can be used to locally cache steam

59:22.440 --> 59:29.360
updates game files and whatnot on your LAN Ars Technica has a whole write-up about it

59:29.360 --> 59:35.180
that will have linked in the show notes you could only cache games you own and it caches

59:35.180 --> 59:38.600
them the first time you pull them down so it's not like you can pull you can't like

59:38.600 --> 59:43.840
take steam pipe point it at the steam store pull down all of the things have it right

59:43.840 --> 59:50.260
there not gonna work that way no and this is like a combination of NGINX and steam pipe

59:50.260 --> 59:55.000
and other things to help you sort of solve the problem maybe got a LAN game or you got

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
a whole bunch of machines or like my cell mates also use steam there are also times

59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.280
where my my fight connection and lady jupes is super strong and I maybe want to do this

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.640
kind of stuff and then there's times where it's not so good and it would be nice that

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:12.720
when I read when I reset up a machine or I'm trying out a system for review to be able

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.320
to just pull them from a local system all raise the Sun when do I not yeah when do I

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:22.680
not the answer is never so this is kind of a neat feature and I I don't really have much

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:28.600
to add we're not gonna go through the whole how to here but if you want to locally cache

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:34.080
your steam games and who doesn't right I also like to have my own local pac-man repo my

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:41.120
own app repo I mean come on I have all the things so ours has a write-up on on that now

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:50.680
West when I say system 76 you say fantastic computers when I say or x2 I say I say laptops

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.480
actually yeah laptop which is fun though they have test I know some of my first systems

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.000
actually my second system 76 machine was a desktop so I know I know that I know that

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.120
but you know what I you know what I haven't said for a while and every now and then I

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.680
mentioned on Linux action show but you know it didn't come to the tip of my mind servers

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.840
but system 76 has a whole line of so I did not know that and I have been led to believe

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.400
that once people have been convinced of the system 76 persuasion they usually end up coming

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.620
back looking for more like servers I don't know if that's true or not but mr. Ryan Sipes

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:28.840
is in the mumble room and perhaps he can confirm rumors of a new ibis pro right is it true

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:34.320
that was right yes there it is that was he was too busy playing with the new ibis pro

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:38.440
I like the I like I kind of got I was on the edge of my seat there for a second that was

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.240
that was really good this is not just any old server though Ryan right because this

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.880
is like one that could have like a whole bunch of GPUs in it this is like a Bitcoin maniac

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:59.440
8 Tesla P 100s 3000 CUDA cores it's a pretty big piece of a machine 1.5 terabytes of RAM

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:08.680
32 terabytes of SSD storage if that's your persuasion 8 GPUs so Ryan is it am I kind

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:12.560
of right though it do a lot of people they end up coming to system 76 they buy a desktop

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:17.120
they buy a laptop maybe I'm a school district and all of a sudden I find a lab full of system

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:22.520
76 machines and next thing I know I need a server and people kind of get sort of well

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:28.200
they get swayed by the whole system 76 package is that is that is that a kind of a common

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:31.960
entry point for the servers or can you can you talk a little bit about what system 76

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:37.600
is doing in the server space it's not something we talk a lot about sure thing we we offer

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:44.960
a full line of servers from your like basic one you you know server that maybe is running

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:50.800
I don't know like maybe use it as a web server maybe it's some something that's not really

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:57.600
intensive on GPU or or you know not we offer from the small server all the way up to the

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:06.280
new ibex pro which is a beast it's a monster my kind of machine yeah and the thing is is

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:14.000
that a lot of folks come for the laptops and desktops but they stay for the the awesome

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.120
server line that we have and they look to us for our fantastic Linux support when they're

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:29.180
considering that type of machine GPUs in servers yeah I'm familiar with like scientific workloads

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:35.640
and pretty familiar with like live streaming use cases but I I can see you know a lot of

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:39.520
different server side workloads coming I joke about Bitcoin it's not really what you would

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:46.160
use this machine for but man I yeah I could imagine there's people out there like in there

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.840
like the design industry or the scientific community that must need a lot of GPU power

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:57.040
right right yeah machine learning and render farms for like 3d video these are common use

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:02.640
cases that we hear about I've said this before I think on the program but we have some customers

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:08.520
who everybody knows who does who's really big into machine learning maybe even autonomous

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:15.080
driving those type of companies and they they've been looking forward to us producing a machine

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:22.280
like this hmm yeah now but we set up one of those steam streaming servers and I can just

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:25.680
play right here on my laptop we'll have the Jupiter broadcasting streaming service one

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.880
of these things it wouldn't just be for you and I could be for everybody yeah that's pretty

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:36.320
great I think I think when I when I have when I picture like the ultimate school district

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:43.040
I would totally like love like labs with system 76 desktops secretaries on the all-in-one

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:48.460
systems and office staff all and teacher computers would all be the all-in-one systems servers

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:52.120
on these I'm not the GPUs but you know just right so that kind of stuff that would be

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:56.640
nice that'd be such a sweet such a sweet setup so Ryan you're you're telling me people are

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.880
still buying local servers and installing them on-premises I thought everybody went

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:07.480
to the cloud well those cloud providers have to buy their servers and they need more powerful

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:12.600
servers than ever so you guys got to stay busy yeah fortunately we've had really really

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:18.200
great reception to our server line and the demand just continues to grow and so we've

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:26.120
continued to grow our server line demand and so I I would encourage anyone who is looking

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:32.840
to or works at a data center or for you know a university doing machine learning protein

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:38.320
folding things that are really GPU heavy to take a look at the ibis you know when you

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:44.640
talk about buying time on one of these GPU servers it isn't cheap in fact some of the

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:50.960
cloud providers require you to enter into some kind of limp like amount of time that

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:56.720
you have to use it because they have to spin up that thing on site in order to make a instance

01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:02.580
available to you and so sometimes this it seems crazy when you're talking about a machine

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:06.040
that can range anywhere from nine thousand dollars to a hundred and fourteen thousand

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:12.000
dollars but if you're a big you know enterprise or university sometimes having something like

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.940
this on site can be cheaper than renting time on a cloud service hey man mine's only 41,000

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:23.320
I don't know what you're talking about I configured a system you know just for casual usage just

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:28.880
for casual usage casual usage with how many cores did I put in there oh I put 22 cores

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:39.040
in there with 44 you should get to yeah so that's the new ibis from system 76 holy smokes

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:45.220
I also wanted to bring some stuff up because lots of folks have been really excited to

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:50.920
see that we're making a new product release and I wanted to reiterate that Carl is speaking

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:58.440
at ubu con and we'll be releasing three products while he's on stage so people who are in the

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:04.560
Pasadena area or can make it out there should totally attend that talk cool man awesome

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:10.040
and of course check out the ibex over at system of family sex calm I'm just gonna you know

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:16.880
I like I like anytime you have a system that has a configuration option of first CPU memory

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:22.620
and then second CPU memory and the option is 768 gigabytes of RAM you're not playing

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:32.080
around this is a wow yeah and then the base CPU design is 2800 course you know and it

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:40.800
can go you can go all the way up from there to like 39,000 cores that is a beast of a

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:45.320
system well I know what I want from my birthday yeah that's a whole that's a whole another

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:49.760
level speaking of another level let's talk about our last and final but you know what

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:55.040
honestly the sponsor that I'm using right now as we do this very show so you can't call

01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:00.040
them last and definitely you can't call them the least they are digital ocean go over to

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:04.680
digital ocean calm and use our promo code do unplugged get a ten dollar credit you spin

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:09.320
up a rig try it out you got an open source project you got a demo you want to do in a

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:13.040
podcast in a few minutes you do it on a digital ocean droplet oh you'll see what I'm talking

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:17.400
about digital ocean calm use our promo code do unplugged after you sign up you get a ten

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:24.120
dollar credit you can try out there three cents an hour rig nice machine three cents

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:30.240
an hour is is really an unbelievable rate to get a really fast computer with a 40 gigabit

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:35.120
e-connection everything has SSDs regardless of the price you pay a brilliant control panel

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:42.120
super smooth straightforward API and documentation that is to die for digital ocean calm use

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:46.160
the promo code deal unplugged you create your account you go in there you get in there

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.640
all like a boss you get your username you do your email thing then you log in you type

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:56.120
in deal unplugged you get the ten dollar credit you go nuts so you get the five dollar rate

01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:01.080
go go crazy for two months I don't I'm not gonna judge I won't tell people what you're

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:04.360
doing I mean you can tell me what you're doing but I won't tell them what you're doing come

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:10.640
on I know it it's great there's so many things you know right now as we record this show

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.600
I'm using digital ocean to host my IRC I'm using digital ocean to stream this here very

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:20.100
show I know I'm using digital ocean to sync the files I'm using to play on this show and

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:24.640
to talk about and I've been using digital ocean this morning to set up the files I'm

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.360
using digital ocean to talk to our virtual lug because the mobile room runs on a digital

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:32.600
ocean droplet hey you there's so many things we use digital ocean for and it doesn't matter

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:36.720
if you're a beginner or if you're an expert you'll find their interface is fantastic they

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:40.380
got data centers all over the world so even our international audience will find something

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:46.000
locally that hyper serves their customers and then they have some of the best freaking

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.960
best documentation on the web not because they copied it and set up a wiki but because

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:56.780
they've really worked with their community they've rewarded the very let's say high producing

01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:01.040
members of the community who create really great content they've monetarily rewarded

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:09.600
them they've hired full-time and I'm plural here full-time editors to edit the documentation

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.280
like they take every aspect of their business super serious and right now not only are they

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:18.080
rolling out this really nice front-end system to help manage your traffic and spread it

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.680
across your entire infrastructure but the beta that I've been playing around with is

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:26.520
their monitoring system integrates right in with the dashboard I can enroll my existing

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:33.240
droplets and I can quote-unquote upgrade them to monitoring nice dude so nice so cool honestly

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:38.960
for us like for a couple of our servers we kind of guessed on how much horsepower we

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:43.040
needed to like dude live transcoding video but we didn't really know and now with this

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.280
new system I can get a much better idea so I can really kind of narrow in on the kind

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:51.320
of performance I do I need more do I need less pushing it or you're just wasting that's

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:56.420
the thing dude and it's really nice digitalocean.com use the promo code do unplugged it just gets

01:10:56.420 --> 01:11:01.560
better every single week and a big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:08.480
program digitalocean.com and use that promo code do you and plugged so Wes you see my

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:15.240
screen right here right now what is that top that's Popeys computer right there I am logged

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:28.680
into Popeys computer using that you know RM dash all right I just kidding we were talking

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:32.320
Popey and I were talking earlier today and it's like well maybe I'll set up a droplet

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:36.200
for you because he doesn't want me to hack his system but this is using teleconsole which

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:41.960
is an epic we featured on Sunday and what's even better than this is I think and I'm guessing

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:45.360
but probably I think you kind of got involved in this because you found that either you

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:50.860
did you help get involved with the snap or you found it had a snap and yeah I discovered

01:11:50.860 --> 01:12:00.200
teleconsole last week there was it featured on Hacker News and it rose up the github trending

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:05.880
projects and I thought oh that looks interesting let's take a look and I contacted their CEO

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:13.680
that the company that is called gravitational that that made teleconsole and said hey would

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:17.520
you like your application snapped and put in the store and I had a conversation with

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:23.260
them on late on Friday night last week and I'd already snapped it by this point it was

01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:29.680
already packaged up as a snap and I had a chat with them and they said seriously you

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.400
just want my permission to put it in the store I said yeah he wouldn't do it so that was

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:40.200
it I put it in the store and I'll hand it over to them shortly I've created a pull request

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:45.440
on their github repo so they can they can take ownership of it but basically if you

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:52.240
the directory you're in is just a directory on a on a like you said on a digital ocean

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.960
droplet but in there is a yaml file if you do an LS oh yeah there's a yaml file in there

01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:04.600
and that's the conflict that I created it's not it's not hugely complex wow that's all

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:07.800
it took I'm gonna I'm gonna look at that again look at look at that so yeah it's really the

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.560
three lines well no that I mean it's less than that if you take out the description

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:18.080
yeah you take out all the metadata there's like three lines yeah this is so you have

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:22.560
copy and then there's a you have a tar file and this is made simpler because it's it's

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:26.200
a go file it means a go program that's pretty much all statically linked it's all ready

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:31.760
to go so it's not like a ton of extra depths have to be installed but this is I mean you're

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.920
running this in a web browser you're connected over a web browser we're using teleconsole

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.320
that's amazing so this is the cool thing we're using teleconsole to talk about teleconsole

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:45.600
so I'm I just installed teleconsole snap from the store and then ran teleconsole and it

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:50.800
gave me a URL I gave that to Chris and he could open that URL in a browser and then

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:54.040
look at my machine and actually interact with the machine so I can sit here and this is

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:59.760
great for providing support if you've got family members who have got an Ubuntu machine

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.240
they can install teleconsole or whenever they need help they can run teleconsole give you

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:10.200
the URL you can connect and there's no port forwarding there's no SSH keys or any of that

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:15.480
nonsense and you did mention on Laz that it is possible to do this with a github ID you

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:19.480
could do it without that you can just give them a URL which is what we did here it's

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:25.120
brilliant and what's what's fascinating is if poppy right if you resize your window on

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:31.320
your side does it resize it on my side like it's it is it is very much what what I see

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.660
is we're gonna make it smaller or larger try making it a little tiny try making a hair

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:39.480
larger does it are you just read you're just dragging the window on your screen so I'm

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:44.160
just grabbing the terminal window and I've just made it slightly bigger oh that's so

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:49.840
cool that is so great and then you can revoke the session essentially and I can just press

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:54.720
ctrl D and it will exit out of teleconsole and I'm done or I can close the window because

01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:00.960
it's just a terminal but it's just so nice yeah it's really really nice what what I what

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:09.080
I what I gravitate towards here is more and more things like this are showing up as snaps

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:15.040
and I this is why I think I'm probably for my five-year bulletproof distro gonna end

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:18.960
up on Ubuntu derivative of some some sort of derivative of Ubuntu I don't know if it's

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:22.760
if it's neon I don't know if it's Ubuntu Mate I don't know if it's Ubuntu proper right

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:29.400
now on the XPS I'm running Ubuntu proper but this kind of thing between PPA snaps apps

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:36.040
and maybe even flat packs that is a whole range and Docker it's a whole range of applications

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.960
that are really simple really easy to get going and and there's more and more stuff

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:46.080
I'm seeing showing up showing up as a snap pick it up yeah and if if there's people listening

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:51.760
to this thinking oh I'm on Ubuntu 1404 and I really want to have a go with this teleconsole

01:15:51.760 --> 01:16:00.640
well snap D landed in 1404 like yesterday oh wow yeah so if you with with isolation

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:08.960
yep really if you apt get install snap D on 1404 you'll get snap D and the confinement

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:14.480
bits and pieces on an uplifting kernel to kernel 4.4 and then you can snap install to

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:22.200
your heart's content as well oh man what is what is toilet is that what is it's like it's

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:27.920
just it's like figlet figlet is like a font thing that lets you put big banner text and

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:36.120
toilet is just similar yeah I don't know why it's great so not only can I remotely control

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:41.480
poppy's machine but he of course he can now control the stream so this is great like you

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:45.960
can have two people can have a text editor open at the like the same fire sure two people

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:50.600
can like cooperate on the same thing yeah it's just amazing I love it maybe this is

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:55.960
what we do tomorrow now our plans are being scuppered we use this yeah we can work together

01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:03.100
yeah remotely via a session sure console yeah great yeah really it is it is perfect for

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:08.480
support it is perfect for collaboration and it feels I so when we covered this on last

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:13.380
on Sunday I got the typical well this is just the perfect way to get hacked type responses

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:17.700
and I understand where people are coming from but one of the things I like about teleconsole

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:22.360
as opposed to giving somebody straight SSH access to your machine is it's session ID

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:27.160
based and you can revoke sessions so you actually in some regards have more control over who

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:33.540
has access to your machine using teleconsole and because you can watch them you you literally

01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:37.960
have more oversight I will say then that that goes back if we I think we talked about it

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:42.640
briefly on the show a while ago the the backing technology it's basically a demo for gravitational

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:48.040
teleport which is their own SSH daemon implementation and so if you're using one of our fine sponsors

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.720
and you have your own infrastructure where maybe you want this kind of audit ability

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:57.600
or control or seamless access for devs who aren't as you know friendly you can use teleport

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.840
or things like this to get similar functionality in your own infrastructure like Wes okay that

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:07.040
makes sense that's a great way to do it too and that's that's the next step is I I've

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:11.880
taught the guys how to do a snap for teleconsole the next step is that they're gonna make a

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:19.060
snap out of teleport so you could have your own on-premises teleport or in a digital ocean

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:24.720
droplet I I really like poppy how simple the yaml file is so the yaml file describes to

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:31.260
snap what it should do it's like the instruction file and it's it is it is ridiculously simple

01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:35.640
when something is a tar file that is essentially statically linked or doesn't have a lot of

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:40.720
dependencies right but you could if you wanted to in this yaml file couldn't you even pull

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:45.160
crap off of like an FTP site to install right you couldn't you can pull from anywhere and

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:48.620
there are way more companies I mean this is one of the more simple ones if you actually

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:55.040
type snapcraft in that window right now it will build the snap it will just open the

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:59.720
yaml file and create the snap straightaway oh hello oh you haven't got any so wait you

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:03.560
gotta have text-to-text well let me install some software on your computer really quick

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:08.920
here remotely that's what computers are for yeah this feels good I like installing software

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:16.920
on other people's computers so yes you're right and and some of the more complicated

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:21.440
apps are pulling in libraries from here and there or building something from source and

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:25.600
it can get a lot more complicated this was it was quite beneficial that when I saw this

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.720
last week I I looked at it and thought well that's a go binary it's a single implement

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:38.060
sure entire solution as one thing and oh hello what's going on there oh man yeah yeah that's

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:44.200
broken yeah yeah well okay you would normally just type snapcraft and it will build so Ryan

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:49.560
you have had so you've been saw even you have installed a several or a few or some

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:55.800
snaps on your system yeah I've been trying to install via snap first before I install

01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:03.320
via any other method and I thought I would have a really bad time just because it's

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:09.240
still growing and and things are changing but generally I've had a good experience

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:15.920
in fact so good that I've been working on a game with somebody else in the system 76

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:23.000
community and it's called code breakers you can snap install code breakers right now and

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.280
we snap that up and it was a lot of fun and it works really well cool I I didn't even

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:35.120
realize I was actively using snaps until this morning when I did a mount command and saw

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:41.120
I had three snaps mounted and I realized oh yeah I have I have notice that as well I have

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:45.280
three snap apps installed on my machine upstairs and I didn't even you know once you get them

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:50.920
loaded up and on your path and it works yeah it just totally works fine they also update

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:56.080
as part of like the normal update procedure which I guess I didn't really realize oh they

01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:04.240
do so yeah I mean like as part of the update it must run the snap command but there's been

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:08.700
times when somebody has been like oh yeah go ahead and update this update this package

01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:12.000
and you'll have the new sweetness and I go to update and it's like everything's up to

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:18.280
date and I'm like well I didn't I didn't run snap refresh but apparently and somebody can

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:23.000
correct me if I'm wrong but I've always had just a running normal updates always had the

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:28.920
update snaps interesting I I have not I don't think I've ran any snap I don't have not I

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:34.200
have not ran a single snap command on my workstation upstairs since I installed them so I don't

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:38.680
I should look at that on arch because I don't know what that situation is on arch I installed

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:41.840
them a while ago and I think I forgot about them and I I don't want that to be what happens

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:46.340
with with those types of applications because that's just a that's a recipe for disaster

01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:51.920
so I should try to walk Chris I know I know I forgot I honestly forgot I did it and I'm

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:56.560
just I'm so used to my package manager installing everything else exactly I didn't even think

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:01.960
about it but they've been running great so there's that so teleconsole combined with

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:10.080
snap combined with that github thing is a pretty powerful future mm-hmm and I I really

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:16.080
think I'm I at least I'm feeling inclined to use a distribution that supports snaps

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:20.040
but I'm kind of feeling inclined to use an Ubuntu based district with flat back snaps

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:25.440
PPAs app files they're just in the general repo I mean like all that stuff is just really

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:33.200
appealing to me mm-hmm what are you working on oh geez sorry I just fixed that in the

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:40.000
background okay cool look at that see that's what's so great about this right there boom

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:48.160
you just have Poby fix things for you now though now Poby's Twitter feed will be filled

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:53.240
with Poby help me that is that is really neat and I noticed too that they have an EU specific

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:59.480
server for teleconsole eu.teleconsole.com well anything else Poby you want touch on

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:07.520
before we know if you want some fun that's not command line stuff I also pushed a game

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:14.860
to the snap store called oh my giraffe so if you snap install oh my giraffe then it's

01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:19.400
not it's not something I've written it's someone another guy wrote and I offered to snap it

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:23.480
for him and put it in the store and it's a fun game so yeah oh my giraffe snap install

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:27.660
oh my giraffe it's great you know before the show I tried to figure out how I would install

01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:33.360
teleconsole as a snap is there like a is there a website the audience should go to to find

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:41.280
a list of the latest snapped up applications so the goal the goal really is for us to once

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:47.880
once an upstream has got something snapped and it's in the store is to update their documentation

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:53.640
basically so that rather than it say go and get this source and build this source or add

01:23:53.640 --> 01:24:02.320
this PPA it just says snap install food right because that's the easiest so once once the

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:07.160
upstream for teleconsole has taken over ownership of this and it's not mine we'll get them to

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:11.060
update their documentation so that it's I see snap install teleconsole blah blah blah

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:14.440
I should have just used the snap command to search for teleconsole instead of searching

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:18.120
the web too that would have I don't know what I was thinking I was being a noob I was being

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:22.520
a snap noob that's what work on it I know I gotta get my s together next week you better

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:26.680
snap install something live on the show prove that you know how okay you better remind me

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:32.560
cuz I'll forget about snaps about everything all right well that's pretty cool I love it

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:40.240
I love it so thanks poppy for at least dedicating a machine sacrificing a machine let Chris yeah

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:47.720
I'm gonna burn it clearly broken yeah it never again should be trusted all right well we

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:53.300
have to get out of here because as is a thing now mr. West has an upcoming episode of tech

01:24:53.300 --> 01:25:00.280
snap that's right and so while we can't just slack we gotta be we gotta be like a serious

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:04.600
production here and room it's new to us we're working on it for the new tech snap program

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:09.360
which is live on Tuesdays in fact all our shows are live you can find their times at

experience we'll see you right back here next Tuesday

01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:09.760
I've never installed GNU slash Linux you know what's been weird West is I've been trying

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.280
this bulletproof Linux at the same time a lot of folks are blogging about switching

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:19.200
from Mac OS to Linux and so it's been interesting to watch their what they reach out for yeah

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:24.120
and I've been following bit cannon which is by the way hashtag this guy I first I was

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:31.640
like is this West because his hashtag on Twitter is West on Linux wow so big cannon aka West

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:39.240
on Linux he just posted another part two yesterday of switching from Mac OS to Linux and it is

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:43.020
a really good post I debated reading in the show I just didn't want to rehash the same

01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:49.960
ground over and freaking over again but long story short he settles on elementary OS because

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:56.280
of how it looks how it works finds a bunch of cracks and rough edges as time goes on

01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:03.920
ends up back on arch this is a Mac OS user ends up back on arch and installing the budgie

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:08.880
desktop hey yo pretty much exactly where I'm yes it is wow which is really interesting

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:14.520
they tried gnome 3 and then he went to you went to budgie I don't know he went with the

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:21.040
arc theme and the arc icons too which is my exact setup wow anyways it's fascinating fascinating

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:26.160
fascinating post bit cannon net if you want to read the rest of it's good yeah it's been

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.720
really good to read this because as somebody who like is consistently thinking about this

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:37.020
stuff I love kind of reading running running through the kind of like path you know going

01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:40.520
down this trying to read the same path of these people followed how did they end up

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:45.760
here the context they were living in and how they're adapting yeah why is he using Geary

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:50.480
why is he why is he using neo vim why is he using Firefox what was the what was the thought

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:54.920
process that led there what is his opinion of files all that stuff really good super

01:27:54.920 --> 01:28:01.480
good post bit cannon dot net if you want to read that almost almost made it into the show

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:09.480
dot com because we put one more Mac OS X link everyone will kill us I have to stop talking

01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:13.600
about it at some point but I just I love it it's like finally it's happening death by

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:18.360
download what's that a reference to that's good what's that a reference to the Android

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:25.520
story I believe oh yeah okay oh yeah right brick in the thing yep yep yep yep beam me

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:31.280
up poppy software license to kill that's clever that's clever yeah I like James Bond references

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:39.100
black phone hits the bricks plasma heats up winter these are good ones yeah needs more

01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:46.080
wimpy that's what the red pepper says needs more wimpy you hear that plane wimpy's been

01:28:46.080 --> 01:29:00.120
typing furiously this evening really well good for you black phone kill switch oh you

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:06.280
just gotta you just gotta embrace the default that's my path to happiness just use breathe

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:10.880
start that's all you really mean you got to you have to and then you have to be willing

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:15.360
to just accept like I'm gonna be I'm gonna be honest with you guys there are aspects

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:20.160
of breeze dark that don't hold up like you have a full so you take like the system settings

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:23.880
window and there's not and you go to one of the settings that doesn't have a lot going

01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:31.600
on and then you maximize that you will see gradient bars in the dark theme I am a picky

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:37.080
son of a bitch so I am I am letting some stuff slide but only because with every innovative

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.960
release they have improved stuff and I just feel like if I just hang it tight yeah it'll

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:47.120
get better yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it doesn't you know it doesn't look worse than

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:57.640
breeze light very large resolution screen because I'm on 1080p it's a 2k Asus screen

01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:05.040
which I think is the perfect resolution for Linux I think 2k not 4k not 1080p but 2k is

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:11.520
perfect for Linux everything looks great everything scales fine you can fit a ton of shit on your

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:16.600
screen but it's not where there's like the little issues like now where's that XPS so

01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:25.040
this XPS 13 out of the box has high DPI support turned on however in the installer the what

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:28.440
do you call the top bar in unity what do you call that what do you call this top bar in

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:34.720
unity where all your menus hide panel the global panel the panel so on the XPS 13 when

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:38.080
you boot it up for the first time the panels doubled you can see there's essentially it

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:41.800
looks like two panels but what it really is is the background graphic for the panels just

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:47.280
repeated twice it's it's we fix that yeah we fix that system 76 fix that I was gonna

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:51.000
say it's right in there and then and then do you see those lines at the bottom of the

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:59.160
screen oh yeah yeah also also only only shows up under their implementation of high DPI

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:03.000
yeah we totally fix that too yeah it doesn't bother that doesn't bother I mean the actually

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.760
that does bother me that right there those lines right now that I've seen it only West

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:09.520
can really see it probably right I don't think there's there's not there's no way no but

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:16.480
they're there they're so there's there's definitely little issues so so Ryan I'm gonna say something

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:22.160
and then you can carry on okay so Chris fixes fixes to those problems you've just described

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:30.560
landed today really whoa yeah Ryan over to you yeah so we fix those problems actually

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:36.400
David and our new kernel engineer worked on that and Cassidy that was a high DPI fix it

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:40.840
that we blogged the fixes that we blogged about here recently they bugged the hell out

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:45.240
of us too so we went ahead and did something about it and those should those should be

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:53.640
in the ISO and 1604.2 brilliant nice nice very nice because it's awesome it's getting

01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:57.640
down to some rough edges now but they're rough edges really like a little right yeah every

01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:16.960
once in a while we go ahead and fix Del's problems.
