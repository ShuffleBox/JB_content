certified get hired get learning a cloud guru calm yeah so this episode is it's

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,520
my coming out I have a big secret that I have to reveal that will be will be laid

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,520
bare in front of all of you for your own judgments later in this show and then we

12
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,560
thought it'd be a decent time to check in on the plucky little distro endeavor

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,000
OS which you'll probably remember came up out of the ashes of enter gross which

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,200
was a arch based distro that really kind of aimed at getting pretty close to

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,560
upstream arch and endeavor OS when it launched we took a first look at it and

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,600
we said this is interesting but it needs some work we're gonna come back at it

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,840
and now here we are towards the end of 2020 they've had a couple of releases

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,540
and it's kind of an opportunity to do a state of the distro so we'll give you a

19
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,080
new update and a couple of things that I found really surprising and then sort

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,680
of led to a whole series of revelations but we've also got a bunch of community

21
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,400
news to get into something we're launching that we want to tell you about

22
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,960
so before we do any of that I got to say hello to the virtual lug time

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,240
appropriate greetings bumble room

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:09,360
what a crew today how about that was how about that huh you know they are mighty

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,760
and powerful in there in the virtual lug if you want to join our mumble room and

26
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,400
get your voice on the show we have all the info on our website at linux

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,880
unplug calm what you do is when you're in there you just tag me in the IRC mum

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,440
Chris last with a little description of what you want to say and then I'll

29
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,400
generally work you into the show and I'll call on you live and you can have

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,320
your thoughts on whatever we're talking about I don't always call sometimes we're

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,480
like moving on and I won't call on you but that's basically how it works so you

32
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,240
can get information about how to set up mumble which is an open source VoIP app

33
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,000
at our website Linux unplug calm let's start with our announcement first

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,520
because we have kind of some disappointing community news but I want

35
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,920
to start with the good you know there's been a lot this year Wes there's been a

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,560
lot worse I've seen it all and we thought we could do something kind of

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,040
fun we were inspired by some friends of ours and other podcasts out there and

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,000
we're gonna we're gonna announce right here on the show get ready for this

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,840
ladies and gentlemen I am proud I am excited I am stoked to announce the

40
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:16,040
Linux unplugged is launching the 2020 tuxes that's right a special segment

41
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:22,740
right here on the show and you can help nominate your favorite projects we use

42
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,500
that term loosely and other tech for 2020 tuxes and we will at the end of the

43
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,000
year we will announce the winners of the tuxes and they will be sent a 3d printed

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,160
tuxi award with what they won on there and it'll also serve as a fantastic

45
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,900
resource for you to get an idea of what projects and distros are really

46
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,680
resonating with the community this year it might give you an idea of something

47
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,740
you could check out and I think it's just gonna be a great way for us to get

48
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,360
an idea of what you all love and what we love and then to send them a little

49
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,560
thank you at the end of the year saying thanks for making that thing that we

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,280
love so much and our audience voted you the best a nice way to reflect on the

51
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,240
year and I mean we've covered so many great things on the show plus a bunch of

52
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,600
stuff that didn't make it in I've already forgotten about half of it I'm

53
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,000
sure you've forgotten even more so we really need some help making a good list

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,240
yeah and I wanted to be something kind of special so the distros they they can

55
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,080
receive or whatever it is a project there's you'll see all the categories

56
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,400
and I want to expand those two this is just the first year but I think we could

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,060
do this every year and I'd like to expand it and get your input on what

58
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,220
other categories we could include so it's just a form you go fill it out with

59
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,640
some questions about favorite this best that worst evens in there I think on

60
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,780
something and then we'll collect all the results we'll submit it to the committee

61
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,700
and then we'll announce the winners on the show we do get some vote power in

62
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,000
that mix but we're also gonna include we're gonna submit it ourselves so we

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,800
need to get as much input as we can because I'd like this to be reflective

64
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,360
of the audience so we're gonna run this for a little while the link will be in

65
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,480
the show notes for the 2020 unplugged tuxes and of course it also gave me an

66
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,440
excuse to include a super a super duper mega retro Jupiter broadcasting beat if

67
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,360
you get this deep cut then you've been listening for a really long time and

68
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,200
this is the official tuxes theme music

69
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:16,700
I'll see how long it takes until somebody can figure out where that's

70
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,840
from now let's talk about the community news we'll do the tuxes soon but please

71
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,820
do go get your submissions in but we need to start with what appears to be

72
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,780
some super bad news for a reason the Linux PC manufacturer that sold

73
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,980
desktops and laptops it appears they've shut down entirely they say as many of

74
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,540
you've noticed our product line is getting smaller and our tech support has

75
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,740
been slowing down to a crawl unfortunately the pandemic has been the

76
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:50,820
final ko blow or knockout blow that's what they write and it's hit our little

77
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,780
town hard and we have not been able to recover from it as of Tuesday November

78
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,900
24th 2020 za reason is no longer in business if you have a computer from us

79
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,680
we hope that it gives you a long and solid lifespan if it does not and you

80
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,300
would like warranty work done we regret there are no employees who can answer

81
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,500
those questions or do service repair employees usually want to be paid and

82
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,900
without sales there's no income to pay them yeah that is really unfortunate and

83
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,500
they they have an in tiny text at the bottom let me zoom in and hands here

84
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,660
they say note that when a business dies its warranty dies with it we know this

85
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,580
part is hard to accept it is sad disappointing and unsurprising that our

86
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,820
reason is shutting down this is them saying this there are many many reasons

87
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,860
but sickness and part shortages are the top two at this point there is no other

88
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,780
option we wish you the best and we hope you and your computers are healthy and

89
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,940
we help you and your computers are healthy and thriving a colonel you have

90
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,460
some experience with our reason yeah so I haven't actually owned any of their

91
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,020
machines but there's a convention that I have met them at personally and they

92
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,700
were really good just down-to-earth people even invited me to come by hang

93
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,500
out with them at their shop if I was ever in the area they're just they were

94
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:15,460
fantastic wonderful people and I'm sad to see that are having to shut down I

95
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:22,620
have to say I hadn't considered that the PC parts makers could be having supply

96
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,100
shortages it has slammed the RV industry surprisingly hard because when you have

97
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,220
different areas that are responsible for manufacturing certain parts and there's

98
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,820
been various different lockdowns implemented you've had various kind of

99
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:40,180
ebbs and flows to the production and so the people downstream from that are kind

100
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,980
of left in the lurch and I hadn't really considered that that could very easily be

101
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:49,540
affecting PC manufacturers and it honestly makes me wonder about if it's

102
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,660
affected our friends at system 76 because they're just hitting their 15th

103
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,780
birthday and they've you know they've they've really grown but at the same

104
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,860
time they could be vulnerable to some of these same supply chain issues and

105
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,180
perhaps our reason is just not nearly as well positioned as system 76 but I

106
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,220
don't know I just I worry yeah it's a wake-up call I think yeah it is it's

107
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,780
something you had I hadn't really it would be really kind of it'd be really

108
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,340
sad to see this spread you know there's other there's other manufacturers out

109
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,220
there we wouldn't want to see go I think from a competitive positioning

110
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,140
perhaps our reason wasn't necessarily the most competitive of the bunch though

111
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,100
but we haven't seen this happen for a while we haven't seen a Linux hardware

112
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,100
vendor shut down recently we've seen a lot launch but I suppose it was

113
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,260
inevitable and also just a little bit sad since they've been going since I

114
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:42,140
think 2007 yeah Jill you had some thoughts on czar reason yeah I was so

115
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,500
sad to hear this there are actually personal friends of ours at the Linux

116
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,940
chicks of Los Angeles there they were stalwarts at the Southern California

117
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,300
Linux Expo they had a booth every year for a lot of years and I got to know

118
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,660
their family very well and they even donated equipment to the Linux chicks of

119
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:06,060
Los Angeles and I have have one of my favorite they make a wonderful stuffed

120
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,100
pen penguin text penguin it's so cute well it's that's a great story yeah but

121
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:19,540
I just I'm just very very sad because a lot of lot of the Linux chicks have have

122
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,940
have their computers and this is just very disappointing and they their

123
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,020
computers are still running great I have a very old dual core laptop of theirs

124
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:36,700
and it runs beautifully still hopefully will for a while yeah Neil you have some

125
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:42,300
thoughts on it too yeah I mean when I found out I was I was incredibly sad and

126
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,260
disappointed like and the reason I found out actually was the saddest of all I

127
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:53,060
was trying to buy a Linux laptop oh yeah and I went on to their site and found

128
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:59,700
out that they shut down and it was just it was a blow to me I haven't directly

129
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,860
purchased as our reason laptop from them in years like I mostly got it through

130
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,700
friends who bought one for me or some other circumstances but they were nice

131
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,940
computers and the team was friendly and really they really cared about making a

132
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:19,180
good Linux experience and making it useful like regardless of Linux

133
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,980
distribution I think that was the that was the thing I valued the most yeah but

134
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,860
the the other part of this you know just about Linux laptop vendors in general

135
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:34,100
moving a little bit away from our reason the Linux laptop vendors in general do

136
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:41,820
not have a whole lot of marketing power unless you knew someone who knew someone

137
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,140
who who had one from one of these vendors I don't think you would know if

138
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,580
they existed I think system 76 is an aberration in this regard and and

139
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:55,600
tuxedo computers in Germany is a similar aberration but like most Linux laptop

140
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,780
vendors or Linux desktop vendors many of them exist but many of them aren't known

141
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,940
and I think they basically operated on like what you call family business

142
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:13,180
margins and budgets and and something like this pandemic which induced all

143
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,160
kinds of interesting supply shortages people shortages all that sort of thing

144
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,060
they don't have the powder on hand the cash to weather that and this is what

145
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:31,020
happens and so if we wanted to have more Linux laptop or desktop vendors you know

146
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:37,260
survive really the way to do that is to help promote them and bring them out you

147
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,420
know from the shadows of being just you know these little shops that help people

148
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:47,060
to being known to the greater community so that they can be supported in the

149
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,580
same way we did with system 76 when they came out when they came out with a

150
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,860
splash with their with their brand and their first laptops you know all those

151
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:01,140
years ago yeah I myself wasn't a customer but it it does it does remind me

152
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,220
that it is it is important that we buy locally essentially that we buy it when

153
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,500
we can buy from a place that is selling it as a Linux product if that's system

154
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,900
76 or maybe it's Dell or Lenovo now it's you buy it in that ecosystem to keep it

155
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,540
strong because of when you buy a machine preloaded with Windows and we all have

156
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,780
to do it from time to time I suppose I'm not shaming anyone but it is

157
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:30,300
essentially it's a vote for the Windows marketplace it's a it furthers and

158
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,300
that's that's the tricky thing here is it makes me think we got to remember

159
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,500
that and there's a lot of hype right now about Apple's m1 and how exciting it

160
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,140
would be to get Linux on there but I think ultimately when you look at what

161
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,460
serves us as a community long term it's it's buying locally from these from

162
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,460
these vendors well and it's a little more tricky these days too with you know

163
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,220
great Linux support coming from companies like Lenovo and Dell and I

164
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,300
think you just got to make sure it's on your list of you know when you're

165
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,660
assessing a new laptop Chris you've been you've been going through this

166
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,340
there's a lot of different trade-offs and I think that item of is this a

167
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,340
business that needs my business and would that help the community well it

168
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,300
should at least be somewhere on your list even if it's not the only factor

169
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,380
yeah there's a lot of things to consider I don't think it can be the sole factor

170
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,060
I don't think you should buy just for that reason solely alone but it

171
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,540
definitely has influenced my shopping I am NOT gonna buy anything that comes

172
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,380
preloaded with Windows for this very reason but let's talk about these m1 max

173
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,620
because there is a lot of interest like it or not I think you could make a

174
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,980
really solid argument that the effort that we're about to talk about would be

175
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,780
better spent on pursuing open platforms and I think a lot of us feel that way

176
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:43,140
but I don't think that takes away from concurrent tasks of making it possible

177
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,420
there's some value in making it possible to run Linux on the m1 Apple machines

178
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:54,180
and it seems that Hector Martin has launched a patreon I invited him on the

179
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,420
show but it was such short timing I don't think it's it was gonna work out

180
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,140
but he's launched a patreon that he's pausing billing on until it reaches

181
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:08,220
$4,000 a month that will in theory be a commitment that he can use to

182
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:14,180
essentially pay for his time to convert or I guess port or whatever you want to

183
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,940
call it make it possible to boot and run Linux on these m1 max which I guess he

184
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:24,180
has some experience in this area what's your read on this Wes long shot well I

185
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,460
think it'll just it'll just be tough what will be tricky I think is deciding

186
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,340
what's the right level I think there's a lot of interest seemingly already

187
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,820
they've crossed that threshold in in donations where it looks like it you

188
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,700
know it it will get funded at least of the 4,000 although the goal itself

189
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:46,860
they're not all complete but getting it to like a really solid experience that

190
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,280
you don't have to be so heavily motivated by Linux to make it worthwhile

191
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,780
especially with so many changes in the m1 things like the the new Apple silicon

192
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:01,140
GPU involved it's just gonna be a long March you're right you know there's some

193
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:06,580
history here he was hacking on Linux on the ps4 for instance clearly a talented

194
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,460
individual it's just gonna be a long time I think even if it goes as well as

195
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,940
possible you know even if it gets workable I guess we check back in in two

196
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:22,860
three years and by that time well how will Linux be doing on the m5 it seems

197
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,980
to me the only shot this thing really has is if Apple supplies some kind of at

198
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,860
least if not code documentation of how the disk controller works or how to

199
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,460
interface with the necessary components of of those disk controllers and whatnot

200
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:45,540
because getting Linux to boot on the m1 while valuable is not nearly as valuable

201
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,380
as actually being able to install and run it on the physical disk and and use

202
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:55,220
all of those components but unlike getting like around just a bootloader

203
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,900
which apparently Apple does have provisions to allow users to unlock the

204
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,340
bootloader and install whatever OS they want they they've apparently built that

205
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,420
into these m1 Macs but it's not just that right it's it's the drivers for

206
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,060
everything in this thing because it's all custom to Apple it may be from some

207
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,060
vendors upstream then we can once we figure out who that is we can take large

208
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,620
swaths of another driver and make it work but it's not like getting Linux

209
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,500
running on an Intel Mac where the t2 or the bootloader is your biggest challenge

210
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,100
but then it's Intel motherboard components and it's Intel wireless and

211
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,380
it's Bluetooth that you know how to work with and it's an audio interface that

212
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,820
you know how to work with like these are all going to be different on an m1 Mac

213
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:42,060
and so the scale of the problem is massive and then of course Apple won't

214
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:47,700
be sitting still especially at this stage in the m1s lifespan so they very

215
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,820
quickly are going to be iterating on this platform and will leave these m1s in

216
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,900
the dust surely by within two years yeah I think the question there will be you

217
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,140
know how much does the platform change and how much does the basic low-level

218
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,180
sort of communications channels that are needed stay the same and how much you

219
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,180
know is it an iteration or do we see a continued revolution on there on their

220
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,420
new totally custom platform which they have a lot more leeway to change and

221
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,700
like Lin mob says in the IRC room just imagine how difficult it's gonna be to

222
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,180
get the GPU working well so there's some good discussion in the in the Twitter

223
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,140
thread someone asked you know do you think it's gonna be feasible to put an

224
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,260
open stack on Apple's GPU and Hector's responses time will tell but I don't

225
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:32,700
think it's impossible Nvidia GPUs aren't exactly simple and yet new though exists

226
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,260
and yeah that's definitely true but I think that that is the right context to

227
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,520
look at this you might get something that's usable you might eventually get a

228
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,940
Linux desktop that displays you a desktop and you can use to browse the

229
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,340
web but it won't be all the things you're excited about from the Apple side

230
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:53,660
of the platform at least anytime soon and that's where I get to imagine this

231
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,980
amount of effort and this skill level being poured into open power PC or risk

232
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,660
five it just seems like so much more benefit from that right it just

233
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,580
ultimately while yes it would be great I feel like what needs to happen is a

234
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,500
shift in perception and maybe Apple will prove me wrong and I actually would love

235
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,700
it if they did but I think we need to shift our perception of these they're

236
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,060
not necessarily computers they're inclusive products they're a holistic

237
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:25,420
device like your Nintendo switch yeah you can get Linux on there but that's

238
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,500
definitely not what it's meant for it's not a general computing device that's

239
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,100
meant for you to load Windows or your own Linux or freeBSD or or whatever the

240
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,060
hell you want and we have to stop thinking of it that way because that's

241
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,100
just not what the intention is it's it's designed to be the best Mac possible

242
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,220
which is what those customers want and I don't think it's ever gonna be anything

243
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:53,660
else if Apple comes out with open source drivers or I mean starts working upstream

244
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:59,260
to make it possible I will be the first to cover it probably quite literally and

245
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,380
I will be the first to congratulate them and retract the statement but I just

246
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,460
don't think it's ever gonna happen I guess time will tell I mean you know you

247
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,700
can't stop hardware hackers from from hacking on things trying to make it work

248
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,300
and it is exciting to see you know what possible gains might be out there but as

249
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,140
ever it is a question of resources and this one won't I won't be planning to

250
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,940
buy M1 hardware for Linux at least anytime soon it has happened it's gotten

251
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,340
it's got up and running on the switch it's it's works on they've got it

252
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,400
working on the PlayStation before it absolutely happens and and somebody will

253
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,620
find a use for it so there's there's that as well so maybe maybe in a year

254
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,860
so I'll be sitting here talking about how I'm thinking about buying an arm

255
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,140
based Mac so that way I can run arch on it maybe it turns into a little you know

256
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,380
little headless box you use for your iOS builds there Chris actually you know

257
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,060
what thinking about it quite literally how I would use it is I would use it as

258
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:58,180
a way to bring life into older MacBooks so even if the support leg behind if you

259
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,440
know you could take a Mac book that maybe Apple had abandoned and was no

260
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,220
longer shipping Mac OS for but you could get Linux confidently running on it I

261
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,020
think that would be a victory that would be a success if that's the goalpost

262
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,100
ultimately then I'm a hundred percent for it I might even consider backing it

263
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,940
I want it you know what the more the more we talk about this the more I think

264
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,140
I want to talk to Hector and and kind of get his take on it where he thinks it's

265
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,820
going because that could be something I get behind I could talk myself into that

269
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,260
they make it easy for anyone at any skill level to get started no matter

270
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,300
what technology stack you use Linode can help your ideas come to life if you just

271
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,300
need a personal web server for a blog or a portfolio or maybe your business needs

272
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:56,340
to scale to serve millions Linode can help you with that and unlike entry

273
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,400
level hosting services that lock you into their platform Linode gives you

274
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,380
full back-end access to customize and control your server to fit your needs

275
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:08,180
they have a great DNS manager simple to take backups one-click app deployments

276
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,340
and if Kubernetes is your speed to manage your infrastructure Linode has

277
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,140
you covered there you can easily manage your Kubernetes cluster with Linode's

278
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,380
fully managed container orchestration engine also a great way to learn if you

279
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,660
want to learn cybersecurity or practice something before you have to do it in

280
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,740
production Linode has some great options there at great price points but one of

281
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,840
the things that I encourage you to look into is their s3 compatible object

282
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,900
storage if you're not familiar object storage is essentially an easy way for

283
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,100
you to store and access data in the cloud without having to run a front-end

284
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,980
file server it's perfect for data that doesn't change regularly this is where

285
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,340
we use it all the time for show assets that are essentially static and what

286
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,300
something is up in their s3 compatible object storage it's really easy to get a

287
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,340
URL and share that file if you want or maybe even use something like that to

288
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,980
power a static website we use Linode's powerful virtual servers to run our

289
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,060
infrastructure our matrix server our encoding server our new next cloud

290
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:09,180
server all of its on Linode my personal servers are on Linode Linode started in

291
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:14,420
2003 as one of the first companies to even get into what is now known as cloud

292
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:19,260
computing three years before AWS go check it out see what I've been raving

293
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,420
about and support one of our sponsors who's made our transition to

294
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,420
independence possible linode.com slash unplugged thanks to Linode for

295
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,700
sponsoring this show and thanks to everyone who supports our sponsors out

296
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:38,340
there linode.com slash unplugged okay prepare yourself because we're gonna get

297
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:44,300
geeky about ZFS because some major milestones have just been reached and I

298
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:49,140
want to try to understand it all obviously we're ZFS users here but also

299
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,900
as things change and you just it's nice to stay up to date and keep keep current

300
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:59,300
so it's now called open ZFS 2.0 and I wanted to play a little bit of Matt

301
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,220
Aaron's at giving us a brief state of the union on ZFS and then what I'm gonna

302
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,540
basically do is try to talk Weston explaining all the good new stuff to us

303
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,620
now I'd like to talk a little bit about the overview of the state of the project

304
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:18,940
so last year I talked quite a bit about what's gonna be coming in open ZFS 2.0

305
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:25,700
and the big thing is that we we've now combined the source code for open ZFS on

306
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,420
both Linux and FreeBSD and last year I talked about how this is going along

307
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:34,260
really well it's going to come out in 2020 it is still going to come out in

308
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:39,260
2020 so this project is very far along we've released three release candidates

309
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:44,020
so far it's on 2.0 RC 3 right now just came out last week and the final

310
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,700
release will still is still on track to come out before the end of the year

311
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,020
possibly even before the end of the month please don't quote me on that but

312
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,620
that's that's that's what we're aiming for and here's some of the features new

313
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,700
features that you'll see in the next release of open ZFS so this basically is

314
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:10,180
superseding the zol releases so this is stuff that's new since zol 0.8 and this

315
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,220
is a continuation of that code base but now with support for FreeBSD as well and

316
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,420
most of these a lot of these we've given talks at previous conferences about so

317
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,740
things like you know all this performance work redacted send and

318
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,140
receive in fact we will link you to some of those talks but in addition to the

319
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:34,340
unified code base for now Linux and FreeBSD it's no longer ZFS on Linux it's

320
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,060
just open ZFS now right Wes yeah isn't that neat I mean from something that

321
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,940
felt like a weird stepchild of the whole ZFS family to now be in the place that

322
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,020
you know a lot of the development effort is actually happening and it's also just

323
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,660
a great example of a wonderful open source project that manages to work with

324
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,980
like pretty much full parity across two very different operating system kernels

325
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,300
but both of them being open source software that's amazing yeah it is and

326
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,540
now they say they're targeting macOS as well so they may have macOS support in

327
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:11,540
open ZFS 3.0 they've they kind of talked up some of the features the one that

328
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,980
kind of stands out to me and I don't fully grasp why you would need it but

329
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:21,820
it's L2 arc support so the level 2 arc in ZFS is like this cache right that is

330
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,580
sort of the most frequently used stuff that ZFS keeps in there well it's the

331
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,100
second layer and you've got the arc the adaptive replacement cache and that's

332
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,780
that's for the first you know the nice smart cache to handle stuff that you

333
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,060
don't really need to go fetch off disk again just keep that hot and fresh in

334
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:39,700
RAM and ZFS does a great job of managing that but if you just you know grams too

335
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,300
expensive you'd only have a certain amount you want more cache for stuff

336
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:48,260
that's not quite as as well used but in the next layer of used you can have a

337
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,940
faster disk say right you've got like a big pool of old-fashioned spinning rust

338
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,500
then you've got like a nice shiny NVMe that you can use as a cache for after

339
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:02,340
RAM that's the L2 arc well this new feature is known as the persistent L2

340
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,340
arc and this just basically saves you time let's say you know you had to

341
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,980
reboot your system you did some updates or you just something happened there's

342
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,460
a fault there's kernel panic whatever most of the time with the existing

343
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,220
implementation of the L2 arc well you have to go rebuild that cache so you

344
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,620
won't get the advantages of having a good cache until you've actually done

345
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,260
gone through you've had your service up and running stuff's actually looking at

346
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,500
stuff from the disk trying to pull it but if your workload doesn't change

347
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,100
that's just wasted time rebuilding basically the same or a similar version

348
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,660
of the cache with persistent L2 arc that's just gonna get loaded back up and

349
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,100
you don't have you can skip that time ah that's handy there's a couple of things

350
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:45,260
in here that make it seem like just using ZFS overall is gonna be quicker

351
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:51,280
amongst just general performance fixes there's also a new compression standard

352
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,780
Z standard Z standard it's a modern high performance general compression

353
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,300
algorithm which should give better compression levels really similar to the

354
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,660
GZIP but with much better performance and it's also got a big selection of

355
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,120
different compression levels so depending on what your data is what your

356
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,920
trade-offs that you want to make you can choose and configure that I think it's

357
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,340
also neat because it's just a cool open source project that was invented at

358
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,540
Facebook back in like 2016 then the Linux kernel got it and it's been an

359
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:22,160
available compression option over in butter fs for a while now and then free

360
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,300
BSD got it originally to compress core dumps thanks to our friend Alan Jude

361
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,620
who also made a proof of concept over there for using it for ZFS that's

362
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,620
finally now been integrated how neat is that welcome to BSD unplugged your

363
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,900
weekly BSD talk show that's too busy getting actual work done to care about

364
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,780
what your silly display server my name is Alan love you Alan yeah that's great

365
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,780
that is really cool to see that get in there tons of stuff like we could do a

366
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:54,660
show that'd be way too long about all of the stuff that's in 2.0 so we will link

367
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,420
to some of the details and of course as always Michael Arbol over there crushing

368
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,700
it with the deets he's got an article that summarizes some of it as well and

369
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,540
it's cool to see this stuff landing I do wonder if we're really gonna see any

370
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,380
movement on what distros adopted or not I doubt it but if you have means of

371
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,140
accessing it it's gonna be a nice little upgrade get yourself prepared for

372
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:22,420
another round of DKMS rebuild exactly let's something we should probably do

373
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:27,220
kind of soon too well maybe next episode we should do an art server update but we

374
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:33,060
need to look into the future with with GNOME and there's a major feature

375
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,420
announcement for GNOME 40 remember that's what they're going to next is

376
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:41,500
version 40 and mutter is moving that's the back end display compositor is

377
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:49,940
moving input work to its own dedicated thread a separate get ready for this

378
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:57,140
Wes a separate CPU thread for the input this long in development effort led

379
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:02,300
by red hat aimed at restructuring mutter that's I mean it's just good right you

380
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,080
don't want the input work handled on the same thread if you don't have to and now

381
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,140
the import work will be able to be moved over to a separate CPU thread and it's

382
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,340
finally at a state where it was merged into git I think it's been developed

383
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,100
it's been played with but I mean this is a fairly big architectural change right

384
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:24,060
the merge request had been open for the past three months but was merged on

385
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:31,380
Friday this is massive this input should the input thread should allow for

386
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:36,300
avoiding possible cursor jumpiness and situations where your pointer kind of

387
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,140
lurches across the screen it should deal with high-frequency input devices a lot

388
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,420
better it should make sure that no lib input events are missed not to mention

389
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:50,900
it's just a superior way to architect a workstation desktop and recently on the

390
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:56,940
show I've talked about how much I've really been enjoying desktop you really

391
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,620
have a little gnome Renaissance over there it was like I came back home for

392
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:07,700
the holidays and my room was still there and it was like oh I love this I love

393
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,620
this and it was great and I got I got the green bean casserole just the way I

394
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,340
like it when I came down for breakfast it was just like being home again the

395
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:21,900
the thing is like being at home it eventually all comes crashing back down

396
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,740
and you remember why you moved out as early as possible and why you only go

397
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:32,660
back for the holidays Wes you saw a little bit of it because was it Sunday I

398
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:36,900
was you showed up and I was stuck upstairs in my office for like an extra

399
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,620
15 minutes before I could come down and say hi to you at the studio because I

400
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:46,500
was just dealing with my computer being slow and input lagging because I was

401
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:52,380
editing god forbid a two and a half hour video file and I was cutting audio from

402
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:57,060
it for the shows and I was getting I was extracting audio segments and having a

403
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,380
large file and working with an application that is trying to display a

404
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:05,020
very large waveform and move about and then have to have some other

405
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,860
applications in the background that are transcoding maybe wave files to flack I

406
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,620
mean this is you know it's it this is a system that I've built that has 12

407
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:21,580
overall addressable threads and I have a dedicated rate 0 14 terabyte scratch

408
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:28,220
array that I use for any files that I'm working on editing my OS is on a

409
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:36,540
dedicated MVME disk that's where my root is and then my home partition is on a

410
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:43,580
dedicated fancy fast Intel two and a half SATA disk and I have every I have

411
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:49,060
it all split out like that plus I have 32 gigs of RAM so I mean it's not like

412
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,740
I'm doing and I'm just cutting audio from a video file it's opened up in an

413
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,780
audio editor but the whole interface just when I'm doing a task that for me

414
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:04,380
is a really standard occurrence the UI becomes unresponsive like right-clicking

415
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,900
on say like an icon it has a delay and when you're moving windows around they

416
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:14,380
get kind of leggy and they kind of stutter around a little bit and when

417
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,220
you're trying to move really quick and it's something that maybe you do every

418
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,980
day and so you're really fast at this task and when you're really fast at

419
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,660
something and you're waiting for your computer like even if you have like this

420
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,420
experience at work if you have something you do for work kind of repeatedly and

421
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,500
you really can just blast through it faster than anybody you know and then

422
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,740
you're you're waiting for your computer at each stage for every time you alt tab

423
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,860
and every time you click on a menu and every time you try to bring up files and

424
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:46,500
when you drag and drop and it just becomes so aggravating and you think to

425
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:52,260
yourself what more can I do I've got a modern high-end AMD GPU I've split up my

426
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:57,220
disk workloads as much as possible I've got tons of RAM I'm only using six gigs

427
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:03,300
of it I've got 12 addressable CPU cores it's a desktop plugged into Ethernet

428
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:09,940
like what more can I do to let my computer work it so I can work as to

429
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,620
the my computer lets me work as fast as effective as possible why are you so

430
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,420
slow and so you know I came downstairs like I just don't know I'm gonna do yes

431
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,540
it's just like it's really aggravating because this is I do this kind of all

432
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,700
the time and I was I was having to talk about it because I've really been

433
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,980
annoying enjoying gnomeshell but I find this very annoying so I was asking you

434
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,620
what would you do what should I do what distro should I do and that's that's

435
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,820
kind of how we got to Endeavor OS but we'll save that for the analysis but I

436
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:43,820
ultimately I decided to go back to the plasma desktop because I just don't

437
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,060
experience this particular kind of frustration there are other paper cuts

438
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,700
but not that paper cut right you you know you win some you lose some but

439
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:58,700
especially for you who are on a high-end machine with real workflow needs it's

440
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,620
sort of like that the existing state of genome and not all of it was necessarily

441
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,700
built for the way that you're trying to operate and I kind of enjoy with my

442
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,940
monitor setup I enjoy the window rules where things always open up in the same

443
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,940
spot when I launched them I like that consistency for my kind of setup yes so

444
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,540
that's that was nice it was like it honestly to complete the metaphor it was

445
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,780
like when after you're done visiting family and you get back to your own

446
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:29,740
place and you're like oh yeah I way more prefer this it doesn't look as good I

447
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:33,620
didn't decorate as nicely but all my things are here and I know what food is

448
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,300
in the fridge yeah exactly that's so much what that's so much what the

449
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,220
experience was like and I didn't I thought the I thought it'd feel like a

450
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:45,220
big compromise but I was like oh no this is actually home and so I have so much

451
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,380
respect for what both desktop teams are doing because there's things I just love

452
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:54,100
about all of them but to see this kind of move for gnome 40 where they're gonna

453
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:59,660
start to break this stuff off that's that's huge because that may end up

454
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:04,020
ultimately being the best of both worlds for me and no one had to get assimilated

455
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:08,740
so big things look like they're in the works for gnome 40 they've also

456
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:16,380
officially announced gnome circle which is kind of a way to include I guess more

457
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,700
people in the gnome clubhouse you don't necessarily in the past if you wanted to

458
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,340
be part of the gnome project your projects needed to be hosted on gnome

459
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:31,900
infrastructure and you had to follow their rules but gnome circle aims to

460
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,420
sort of change that yeah now to become members projects must simply be

461
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,020
open-source software and use the gnome platform both applications and

462
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:45,020
development libraries can apply and projects don't need to be hosted on

463
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:50,600
gnome infrastructure nor do they need to follow gnomes release schedule now what

464
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,980
do you get when you'll be eligible for a range of benefits including promotion

465
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,940
gnome foundation membership and that gives access to things like travel and

466
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:02,540
marketing funding services including an at gnome org email address blog hosting

467
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,300
video conferencing and hey I'm gonna next cloud account so you actually get

468
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,300
to be part of the family but you don't have to play by all of the rules yeah I

469
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,260
might mean we get to see a bunch of cool desktop applications and whatnot start

470
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,060
showing up that are maybe a little more independent but sort of follow that

471
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,140
desktop ethos so they look really good as a part of your desktop I think that

472
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:28,820
could be a really lovely development just a little bit of cleaning just a

473
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,020
little bit here and there every now and then it's always worth mentioning you

474
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:38,460
should join the luck plug our virtual lug has a whole other event outside the

475
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:44,240
show on Sundays and they do that at noon Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern in the lobby we

476
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,620
have our mumble info on our website and it's kind of it's perfect because if we

477
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,160
ever have a backup time where we need to record the show that's when we do it

478
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,860
because we know there's people in there and so there's other reasons it's kind

479
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,500
of fun you know it's a great place to hang out and chat with people but can

480
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,220
also maybe every now and then catch a live show and I'll also give a mention

481
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:08,740
to the all shows feed if you're subscribed to that you'll know that

482
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:13,540
Linux action news has recently been revamped with mr. West pain joining the

483
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,380
team and I'm really loving where we're going with it and if you're if you're

484
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,420
only listening to this show you're only getting half the story there is a whole

485
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,140
other set of stories that we cover in Linux action news and that's the stuff

486
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,540
that kind of dense the open source universe every week particularly great

487
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:34,220
if you want to be or are in the industry and you want to stay current on stuff

488
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,900
that has wider ramifications to Linux action news has got you covered so check

489
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:43,900
that out if you're not already linuxactionnews.com and that my friends

490
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:49,980
is all the tidying we need to do today so it's time for an endeavor OS check

491
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:54,180
and something I promised when they first announced and we took a look at it and I

492
00:37:54,180 --> 00:38:00,060
sort of judged it as need some time to cook but we should come back to it and

493
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,980
that was a little bit ago and here we are they have a new release in the works

494
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,060
right now they just put one out in September and then of course because

495
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,780
it's based on arch you can get up-to-date in between pretty quickly so

496
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:22,220
endeavor OS has found itself a comfortable niche in the distro world

497
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:27,100
because God knows there's a plenty of Linux distros out there and you really

498
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,860
kind of have to wonder what makes different distro stand out from each

499
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:35,420
other especially when you have mangero which is clearly filling a big need for

500
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:40,020
people who want a productized arch right there's already arch with an installer

501
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,380
in several different forms so like what do we get in here yeah and a big

502
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:50,380
community too right so I think and it's it was evident when they launched but I

503
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,940
think as time has gone on they have refined their position in the market

504
00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:01,220
with a maybe more clever pitch they very much are not focusing or even pushing a

505
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:06,100
desktop or even branding they say on their website endeavor OS is mainly a

506
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:10,420
terminal centric distro with some gooey tools out of the box like our welcome

507
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:15,500
app reflector auto and a kernel tool to make jump-starting easier and with these

508
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,860
tools and the power of the terminal we offer you the opportunity to give you

509
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,380
full control from the start in creating a system that suits your idea in

510
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:27,820
computing they even kind of list no branding as a feature so wrap your head

511
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,700
around that because that's got to be as a distro that's that's got to be a hard

512
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,540
choice you're gonna you're gonna remove your wallpaper you're gonna remove your

513
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,460
branding if the user chooses well then how are they gonna remember are they

514
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:46,300
gonna know but they offer that if you use their online installer you get a

515
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,500
choice of desktop environment but they really seem to be refining their pitch

516
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,840
as as close to arch as possible they say on their website and I love this with

517
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:02,420
the exception of our in-house developed reflector auto the welcome screen and a

518
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:07,820
kernel manager and the update notifier all of the packages are installed

519
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:12,780
directly from the arch repos or from the AUR they are not customized or modified

520
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,020
they're not coming from our own repo we want to stay as close to arch as

521
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:21,540
possible and so that's I think where they're trying to position themselves is

522
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:28,260
a Kickstarter to get into just a long term arch setup for the desktop does

523
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:33,660
that appeal to you you know it kind of does at least you know I don't know if

524
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:38,660
it's necessarily what I would choose to use to set up my next arch system which

525
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:43,820
by the way I do think my next system will be an arch system again but I'm

526
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,400
glad this exists because if I'm going to be working on a system if I'm gonna

527
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,180
advise other folks to do this I just don't know that many folks who've been

528
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,740
down the road of setting up an arch system have gone through all the

529
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,780
installs have done that and who really just like doing it all the time I kind

530
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,260
of do for me that's it's like a rite of passage it's a way you sort of get

531
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,700
familiar it's almost like you're paying the upfront cost to really understand

532
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,660
and feel connected to your system that I really like about running arch but I

533
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,620
also get that for many you just want the you know the easy maintenance the

534
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:18,660
simplicity and the great access to packages and for that use case this

535
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:22,860
seems perfect and they never have to install it again if you don't screw it

536
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,940
up you know that's that's super appealing to me some of my longest

537
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,460
installs have turned out to be arch boxes and I know this people listening

538
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:33,980
there oh arts are talking about ours you can roll your eyes I kind of I think you

539
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:39,460
should try to put that aside if I could be so direct and and consider that

540
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,300
there's obviously something that's appealing to a certain market because on

541
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,540
top of whatever everything that West just touched on I have to be honest with

542
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,100
you I think just because I've been around for a long time I don't think

543
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:55,380
this would impact new users to the desktop but I find it a big relief to

544
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:01,300
not think about if I'm installing a flat pack a snap a deb or an rpm it's such a

545
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:08,100
relief just to say yay that's the that's the helper I use yay dash s slack or

546
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:14,020
telegram and I'm not doing the overhead of what do I want a flat pack of this if

547
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,580
it's a snap and it's confined am I gonna have some issues because I do

548
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:21,860
attachments with this app it's just a binary it's gonna be as fast as possible

549
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:26,980
because there is there's no there's no like structure around it it's just a

550
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:32,020
binary on my computer and it's gonna get updated really quickly sometimes as soon

551
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:36,500
as the git repo has been updated and I'll only have to run one command ever

552
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,740
do that ever like what I was doing on pop which I got down pretty well I was I

553
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:45,300
would have to do apt updates and then I would have to do flat pack updates and

554
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,340
then I would you know and I have to do both of them I just got down and snap

555
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:52,860
just takes care of itself but I just as a longtime user I guess I guess I

556
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:59,420
haven't really liked that overhead that the that I take when I even on fedora

557
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:03,900
it's like I'm always kind of wondering what's the downside of having my video

558
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,700
player as a flat pack is there a downside to that does that mean it's

559
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,580
gonna does that does that mean there's gonna be any difference in where it can

560
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,940
get to on the file system or access to what video decoding you can do like I

561
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:17,700
just have to do that math and it's exhausting and I don't have that with an

562
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:22,700
arch based distro and so what endeavor OS is done here is they've said hey we

563
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,380
get that you want arch but you also don't have a lot of time you don't want

564
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,620
to be worried about who's maintaining these packages what the delay is you

565
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,040
just want if it's an arch you want it but you don't want to bother with the

566
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,900
whole setup process it's an interesting kind of middle of the road too because

567
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,740
it's not it's clearly not aimed necessarily at you know like brand new

568
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:46,340
users folks you don't who aren't prepared for arch it's terminal centric

569
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,060
distro right but at the same time they have a lot of nice little utilities like

570
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,020
in there in their welcome utility that sort of get you going explain some stuff

571
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,700
helps you out with helpful tools helps you know some guides to like well here's

572
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,820
how you start installing stuff from the AUR so it's it's an interesting sweet

573
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,220
spot of yeah you want to use this computer but we're still gonna cut you

574
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:09,660
some slack we've got some docs we've got a wiki we've got a forum got all the

575
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,740
usual structure it's like you do need some help well there's folks around and

576
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:17,500
there's some docs for that too they have applied their customization at just the

577
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:23,620
right points so a live session starts with their welcome app it's an XFCE based

578
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:29,180
desktop which in general the any GTK desktop is just a mess about where it

579
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,380
puts the windows across my three screens but this one was particular hilarious

580
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,700
like it would just be random what screens different dialog boxes would

581
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,540
pop on and what orientation they would be in but once I got everything

582
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,340
centralized on one screen I noticed that they have a tool right there they're

583
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:48,620
the reflector auto tool reflector is a tool in arch that goes out and helps you

584
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:53,420
find the fastest mirrors and update your mirror list well they just have like a

585
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:58,660
one-button click to do that they ask you a couple of questions and then it gives

586
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:03,620
you a super fresh fast set of mirrors and that's really nice because that's

587
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,820
something I do when I'm setting up an arch box already then they have an

588
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,440
update this app button so that way you know you have the latest version of the

589
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,660
welcome app and presumably the installer and then I like that they have an

590
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:19,020
offline mode and an online mode to install offline mode just gives you like

591
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:23,220
a their XFCE desktop environment with the packages that are released on that

592
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,140
ISO and it's a good-looking it is you know actually that's what that's what I

593
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,100
went I figured that's what I'd try and I stuck with it because it's a it's a

594
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:35,340
sharp XFCE enough that took me a few minutes of having to go poke around to

595
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,100
figure out oh yeah this is XFCE the first time I booted it up that is

596
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:43,300
legitimately the benchmark when you know they've got XFCE right is when you

597
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,540
can't tell it first because it just looks like a modern desktop and that's

598
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:50,820
slick and you could really see the appeal to that or so that's the offline

599
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:54,300
mode or if you use and that's nice to have I should say I'm all over the place

600
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,180
I'm very excited about this but offline mode super nice to have really

601
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,940
appreciate that that's an option and they kind of have a little bit more

602
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:06,540
experimental online method which lets you select a desktop environment at the

603
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:10,500
time of install and pulls down the latest versions of everything from the

604
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,700
arch repo and again that's where having that reflector tool comes in handy

605
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,100
because that means as you install it's gonna be the fastest package

606
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:24,140
installation transfers as possible and I think these features and even the

607
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:29,740
process are just clearly more appealing to experienced Linux users who've

608
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,780
probably been through this rigamarole before they understand that like using a

609
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,980
fastest mirror for example means your system will install faster like that

610
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,640
could be as an example of the type of user that understands that difference

611
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:46,040
it's kind of the type of user this is targeted at and I think endeavor OS is

612
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:51,380
nailing that it's for people who like to mess with computers it's for people who

613
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:57,660
like to mess with computers and you know who you are and it it's not better it's

614
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:02,140
not like the superior distro it's just another option it's it's a set of

615
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:06,260
features that are appealing to my uses of Linux like I mentioned with

616
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:11,080
everything Wes and I talked about plus these options right at install the ones

617
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,620
you're done are just kind of out of your way but having these these choices of a

618
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:20,140
custom partitioner that is actually surprisingly customizable it recognized

619
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:26,260
my LVM raid and even even recognized like the the disk that is the is the

620
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,900
output of that and all of it and let me manage all of it in a way that is

621
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,300
possible in most distros but some distros don't even make it don't even

622
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:38,340
make that approachable and it's not like because endeavor OS has all these things

623
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:43,140
Ubuntu or Fedora are bad it's they're just different it's a matter of personal

624
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,380
preference but I think I'm the kind of user that prefers to have access to

625
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,260
these kind of more power user style features at the beginning of install and

626
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:56,180
I you know I went through there on my main workstation which I originally

627
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,580
wasn't gonna install this on but then I really started to enjoy it and it was

628
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:04,020
fantastic to just choose this disk layout that I mentioned earlier and and

629
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:10,620
be able to visually see it and lock it in and reboot my box and it just it was

630
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:14,740
all there it's a very basic plain install but it's all there I mean I think

631
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,380
if you were gonna set this up by hand in the regular archway I'm not sure you

632
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,980
would have been done by the showtime no no I did it this morning not planned I

633
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,500
was just gonna just keep on keeping but I thought you know I was really enjoying

634
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,800
it so I was like let's see if I can get this done this morning and I chose

635
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,380
plasma as my desktop environment again and it's going pretty smooth so far I

636
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:43,300
really like it it's it's there's something else I find kind of appealing

637
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:48,180
about and I don't know if this is gonna be a factor but I'm trying I'm trying to

638
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:52,980
be open-minded when I get my new laptop whenever that happens I want to put an

639
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,580
OS on there that I'm really gonna stick with for a while I want to put a distro

640
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,380
on there and I know myself I know that sometimes when I get like kind of

641
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:03,340
stressed out I can I can kind of start to distro hop as a way to quote-unquote

642
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:07,580
problem-solve with immediate results where maybe I'm struggling with

643
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,860
something that takes a long time to resolve and it's frustrating so I want

644
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:14,020
something I can make a change to immediately and see some immediate

645
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,180
benefit and sometimes that's why I think I distro hop so I have to be aware of

646
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,160
all of these aspects it's it's a complicated psychological thing for me

647
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:27,060
with you know it's hard to pick a distro these days well it is and you know

648
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:31,100
you're gonna leave it running for a while forever at least with you but it's

649
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,780
gonna stick around you want it you want to make the right choice and you don't

650
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:38,620
want to regret that later when everything's broken and on fire I got in

651
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:43,220
my head too I started thinking if I say it was on air and I ran Ubuntu all the

652
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:47,180
time and I talked about how I always run Ubuntu or what I noticed when I talk

653
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:51,740
about how I use pop OS people think like oh he's so in the bag for Ubuntu or

654
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,780
he's running pop OS because system 76 paid him to do it or if I run Fedora

655
00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:00,420
it's like oh he must he must be a big fan of Red Hat and I worry that like the

656
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,700
distro I choose to run like sends a signal in a way just because of being on

657
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:12,900
the show and while arch sort of sends a like oh by the way use arch it doesn't

658
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:18,140
signal any kind of corporate allegiance it's sort of like neutral territory much

659
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:23,340
like Debian is and so in a way it kind of feels like that in the back of my

660
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:27,220
mind is playing a role in the distro I may choose to going forward is just

661
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:31,580
simply I know arch I can make it work for me I'm very happy with it and it

662
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:38,220
essentially means I'm I'm neutral yeah you know I I don't I don't have some

663
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,540
sort of perceived bias because I use pop OS or because I mean right because I'm

664
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,980
running on Fedora we all know you're in the pocket of the Linux foundation

665
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:52,420
anyway yeah I'm getting that big foundation money for sure I don't know

666
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:55,100
maybe that's just maybe I'm just up in my head about it but it's been on my

667
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:00,260
mind too as I go through this and I kind of like that I don't really I know that

668
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,420
over the years there's been drama with arch here and there but I can't really

669
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,180
articulate anything at the moment but mostly not right I mean you don't you

670
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,660
just don't expect the next big thing the back next big tumult that we'll end up

671
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:14,540
talking about here on the show if you're running arch it probably won't be about

672
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,740
your distro might be about some software you're running but then you'll

673
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,220
just be running the upstream stuff anyway I do like them fresh packages

674
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:25,540
that's the it's like if I was gonna go if I was gonna go gnome desktop Ubuntu

675
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,300
and Fedora I'm much more appealing because you get that fresh gnome shell

676
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:33,700
sauce right when it's pretty much as soon as possible like arches it takes

677
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,820
even longer to get an arch than it does in Fedora Ubuntu you know but yeah I

678
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,700
looked at it and I thought you know it's very it's a you tilt it's a

679
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:45,340
utilitarian move for me much like plasma is a very utilitarian desktop for me and

680
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:49,000
I think the two things might work well together and I think endeavor OS could

681
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,180
be the way I got there and I kind of love it because anti gross was my

682
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:58,700
solution in the past for some machines but it felt like too much where I do not

683
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,140
get that sense with endeavor OS it really feels like it's pretty much there

684
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:05,860
to help me get it rolling and then they're out and it's peace out have a

685
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:09,020
good time enjoy your arch box yeah that's not too much and it felt like

686
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:13,180
like with the with the little reflector helper it was kind of just of an enough

687
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:16,340
of a gooey for me like I can do it I know how to edit this in the command

688
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:19,620
file but scrolling through to find just the countries I want or you know

689
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:23,980
whatever else it's just really nice to have a quick gooey I could click it had

690
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,780
already figured out that I just wanted you know servers in the United States

691
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:32,620
had HTTPS already selected boom I also when I was in the forum and Frank was

692
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:36,540
just reminded me Frank it sounds like one of the founders of endeavor OS has

693
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:40,220
been having some medical problems recently yeah Brian is really a very

694
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,980
nice guy and he's been having a few medical issues but I really think you

695
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:49,140
should get him on he is a wonderful person to talk to and is really focused

696
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:54,380
on his community and that forum that you were talking about they are really

697
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,900
helpful that's a really nice thing to hear I don't think I've had enough

698
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:02,540
exposure yet to really make a call but it's good to get that feedback yeah I

699
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,580
we will try to track him down or Brian if you're listening reach out to me on

700
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:10,820
telegram or Twitter I'm Chris lass or Chris at Jupiter broadcasting comm I

701
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,980
would love to chat and I hope he gets better I saw that news and it's really

702
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:20,780
sad because it's such a great solid distro so my best goes out to him so I

703
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:26,500
really like it West would it be stupid nuts ridiculous to put this on the new

704
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:31,700
studio hardware would it be crazy I mean Ubuntu has served us so well that the

705
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,220
only reason I would want to replace it would just simply be for consistency

706
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,260
whoo now you're getting exciting I thought you're gonna say reinstall it on

707
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:42,060
our server in the garage but okay okay we'll start with the studio hardware

708
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:47,900
well no the server is already arch it sure is you know if if we get jack maybe

709
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,860
pipeline you're going I think we I think it could work I think it could work well

710
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,500
test box yeah but we need a text box we should probably run the test box for a

711
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,580
little while go through a couple update cycles and figure out this is gonna work

712
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:03,060
for what we need yeah I think we're gonna stick with it it's just we are

713
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,260
getting to a point where we really have to we you know we we were we were very

714
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,180
generously sent some hardware so we have to run that through some validation

715
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,260
testing and we have some machines we have to replace its maintenance season

716
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,780
in the studio very much so funny how that always seems to happen around the

717
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:19,940
holidays and I don't think we're gonna put 1804 on there which is what some of

718
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:24,060
them have now so where do we go next this is a serious perpetual problem I

719
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:28,140
have but I enjoy I think at the same time we'll figure it out we'll figure it

720
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,460
out maybe folks should write in and let us know you know if we should if we

721
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,300
should go down this dark road yeah I'd actually be curious to know what their

722
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,740
studio production experiences are what are you doing audio on out there

723
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:46,620

737
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:51,260
while visiting the Linode site I typed in Linode comm slash Linux and I found a

738
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:55,660
pleasant little Easter egg oh that's why I couldn't get Linux I see I wanted to

739
00:55:55,660 --> 00:56:00,700
get Linode comm slash Linux I was wondering we have slash unplugged he

740
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,900
said if you visit the site of this address you'll get a smile for sure

00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,700
had gotten it but I guess that's that's what it was all right West fire well we

744
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:20,500

I've got another question for you Chris and this one from Harry what are those

760
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:31,020
RF earbuds that you're using I've heard you made reference to the fact that you

761
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:36,500
use RF earbuds instead of Bluetooth what are you using and what are you using in

762
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,380
conjunction for your microphone oh man well I so I have some bad news is

763
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:44,580
they're not earbuds so that's the bad news maybe those are out there if

764
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:50,060
anybody has any recommendations do send those in but what I have been using is

765
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:55,220
more like over-the-ear headphones and I was just searching my orders to try to

766
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,580
get the exact model number of them but and I know I have them somewhere in the

767
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,140
show notes you may be able to find them on the website but when I search my

768
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:06,380
order on Amazon they don't show up they're like Corsair RF headphones that

769
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,860
have a microphone built in that auto mutes when you put the when you put the

770
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,820
mic up and then it unmutes when you put it down which is what I prefer but the

771
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:17,300
brilliant thing about it and I've had some good success with Bluetooth but the

772
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:21,900
brilliant thing about the RF headphones is not only is it super reliable and

773
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:27,640
rock-solid wireless obviously but there's a USB dongle that is an always

774
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:32,980
on existing sound card even if you have the headphones turned off so you're not

775
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:36,940
having this problem where the headphones come and go and so your sound device

776
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:40,100
comes and goes because that that's sometimes like for example maybe chrome

777
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,220
doesn't switch over when you first turn on your Bluetooth headphones because you

778
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,860
have to close and reopen chrome before it'll start sending audio to the new

779
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:50,580
audio device those kind of annoying little problems hate that so much they

780
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:54,380
don't come up because the USB dongle is always there it's always acting as your

781
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,960
sound card so it's always your default output device and then you just turn the

782
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,540
headphones on or off when you want system audio which just how I prefer to

783
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:07,620
work oh you found it thank you yeah they are premium gaming headphones I don't

784
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:11,100
know about that but they do work just fine with Linux and they are great for

785
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:15,860
gaming I don't know about premium gaming headphones I guess they do have an RGB

786
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:20,140
logo on the side that I don't think you can control from Linux so a disclaimer

787
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:24,420
of course yeah well that's good I'm glad I knew you have been using those and I'm

788
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:28,300
glad to hear that they're still working well yeah I I pretty much use them every

789
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:32,020
weekend at least I don't like to use them as much for video conferencing

790
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:37,460
because they are so big but yeah all right so Bennett writes in about the pro

791
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:41,660
one X smartphone hi Chris and Wes I was wondering what your thoughts are for the

792
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:47,420
pro one X smartphone from FX technology and the XDA developers I hadn't heard of

793
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:51,980
the original pro one and my jaw hit the floor when I saw a physical keyboard and

794
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:57,060
it ships with Ubuntu touch and lineage OS and the specs well they're pretty good

795
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:02,380
I'm fairly active on XDA I was fairly active and the phone would be perfect

796
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:06,940
mix between an old Android and my current love for Linux they demolished

797
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,780
their IndieGoGo campaign and it looks like it's gonna ship in March I hope to

798
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:16,060
hear your thoughts Bennett how did I not hear about this Wes this one was new to

799
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:19,980
me too I know thank you for hiding in Bennett yeah I I'm really happy to check

800
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:26,380
it out I actually be kind of down for a I have a I have a very small phone now

801
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:30,780
which I'm really happy with and I could see room in my heart for a bigger phone

802
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:35,620
with a keyboard it's that style where you slide it back and up so the screen

803
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:40,700
kind of pivots up so it kind of is tilted right at you and they say it's a

804
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:47,980
purposely designed function for Android lineage or Ubuntu touch so that looks

805
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:52,900
really good and of course it has USB C out and they talk about connecting it to

806
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:57,580
a larger screen and they have some shots of it with the Ubuntu desktop a

807
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:02,780
Bluetooth mouse and keyboard and then it's connected over USB C kind of kind

808
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:06,380
of one yeah you know this would be pretty nice even if it was just like a

809
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:10,180
handy little remote terminal machine even if I didn't use it as a full-on

810
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:14,660
replacement for my regular smartphone just having this in my bag and my back

811
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:20,900
pocket and the car I'm interested get this West that has a removable battery I

812
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,740
didn't think they still made those they have three left at their Black Friday

813
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:30,320
sale price which is down from 829 to 599 too rich for my blood but I think it's a

814
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:35,300
fair price for what this thing is so they'll probably be sold out out of that

815
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,740
particular one by the time you're hearing this unless you're listening

816
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:41,980
live I'm gonna drop it in the IRC right now so if you want it oh you already did

817
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:46,260
look at you as we're hooking them up but I'll put it in this I'll put the direct

818
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:51,100
link to the Indiegogo in the show notes if you do want to check it out because

819
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,580
even I mean if you have the money to burn even at full price it looks like

820
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:58,660
really nice and the fact that they're aiming for multi OS compatibility out of

821
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:03,780
the box and they have what looks like an actually pretty decent QWERTY keyboard

822
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:07,860
I'm down with that I think that's a pretty solid recommend recommendations

823
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:11,940
so thanks for sending that in those are those are solid all right West have

824
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:16,380
yourself a taco because it is time for the picks and I mentioned earlier I

825
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:19,940
wasn't sure about having a video player as a flat pack well I'm gonna recommend

826
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:26,820
a flat pack that's a video player it's a really great MPV front end for the

827
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:31,060
plasma desktop yeah yeah of course right I'm always looking West for the best

828
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,740
video player this is gonna replace dragon player for me and it's gotta look

829
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:38,220
native so that when you full screen that you can easily forget about all those

830
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:44,100
mismatched window orders of course he's savage yeah it is a cute QML video

831
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:50,820
player built on top of lib MPV and it's available as a package of course but I

832
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:54,260
have a link to the flat pack and I think it's great it reminds me a lot of dragon

833
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:59,820
player but it's it's current it's maintained and I think MPV is the best

834
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:04,700
video player for desktop Linux I love me MPV soloid or whatever it was was great

835
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:11,340
on GTK so this is great for plasma now we do have a second pick you want to

836
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,180
cover that one yeah this one's interesting we've talked a lot about

837
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:19,660
YouTube DL lately but maybe you're not interested in moving pictures you just

838
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:25,500
want regular pictures well enter gallery DL a command-line program to download

839
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,380
image galleries and collections from several well they say several but turns

840
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:34,620
out many image hosting sites I like this so it's like YouTube DL but for

841
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:37,900
galleries the chat room says I didn't mention the video player names because I

842
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:43,180
don't really know how it's pronounced Haruna Haruna yeah so Haruna is the video

843
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:47,460
player and then gallery DL is the command-line app that downloads image

844
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:51,500
galleries and collections it doesn't say exactly what right here in the in the

845
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:56,580
release notes but they do have a page on their github and it's just about every

846
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:01,260
damn picture site I've ever seen I could see this being really handy for like

847
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:05,580
backgrounds getting wallpapers yes or you know maybe some some you don't want

848
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:08,340
to be on a platform anymore you just want to back up a bunch of your old work

849
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,300
something like that because you know they've got got things for Instagram

850
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:15,260
they've cut they've got things for all these popular sites like flickr or

851
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:21,180
various places you might post art on here a lot of other sites as well but

852
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:26,420
hey that's the sign of a good tool that's right that's right if you'd like

853
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,220
to give us a suggestion for an app that we should try out maybe talk about in

854
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:33,580
the show contact page is a great place for that too you can just let us know

870
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:30,180
all right let's name this thing JB titles calm gonna come up with a real

871
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:33,260
good name right that's the secret to podcast success it's got to be it I

872
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:38,220
think with the new laptop I'm gonna kind of refresh the home setup I'm gonna try

873
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:43,220
getting monitor mounts and a laptop mount that goes on the monitor mount so

874
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:47,460
I can have screens and my laptop mounted and yeah I'm really gonna I'm gonna put

875
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:50,940
some effort into kind of like a 2021 setup so I want to try to get it all

876
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,100
kind of going and then I think I'm gonna talk about it here on the show talk

877
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:57,540
about what I did and what didn't work for me I think it's gonna be I think

878
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:00,660
it's gonna be a solid kind of at least start for the year I don't know if I'll

879
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:03,980
stick with the whole setup but I'm kind of I'm kind of aiming for that sounds

880
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:07,620
like we'll need to play some bets for how long it lasts oh I don't know if I

881
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:10,860
don't take any of that action with
