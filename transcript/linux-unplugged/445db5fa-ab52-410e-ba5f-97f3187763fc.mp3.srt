00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Meet SPUD, the spontaneous pop-up display.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Do you remember the first time you streamed a video on your smartphone?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
At that moment, you were no longer tied to your living room for your entertainment

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
or to your office for work. You could access your content anywhere.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But there's one small problem, your small mobile device screen.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Almost all of us prefer large displays for entertainment and for work.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
When those work deadlines are approaching, a large desktop monitor

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
or a dual screen setup will significantly boost your productivity.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So what if there was a way to have the mobility of a phone, tablet,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
or laptop without losing the benefit of a large screen?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Sounds impossible, but that's exactly what we did.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Introducing SPUD, the spontaneous pop-up display.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
SPUD is a high-resolution, 24-inch display that crosses

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
down to the size of a book and weighs less than two pounds.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah, so it kind of rolls up like an arm pressure testing kit almost.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And then it pops up into a projector. It's kind of neat.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And it hooks up over a different USB-C or whatever kind of adapter you've got.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now, it's called SPUD, which is a completely new type of product, they say.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's the world's largest and most portable display

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
because it's essentially using projection inside that little housing.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You see right there, it just hooked up USB-C to send the signals. Overall, it's 24 inches.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You can use HDMI as well. That is a good question.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The resolution is... I'm not sure. Actually,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't see it on here. I'm sure it's on here, I just didn't look at it. But, yeah, isn't that

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
funny? Hmm, let's find the resolution, Wes. I like that.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Look at that. That's pretty cool. That is actually pretty cool. I wonder how bright it is, too.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That would be the other question I have. You know, I played with that once when I was

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
younger. Back when I saw the CRT TV, I had like a flat lens hooked up on the front to try to project it.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, yeah. It did not work very well. So, I mean, this seems like something you'd have to kind of...

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You know, I'd want to see the quality of the display to really know like how many uses you could

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
do, but it's a really cool idea. I love that. Okay, so USB,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
HDMI, brightness dial, and the spud on button.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Everybody gets their spud on. All right, here we go. Here's the nitty-ditties.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Here we go. Here we go. You ready for the itty-bitties? 720p.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
720p is your... So it's 720p. The battery runs for

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
4 hours at 785 nits, which is pretty good

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
really for... Or you can get 10 hours at 350 nits, and it's less than 2 pounds.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's pretty cool. 16 by 9 aspect ratio

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
runs off of 12-volt DC power, or you can hook it up to a USB

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
plug and run it off of that. It's got built-in speakers, too.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's kind of neat, and it's got this case.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I mean, you know, as far as something for, you know,

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
not in a crazy amount of price that you could throw in your backpack. If you travel a lot.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Picture it, Wes, with CONVERGENCE! Oh!

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 170

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
for November 8th, 2016.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
weekly Linux talk show that's trying not to think about the election doomsday.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes. Hello, Chris. We're going to have a nice, tight

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
show today, because it is actually election day, and everybody's like, actually in the chat room

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
today, they're like, just don't do Unplugged, and just do like an unfiltered Unplugged combo

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
show and talk about the election. I'm like, that's not Linux-related. You don't understand how this works.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We need our daily dose, weekly dose of Linux. Yeah, man. Yeah, man. We need our Unplugged dose.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So we do have a good show coming up. We've got a birthday to celebrate, but we've also got some great hardware

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
to talk about. And then later on in the show,

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
we're going to be helpful. Even if you're a pro user, we've got a couple of helpful updates for you this week, but

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
if you're getting into Linux, or you're going to help somebody get into Linux, we've got some great

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
newbie stuff coming up, some great tips, including embracing the command line.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I said it. I said it. Don't be scared. Don't run away.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We're going to embrace the command line. Also, if you're using FileZilla, knock it off.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Stop it. We've got something you should know about, and a replacement product.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
A project? Not a product. Something like that. It's been forked. It's been forked.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Somebody got hacked, and it motivated them to fork FileZilla.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah. We'll tell you about that. But, Wes,

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
before we get into any of the stuff, the updates, the segments we've got coming up, you know what we've

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
got to do? Oh, there's something very important. We've got to bring in that virtual lug.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Time appropriate greetings, Mombroon. Greetings, brother. Hello.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hello. Hello.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hey, hello. Hello. Man, I thought you guys should all...

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Aren't you all supposed to be out voting right now? These must be people from outside the states, I guess.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I can't believe there's a particular thing there.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Listen to all these excuses. All these excuses.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm in. I am voting. Give me like five hours. I've got a plan.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hello, everybody. I've already voted. Good for you. Good for you. All right. Well,

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
let's celebrate a very important birthday

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
that almost just passed us right by. I know, right? But we did manage to catch it, and

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
it's something that we all can relate to.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's at a milestone, the 25th birthday, where

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Vim's car insurance finally goes down in price. Happy, happy birthday

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
to Vim. This is a rowdy crowd.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Come on, guys. You're in my house.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's right. Over 25 years ago,

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
over 25 years ago, it was started. You see, the problem was

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
that Bram, he wanted something like Vim for his Amiga. He was a big

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
user of VI. I'm sorry, I should say VI. He wanted something like VI, but they didn't

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
have anything like that on the Amiga. So in 1991, on November 2nd, he released

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
the first version of VI, Imitation Edition.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
After three years of working on it, the VI Imitation Edition.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Two years later, with the version

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
2.0, so the first version took three years, second version took two years,

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
two years later, with version 2.0 of Vim, the feature set

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
had exceeded that of the original VI. Or VI.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And so they changed the acronym

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
from Vim Imitation to Vim Improved.

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Isn't that great? That is really cool. That is really cool.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That is a big milestone. 25th birthday?

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I mean, think about where it's gone and how widely it's deployed today.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Thank God we have Nano. I mean, what? No, come on.

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
They still don't know how semantic versioning works.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I used Nano once in a video recently, and I've been getting crap about it for two weeks.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Chris, you use Nano?

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What are you doing?

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I thought you would use VI or Emacs. Why are you using Nano?

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think it's nice. What are you doing, man?

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Nano-W. Nano-TACW.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Forever. I don't even know what TACW does. Enlighten us.

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh man, it just supports

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
wide characters without cutting it off.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But you know, I actually, if I'm editing the file,

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't know what this is. If I'm editing the file,

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I tend to use Vim, because I got my colors and all that kind of stuff.

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But if I'm viewing a file, and I don't want to use CAT, or more,

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
or whatever, if I don't want to just look at the file, I just want to just

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
for some reason open it up, but not edit it.

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
When I'm going to look at a file, and I'm going to dig around, but I'm not going to use Pseudo,

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I use Nano for some reason. And then when I'm going to edit the file with root privileges,

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I Pseudo, VI, then the file.

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Isn't that weird? That is weird. But I mean, I can see, if it's just something you've learned in your fingers now,

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and you just type it, right? It's like, the one is my viewing editor, and one is my

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
editing editor. I know, it's so stupid.

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's so dumb, because I do every now and then when I'm already in there, and now I'm like, well, I'll just change that real quick.

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And then it's like, I go to save, and it's like, you don't have the privilege

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
of using Pseudo-T to get out of it, right? Yep.

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's so stupid. But it's habit. It's habit from a decade ago,

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
when I was revolting, and I wanted to find a new text editor, and I had

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
this boss who was

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
the only other Unix slash Linux guy in the office with me, and we would prank each other

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
constantly. And so I remember, like, I had replaced Vim, like,

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
when he would use VI, it would echo, like, Bruce Stinks, or something like that

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
on there. Bruce is a monkey. And we did things, like we'd set up cron jobs to

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
send system-wide messages on the hour, so every user logged into the system would see

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Bruce smells like a monkey, and things like that. Like, we'd mess around with each other, and I remembered

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Nano was sort of the prank we would use, like, we'd set up an alias

134
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
so things would launch in Nano or whatever. Like, there was all these, so I think that's where it

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
started, and then it just sort of became, because I got pranked, I think I just

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
stuck with it. He's just like, well, I'm not going to let this, screw this, I'm not going to let this defeat me.

137
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I will use this editor. Yeah, exactly. It is a fun editor. And then now here

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I am, years later, and I'm getting crap from the internet, and it's like, okay, you guys don't understand.

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's how a lot of stories end. Then I put it up on Facebook

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and got fired. Alright, well, let's talk a little hardware.

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm always out there looking for, like, the next perfect set-top box.

142
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I truly believe something that's like the NVIDIA Shield, but fully

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
ran Linux, GNU slash Linux. Not Android, not NVIDIA's fork

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
of Android Linux. Yeah. You know, if NVIDIA's forking Android,

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
they're not forking it too hard, because they're managing to deliver the monthly

146
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Android updates still. Yeah, I don't mean a hard fork. I mean, I don't know if they are or not, but it does

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
seem like it has its own launcher and stuff. So, I've been watching

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
this space, kind of with some curiosity, and the beard

149
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
found this article, because he knew it was right up my alley. Zotac is cramming an AMD Radeon

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
RX 480 into a PC that is the size

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
of, well, it's smaller than a NUC. Wow.

152
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Hey, that looks pretty slick. Yeah, it's a Magnus ERX 480, and it comes

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
with the AMD Radeon RX 480 Polaris based GPU.

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And this is pretty nice, because they're going to have three versions. Bare Bones, which is

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Bare Bones, plus, which is the version you get if you're

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
buying it for Linux, and then they sell a Windows 10 edition, which is the version

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
that you buy if you accept defeat in your life and are a masochist,

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and you like to label yourself as pushing the easy button, you buy that.

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Or you really need Cortana just everywhere in your life?

160
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That seems like it. Yeah, yeah. The Bare Bones version is what you'd expect.

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Just a little kit with a 2.2 gigahertz Skylake CPU. Somehow

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Kaby Lake didn't make it in there. They must have been working with Apple. But the one you probably care about,

163
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
the Plus version, you can get it pretty tricked out.

164
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
In fact, you can get up to 32 gigs of RAM in the sucker if you want to.

165
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But it comes stock with 8 gigs of RAM, a 1 terabyte, 2.5 inch

166
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
hard drive, and 120 gigabyte

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
M.2 SSD. So that's not bad, really.

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And it's smaller than a NUC, which

169
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
really is impressive, which could make this a really nice little Steam

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
OS slash Kodi box, possibly. You're not doing anything weird with a NUC with

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
trying to rig in an external GPU? It's there. Exactly.

172
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah, the external, come on. I mean, geez, come on.

173
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's kind of got a lot of ports on the back, too, like a lot of IO. Check this thing out.

174
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll zoom in a little bit if you're watching the video version here. We got ourselves two display

175
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
ports, two HDMI, two Ethernet. Two?

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah. It's got a Wi-Fi.

177
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, this port right here is for an external Wi-Fi antenna.

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And then over here, this is an external power supply port. And it looks like we've got four

179
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
USB ports, and two of them are USB 3. This is some serious...

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That's awesome. Yeah, and the front's got some IO on it, too. So, dual Ethernet,

181
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
dual HDMI. That's great on this form factor. Of course, dual display port.

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I mean, if you've got a Polaris GPU in there, you can

183
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
afford to run monitors, and these ports are small enough.

184
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's pretty neat. So, if you're looking at tiny PCs, that Zotac one might be pretty cool.

185
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And we'll have a link to the PC World article where they talk about it. And it was called...

186
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, yeah, the Magnus. The Magnus.

187
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Speaking of cool hardware, Ben is joining us in the Mumble Room. He just got himself

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
a new System76. Did you get the Lemur, Ben? Or what did you get?

189
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I got the Lemur. The Lemur. I'm not familiar with that one.

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The Lemur. Yeah. So, tell me, what did you get? What was your spec? Did you get the base unit?

191
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Did you modify it all? How long have you had it? I put some upgrades in it.

192
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Come on, you've got to get the deets. Tell us the deets. Alright, alright. Here's the order page.

193
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Let me tell you what I paid for. I paid

194
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
$1,334 for it. And I got second day air shipping.

195
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Ooh. Yes.

196
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I got 1604.1 on it with a

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
114 mod display IPS LED backlight. Yeah, the matte display.

198
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So instead of the shiny display, right? Right. And HD graphics

199
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
620. Ooh. And I also got the 2.7

200
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
up to 3.5 processor i7 when all 9 yards.

201
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Ooh. Yes. Are you worried all about heat when you go up to the i7?

202
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What do you think? It's only two cores and four threads, so it's nothing major.

203
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yeah. I also got 16 gigs of RAM,

204
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
2400 megahertz DDR4, and a

205
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
250 gig M.2 SSD. Nice.

206
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Good call. And I also got a secondary 500 gig drive,

207
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
as well as the upgraded Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
yeah. It's nice to be able to get a laptop that small and still have an Ethernet

209
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
port on it. Yeah, definitely. No joke, because in honesty, I

210
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
sold my Macbook for this thing, because I just was getting so fed up with this stupid

211
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
thing. It was like, I can't run Linux on this darn thing.

212
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's how we started chatting about this, really. Right. And truthfully,

213
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I just got so fed up with the thing I sold it on eBay and bought

214
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
this System76, because I just wanted to be able to run my Linux just fine, and

215
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I finally just said, screw it. And you know, so... How's the keyboard

216
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
been, and the screen quality and all that? It's been fine.

217
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's, you know, been very wonderful. It's better to type on than any of my other laptops

218
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I own, and I'm very pleased. And the screen? How's the screen?

219
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The screen looks good? Great. Not having any problems.

220
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
These guys are all making me want to get a new rig so bad.

221
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I've got the Apollo, which is really great, but it's only two core. And I want a four

222
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
core system for video editing. Your mobile editing rig. Yeah. So like

223
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
my Apollo has become my go-to at-home computer.

224
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And that's wonderful. But when I want to edit video, I'm like, I'm kind of still going towards the MacBook

225
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Pro, just because it's got four cores. And a dedicated...

226
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And a dedicated GPU. And I'm loving this thing so much, Chris.

227
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I might actually throw Arch on it as well. I think you should.

228
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Just because I'm that daring. I think it would probably run fine,

229
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
really. Oh, sure. Yeah. Especially with those total of six

230
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
cores. I'm going to have so much fun doing that. And I might actually

231
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
stream the install. You know, one thing Mike was saying on Coder Radio is he's not a big

232
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
fan of the trackpad. What are your thoughts on the trackpad? Because you were using a MacBook Pro before, and

233
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
they tend to have pretty good trackpads. Well, I actually think

234
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
it's better than the MacBook trackpad. Really? How so?

235
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Well, I'm going to be honest. I liked the Mac

236
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
trackpad, but it's just that tap to click was horrible.

237
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And I'm actually finding that... Having physical buttons

238
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
is nice. And actually, the

239
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
HP I'm talking to you guys on right now has buttons on it, as does my System76.

240
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So I'm finding that a heck of a lot easier. And I've actually,

241
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
when I'm playing like SWTOR or something, I'm having a

242
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
heck of a lot better time gaming. And made of Linux Steam

243
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
games, which I do do, I've had a lot better time like

244
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
playing Kotor 2 on Linux, which has natively ported

245
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
very much better. Hmm. Well, keep us updated,

246
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Ben, on how it goes. Because I think a lot of people are looking right now.

247
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
No problem. I've been following this topic with a lot more interest

248
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
recently. Yeah, the more first person feedback we can get, the better. But also, I will

249
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
send you a picture of my soon-to-be setup as

250
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
well. Nice. I love setup pictures.

251
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
We've got to move to something a little disappointing, because it makes me

252
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
remember the time where I had such a badass PVR setup.

253
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And I would have been crushed if I would have seen this news back then. But the official

254
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Mythbuntu distro is going away.

255
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The developers of Mythbuntu Linux Distribution have announced that the development of the official

256
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Ubuntu flavor will come to an end in the coming future. They stated that it's just because of a lack of

257
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
manpower to work on updates and bug fixing. Of course, you can still just install

258
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Ubuntu or Ubuntu and install Myth. But this is

259
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
sort of, I think, more indicative of a bigger trend happening,

260
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
where this is probably PVRs on Linux

261
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
probably just going to get rolled into something like Kodi. And I've got to imagine

262
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
there's a couple of projects... AmbientPlex are both also able to do this stuff now.

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
How do you think things like MythTV might be a little bit of

264
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
an older style and model? And especially it was great, like, early

265
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
2000s when you had all the cable channels, you wanted digital access to them.

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Things like Netflix, etc., weren't necessarily big or streaming yet, so it made a lot

267
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
of sense. And maybe it still has a place, but it's not nearly as popular.

268
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But man, I had such a cool setup for a little while.

269
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Had to remove all the commercials and save them off to a special folder.

270
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And I could access it on all my TVs.

271
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Compared to something where you're using the proprietary thing, or you've got a VCR and

272
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
you're programming the time in, looking up the... No.

273
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's so not how I want to do it.

274
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So if you're a MythBuntu user, don't fret. MythTV isn't going away.

275
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Just that particular distribution. But I

276
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
back then was relying on these put together distros because I just didn't want to invest

277
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
the time in figuring out everything. I actually eventually even

278
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
built them on top of Gentoo boxes, so I did eventually just roll my own. But

279
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
getting started, it was really nice to have a distro. I can't remember which one it was called,

280
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
to be honest with you, but it was Fedora-based at the time.

281
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You know, I think I'd like to hear Chris last, the Gentoo

282
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
years on UserAir or something. That would be good.

283
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You know, people think

284
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
we're crazy for running Arch in the places we roll Arch.

285
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I ran Gentoo Linux in the most mission-critical of

286
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
financial institutions where the ability to process and prove

287
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
transactions was running on these boxes, and I put them on Gentoo, so that would be a good story.

288
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Because it was, looking back on it, as much of a fan of rolling

289
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Linux as I am right now, never would have done that.

290
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Never. But something, I guess, I don't know if I was stupid at the time.

291
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Part of it was I was excited, and there was only so many

292
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
ways to get this version of CUPS with these drivers and this version of Samba.

293
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That was sort of it.

294
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Maybe if you'd like to hear that story, come see me in California. I'll be in the Oakland, San Francisco,

295
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Berkeley area this weekend, Sunday, November 13th.

296
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We're going to do a meetup where I'd normally be doing Linux action shows since we pre-recorded last weekend.

297
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm going to do a meetup in California, so if you're in the area, go to

298
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, or just find the link in the show notes,

299
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
and let me know if you're going. Right now the plan is to go to the

300
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Handong Restaurant, which is famous for their dumplings and all their

301
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
other delicious food, and we'll just hang out and chat.

302
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Watch Chris eat dumplings, you know, buy him a beer. Or maybe I'll buy you a beer, depending.

303
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You never know. You just never know. Meetup.com slash

304
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Jupiter Broadcasting. That sounds like a ton of fun.

305
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It might be. It might be. Yeah, and then we're going to stay down in the California area

306
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
through Monday, but that'll probably just mostly be doing the tourist thing

307
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
recording some video. Little vacay. Picking up what we call in the industry some b-roll

308
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
for the footage, you know, so that way when we come back and put it all together

309
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I've got shots of California. The California experience. Location establishing

310
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
shots with air quotes. That proves that you didn't just make it all up. Yeah.

311
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Didn't just go to video blocks and buy it off of b-roll. Yeah. Meetup.com slash Jupiter

312
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Broadcasting. If you'd like to hang out while I'm on my way down to California,

313
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
and I'm sitting there working in Lady Joob's, I'll be connected to a ting

314
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and my fi. That's right. That's right. Go to linux.ting.com to sign up

315
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and support the show and get $25 off your first ting device or

316
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
$25 in service credit. If you have a GSM or CDMA device, check their

317
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
BYOD page because they support both types of networks.

318
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And now newer phones, they just have like the universal GSM chips and they work everywhere.

319
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's amazing. So nice. It's the way it should have been all along. And that's ting.

320
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Ting is the way wireless should have always been because you just pay for what you use. No contract, no

321
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
registration fee, no locked phones, no like ting experience layer

322
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
where they get in the way of you and updates and they hold back update. None of

323
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
that. None of it. Let's just stop. It's almost 2017.

324
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Let's stop and you can do your part. Go to linux.ting.com and just

325
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
take the ting litmus test. Click that what would you save button. When you're

326
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
listening to this, we have a new president of the United States. And God knows, now that that person's

327
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
in office, you're going to need to save money. Works either way.

328
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
How timely, Chris. How timely.

329
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Go there and check them out. They've got great customer service. They have a bunch of good devices

330
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
from the budget category and probably honestly ones you haven't even considered

331
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
because Ting's thinking outside the box with some of these things. Everything from feature phones like the

332
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Moto G4 Play is also a great smartphone with a decent feature set

333
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
for a great price. Mifis, blue devices, Nexus devices,

334
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
internet phones, and they've got a great blog to top it all off. Did you see

335
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
this, Wes? They did a how-to on how to install a freaking USB power outlet

336
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
in your home. So you take like the power plug. Really? Yeah, no more adapters and dongles.

337
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
No, no. Just go right from the wall to your device. That's great. That's kind of a neat tip. They've got

338
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
a bunch of great tips over there. That's just an example. They're such nerds. I love it.

339
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Linux.ting.com. Go there because Linux.

340
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And you know, in case like you've got a significant other that sits down

341
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
at your computer and you're a little worried about what might come up in your URL history,

342
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
good to have Linux in there because it just looks like you're geeking out all the time. So it's also

343
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
just good for you. It's good for us. It's good for Ting. Let's just everybody do

344
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
each other a favor. Right now, you're watching live. You're sitting at home listening.

345
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You're in your car doing 70 miles per hour down the freeway. I want you to grab your

346
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
iPhone. No, don't do it then. But I want you to grab your phone. Every other time.

347
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Linux.ting.com. Go there. Check them out. Grab a device or bring a device.

348
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Save some money and only pay for what you use. And a big thank you to Ting for

349
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
sponsoring the unplugged program. Linux.ting.com.

350
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Well, we've got a little breaking news right now as we record the show, Wes.

351
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Breaking news. Yeah, we got ourselves a brand new edition of Cinnamon

352
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
that just hit, well, stable. But it's not actually available to install. Version 3.2

353
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
has been released by Clem. And it's got some fanciness in it.

354
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It comes with a workspace switcher that's been nice and updated and improved. Simplified background

355
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
manager, keyboard navigation for context menus, which is

356
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
dope. That's nice. Yeah. Updated app indicators and settings, support for display

357
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
and percentage next to the volume slider.

358
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Also, I think there's a couple other nice ones in here like the placement of the system tray notifications was fixed

359
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and is no longer dependent on GComp, which could be good depending on your view. And last

360
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
but not least, I think probably this is the most

361
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
expose Mac-like feature, but also kind of useful. They call it Peek

362
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
at the desktop. Oh, that's cute. Yeah. And it's, as you can kind of guess by the name,

363
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
it's a desktop applet that lets you quickly take a peek

364
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
at your active desktop and throws everything out of the way. Also support for the latest

365
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
GTK 3, I believe, is in there. Cinnamon 3.2

366
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
probably going to be hitting a point update in Mint soon,

367
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Arch repos, and other places where you get your Cinnamon. That's not a bad

368
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
update from the Cinnamon team. No, no, no. I'm not using it a lot these days, but I still

369
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
have a great respect for Cinnamon just as a very usable, you know, it's not necessarily

370
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
the best or the prettiest or the newest looking, but I feel like it's still pretty cool.

371
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You're right, though. It's traditional. Right? If you're not going to go full like

372
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
tiling window manager, I find it a good power user desktop.

373
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Still think GNOME 3 edges out a bit for me, but I agree. It's in there.

374
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So I asked Wes, I said, Wes, what's one of your favorite stories this week? And

375
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
you found this freeing my tablet, aka Android hacking, both the

376
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
software and the hardware. This guy writes, two years ago, I left my country.

377
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It's a sad story, but this is just to say

378
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I had some time, and I was working remotely for an Irish startup, and

379
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
he wanted to get Debian on his tablet.

380
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That is an ambitious goal. There was no real open source process

381
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
for rooting the device, getting Debian on there, so he starts

382
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
up with an ASUS Memo Pad 10, specifically the ME 103k edition,

383
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
which came out in like August, I think, of 2015. It's got

384
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
a 10-inch screen, a gigabyte of RAM, quad core Qualicom Snapdragon, and

385
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
16 gigs of storage. Jeez, it sounds like it's about like a MacBook Pro.

386
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
But this is where it really kind of gets interesting, though, because he had to

387
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
do this whole deep dive into Android and figure out how the Android boot process works and

388
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
all of the secrets. What was it that grabbed your attention? Yeah, to me, it kind of just reads as

389
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
almost like a Rosetta Stone for, you know, like,

390
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
traditional GNU slash Linux desktop users, because we're used to our user land, and Android has the

391
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
kernel, but it's such a different system from everywhere up, and so he really kind of

392
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
talks a lot about how Android is structured so that you can replace it

393
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
with Linux. Yeah, that is a really cool

394
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
journey that he documents here. Just the time it must have taken

395
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
to stop at every stage and document this and capture it and then save

396
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
it for his blog later. That's a lot of work! And he's

397
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
looking at waveforms. It's really a deep dive, and it's a lot of fun.

398
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Sometimes I picture, like, the guys at Canonical that were trying to figure out how to

399
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
get Ubuntu Android Edition working for the first time doing stuff like this.

400
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Yeah, digging around in there. That's interesting.

401
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's probably the most important, or probably the most impressive part about it is the documentation aspect.

402
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah, because it's so well, like, the code aspect is clearly

403
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
indicated on here, like, he's using some nice formatting.

404
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
SE Linux. Oh, and he talks about having to work around SE Linux. So hopefully this will be more useful

405
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
as we see more Ubuntu on phones roll out,

406
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
as we see more stuff where, like, more Android stuff becomes in the mainline

407
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
kernel. Hopefully this will be more useful. I know, like, Nexus 5 is mostly supported in mainline

408
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
now, so maybe I can run Debian on here. Not that I would.

409
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So remember I was talking about FileZilla, and I like it. I've used

410
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
FileZilla for years. It's not gorgeous or anything, but it sure gets the job done.

411
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And according to this person,

412
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
FileZilla does not encrypt your saved FTP passwords,

413
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and because of it, he was hacked, and so he ended up

414
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
forking FileZilla and calls it FileZilla Secure.

415
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
FileZilla Secure is a free FTP client that has all the features of the original

416
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
FileZilla, plus it encrypts your FTP passwords to protect from hackers

417
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
stealing them. But they're local passwords, so it doesn't really matter.

418
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's the same argument with Pigeon back in the day. Yeah, I guess

419
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
somebody either got on his machine, oh, malware got into my system through a browser

420
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
exploit, and within seconds, someone suddenly had access to all of my websites.

421
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So do you know, does it then prompt you to enter an unlock key?

422
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It looks like it from the screenshots, yeah. There's a master password to decrypt your

423
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
FTP logins. I haven't installed it, but looking at his screenshots,

424
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
that's what it looks like. He said it took him a week trying to clean up the mess after somebody

425
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
got his password file for FileZilla. I feel like at this point, would it be better spent

426
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
just making a plugin for key pass or other type database?

427
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I don't think it's even a good idea because it's a local

428
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
issue. If you have a local infection, there's more than

429
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
that is the problem. And they do actually

430
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
do base 64 encoding, so it's not like you can just read a plain text password.

431
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But it's not encrypted, but that's kind of the purpose. They want you to

432
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
know that it's not totally encrypted because that's

433
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
a security theater at that point.

434
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I think it's still a good idea to do it. I feel like you should have security at all layers

435
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
like an onion. The only thing that bothers me about this

436
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
particular one is that the commits are associated to example.com

437
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
email. That's a little weird.

438
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So also he says increase the maximum number of

439
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
transfer feeds from 10 to 1,000. He says

440
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
10,000 is not really recommended, but 20, 50, and even 100 threads

441
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
has shown to work and increase transfer speeds by 5x.

442
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Well, it's interesting to see new development anyway. Yeah, and I guess it's something to be aware of.

443
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Because I didn't actually think about it. I didn't really think about the fact that

444
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I might have really important server logins just sitting on my hard drive unencrypted because otherwise

445
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I don't put passwords and text files on my hard drive. Even if they're base 64

446
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
encoded, I'm not comfortable with that. The other thing that people should just stop using FTP. Use

447
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
keys, use SFTP. Is that what you were going to say?

448
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I would say FTPT, but I also wanted to point out that

449
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
even though FileZilla is kind of ugly by default, there's a new theme

450
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
on Compact called FlatZilla that actually makes it look pretty good.

451
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Okay, good to know. Nice tip. Telling people to stop using FTP is like

452
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I don't know. You should know, but some people don't. You can use FTP, just do it over SSH.

453
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
There you go. You know what it is like all those hosts out there

454
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
that host cheap websites and stuff. That's why you've got to go with a great host like DigitalOcean.

455
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Go to DigitalOcean.com and use our special promo code of

456
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
power, DO, one word lowercase, and don't host it on some fly by

457
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
night site that requires you to FTP up your files like an animal. Host it over

458
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
at DigitalOcean.com. In fact, DigitalOcean has outrageously great

459
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
pricing. $5 a month will give you a great rig with an SSD

460
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
hard drive that will easily run a personal website like nobody's business.

461
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And with a $10 credit, you can run it two months for free. But look at this. Look at this pricing.

462
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
If you're watching the video version right now, I want you to lick your screen. I want you to stand up and lick your screen.

463
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Three cents an hour for two gigabytes of memory, a two core processor, a 40

464
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
gigabyte SSD, and three terabytes of boss level transfer. Why is it boss

465
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
level? Well, that's a great question because you're reading from them SSDs over a 40 to a 40

466
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
gigabyte e-connection. And they've got data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore,

467
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Amsterdam, London, Toronto, and Germany. You could spin up a droplet in each one of those.

468
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Now you're boss level. You just went boss level.

469
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED. I'll tell you what else is boss level.

470
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Their interface. Holy shmoly

471
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
that interface. It is so well designed, so

472
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
well laid out, but yet doesn't feel watered down.

473
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And then they have an API that's intuitive and command line utilities that allow you to run

474
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
large scale production workloads or just something in your quake terminal. Drop it down

475
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and issue a command. You want to do a snapshot before you do a big transaction, a big upgrade,

476
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
a big change? And you do. And you do. You also have great apps you can

477
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
use on your phone. They have highly available storage. I said highly available

478
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
storage. It's highly available. And you can run up to 16 terabytes, attach

479
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
it to your droplet. Here's what I would do.

480
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I'd start out with that three cents an hour rig. And then I'd put MB on there.

481
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And then I'd get a whole bunch of block storage and

482
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
formatted all ButterFS. All ButterFS

483
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
all the time in RAID 5 mode. No, I'm just kidding.

484
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm just poking fun. What are you telling me, people? I'm just poking fun. No, they got ZFS.

485
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So I would use that. Why not? Go use a real file system. And they got FreeBSD if you want

486
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
to go that route. They got Ubuntu. They got score OS. You know, MB is right in FreeBSD's

487
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
package manager. Really? I wouldn't know that. I wouldn't.

488
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And I would not. I would. BSD would not be my first choice for a

489
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
an MB server. But you could do it. You could do it for some reason.

490
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You could do it. You could also run Fedora up there on DigitalOcean. You could

491
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
run good old classic Debian. Nice lean and mean Debian.

492
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You could do it. You could do it. Why not?

493
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And you should. Hey Wes, do it. Do it right now. Just do it. Just go to DigitalOcean.

494
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
DigitalOcean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

495
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You apply to your account and you get a $10 credit and you support the show. Big thanks

496
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program. All right, we've got to help our friend

497
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
out. We had an audience member write into the Jupyter broadcasting subreddit. Yeah,

498
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
there is one. Who knew?

499
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
He says, please explain NFS to me before I destroy something.

500
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And I think he probably had an effing in there, but he probably cut it out. And this is from

501
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Bugabinga. And he says, are you planning or have you already made any guides or segments

502
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
to setting up NFS at home? I realize NFS spans a wide range of

503
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
use cases, but I'm interested from the perspective of a desktop Linux user. How to share

504
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
media and documents with my family on our LAN. Here's my environment, which I'm

505
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
curious if it's common amongst the Jupyter broadcasting audience. I have a small family household

506
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
with three to six persons, several desktops, laptops, and phones running

507
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Android and Linux. All wireless LAN. All

508
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
5 gigahertz. He says, there are some problems I ran into when setting up NFS.

509
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Old documentation with things confused, NFS 3 and 4.

510
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
He's not even sure if NFS is supposed to work well over Wi-Fi. Endless combination

511
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
of mount options. Confusing security model. Local UIDs and GUIDs

512
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
versus remote UIDs and GUIDs made by

513
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
old documentation. Hanging mounts on boot or logout. Cannot use

514
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
ethernet cables because we don't have, we can't use ethernet because we don't own

515
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
the flat we are living in, so they're doing Wi-Fi everywhere. He says, I'm so fed up with NFS

516
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
that I set up a somershare just for fun, and unfortunately

517
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
it works. Like, that's an unfortunate

518
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
thing. So I thought maybe we would discuss that, but

519
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
first of all, we should just say up front, if Samba works for you, there's no shame in using Samba. Not at all.

520
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Samba, they've spent significant time making Samba work great from Linux to

521
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Linux. It's first class. These days, there's graphical

522
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
utilities to set it up. It sounds like he's already got it working, so.

523
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So Wes, do you have any immediate thoughts about using NFS on a wireless LAN?

524
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I mean, I guess you will just have to make sure, like, it depends on

525
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
the distributions that you're using, but you need your storage daemons

526
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
basically, you need the dependency on the mounts with the storage daemons and on

527
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
the network. So that if the network goes down, you can have those

528
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
connections or that you won't take the network down before unmounting your NFS share.

529
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
How you do that probably depends, and wireless is obviously, because now you need

530
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
a wireless daemon, you need WPA supplicant, that kind of thing, it's less ideal

531
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
than like a simple DHCP.

532
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
If Samba's working, I really would probably just stick with Samba. I mean, unless you have like a

533
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
maybe NFS for some reason is better in your environment, or you prefer working with it, or you have

534
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
more experience, but if not, I mean, Samba gets you a lot of things.

535
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
If anybody in the mumble room has any suggestions, feel free to tag me with mum in the chat room.

536
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I want to cover just a couple of things to help him out here a little bit. Quit worrying about NFS3

537
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
versus NFS4, really. Don't worry about that. You don't need to.

538
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You don't need to worry about any of the maintenance issues or domain type things.

539
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And I'm going to try to find NFS Arch.

540
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I'm going to put a link to the Arch Wiki's NFS entry here.

541
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I have it right here. Oh, good man. When you drop that in the doc, right by his question there,

542
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
because this is where he's getting hung up on a lot, is he says confusing

543
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
mount options, endless combinations of mount options.

544
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Well, here's the reality. You can actually leverage

545
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
SystemD to make this better for you. SystemD can mount and unmount

546
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
automatically your NFS share or mount point when it detects

547
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
your network goes down and up. So, respectively, when the network goes down,

548
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
it will unmount it, and when the network goes up, it will remount it.

549
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And this is really nice. So you're using SystemD to manage the mount point,

550
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
which is aware of your network state. So that's a really great feature.

551
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So consider looking into that, and that will be in the Arch Wiki on how you set that up.

552
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's really simple. Some of those mount options can also help your NFS

553
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
share and mount tolerate

554
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
fluctuations in network connectivity. I like to think

555
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
of NFS as close to a physical connection

556
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
to storage as possible over a network connection before we had iSCSI and stuff.

557
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It is designed in an era where the network is persistent, and it

558
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
expects it to be there, and the system that connects to it expects it to be part of the file

559
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
system. So this is the problem you're running into. Samba is more forgiving with connections

560
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
and disconnections because it was designed in an era where that's more frequent.

561
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And then the other thing, when you said you're confused

562
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
about the security model, where there's local UIDs and group IDs,

563
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and there's remote user IDs and group IDs.

564
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
This is something that is much simpler if you

565
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
have a little bit of forethought before you set up your local

566
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
box in your NFS server. I always try to make sure

567
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
that the user account I log into my Linux desktop has the same UID

568
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
as the user account I'm connecting to or with on my NFS

569
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
server. You same for you? Yeah, and I think this is where you see NFS pairs well with things where you already

570
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
have some sort of LDAP or you have some sort of directory management system set up so that you

571
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
do have the same users across multiple boxes. Yeah, otherwise what I try to do is I try to

572
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
make sure that my local user is user 1000 and my remote user

573
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
is user 1000. And that's generally, if I'm the first person to create an account

574
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
on my Linux desktop, that's generally I'll be user 1000. And so you

575
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
just have to take special note and make sure that the user account and credentials you're connecting

576
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
with are the same. Now you can specify the UID and

577
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
GID that you want to connect with in your mount options. So you can do some of that there.

578
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But it is just simpler if everything lines up because then the security permissions

579
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
just work. And when you do it that way, I find it to be the security model to be

580
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
simpler than Samba, personally. So that is...

581
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Alright, did we get anybody tagging me with suggestions from the... I thought this might be up the

582
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Mumble Rooms alley file sharing. What do you guys use on your home networks to share files

583
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
around the LAN? Big files, maybe you're primarily on

584
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
WiFi, you're not hooked up. What are you using to share files between Linux boxes?

585
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
All about that Samba. Yeah, really? Mostly because I do

586
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
have some Windows boxes and other things that I want to share with. And like other little

587
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
big appliances for TVs and stuff that only talk Samba. So it makes sense just to do everything

588
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
over Samba. So are you setting up a Samba server on each machine or how are you doing that?

589
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
No, I just have a centralized NAS effectively with Samba on it.

590
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Same here. So Pobie, you like

591
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
will from one laptop copy to a central share and then go to the other machine and copy it from that central share?

592
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So I've got a HP microserver which I used to have

593
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
12 disks in a butterFS array but I switched to ZFS recently.

594
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Or ZFS if you like to call it that. And I also have as another

595
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
backup Netgear NAS, Ready NAS thing

596
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
that I recently learned has butterFS in it.

597
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And they're both Samba and I can just browse

598
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
the network on anything. Whether it's my Android phone or

599
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Ubuntu phone or laptops or desktops or Windows or whatever.

600
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I know Samba is going to work everywhere and I don't have to make any effort

601
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
whatsoever to connect to it. It just works.

602
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Okay, so let's go Digitalize and then we'll go WW. So Digitalize, you're using

603
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
SSH? Yeah, I use SSHFS.

604
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You know, it's just simple. It's installed and your operating system is ready and

605
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
it's ready to go. Yeah, that's not a bad way to go really. It's just using SCP or

606
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
SSHFS or something like that because I like having SSH on all my machines anyways.

607
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
The server and the client obviously. Alright, so WW, you have a cabling

608
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
idea laid on me. Yeah, so I live in an

609
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
older house and I can't really use a powerline

610
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
adapter. But I would suggest if he doesn't, maybe use that.

611
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Or what we do is we actually run the cable

612
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
and then we use cable crimps which you can

613
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
lightly tap into the walls. So he could tape it

614
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
maybe on the bottom or run along the wall on the bottom with tape.

615
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Or check with your landlord and see if you can lightly tap into

616
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
those cable crimpers and they're really easy to patch up

617
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
when you move out. You know, you can just spackle. The powerline networking

618
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
could be interesting. I would want to test it first because I've had mixed results with it.

619
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Like here at the studio, I can't plug something in

620
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
upstairs and then plug the other end in by the TV and get networking from

621
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
that. It's because it's like cross circuit breakers or something. Alright, so I was

622
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
hoping Wimpy would represent someone using NFS because now I'm starting to feel like I'm a maniac

623
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
using NFS to share files. So Wimpy, what's your setup?

624
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I use NFS exports effectively for me. So

625
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
most of the stuff that's accessed from the NAS's in the house

626
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
is over some protocol specific to what it does.

627
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So there's DLNA used for the music and Plex used

628
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
for the photos and the videos. And that's what the

629
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
devices in the front room and all the rest of it

630
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
are hooked up to. For me to actually hurl photos

631
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and videos and music into the servers, I use NFS.

632
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And then I have a couple of Samba shares

633
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
which are just there so when family and friends visit

634
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
and they've got photos and things they want to share with us,

635
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
they can just connect them from whatever computer that they're

636
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
using and drop them in there and then I can deal with them after the fact.

637
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Are you doing a guest Samba account too for that? Yeah, yeah.

638
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's just four guests. They've got their own wireless network as well.

639
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Their own VLAN. Oh, really?

640
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So like a dedicated router in its own VLAN? No, no.

641
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's the same router so it's just a VLAN on the same router. Nice.

642
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And their own subnet and they can't peer at any of the management

643
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
interfaces or anything like that and the hosts on that VLAN can't contact

644
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
one another either. All they can do is get to the internet and get to that

645
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Samba share. I just set up a guest Wi-Fi network in Lady Jupiter

646
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
because I figure we're going to hang out. I'm meeting a couple of people

647
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
on the way down and once we get there people are going to be welcomed into the Lady Jupiter.

648
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And the thing you know about JB fans is they're technically savvy. First question is how do I get on

649
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
the Wi-Fi? And the thing is, well, now I've got a data server,

650
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
a file server on here and my password is honestly embarrassing

651
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
and so I don't really want to tell audience members that I just meet on the road.

652
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And it changes your threat model, right? It's like, well, it's Hedea and you and

653
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
the kids and a couple other trusted people then you can kind of be a little more liberal.

654
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Second, there's people you don't know or people you hardly know. That's different. And the router

655
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
supports it so it's just a matter of enabling that functionality and so I just took a little time

656
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
and I was like, I'm going to have some people visiting. Some people like they clean up

657
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and do like dishes and stuff before they have people over. I set up the guest Wi-Fi network.

658
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You should probably install something, you know, like ad blocking.

659
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Yeah, yeah. So, alright, any other thoughts from the Mumba Room

660
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
on file sharing over your homeland before we move on? And hopefully

661
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Bugabinga is, oh yeah, did you have some? Oh, I was just going to say, like when we said

662
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
DLNA is something that can get used if you're serving certain

663
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
types of things. I've also seen like WebDAV or even if you're

664
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
going one direction only, you can always just run an HTTP server. This is something

665
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
that Nextcloud does make kind of easy if you have a Nextcloud server on your LAN is you can do the WebDAV

666
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
thing or you could just be like, here's a URL to go to. This is something I do

667
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
for Angela with her Open Media Vault server. There's just a couple of things I installed

668
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
on there and I'm not setting up port forwarding on her router or anything like that.

669
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It's just, here, go to this URL. It's all local URL, but she can give it

670
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
to anybody that comes over and so when they're taking pictures and stuff, they can put it on there.

671
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
That'll be a nice thing and it's like, why not just set that up and make it easy

672
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
enough. Give them a spot to go to and then lock down the stuff that you're really concerned about.

673
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
That's a good way to go. Go ahead.

674
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Well, Chris, this is going to be interesting. I'm actually thinking about setting up

675
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Ubuntu or some kind of server with file sharing after the show.

676
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Oh yeah? What are you going to use?

677
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Probably Z or NFS, something like that. But what are you going to use to share the files? Probably

678
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Samba now.

679
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Yeah, that's probably what I'm looking at.

680
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I think a lot of Linux users, some of us when we move over to Linux,

681
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
we want to reject anything Microsoft and Samba

682
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
feels like a Microsoft thing. But I would look at Samba

683
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
as Samba actually represents a really kind of inspirational

684
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
decade long journey to not only

685
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
figure out what Microsoft is doing in a way that doesn't violate patents

686
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
and copyright and reverse engineer, but then

687
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
to build a superior product and then on top of that, they've built in

688
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
functionality to make it so when the Samba client, when you connect to a Samba server

689
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
and the Samba server realize they're talking to each other, they've built in hooks

690
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
to then communicate more efficiently and quicker and faster.

691
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
They are aware of the way the kernel works on each end of the system and it is

692
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
like a superior technology and that I think the Samba

693
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
project probably doesn't get enough credit for. Okay, Monkey Comm, you'll

694
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
wrap us up with a little Kaja slash SFTP

695
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
right in the file manager approach. Tell me about it.

696
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Yeah, I've been using that for a while. It avoids having to set up something

697
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
separate, something like Samba or NFS. You just set up

698
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
SSH with user privileges and you use your file browser in MIT.

699
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah, and you can even just bookmark it on the sidebar there.

700
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
You click it and it prompts you for the password if it's not saved in the key ring.

701
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
That's how I get to a lot of the systems here on the JB network these days. The reason why I don't like it a lot,

702
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
and this is only if you're using it a lot, if you're using it heavily, is there is

703
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
the overhead of using GVFS and then there is also the overhead

704
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
of using SSH to encrypt everything.

705
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I'm sitting here sending a 3.5 to 30

706
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
gigabyte H.264 file and I'm encrypting

707
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
all of it. That's all hitting my CPU and then it's all hitting the other

708
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
side of the CPU to decode it just so that way I can move it from machine to machine.

709
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I don't give two craps if it's encrypted or not. So here's the question. Is there something

710
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
like SSH FS but Netcat FS?

711
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Because I'll do that on the local network. You're just piping it through Netcat

712
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
and you go boom. Yes, there you go. What do you think of that?

713
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
You know what? You should save that for the five

714
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
top command line entries that

715
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
end users must know. New end users should learn and we're just going to accept that every

716
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
now and then it's okay to learn the command line. And you know what? Speaking of learning the command line, it's a great time

717
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
to mention Linux Academy, the third sponsor here on the Unplugged program, which

718
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
means we are winding down to the last segment. I am

719
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
really impressed with Linux Academy. They just closed another round of funding and they are

720
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
really kicking into high gear. I'll tell you about just some of the new things coming around the corner, but first let me give you

721
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
the basics. Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged. It's a platform to learn about

722
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Linux and all of the really great things around the nitty gritty aspects of Linux and

723
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
the stuff built on top of it. linuxacademy.com slash

724
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
unplugged. Go there. Sign up for a seven day free trial and then

725
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I have a course I want to recommend to you because it's such a no brainer and I'm not sure I've ever

726
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
mentioned it before. They have a course on how to use Linux Academy.

727
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
So you get the best out of Linux Academy by taking this introduction to Linux Academy course.

728
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Wow, that's like man-man. Isn't this a great idea though?

729
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
It seems like it. No, that seems essential. Good way to get the most out of it.

730
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
But here's a couple of new things they've been working on. You ready for this?

731
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I'm not even sure if they've released this fully publicly yet, but this is new stuff that's just come out.

732
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
That's why you listen here. We spill the beans. They've got the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer professional

733
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
level course now, the SysAdmins Guide to Bash Scripting,

734
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
the Cloud Essentials Certification Prep Course, Running Container and Clusters with Kubernetes,

735
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
which is very timeful right now, Apache Spark

736
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Essentials, Red Hat Certified Engineer Prep Course, the AWS Certified

737
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
SysOps Administrator Course Refresh. They just refreshed the courseware on that

738
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
and they just refreshed the courseware on the Docker Deep Dive. Nice.

739
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Yeah, that's also because there's been some updates there. Some big content updates coming

740
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
soon for the AWS Concepts and KVM Virtualization Essentials

741
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
as well. That'll be coming in the fall, which is just about now. Lots of good stuff

742
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
on Ansible coming down the pipe as well, which I know is interesting to a lot of our audience

743
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
member, as well as Big Data Essentials, Jenkins, Git Essentials,

744
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
and Azure Prep Courses. So there's

745
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
new releases just about every day right now at Linux Academy. So your

750
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
for sponsoring the unplugged program. So now,

751
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
speaking of command line tools that we need to learn,

752
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
PCWorld has an article up that I think we should vet. The five terminal commands

753
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
every Linux newbie should know. Dun dun dun. And I want to go

754
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
through the list. I'm going to read them off to you and then I say we put any of these up for replacement.

755
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So we're testing you, making sure you know what they all are. So number one,

756
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
every Linux newbie should know sudo. Number two, and then we'll talk about

757
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
these, you should know your package manager, be it yum, apt, pacman, of course.

758
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
You should know your package manager. Number three, systemctl

759
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
to manage systemd services. Number four,

760
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I'm surprised it took number, see I wonder if our list, if this wouldn't be maybe

761
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
a little bit up on the list, ls, you know, to list directory.

762
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
It seems like you might want that before number four. So this is...

763
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
And number five, man. Of course, we all know the man page,

764
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
man pages. So they have, again, to recap, five is

765
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
man, four is ls, three is systemctl,

766
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
two is pacman or

767
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
apt, and one is sudo.

768
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I feel like, I feel like maybe nothing's missing

769
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
here necessarily, although ps would be nice or top

770
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
would be nice. I also, we'll get into

771
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
this, but I feel like if my list would be ls

772
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
first

773
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
and probably man second. Yeah, man's pretty good. And then

774
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I think I would do things like sudo. I think that would be three.

775
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And I think... Although should we not, maybe we shouldn't

776
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
tell them about sudo if they're reading this list? Okay, systemctl stays at

777
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
three. And sudo, I still feel like sudo should be in there. I mean, you will

778
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
need to learn it, right? Once you need to make any system change. I think sudo is four and your package manager

779
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
is five. I think like the last thing you need to know as a new Linux user is how to use your

780
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
package manager on the command line. You should learn how to list directories. I think you should

781
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
learn how to look at processes, maybe know how to

782
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
do basic things like read a manual, reboot.

783
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Maybe free in there. If you don't know these tools, you're likely installing a distro that has a

784
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
graphical package manager. Right. So you don't...

785
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I'm curious to know what... Let's see what some of the

786
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Mumble Room thinks. So if you guys have a list or a command that

787
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
you think is missing, ping me in the Mumble Room. Oh, you do, Poppy? Go ahead.

788
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
So I just pasted you a command you can run, which

789
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
shows the most popular ten commands in

790
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
your bash history. Oh, that's a great one. And for me,

791
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
the top five, number one is ls by

792
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
a factor of two above the next thing I've ever run, which is cd.

793
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Right, so ls and cd and then sudo, which is

794
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
not unreasonable on Ubuntu where you don't get root account by default. Yeah. And then the

795
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
next one is my editor of choice, which I'm not going to name because I'll just get hate.

796
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And then there's other stuff after that. But yeah, ls and cd and

797
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
sudo, they seem like reasonable things to have at the top of your list. So...

798
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I think you should say, and we can debunk a myth here.

799
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I'll go first. My favorite editor is

800
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Nano. Oh!

801
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Were you here earlier in the show where I admitted to getting crap for the last two weeks

802
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
because I used Nano? I heard you mention it, and I wasn't here

803
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
to back you up, but I've been using Nano forever. And this is

804
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
mostly because the first Unix system I used,

805
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Pine was the email client, and consequently

806
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Pico was the editor. Oh my god, Pico, yes!

807
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Nano is a Pico clone. So hard coded into my

808
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
DNA is all the key bindings for Nano.

809
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I knew there was a reason I liked you, Martin. That must be it.

810
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I forgot about Pico! All these people that say that Vim and Vi

811
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
are so powerful, and there's all these key bindings. Well, there's all these key bindings in

812
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Nano as well. And if you know them, it's just as

813
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
fast and productive. I love you. That is amazing. I forgot about

814
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Pico, and that absolutely, and Pine, yes. Yes, alright.

815
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
So is it Nano for you too, Popey, that I take it? Yep. Alright.

816
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Now, JDA, I think I saw that go by, you also use Nano.

817
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Yes, I also use Nano, and I'll say as a visually impaired

818
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Linux user, yeah, I'm low, so it's

819
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
a lot more user friendly when you're zoomed in to a pretty high degree

820
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
on a monitor than the alternatives out there,

821
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
and just as someone who's tried all the different ones, in an accessibility

822
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
standpoint, Nano takes the cake, and I just wanted to

823
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
throw my two cents in there. I can't believe we started this show out with me admitting to all the crap I was getting.

824
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And Ben, you use Nano as well? Yeah, man.

825
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Nobody stood up, nobody said anything. Yes, Club Nano, there we go.

826
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
A wrong has been righted. Wait a minute, you see guys, I am

827
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
visually impaired too, I have to wear glasses because I have a stigmatism and light problem, and truthfully,

828
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I just gotta use Nano because of my sight, and because

829
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
you know, I also have autism, so it's kind of hard for me to wrap my hand around

830
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
other editors. Dude, you don't have to justify it, just embrace it.

831
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I love the Nano. It's fine. Sweetloo, you're a Nano user too, Sweetloo?

832
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I am, and my hierarchy

833
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
is Pseudo, CD, TAR, LS, and WP.

834
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Alright, you guys wanna know mine? Yeah.

835
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
My top RAND command, do you have a guess before I say what it is?

836
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Don't look. OBS. JITC. Huh?

837
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
JITC or OBS? Nope, it is

838
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Packer dash dash SYU. Dang.

839
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Wow. Archbox, right? Someone has a problem. Typical Arch user.

840
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I'm updating my packages, I'm updating my packages.

841
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Yeah, spin got it, spin got it. Oh, ngrep for monkeycom.

842
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
What do you use an ngrep for so much, monkeycom? We're on telecom,

843
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
so I'm constantly looking at streams. That makes sense. Hence the name.

844
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
My top 10 has a YouTube DL on it. Really? I bet

845
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
mine upstairs does where I do the unfilter clips, because I pull a lot now these days off YouTube.

846
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So my top command is CD, and then

847
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
sudo ls git nano rm ssh cat apt unyadim.

848
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I think you can tell mine is a laptop, because like SSH,

849
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
ping, MTR, IP, clearly I'm on a lot of networks. And you're

850
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
testing your connectivity each time, like why is this not going as fast as it should, what's the problem with

851
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
this thing? Why is YouTube DL so slow? Oh man, YouTube DL is

852
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
one of the best applications ever. It's funny, I

853
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
see like lots of these scrolling by in IRC, people saying ls is their most popular

854
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
thing. And when you watch people doing screencasts where there's command line stuff,

855
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
when people are, if they don't plan their video well,

856
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
you'll often see them just type ls randomly. I've watched

857
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
people give presentations where they're about to type a command. It's like your

858
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
idle thing. Yeah, it's like, you know how like

859
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
valley people say so in front of a sentence? Like nerds say ls

860
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
in front of a sentence before they do stuff. It's like a nervous tick anymore sometimes.

861
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
That's my um and pause for thought last thing.

862
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Yeah, I don't, you'd think I would use like PWD more to get my current

863
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
directory, but no, it's ls, and I always recognize where I'm at by what I see on the screen, and

864
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I'm getting like, and I even do ls-la. I don't,

865
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I like to have it. It's always dash la man, always. Yeah, I like to

866
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
have it with the attributes and the timestamp. Oh no. We are such nerds.

867
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
ls-lisa. Oh, lisa. Now, what is the

868
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
what is the s? I want to try it now. Now I'm going to go do that.

869
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
You could have told me something. Yeah, sl is probably 10% of my commands too. Oh my god, that's

870
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
too wide. Oh, that's too wide, yeah. It gives you everything. Yeah, it does.

871
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
See, I'll do a little. You need that stuff. See,

872
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
well actually ls still does quite a bit of stuff too. Look at all that though.

873
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
See, Rekai says ls-lot, and I like that because it's easy

874
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
to remember, but I always type it la, la, no,

875
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
l-t-r-a for some reason. I can't type it in the right order. We

876
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
are really geeking out now. This is

877
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
the best Linux podcast unit. This is the Linux podcast unit's finest right here.

878
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Alright, so ls is obviously on the top of all

879
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
of our lists for these five commands for new users. Is there anything else missing?

880
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I would say that if you have systemctl, you should really mention journalctl. Yes.

881
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Because that's an under, I mean, people don't appreciate how easy it is to make it

882
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
review things. Michael Dominic's system kernel panicked on him, and he was not sure how

883
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
he was supposed to look at the logs anymore. It was totally foreign to him.

884
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
So yeah, that would be a good one. Yeah, monkeycomp saying tail-f

885
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
log, yeah, yeah, yeah. Or journalctl, yeah. Alright,

886
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
that's a good one. Any others? I think you want, maybe you'll want

887
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
like ip or ifconfig, but really ip just for... What do you think, Wes?

888
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
What do you think, Wes, of just admitting

889
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
that it's not horrible to know a couple of command line tools? Like, the computer is

890
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
a tool. Right. And do we have to pretend like there's no command line

891
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
all the time? And it seems like really the equilibrium we should reach

892
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
is you use GUIs for things that you enjoy using GUIs for, and it makes sense

893
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
to use them for, and use the command line when it makes sense to do that. And obviously it'll be different

894
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
per user, but it shouldn't be something that has to be hidden away. One of the things I've seen

895
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
happen a couple of times, either directly or indirectly, just

896
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
either by being involved with a migration or just watching a migration as a third party

897
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
is I have watched several times companies transition from DOS-based

898
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
like terminal input, like either through like an SSH login or a

899
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
VTR or whatever, like the old virtual terminals for mainframes or

900
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
just a DOS app, like they could fly through with the keyboard, you know, like they

901
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
and they go, okay, and then okay, Mr. Fisher. Okay, yep,

902
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
we're ready to go. And I just ducked all the way out of the concern chair room.

903
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
And now they're like, okay, let me, let's see,

904
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I don't really know how to use the system. So you wanted to move your

905
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
reservation to, okay, well, yeah, okay. So if I go

906
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
into here and I click, like it's their efficiency

907
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
really dropped off. And I'm not trying to say that the command line was easier to use,

908
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
but there is something about

909
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
that particular interface that is sometimes the most efficient way to interact with the computer.

910
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Right, it's that balance of like utility versus learning curve. And, you know, so something that

911
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
makes sense for a home user, a casual user might not make sense for someone whose job it is to use

912
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
software every day. William, were you going to say something?

913
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Oh, I was just going to suggest even my parents are kind of like that. Like they kind of remember the good old DOS days

914
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
when I bring them back to a terminal. It's kind of hilarious. And it's kind of nostalgic and fun

915
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
the few times they have to use it. I was all like the first time

916
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I was migrating a company from a DOS system. It was a DOS system that loaded up

917
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
and then it launched a DOS-based mainframe terminal.

918
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I can't even remember what those terminals are called anymore.

919
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And then they spent their entire day in this system. And that was the computer

920
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
to them. And I migrated them to a graphical version of that.

921
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
And it sucked so bad. It was, I had, I was so

922
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
gung-ho about moving this company into the modern day and getting them on graphical

923
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
interface. And it was going to be, you know, replacing all these old

924
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
custom built PCs with brand new thin clients. And

925
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
it just was a huge usability reduction. And it was never

926
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
part of the conversation. It might have been an 8270. It might

927
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
have been. That doesn't ring a bell though. I think people who don't actually use the system take for granted

928
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
how much muscle memory there is in typing that stuff out and how quick you can translate what you want in your head

929
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
to some pattern you type in on the console after you've done it so many times.

930
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Yeah, and if it's a series of eight menu options and it's one through eight to trigger them

931
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
and your hand's already hovering to the keyboard, you just tap that thing out super quick.

932
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Like especially the hotel receptionists and stuff who have got it down to a science and they're just like banging on the keyboard and just

933
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
get it all done immediately.

934
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
So I think when we talk about Linux, and

935
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I think a lot of people are going to be moving over to Linux are geek power users. I don't know if,

936
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I mean I'm sure it's not all of them, but we've been talking about this theoretical frustrated

937
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
web development user who's got a Macbook a few years

938
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
ago because it was BSD with a GUI and now they've realized, oh this is

939
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
actually a commercial product that has a lot of other interests and it's not their

940
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
primary focus, it's not their main platform, it's not their money maker, and there's a huge

941
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
strategy tack that's dragging this entire platform around by the ball sack. I want to move

942
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
to something where I can just get my work done, I can get a laptop with the hardware I want,

943
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
and I can still SSH into the same servers and build my same applications.

944
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
And there's a lot of little niche use cases like that, like

945
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
UserAir. UserAir two years ago, I never could have

946
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,000
produced the entire thing using Linux and open source software. And now we have an

947
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
entire system that's all open. I mean it's like a lot of

948
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
different use cases are switching over to Linux and each little

949
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
niche vertical is going to add up to a serious amount of users.

950
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I hope, I think, that's the theory, right? That's the hope, that's the theory.

951
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
And so when they come here, why not say, yeah, you'll have to use the command line

952
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
sometimes, there's probably like six, five, six, seven, eight commands you should probably do. You should probably

953
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
learn, take a half hour and learn each one, and you will have

954
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
a good set of tools to learn more from there. If you know Man, you know LS,

955
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
you know how to look at processes, you know how to stop and start services, you know a

956
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
lot of stuff that you're never going to have to deal with the command line. And maybe that's a good way to approach it, right?

957
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Like it's different than if you're going to the Windows world where, you know, like there's a whole

958
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
huge system of things to learn. On Linux there's a lot of, you can get by with a lot of like just a

959
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
few fundamental principles, you know, five or ten commands that you need to know, and then you can

960
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
administer a fair bit of your system.

961
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Hurricane, you think Windows 10 users are ripe for the pick and two?

962
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Yeah, well I started on Windows 10, or I was a Windows

963
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
user a couple years ago, and then two years ago when Windows 10s came out I just completely

964
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
dropped it. And that's when I started

965
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
packaging Namby for you guys and for the community and

966
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
now all my machines run Linux.

967
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Well our one then, our benefit. That's awesome. That is really good.

968
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Alright, so Ben I want to give you a chance to jump in because

969
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
you got the new System76 machine, you're switching over from the Macbook, you're not afraid of the command line.

970
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
You're okay with it.

971
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Bingo. No? Going once? Going twice? Alright, Swift, I'll let you

972
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
have the last word on this particular one. Go ahead.

973
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Yeah, in this case it's like with Vista, I remember when that came out.

974
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I was Ben the guy who sold you the Macbook.

975
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Okay, when Vista came out you would have thought that that would have been a big

976
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
deal to get people to Linux, and yet even though it was such a catastrophe

977
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
that's not what happened. No, they went to the Mac.

978
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Yeah, so with Windows 10, I mean I wonder how that's going to

979
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
be the change now with Macbook Pros being what they are now,

980
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
and just with people getting aggravated with Apple.

981
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I'm curious if that's ever going to happen and make people really switch to Linux.

982
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
That's what I want to see. I think that is what's happening.

983
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I think it is. I think a lot of them, I think when Vista came out

984
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
people said to themselves, that's it, I'm going to get a Mac.

985
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I was going to get a Ubuntu rig, but they ruined it. They ruined it for us.

986
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
They ruined everything. That was actually surprisingly common.

987
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I feel like a lot of the blogs kind of talked about how they looked at, you know, right when the Unity transition happened

988
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
they had been looking at using Linux and then went to Mac OS, so it's interesting

989
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
that inflection point wasn't that long ago. I know, I know. I do think

990
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
that is partially true. So it makes me give the idea that part of this momentum is that like

991
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
some of these Mac users have had their eye on Linux for a while, right? Like they've considered it, maybe it hasn't met

992
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
the standards that they don't think it can. Or what they did before

993
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
isn't what they do now. Like Mike was all in on iOS development. Right. And then he's like, well

994
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
this isn't paying the bills. He's doing more back end stuff. Yeah, and now then he's like, well wait a minute

995
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
if I'm just doing back end work, what am I doing? And I think that's true for

996
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
a lot of them as well. And I think distros are better than they used to be.

997
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Yeah. And a lot of progress has been made on that kind of thing. And, you know, we've, I think

998
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Linux has learned some of like what Mac did by having such an integrated stack

999
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
and the kind of like seamlessness and the integration and the consistency

1000
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
and we've gotten better there too. Meanwhile, Wes, we'll just sit

1001
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
back and say we told you something to watch. We'll welcome them with open arms and tell them which five or

1002
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
six command line apps they should probably bother learning. They probably already know half of them from the Mac anyways.

1003
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
So they probably only have to learn like another three or four more. Yep. They probably are already set.

1004
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Alright, well we're going to get out of here. I don't know if this has ended up being a short show or not because

1005
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
it kind of felt like, I guess it was just a regular size show. But we're going to get out

1006
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
of here because the elections are coming up and then I am jumping on the road

1007
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
and heading down to California. Getting out of town. Don't forget about that meetup at

1008
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting and do come back next week and

1009
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
hang out with Noah, Wes, and the gang. Yeah, be here. Yeah, Noah will be in studio.

1010
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
What a treat. So you guys can hang out and, you know, cut

1011
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
rugs or whatever you got. Who knows? I don't know. You should tune in Chris. Be here live.

1012
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Yeah, maybe. I wonder what they'll be up to. Of course if I tune in and I don't

1013
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
like it, then what do I do? Jump in the moment room and yell at you guys? No, I'm kidding.

1014
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
We'll cut you off. Don't worry. Oh, that guy. Get him out of here. Kick him out.

1015
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Alright everybody, thanks for joining us. We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1016
01:07:44,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Music.

1017
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:31,680
Oh, there we go.

1018
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,680
All right, JBtitles.com.

1019
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,680
JBtitles.com everybody.

1020
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,680
Get over that.

1021
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:38,520
So what distro are you still running there on that laptop, Wes?

1022
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,520
This would be Arch Linux.

1023
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:40,520
It is.

1024
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,520
Is it Apricity, though?

1025
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,520
That's what I was wondering.

1026
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,520
Nope, just Arch.

1027
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,520
Oh, you reloaded to...

1028
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,520
Really?

1029
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,520
Really?

1030
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,520
No more?

1031
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,520
What are you doing there on the...

1032
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,520
Really?

1033
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,520
Really?

1034
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,520
Really?

1035
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,520
Pretty minimal right now, like very few plugins.

1036
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,520
Have you had a chance to see the Linux action show from Sunday?

1037
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,160
Noah had some really weird performance issues on his Arch box.

1038
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,400
Yeah, that did seem weird.

1039
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,720
I was excited that he switched, though.

1040
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,680
Yeah, a lot of people think he's crazy for doing it.

1041
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,280
What's the hardware he's running?

1042
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:05,000
I don't know exactly.

1043
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,760
Yeah, that performance stuff seemed...

1044
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:07,760
I saw that.

1045
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:08,760
It was a little weird.

1046
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:09,760
Yeah, it seemed really weird.

1047
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,760
Like the launch times were...

1048
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,520
Like even for a fresh install, and he's doing all SSDs, I think.

1049
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,520
Yeah, Chris, I actually saw that show, and I saw the lag he was getting.

1050
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,520
I was like, what the heck is this?

1051
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,000
Yeah, that was the weirdest thing.

1052
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,960
And to me, it looked like network, because it affects both Chrome and Firefox.

1053
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,720
I don't know what kind of Wi-Fi he's gotten in, but I got to tell you, it looked pretty

1054
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,720
laggy.

1055
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:37,240
I'll tell you, I'm on Time Warner with the 300 meg internet, and I was getting 350 today.

1056
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,840
Should we have like a nano title?

1057
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,840
We should probably have a nano title, right?

1058
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,840
Maybe, yeah.

1059
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,840
It was pretty...

1060
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,840
I like that idea.

1061
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:49,080
I like it until Popeye and Wimpy said anything, and it was really Wimpy that pushed it.

1062
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,520
No, everybody else is like quiet about it.

1063
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,280
I'm all up here admitting my nano sin, and everybody's like, I run nano, but I'm not

1064
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,280
saying nothing.

1065
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,280
Yeah, we should have stuck up a bit back there.

1066
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:04,680
At my last job, not the job I have now, but my last job, when we were doing stuff, occasionally

1067
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:09,640
you have to gather around someone's computer, when everyone used to gather around my computer

1068
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:15,640
and I would edit something, I could actually hear them say, freak, as I typed in nano.

1069
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,480
Yeah, nano shame's been around forever.

1070
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,760
I mean, it started as a bit of a joke, actually.

1071
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,200
And I think it was Pico we were using back in the day that started as the joke, not nano.

1072
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:30,280
Well, I, so originally, I was, well, I was using Pico on Unix systems, and then on...

1073
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,800
On Linux, I would load Pico too, though.

1074
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,800
I wouldn't load nano.

1075
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:38,720
Yeah, in the early days, Pico, and then a little bit later on, it was, nano was called

1076
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:45,960
TIP, this isn't Pico, originally, and then it changed to nano, because nano is a thousand

1077
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,720
times larger than Pico.

1078
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,560
I feel like it was like Gentoo or something that made me switch from Pico to nano, but

1079
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,560
I don't remember.

1080
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,560
I feel like there was...

1081
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:59,120
I was going through that transition of, you know, learning nano, not TIP, you know, not

1082
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,120
Pico.

1083
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:06,360
But yeah, yeah, it was all just because the only email I had available to was Pine, and

1084
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:10,160
I just learned how to get around using Pico.

1085
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:15,640
So as soon as I started exploring the system, I edited everything with Pico, and that's

1086
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:20,320
just stuck with me for however many years it is.

1087
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:24,780
Nano users unite, and nano aggressions are not bad.

1088
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:28,040
Nano users come out of the closet funny, but it's too long, I think.

1089
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:32,840
And nano the lesser Emacs is kind of slammy.

1090
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:37,720
I was seeing a lot of lines of nano FTW, but that was, I don't know.

1091
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,960
Not so nano now.

1092
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,600
I kind of like that one.

1093
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,200
I wonder how the drone thing worked out.

1094
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:49,120
See now someone needs to implement nano, like there's the evil mode for Emacs, maybe there

1095
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,840
should be a nano mode for Emacs.

1096
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,840
Yeah, yeah.

1097
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,360
Actually, I would like pirate mode.

1098
01:11:54,360 --> 01:12:00,280
Did you ever see, you have to be kind of old, but did you ever install Red Hat when you

1099
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:04,400
could install it in, oh, I forget what they call it, but it was basically, it was Red

1100
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,880
Neck mode.

1101
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,800
It was when Red Hat was testing out multilingual support.

1102
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,480
And so they were testing Red Neck mode, and they actually shipped a version, or it was

1103
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,720
a beta, where you could, I think it was like in the 5 series or something, where you could

1104
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:20,400
install Red Hat Linux in Red Neck mode.

1105
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,400
Actually existed.

1106
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:47,520
It was amazing.
