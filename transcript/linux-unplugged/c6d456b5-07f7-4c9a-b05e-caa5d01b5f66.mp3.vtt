00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 38 for April 29th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:45.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's still a little hungover and still pretty dang happy from the most excellent Linux Fest Northwest. My name is Chris.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
My name is Matt.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Hey there, Matt. How you feeling?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Feeling pretty good.

00:49.000 --> 01:04.000
Good, good. Well, I'm looking forward to today's show because we have some follow-up interviews that didn't make it into this Sunday's Linux action show from the floor of Linux Fest Northwest. If you watched our live stream, and a lot of you did, and we had a great show, but that was always at our booth.

01:04.000 --> 01:16.000
We showed some clips from the floor, but there was still even more. Even the ones we streamed live on Saturday and ones that we showed on Sunday, guess what? We still have more interviews to show today, so we've got some great ones we're going to play, and I'm looking forward to that.

01:16.000 --> 01:28.000
So we've got kind of a special show today because we've also got folks that have joined us in our virtual lug, the Mumble Room, who are also at Linux Fest Northwest. So it's going to be a little bit of a follow-up from this Sunday's show, but don't worry.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
Even if you weren't there, that's actually even better for you because it's going to be stuff that you didn't get even a chance to ask these folks or talk to these folks.

01:35.000 --> 01:50.000
We've got guys from SUSE, we've got folks from Firefox OS, and others. So we're going to get to that, but first, Matt, before we get into our clips, I want to thank our first sponsor this week, and that is the great folks over at Ting.com.

01:50.000 --> 02:10.000
Ting is mobile that makes sense, my mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider. Matt, of course you're a Fios customer, but last Thursday, I don't know if you heard about this, Comcast got their fiber connection completely cut, and we were out of internet connectivity for the entire day.

02:10.000 --> 02:23.000
It started at 1 a.m. in the morning, and it lasted until about 4 o'clock in the evening. It was huge. Yeah, and Ting saved the day in a really big way because Ting is no contracts, and you only pay for what you use.

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
So I knew that I had the ability to just turn on Hotspot because it's included with my Ting service, and I was just going to pay for the usage for that day.

02:30.000 --> 02:42.000
It was just absolutely critical because Alan had just flown in from Canada. That's another country, and he was here in studio to do TechSnap, and we didn't have any internet connectivity.

02:42.000 --> 03:01.000
I mean, that was like worst case scenario because when does that ever happen? And Ting totally saved the day. I don't want to waste my Nexus, right? I grabbed Rekai's HTC One, put that down on the table, turned on the Wi-Fi hotspot mode, and boom, Alan and I were able to prep the show.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
We even started the first half of TechSnap live using the HTC One tethering. It was pretty crazy, and thankfully after the new segment, the regular internet connectivity came back up.

03:06.000 --> 03:18.000
But you know, I was getting like 15 megabits on my LTE connection. So here's what I want everybody to do. Go over to linux.ting.com. Yes, linux.ting.com, and check out what you would save by plugging into that savings calculator.

03:18.000 --> 03:26.000
I think you'll be pretty impressed. Go down also and watch the demo of their cool dashboard. It's really intuitive, and it makes it really straightforward to manage your account.

03:26.000 --> 03:40.000
And that's one of the things that now that I've been a Ting customer for over a year, I really, genuinely appreciate how great that interface is. And I feel like I've never, like Matt, when I got you to sign up with Ting, I was like, Matt, you got to try this out.

03:40.000 --> 03:51.000
Like even before they were really coming on as a sponsor, I was like, Matt, you got to look at this. And then also now with Rekai, I've given him a phone, and neither one of you did I ever have to say this is how you use the dashboard, this is where you log in, this is what this does.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
It just makes sense, like all of the Ting lineup does. And you know what's really great? It was stupid simple. Yeah, you could walk right into it and you were good to go.

03:57.000 --> 04:07.000
What's really great now is that now that we have multiple lines on that dashboard, it's really simple to just say, okay, this is the cost of X, this is the cost of Y, we can keep everything separate, we can set up alerts if we need to.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
The more devices you add, it still stays simple and intuitive, and that's what I love about it.

04:13.000 --> 04:25.000
But I've got great news. If you already have an HTC One that's compatible with the Ting network, and they have a BYOD page where you can check out what devices are, you can now bring it over to the Ting network.

04:25.000 --> 04:33.000
You can now bring the HTC One over to the Ting network, and that's pretty exciting because that is a really good phone. I really love the HTC One.

04:33.000 --> 04:45.000
Go over to linux.ting.com, that'll take $25 off your first month of service if you're going to bring, say, the HTC One or any compatible phone. If you don't already have a phone, then going to linux.ting.com will take $25 off your service.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
If you're like me, we'll pay for your first month of service. linux.ting.com. And a really big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

04:53.000 --> 05:03.000
Love those guys. And the Ting devices were showing up representing at Linux Fest Northwest, and we were using Viber to stay in communication.

05:03.000 --> 05:13.000
I know Viber isn't perfect with security, but at Linux Fest Northwest, it was so great to have group chats with picture and voice capabilities, like quick, almost like radio.

05:13.000 --> 05:24.000
Roger that, I'm moving down to the lobby over, and it would just send it to everybody. But then also to be able to work on my laptop and also keep in the Viber discussion, that was really cool.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
And having those on the Ting devices was awesome. Okay, Matt, go ahead.

05:29.000 --> 05:39.000
I was going to say that I was actually pleasantly surprised with Viber's capabilities because I found it to be not only easy to use, but I find myself probably going to stick with it now. I'm actually kind of addicted.

05:39.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah, it seems kind of stupid simple. I think they could series up the UI a little bit if they wanted more people to take them a little more seriously.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
True.

05:49.000 --> 05:58.000
But once you start using it, it's pretty useful. And I've read reports that there's ways you can get access to the pictures stored in clear text on their servers if you were super motivated.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
It's not obvious, but there is a way to get to them. So it's not perfect with security. And the same with the voice memos. So it's got some issues.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
But for what we were using it for, like, I'm going down to the booth. That's fine.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Yeah, exactly.

06:11.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah, in fact, I remember, too. We were pulling up Sunday morning for the Linux action show after everybody had eaten at our hotel and we were driving towards the fest.

06:20.000 --> 06:28.000
And they're like, Chris, Mad Dog is waiting for you. And I'm like, yeah, well, we're not even set up yet. So we're not ready for an interview.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
They're like, no, you don't understand. Mad Dog's here. Guys, I know. But we were able to have this back and forth. So they were able to relay to him what was up.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
So it was super useful. All right. Well, while we're talking about Linux Fest Northwest, maybe we should play a couple of clips.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
I don't know where to start exactly because these are all just really great.

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
But one that I think just kind of stood out for me as kind of a funny moment and I'm sure the Mumble Room will agree with me later on in the show.

06:52.000 --> 06:59.000
Microsoft made a big splash, right? I think we kind of mentioned that last like they were the talk, weren't they?

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
They were huge. I mean, not only were they just actually all around great guys to be around, but they were giving out food, which is always a win with the Linux crowd.

07:07.000 --> 07:14.000
Like cotton candy, cupcakes, donuts and then like full on shirts in tubes and in crazy shapes.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
So they really brought the swag. So that's why this chat we had with someone.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
I don't want to use his name. If he uses his name in the clip, that's fine. But I'm not going to say it if he doesn't.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
But we talked with an employee from Microsoft who came up not as part of the Microsoft crew.

07:30.000 --> 07:37.000
In fact, I think he just kind of came up on the sly because he's a Linux user at Microsoft and he wanted to see what's up.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
So I talked to him a little bit and I just found the whole chat delightful.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Say again in the microphone what your name is. My name is Jason Wagner.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
Jason. Oh, hello, Jason. Very nice to meet you. Tell the folks what you do. I work for Microsoft.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
I believe there is a pretty big presence of Microsoft here this year. Is there? Yeah.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
I've been hearing a lot about the Microsoft booth. Everybody stopped by to talk about the Microsoft booth. I'm not with them.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
I'm just by myself. Oh, okay. Very cool.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
So why do you think it is? I mean, you don't have to share. It's just in your opinion.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Why do you think it is that Microsoft does have such a splash here this year?

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Does half the sponsor? Is making such a big splash?

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
Very popular. I mean, you've got some great food. Cotton candy. That's pulling out all the stops. I like that.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
I don't know. Maybe we have conventions in the area and we just have to make a presence.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
Wow. I loved that answer. I couldn't believe what he said. I mean, I don't know, man.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
Basically, we have a budget and this one is local so it's easy for us.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
So what we kind of do is just figure, look, they have this much money so we just send them up.

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
And it was just funny because if that's true, they don't project that. They seem genuinely interested to be there.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
I definitely felt like there was more of a genuine connection there for sure.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Yeah. All right. It continues on. So now he's going to talk a little bit how he –

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
I eventually find out that he's a Linux user at Microsoft, but it takes me a little bit to get there.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
I thought you were going to tell me something more fancy than that, to be honest with you.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
It's probably pretty simple.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
What do you do for Microsoft?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
What's that?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
What do you do for Microsoft?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
I do IT.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
Oh, okay. Do you have much Linux at Microsoft that you end up working with?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
I don't work with it.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
But you're just kind of curious what goes on up here?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Yeah.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
So what do you think?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I'm loving it. I'm running it at home now.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Oh, yeah?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Yeah. My primary desktop is –

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
What distro do you use?

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
At home or on my workstation I use Arch with GNOME 3.12.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Look at you. Right on.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
And on my laptop I've got the new Ubuntu GNOME.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
What do you think?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
I love GNOME.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Yeah.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Wow. So are you –

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I was the guy on your Google Plus who was posting the,

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
hey, this is kind of the best way – the best workflows for GNOME.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Yeah.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Yeah. That was actually kind of helpful because I've been using –

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I have a lot of different desktops.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
I'll use Unity right now.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
But, yeah, I agree.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
GNOME has really gotten really great.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Yeah.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
So are you able to use that at work?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Am I what?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Are you able to use that at work?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I use it – I work from home.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Oh, okay.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
So I can use GNOME as my primary environment and then I'll –

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
I have a VM that I run in GNOME boxes.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
So that's Windows 7.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Yeah.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
And I do everything for Microsoft there.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
That's really interesting.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
GNOME boxes.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Yeah.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah, I use GNOME boxes too.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
We even use the smart card readers and I'm able to pass that through USB.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Oh, nice.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
So is this the first Linux fest for you?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
This is my first Linux fest.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Very cool.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Have you gotten any sessions?

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Have I gotten any what?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Sessions? Any sessions?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Oh, yeah.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
And what do you think?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
It's pretty good.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Anything stand out?

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
I went to a Python intro to Python.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
That was really great.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
So I'll be picking up some of that.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Yeah.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Good.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I just went to Brian's SUSE talk.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Did you enjoy it?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah, I did.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Good.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
What do you think of SUSE?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
I'm not sure yet.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
I'm going to have to try it.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Yeah.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
But I picked up a SUSE and Fedora CDs and we'll see how that goes.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
You're going to give them a try, huh?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Yeah, I think so.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Good.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
Arch is – it really scratches an itch for me.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.280
I love the AUR, but there's just a bit too much breakage that I can tolerate on my primary

11:00.280 --> 11:01.280
machine.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.280
Sure, sure.

11:02.280 --> 11:08.840
The other day I couldn't update my system because some font thing got changed, whatever

11:08.840 --> 11:09.840
that was.

11:09.840 --> 11:10.840
Yeah.

11:10.840 --> 11:11.840
I'm using the Infinality packages.

11:11.840 --> 11:12.840
Yeah, yeah.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.840
Love them.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.840
Beautiful fonts, though.

11:14.840 --> 11:15.840
Beautiful.

11:15.840 --> 11:16.840
Yeah.

11:16.840 --> 11:17.840
Absolutely beautiful.

11:17.840 --> 11:21.000
But I couldn't update for a day, so I figured out what the break was.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.240
Were you able to fix it?

11:22.240 --> 11:23.240
I was able to.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.840
I had to find some forum post about it.

11:24.840 --> 11:25.840
Yeah.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.840
I'm not – I'm not sharp enough to do it myself yet, but –

11:27.840 --> 11:28.840
Yeah.

11:28.840 --> 11:29.840
Yeah.

11:29.840 --> 11:30.840
You know, I've had a few bumps like that, too.

11:30.840 --> 11:35.440
It feels like it's only been a few times every couple of months maybe, but it's enough

11:35.440 --> 11:39.760
that I could see how somebody could be kind of sensitive to it because if you're busy,

11:39.760 --> 11:42.640
it gets kind of a – and then you don't want to fall too far behind.

11:42.640 --> 11:43.640
Exactly.

11:43.640 --> 11:44.640
Yeah, especially in Arch.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.880
So I try to do it every two or three days and then if something breaks and I've got

11:47.880 --> 11:52.200
a day or two to kind of get on it and then I'm never really like a week behind or anything.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.200
Yeah.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.200
Well, very good.

11:54.200 --> 11:57.360
So I stopped by – after he got up, you know what I said is – I said, yeah, it doesn't

11:57.360 --> 12:00.120
break that often for me anymore, but I think if it ever broke to the point where it took

12:00.120 --> 12:02.400
me more than 30 minutes to fix it, I'd probably wipe it.

12:02.400 --> 12:03.400
Oh, really?

12:03.400 --> 12:04.400
Yeah.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.400
I think that's how I feel about it.

12:05.400 --> 12:09.160
Like right now, I've never had anything break that's taken more than – you know,

12:09.160 --> 12:13.540
you figure five minutes to do the quick search, five minutes to read it, and then about five

12:13.540 --> 12:14.540
minutes to fix it.

12:14.540 --> 12:19.280
And if it – if it – you know, that's not too bad considering, you know, what I

12:19.280 --> 12:20.280
get for the – in return.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.280
Sure.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.360
Anyways, I just thought that was an interesting conversation with a Microsoft employee who's

12:23.360 --> 12:24.360
running Gnome 3.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.320
Now, he's doing it remotely though, but I like that one.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.320
So we also –

12:28.320 --> 12:29.320
But that's still clever.

12:29.320 --> 12:30.320
That's still clever.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.320
Yeah.

12:31.320 --> 12:34.160
And it's just – I wonder – I wonder how many other Closet Linux users there could

12:34.160 --> 12:36.680
be hanging out at Microsoft.

12:36.680 --> 12:41.800
So we had a chat with Peter from SUSE and Noah asked him a few great questions and I

12:41.800 --> 12:42.800
wanted to roll that.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.960
We're here with Peter Linell from the OpenSUSE and SUSE project.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.160
How are you doing today, Peter?

12:47.160 --> 12:48.160
I'm doing fine.

12:48.160 --> 12:51.400
I want to note you pronounce it SUSE like John Philip SUSE.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.920
It's always a confusion for people.

12:52.920 --> 12:53.920
SUSE.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.840
Well, tell me a little bit about SUSE and OpenSUSE and what the differences are between

12:56.840 --> 12:57.840
the two.

12:57.840 --> 13:02.260
Well, for starters, SUSE, the company, is actually the oldest enterprise Linux company

13:02.260 --> 13:07.000
started some 22 years ago in 1992 in Germany.

13:07.000 --> 13:14.420
And in the SUSE timeframe when – after SUSE had gotten bought by Novell, the decision

13:14.420 --> 13:18.020
was to open source all of the SUSE enterprise.

13:18.020 --> 13:23.520
And from that, now OpenSUSE, the community project, is basically upstream for the SUSE

13:23.520 --> 13:27.720
enterprise Linux product, which will have a new version coming out in the fall.

13:27.720 --> 13:28.720
Okay.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.240
Now you work with both OpenSUSE and regular SUSE.

13:31.240 --> 13:32.240
Is that correct?

13:32.240 --> 13:33.240
That's correct.

13:33.240 --> 13:38.040
I'm an OpenSUSE community member, which many SUSE employees are.

13:38.040 --> 13:43.500
As well, I'm an Open – I'm an employee of SUSE, the enterprise Linux company.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.560
I cover the West Coast as a sales engineer.

13:45.560 --> 13:46.560
Okay.

13:46.560 --> 13:50.960
So even though one is more of a business model, one's more of an open model, they're both

13:50.960 --> 13:53.200
technically open source software, correct?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.200
Correct.

13:54.200 --> 14:00.320
99% of what SUSE enterprise Linux is actually GPL compatible software.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.320
It's open source.

14:01.320 --> 14:02.720
You can download the sources.

14:02.720 --> 14:07.600
When you're a SUSE customer, you get all the source DVDs and source RPMs.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.120
What exciting things are the OpenSUSE project working on?

14:10.120 --> 14:11.320
Are the SUSE project working on?

14:11.320 --> 14:14.720
What exciting things can we look to see that might be coming up?

14:14.720 --> 14:17.920
Well, one thing we're doing is – and tomorrow I'm going to give a talk on it.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.840
It's called the Open Build Server.

14:19.840 --> 14:25.640
And we're almost a victim of our own success in that OpenSUSE of the community distribution

14:25.640 --> 14:29.840
has grown dramatically in terms of the packages.

14:29.840 --> 14:36.920
We went from 5,000 to near 9,000 packages now.

14:36.920 --> 14:40.280
And the challenge is the release management.

14:40.280 --> 14:46.400
So we're refining the tools behind the scenes to have a better release management plan for

14:46.400 --> 14:49.280
the next version of OpenSUSE.

14:49.280 --> 14:55.400
Other than that, we are continuing to push the envelope in kernel and things like that.

14:55.400 --> 15:01.080
And the other great part is the SUSE engineers who work on the enterprise kernel are constantly

15:01.080 --> 15:05.320
contributing back into OpenSUSE, their fixes, enhancements, and things like that.

15:05.320 --> 15:06.320
Perfect.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.320
Well, thank you very much.

15:07.320 --> 15:08.320
I appreciate your time.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.320
Thank you.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.320
Thank you for talking with you.

15:10.320 --> 15:13.120
Yeah, the SUSE booth was really one of the great ones.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.520
They always have a great approach to it.

15:14.520 --> 15:15.520
So that's one of the fun ones.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.880
And they had it in a great spot this year, too.

15:18.880 --> 15:23.240
So we had a chance to chat with Adam, who showed up with something kind of cool.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.680
I gave it a mention last this week.

15:25.680 --> 15:26.680
It's called Crouton.

15:26.680 --> 15:31.280
And I'm particularly interested in it because I have this C720 that's a pretty good machine,

15:31.280 --> 15:36.060
but I've had some flakiness under Linux, and I almost wonder if maybe I should try

15:36.060 --> 15:41.320
to give Chrome OS more fare of a shake because there's some things I do like about it.

15:41.320 --> 15:44.560
And I feel like to really have a well-rounded opinion, I should probably give it more than

15:44.560 --> 15:46.740
a few hours like I did before.

15:46.740 --> 15:50.400
So I was thinking, I would kind of like to go back to Chrome OS on the C720 for a little

15:50.400 --> 15:55.280
while, but I'm just not quite ready to give up full desktop functionality.

15:55.280 --> 16:00.880
I like the option of sometimes actually getting something considerable done on a laptop that

16:00.880 --> 16:01.880
size.

16:01.880 --> 16:05.680
And so Adam happened to show up at just the right time to talk to me about Crouton, and

16:05.680 --> 16:08.360
now it's really got me thinking about juicing up my Chromebook.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.120
Welcome to Linux Fest Northwest.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.120
Thank you very much.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.120
2014.

16:12.120 --> 16:16.400
I give Jupyter Broadcasting full credit in getting me out here from Flagstaff, Arizona.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.400
Oh, wow.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.400
Wow.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.960
So you brought your Chromebook with you.

16:19.960 --> 16:20.960
Yes, I did.

16:20.960 --> 16:23.040
But it seems to be a little schizophrenic.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.040
Very fine.

16:24.040 --> 16:25.800
Because just a few seconds ago, I thought that thing was running Linux.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.400
What's going on?

16:27.400 --> 16:32.000
So it is running Linux at the same time as it's running Chrome OS.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Sounds awesome.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Let's see here.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Yeah.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
All right.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
So...

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
And how are you doing this?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.120
Because I know there's dual boot, but this isn't dual boot, right?

16:40.120 --> 16:41.120
This is a Chromebook.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.120
Yeah.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.120
No, dual boot.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.120
You're not using dual boot.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.120
Oh, no.

16:45.120 --> 16:55.600
There is a crewbuntu project where you can install in place of Chrome OS almost any distribution

16:55.600 --> 16:56.600
of Linux you want.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.600
Yeah.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.600
This is a different project.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.160
It's up on GitHub.

17:00.160 --> 17:03.040
I could pull up the link in just a second.

17:03.040 --> 17:06.920
It's called crouton, C-R-O-U-T-O-N, if you...

17:06.920 --> 17:08.920
Like the kind I eat?

17:08.920 --> 17:09.920
Yeah.

17:09.920 --> 17:13.600
Do a GitHub search for crouton.

17:13.600 --> 17:21.440
And it's basically a shell script that you download that handles finding whichever desired

17:21.440 --> 17:25.020
distribution you'd like to run in a CH root.

17:25.020 --> 17:27.080
So it does all this with CH root.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.960
So it's actually running under Chrome OS?

17:28.960 --> 17:29.960
Exactly.

17:29.960 --> 17:30.960
Ah.

17:30.960 --> 17:31.960
That's the trick.

17:31.960 --> 17:32.960
I gotcha.

17:32.960 --> 17:38.080
And at the same time, you can keep one application running while you switch back and forth.

17:38.080 --> 17:43.760
I can have YouTube playing on Chrome OS while I hop over into Linux to do some mono develop

17:43.760 --> 17:46.760
or maybe my team speak or, you know, those...

17:46.760 --> 17:47.760
Cool.

17:47.760 --> 17:51.040
Those few applications that I haven't been able to completely...

17:51.040 --> 17:52.040
Get away from.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.040
Get away from.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.040
Yeah.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.280
And, you know, also, I love Linux.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.380
I want to use Linux.

17:58.380 --> 18:01.520
So it's nice to have it right there in my pocket whenever I need it.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.520
Yeah.

18:02.520 --> 18:03.520
Yeah.

18:03.520 --> 18:08.080
So what kind of overhead, I mean, Chromebooks are kind of historically tight on resources.

18:08.080 --> 18:11.160
So does this kill the resources on a Chromebook?

18:11.160 --> 18:16.560
I found that my major complaint about this Chromebook itself is that as far as I know,

18:16.560 --> 18:18.240
the RAM's not expandable.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.240
Four gigs?

18:19.240 --> 18:20.240
I'm stuck at two.

18:20.240 --> 18:21.240
Two.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.240
Yeah.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.240
And that's probably a bad choice on their part.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.240
Yeah.

18:24.240 --> 18:28.560
They put the touch screen in it and, you know, the Haswell, so this has got great battery

18:28.560 --> 18:29.560
life.

18:29.560 --> 18:30.560
Yeah.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.600
But if you had four, that'd be great, right, or even more?

18:32.600 --> 18:33.600
It would be.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.600
Yeah.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.720
What I've noticed, and I can even show it on the system monitor, is that basically once

18:37.720 --> 18:43.360
I have both of them running at the same time, I'm sitting at about 75, 80% RAM usage.

18:43.360 --> 18:46.220
So I am somewhat limited on what I can do.

18:46.220 --> 18:47.260
Up to that red line.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.260
But it works.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.260
It does.

18:49.260 --> 18:50.260
Yeah.

18:50.260 --> 18:51.260
It definitely serves my needs.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.260
Do you...

18:52.260 --> 18:55.460
So when you're in the truth, you just have your own walled-off file system.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.920
You can't get to the Chrome OS file system or anything like that?

18:57.920 --> 18:58.920
You actually can.

18:58.920 --> 18:59.920
Really?

18:59.920 --> 19:00.920
Yeah.

19:00.920 --> 19:03.040
Anything you have in your Downloads folder.

19:03.040 --> 19:07.200
If anybody's used Chrome OS, they know that there's usually a Google Drive with everything,

19:07.200 --> 19:10.960
and then there's your Downloads folder, and that's what you work under.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.200
And yes, you can get to all of those files.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.200
Holy!

19:14.200 --> 19:15.200
Look at that.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.200
Yeah.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.200
That is really fancy.

19:17.200 --> 19:21.080
So do you have to do anything special to Chrome OS before you install Crouton?

19:21.080 --> 19:22.080
You do.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.080
You do have to go into developer mode.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.080
Okay.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.840
And for whichever Chromebook you have, there are lots of online instructions on how to get

19:26.840 --> 19:27.840
into developer mode.

19:27.840 --> 19:28.840
Yeah.

19:28.840 --> 19:29.840
Which does reset it.

19:29.840 --> 19:30.840
Yeah.

19:30.840 --> 19:31.840
Yeah.

19:31.840 --> 19:32.840
It does.

19:32.840 --> 19:33.840
Yeah.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.640
So if you're going to do this, do it early on before you get a lot of stuff set up in

19:36.640 --> 19:37.640
Chrome OS.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.360
Well, Chrome OS is not so bad in most cases.

19:39.360 --> 19:40.360
No.

19:40.360 --> 19:41.360
Yeah.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.360
Most of your stuff will repopulate pretty quickly.

19:42.360 --> 19:43.360
So that's not a big deal.

19:43.360 --> 19:51.440
But once you have it going, it's as simple as once you have run the Crouton script to

19:51.440 --> 19:57.920
install whichever distribution you want or whichever desktop environment you want, then

19:57.920 --> 20:01.760
it provides you with a handy dandy little shell script that you can run to just start

20:01.760 --> 20:02.760
it up.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.840
So if I can get this on the thing there.

20:05.840 --> 20:06.840
On the thing.

20:06.840 --> 20:07.840
All right.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.840
So you're in Chrome OS.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.440
And now you're running, is it booting right now?

20:12.440 --> 20:14.280
Wait for it.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.280
There it is.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.280
There's a boot too.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.280
And there we go.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.280
I recognize Unity.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.280
Yep.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.160
And I chose Unity because I wanted to see how it worked with the touch screen.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.160
Yeah.

20:23.160 --> 20:24.160
And how's it been?

20:24.160 --> 20:25.160
Yeah.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.160
So it's been really good.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.160
Good.

20:27.160 --> 20:31.400
I've been able to quickly launch things with a touch.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.160
And then, you know, I've been really impressed with the responsiveness.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.160
The way...

20:35.160 --> 20:37.320
I was really shocked that the touch screen worked at all.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.840
I was kind of just imagining that that's probably not gonna happen.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.640
And I hopped over into it, and everything's been working.

20:43.640 --> 20:47.320
I was just demoing, also running some applications in Wine.

20:47.320 --> 20:54.040
So to me, I've got three different operating systems kind of working in tandem there.

20:54.040 --> 20:56.880
You know, one of the things that kind of struck me, I don't know if you...

20:56.880 --> 20:57.880
Did you catch it?

20:57.880 --> 21:00.960
We had a few people show up at the booth that were using touch screen machines.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.080
I actually noticed that.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.080
I was wondering if other folks caught on to that as well.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.080
It seems like a trend.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.080
Yeah.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.080
I don't know.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.080
I didn't see...

21:08.080 --> 21:09.080
I saw a lot of tablets.

21:09.080 --> 21:10.080
But I mean, I saw like Chromebooks.

21:10.080 --> 21:13.200
And I know, Eric in here, you brought your laptop that has a touch screen.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.560
You use Unity too, don't you?

21:14.560 --> 21:16.720
Yes, I do, for that very reason.

21:16.720 --> 21:17.720
Yeah.

21:17.720 --> 21:20.760
That seemed to be everybody that brought up to the booth that was using touch was using

21:20.760 --> 21:21.760
Unity.

21:21.760 --> 21:22.760
Almost universally on a laptop.

21:22.760 --> 21:27.120
Well, it only makes sense because really, in KDE, it doesn't have very good touch screen

21:27.120 --> 21:28.120
support.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.640
In fact, it even keeps the cursor wherever you touch it.

21:31.640 --> 21:34.100
Have you tried the Plasma Active interface?

21:34.100 --> 21:35.100
You know what?

21:35.100 --> 21:38.200
There's nothing really working with Plasma Active yet.

21:38.200 --> 21:42.780
You still have to compile it from source in most cases.

21:42.780 --> 21:44.040
So there's that.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.400
And then I tried Gnome.

21:46.400 --> 21:54.560
And Gnome is not as easy to resize windows or even move windows as it is in Unity.

21:54.560 --> 21:58.060
For instance, you can't drag it by the title bar in Gnome for some reason.

21:58.060 --> 22:00.440
I don't even know why that is.

22:00.440 --> 22:03.440
You think with those big client-side decorations, it may be easy to grab.

22:03.440 --> 22:04.440
Exactly.

22:04.440 --> 22:05.440
It's not.

22:05.440 --> 22:06.440
Exactly.

22:06.440 --> 22:07.440
I can't do it.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.040
I just put my finger on it.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.720
I try swiping that thing over.

22:10.720 --> 22:11.720
It won't do it.

22:11.720 --> 22:12.720
Yeah.

22:12.720 --> 22:13.720
It doesn't follow my finger.

22:13.720 --> 22:14.720
Yeah.

22:14.720 --> 22:15.720
All right.

22:15.720 --> 22:16.720
All right.

22:16.720 --> 22:17.720
I don't know if it's a trend.

22:17.720 --> 22:20.440
I don't know if I'm ready to call it a trend, but it definitely was an observation I made

22:20.440 --> 22:22.680
that seemed like people are taking to touch.

22:22.680 --> 22:27.300
And I think what it is is so many of these Windows 8 laptops have shipped now with touch

22:27.300 --> 22:30.840
support and people are buying those and loading Linux on them.

22:30.840 --> 22:34.680
There's vendors like System76 also that sell touch.

22:34.680 --> 22:37.160
And it's happening.

22:37.160 --> 22:38.160
It's happening.

22:38.160 --> 22:43.400
Speaking of something that's happening, our second sponsor this week is absolutely happening.

22:43.400 --> 22:44.780
That is DigitalOcean.

22:44.780 --> 22:48.560
Go over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code UNPLUGGEDAPRIL.

22:48.560 --> 22:51.480
It's going to work for a little bit longer, getting close to the end here.

22:51.480 --> 22:54.680
But wouldn't it be great to give us a little boost towards the end of April and here's

22:54.680 --> 22:55.680
why you want to do it.

22:55.680 --> 23:01.520
You'll get a $5 credit or a $10 credit, which is great when you get the $5 rig, which, do

23:01.520 --> 23:04.880
the math there, that's two months for free when you use our special promo code UNPLUGGEDAPRIL.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.640
So what is DigitalOcean?

23:06.640 --> 23:10.200
DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

23:10.200 --> 23:12.240
to spin up a cloud server.

23:12.240 --> 23:15.800
Folks in our audience have gotten these things up and running in 40 seconds, 47 seconds.

23:15.800 --> 23:19.800
Most folks, and don't be ashamed if you're one of them, 55 seconds.

23:19.800 --> 23:25.280
And pricing plans start at only $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD,

23:25.280 --> 23:28.800
which is awesome, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

23:28.800 --> 23:32.800
And the best part is that DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco,

23:32.800 --> 23:36.140
Amsterdam, Singapore, you name it, you can put a rig there.

23:36.140 --> 23:37.280
The interface is simple.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.360
The control panel is super intuitive.

23:39.360 --> 23:43.000
The power users can replicate it on a larger scale with their straightforward API.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.280
You might want to check this out because over on the DigitalOcean website, over at digitalocean.com,

23:47.280 --> 23:51.660
click on the community tab, and then go look at view projects.

23:51.660 --> 23:57.120
These are community projects that some of them are using this DigitalOcean API to really

23:57.120 --> 23:59.080
provide some great functionality.

23:59.080 --> 24:04.160
On Sunday, I talked about an application that ties in with the Ubuntu to manage your droplets,

24:04.160 --> 24:08.240
to turn them on, turn them off, check their IP, their OS status, things like that.

24:08.240 --> 24:15.880
And then almost, I think it was Monday, there was one out now for the Mac.

24:15.880 --> 24:19.540
People are really kind of rallying around DigitalOcean and it makes sense because they've

24:19.540 --> 24:22.560
been investing in SSDs for a long time and there's a reason.

24:22.560 --> 24:27.280
You just get better performance, higher density when they pair it with tier one bandwidth

24:27.280 --> 24:30.880
and the data centers all over the world, they've all been hand chosen by DigitalOcean to be

24:30.880 --> 24:32.000
really excellent.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.880
So go over to digitalocean.com and check them out and see why so many folks are using DigitalOcean,

24:36.880 --> 24:42.000
not just for projects and learning like lots of our audience does, but also for hosting

24:42.000 --> 24:45.520
the back end infrastructure for their critical applications.

24:45.520 --> 24:50.920
DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code unpluggedapril and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

24:50.920 --> 24:53.880
Linux Unplugged.

24:53.880 --> 24:56.000
So let's go back to the Linux Fest Northwest coverage.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.360
One of our very own was there, Brian2040 from the chat room and he had a booth to talk about

25:00.360 --> 25:03.120
his distribution which has recently sort of changed course.

25:03.120 --> 25:08.320
We're here with Brian from the DescentOS project, most people in the Jupiter Broadcasting community

25:08.320 --> 25:10.480
are going to know him as Brian2040.

25:10.480 --> 25:12.440
Mr. Brian2040, how are you doing today?

25:12.440 --> 25:13.920
I'm doing pretty good.

25:13.920 --> 25:19.280
Tell me a little bit about what DescentOS is and what you can do with it.

25:19.280 --> 25:24.440
Mainly what DescentOS is, currently it's a Debian based distribution that actually

25:24.440 --> 25:26.400
stands on the desktop.

25:26.400 --> 25:31.280
We are in development of the 5 release right now where it is actually more for general

25:31.280 --> 25:36.600
usage, that means you can use it for desktop servers, embedded systems and everything like

25:36.600 --> 25:41.440
that and it's totally independent but right now what we're doing is mainly just going

25:41.440 --> 25:48.400
out there with the desktop version and say hey, we're back, we've got this new version

25:48.400 --> 25:53.360
of our 4.0 system out here which I actually released last year, on this day last year

25:53.360 --> 26:03.640
and basically what we're doing is hey, it's back, let's see what we can do with this.

26:03.640 --> 26:07.880
So you were telling me a little bit earlier that you are looking to push DescentOS more

26:07.880 --> 26:13.040
into the embedded space and primarily focus on the embedded space.

26:13.040 --> 26:21.500
How is the development of the embedded spin of your distro coming as opposed to the desktop

26:21.500 --> 26:23.480
one that we see here on the laptop?

26:23.480 --> 26:24.480
It's going pretty well.

26:24.480 --> 26:28.240
Embedded is a whole other monster pretty much.

26:28.240 --> 26:32.080
We're bringing support for the BagelBone Black initially.

26:32.080 --> 26:35.720
We might end up bringing it to the Raspberry Pi right now but right now it's mainly for

26:35.720 --> 26:37.720
ARMv7 not for ARMv6.

26:37.720 --> 26:42.040
And if people wanted to find more information about DescentOS or what you guys are doing,

26:42.040 --> 26:43.760
where could they go?

26:43.760 --> 26:45.680
You could always email me.

26:45.680 --> 26:51.840
My email is brian at descentos.org with no pipe in there and that's probably the best

26:51.840 --> 26:53.600
way to get information from me right now.

26:53.600 --> 26:56.260
We're bringing our site back up.

26:56.260 --> 26:57.800
That would be at descentos.org.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.580
We're bringing that up Monday.

26:59.580 --> 27:03.240
So Tyler, you've been working on, you were there with Brian at the booth.

27:03.240 --> 27:06.200
So what kind of big changes does he have coming to DescentOS because it sounds like he's got

27:06.200 --> 27:08.000
a few ideas in mind.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.880
I would say the biggest change that he does have coming up is going to be the package

27:11.880 --> 27:17.400
manager he's going to be including in DescentOS 5 because it's not going to be based on anything

27:17.400 --> 27:18.400
else.

27:18.400 --> 27:24.480
It's called HPM which is a hybrid package manager that will do both binaries and compile

27:24.480 --> 27:25.480
from source.

27:25.480 --> 27:26.480
Oh.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.480
Oh wow.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.480
HPM.

27:28.480 --> 27:32.080
So yeah, we'll get him in here soon to talk more about that because they've got a whole

27:32.080 --> 27:35.860
new idea, a whole new approach that sounds pretty awesome.

27:35.860 --> 27:41.200
So that was DescentOS and I think they're going to be hitting sort of that sysadmin

27:41.200 --> 27:45.320
sweet spot if they keep on their current path from what I talked to them about it at LinuxFest.

27:45.320 --> 27:49.320
All right, so we got a chance to talk with the folks from Firefox and I believe this

27:49.320 --> 27:50.320
was Ben.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.320
Hello, Ben.

27:51.320 --> 27:52.320
There he is.

27:52.320 --> 28:01.160
Can you tell me a little bit about what the Mozilla Corporation is up to right now?

28:01.160 --> 28:03.780
Yeah, we're doing a lot of things.

28:03.780 --> 28:05.080
We're focusing on mobile a lot.

28:05.080 --> 28:08.880
So we have a device coming out with an operating system that we've developed called Firefox

28:08.880 --> 28:09.880
OS.

28:09.880 --> 28:13.240
And with it, we're trying to bring, we're trying to kind of close the digital divide

28:13.240 --> 28:17.000
a bit and bring smartphones to emerging markets.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.120
So a lot of emerging markets are still using feature phones if the people who are lucky

28:21.120 --> 28:22.880
enough to have them.

28:22.880 --> 28:27.320
And we think that we can improve quality of life quite a bit for people if we bring them

28:27.320 --> 28:29.560
from a feature phone to a smartphone.

28:29.560 --> 28:33.040
And to that end, we do a lot of things like we're developing things and we're getting

28:33.040 --> 28:35.680
feedback from a lot of the people in these countries.

28:35.680 --> 28:39.120
So we've talked to some people in Argentina and we figured out that they really use FM

28:39.120 --> 28:42.600
radio a lot on their phone and they rely on that as their main radio and they use that

28:42.600 --> 28:43.920
a lot for communication.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.480
And they might not necessarily have a computer.

28:45.480 --> 28:51.280
So they need a lot of these features in phones that a lot of other markets don't have, like

28:51.280 --> 28:55.540
sharing pictures over Bluetooth with their friends.

28:55.540 --> 28:59.200
And so we're focusing on lower-end hardware.

28:59.200 --> 29:03.680
So most people in these markets can't afford a $400 smartphone or something like that,

29:03.680 --> 29:05.620
but they can afford a $25 smartphone.

29:05.620 --> 29:09.040
So we have a $25 smartphone coming out geared for them.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.040
It's not stripped down.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.680
It still has a touch screen.

29:11.680 --> 29:15.280
It'll still have a full smartphone experience.

29:15.280 --> 29:18.240
It'll just be at a lower price point that people can actually afford.

29:18.240 --> 29:22.280
That sounds outstanding and I think that really does fill a niche market.

29:22.280 --> 29:28.200
If budget constraints weren't an issue and I was looking for a platform that was a little

29:28.200 --> 29:35.200
bit less locked down than say, for example, Android, which is called Linux, but is it

29:35.200 --> 29:38.360
really open source, a Linux operating system?

29:38.360 --> 29:40.960
Is there something that Firefox OS can offer me that way?

29:40.960 --> 29:42.140
Yes, definitely.

29:42.140 --> 29:43.760
All of the development happens in the open.

29:43.760 --> 29:44.760
You can go on GitHub.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.800
You can watch our development.

29:46.800 --> 29:50.060
And I mean, beyond that, it's a lot more open in that we actually interact with community

29:50.060 --> 29:53.880
and you can see all of these things that happen as they happen and as such, it's a much more

29:53.880 --> 29:55.560
open platform.

29:55.560 --> 30:03.840
Now I know a big concern is the applications that run on the phone.

30:03.840 --> 30:10.520
Is the Mozilla OS at a very locked down app store and if I buy my apps on Mozilla Firefox

30:10.520 --> 30:13.400
OS, is that something I'm not going to be able to run on any other phone?

30:13.400 --> 30:14.680
No, absolutely not.

30:14.680 --> 30:15.760
That's not something we want.

30:15.760 --> 30:19.120
And so we actually created a standard.

30:19.120 --> 30:25.320
So all of the things, create apps for Firefox OS are now part of the upstream standards

30:25.320 --> 30:28.660
that they use like JavaScript and programming languages, things like that.

30:28.660 --> 30:35.080
And so you can actually write apps that are web apps and they have access to things like

30:35.080 --> 30:39.160
hardware so you can write a web app to use your camera and you can write a web app to

30:39.160 --> 30:41.280
make phone calls, things like that.

30:41.280 --> 30:44.760
And these are also compatible with a desktop and they're compatible with other operating

30:44.760 --> 30:50.860
systems like Ubuntu have said that they're going to be fully supporting Firefox OS apps,

30:50.860 --> 30:51.860
for example.

30:51.860 --> 30:55.660
So when you write an app, you can run it in many places.

30:55.660 --> 30:59.360
Because they're web apps, wouldn't they technically work on any device that has a web browser?

30:59.360 --> 31:00.360
Absolutely.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.200
So you can actually share a lot of assets.

31:02.200 --> 31:05.960
Obviously like a desktop browser is going to have a much bigger screen so you have a

31:05.960 --> 31:09.600
different layout but you can reuse a lot of the same resources for that.

31:09.600 --> 31:10.600
Outstanding.

31:10.600 --> 31:11.600
Well, thank you so much.

31:11.600 --> 31:15.040
And if somebody was interested in learning more about Firefox OS or if they wanted to

31:15.040 --> 31:21.520
make a donation to the Mozilla organization, where would they go to find more information?

31:21.520 --> 31:23.680
Mozilla.org is going to be a great resource on there.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.040
It should have everything you need.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.040
It's very intuitive.

31:26.040 --> 31:27.040
Sounds good.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.040
Well, thank you very much for your time.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.040
We really appreciate having you.

31:29.040 --> 31:30.840
Man, didn't Noah do a great job?

31:30.840 --> 31:31.840
He really did.

31:31.840 --> 31:32.840
Yes, he sure did.

31:32.840 --> 31:37.120
I thought that guy's answer regarding web apps where he said everybody knows the benefit

31:37.120 --> 31:41.520
to web apps if you can make it truly integrate at the OS level but still then also have something

31:41.520 --> 31:45.600
that works in the web browser, that really would be sweet because the thing about it

31:45.600 --> 31:50.400
from a lazy developer standpoint, that really saves them a lot of time.

31:50.400 --> 31:54.520
So I don't know, he says it can access the camera and all that good stuff.

31:54.520 --> 31:56.200
Web apps are getting pretty good.

31:56.200 --> 32:01.760
Maybe Firefox OS, whatever it's going to be called, has a shot.

32:01.760 --> 32:05.040
I'm looking forward to at least getting something to play with it.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.200
Personally speaking, I think if we can find an audience, because I see this as like the

32:08.200 --> 32:14.080
perfect entry level, you know, virgin smartphone people type individuals that are looking to

32:14.080 --> 32:16.640
kind of pop their chair and get into this realm.

32:16.640 --> 32:17.840
My mom is a great example.

32:17.840 --> 32:20.520
You couldn't get her to use a smartphone to save her life.

32:20.520 --> 32:24.260
But something like that where it has a reasonable barrier to entry, especially at that price

32:24.260 --> 32:26.360
point, that doesn't sound so scary.

32:26.360 --> 32:27.360
What about Alan?

32:27.360 --> 32:28.360
What about you?

32:28.360 --> 32:31.920
I mean, you have a Nexus S, so you're not totally, you obviously don't feel the pinch

32:31.920 --> 32:35.920
to have like the most crazy high-end smartphone, and I don't think you have too many apps on

32:35.920 --> 32:36.920
there.

32:36.920 --> 32:41.320
Would you consider a Firefox OS phone if it did calls, texting, email, and you know, maybe

32:41.320 --> 32:42.800
Twitter and stuff like that?

32:42.800 --> 32:45.040
I don't think he's there.

32:45.040 --> 32:46.200
Well, that's too bad.

32:46.200 --> 32:50.240
I'd be really curious because Alan's basically got one phone like at the start of TechSnap

32:50.240 --> 32:51.240
and he's used the same phone.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.240
Meanwhile, I've had like six phones.

32:52.240 --> 32:53.240
I'm crazy.

32:53.240 --> 32:54.240
This is true.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.080
He's an individual when it comes to stuff, and I think he's really kind of got a system

32:57.080 --> 32:59.520
that works for him, and he's probably just going to stick to that.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.360
Yeah, and I think you probably nailed it.

33:02.360 --> 33:04.000
I could see also a class of geeks out there.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.680
I think there's a lot of geeks that walk around with a feature phone, a lot more than

33:07.680 --> 33:08.680
we suspect.

33:08.680 --> 33:09.680
Oh, yeah.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.160
Especially with like tablets, like you can get something like the Nexus 7 that fits in

33:12.160 --> 33:16.240
your pocket anyways, and then if you just have a feature phone to make phone calls and

33:16.240 --> 33:20.080
send a few text, quick text messages, no big deal.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.080
I think there's...

33:21.080 --> 33:22.080
Go ahead, Tyler.

33:22.080 --> 33:26.360
I was saying, as somebody who currently has a Galaxy Nexus and wanting to look for something

33:26.360 --> 33:32.120
more powerful, I think something like a Boon 2 phone would speak more to me than Firefox

33:32.120 --> 33:33.120
OS.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.120
Yeah.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.120
What do you think, Matt?

33:35.120 --> 33:37.080
Boy, that's a tough one.

33:37.080 --> 33:42.280
Trying to draw the comparables between a Boon 2 phone and Firefox.

33:42.280 --> 33:46.000
I would need to spend some real quality time between the two devices because I think they

33:46.000 --> 33:47.680
definitely scratch different edges.

33:47.680 --> 33:53.480
I think as far as usability, I've actually had my hands on more frequently with a Firefox

33:53.480 --> 33:56.840
phone and I would say that it seems like it's a very straightforward experience.

33:56.840 --> 34:00.880
The Boon 2 phone is constantly developing and evolving, so I would need to see how that

34:00.880 --> 34:03.800
really turns out in the long haul before I could really make that direct comparison.

34:03.800 --> 34:04.800
Yeah.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.200
And it's always, you know, it depends on can it run what you want.

34:07.200 --> 34:08.200
Right.

34:08.200 --> 34:09.200
And for some people, that's a...

34:09.200 --> 34:13.160
Like you just point out, that list is smaller and for other people, that list is longer.

34:13.160 --> 34:14.160
I think so.

34:14.160 --> 34:17.640
I think the other thing to really consider too is that I think potentially they will

34:17.640 --> 34:20.040
be tapping into much of the same market.

34:20.040 --> 34:23.200
I think they'll be tapping into much of the same type of user.

34:23.200 --> 34:24.200
People that just want...

34:24.200 --> 34:26.920
Look, they want a smartphone, but then at the same time, they don't necessarily need

34:26.920 --> 34:27.920
an Android market.

34:27.920 --> 34:29.160
They don't necessarily care about that other stuff.

34:29.160 --> 34:32.800
I mean, Firefox seems like it has a bit of a head start right now, but if Ubuntu starts

34:32.800 --> 34:38.320
with a good splash, they'll essentially be in the same spot, kind of going for the same

34:38.320 --> 34:39.320
customer.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.320
All right.

34:40.320 --> 34:43.280
Well, so we also had a chance to chat with Seth from the EFF.

34:43.280 --> 34:47.080
We're here with Seth from the EFF, and Seth, how are you doing today?

34:47.080 --> 34:48.080
Doing great.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.080
How are you?

34:49.080 --> 34:50.080
Excellent.

34:50.080 --> 34:53.840
Can you tell me a little bit about what the EFF is and what you aim to do?

34:53.840 --> 34:54.840
Sure.

34:54.840 --> 34:59.280
EFF is a non-profit, member-supported organization based in San Francisco.

34:59.280 --> 35:05.600
We've been around for about 25 years, and we're the foremost organization promoting

35:05.600 --> 35:07.560
individual rights online.

35:07.560 --> 35:14.360
So we have lawyers, we have technologists like myself, we have activists, and we work

35:14.360 --> 35:19.100
in the courts, we work in Congress, and we work with technology, explaining how things

35:19.100 --> 35:23.640
work and trying to protect people's individual rights, like free expression and privacy,

35:23.640 --> 35:25.560
in the context of technology.

35:25.560 --> 35:32.000
Now how has maybe your role changed, or maybe not your role, how has the relevance and importance

35:32.000 --> 35:36.800
of your organization changed since the revelation of Edward Snowden?

35:36.800 --> 35:42.540
I would say we've gotten a lot more public attention to our work on surveillance issues

35:42.540 --> 35:44.220
in particular.

35:44.220 --> 35:47.400
And electronic communication surveillance is one of the core issues that we've worked

35:47.400 --> 35:49.480
on and that we've always worked on.

35:49.480 --> 35:54.720
So we were already, in fact, suing NSA over electronic communication surveillance, over

35:54.720 --> 35:59.840
mass surveillance, years ago, starting back in 2005.

35:59.840 --> 36:04.880
And so the Snowden revelations have certainly brought a lot of attention to our work in

36:04.880 --> 36:07.400
the courts and our work in Congress.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.640
Our membership is way up.

36:08.640 --> 36:11.880
We're hearing from people all the time that they really care about what we do, that they

36:11.880 --> 36:13.920
really care about the fight against mass surveillance.

36:13.920 --> 36:17.240
Now I know you told me when we started that you're a little short on time, but if I can

36:17.240 --> 36:22.080
ask you real quickly, if somebody was interested in supporting the EFF or getting more information

36:22.080 --> 36:24.840
about the EFF, where could they go to reach out to you?

36:24.840 --> 36:30.000
Well the best place is our website at EFF.org for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Thank you so much for your time.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.200
Yeah, I don't know how much traffic they got, but I thought it was pretty cool that they

36:34.200 --> 36:35.320
were there.

36:35.320 --> 36:40.620
And Noah's question about, how's it been since Snowden was a good one?

36:40.620 --> 36:41.880
That was an excellent question.

36:41.880 --> 36:45.520
And I think that, no question, well it's really telling if you stop and think about it.

36:45.520 --> 36:50.480
He mentioned that they've already been in the process of addressing the whole NSA thing

36:50.480 --> 36:51.480
previously.

36:51.480 --> 36:54.720
I honestly didn't see much of that in the news until the Snowden stuff happened.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.640
I mean, all of a sudden everybody cares.

36:56.640 --> 36:59.160
Everybody in the mainstream media suddenly cares at that point.

36:59.160 --> 37:04.040
Previous to that, eh, you know, honestly, most people didn't, and that's sad.

37:04.040 --> 37:07.040
So that's, we'll call it there for the clips from Linux Fest Northwest.

37:07.040 --> 37:10.040
If you didn't catch the Linux action show, be sure, it's worth the watch just for the

37:10.040 --> 37:13.800
chat with John Mad Dog Hall, but there's also a bunch of other great chats in there too.

37:13.800 --> 37:20.760
So go watch episode 310 of the Linux action show if you haven't yet, and hopefully you'll

37:20.760 --> 37:21.760
get a chance.

37:21.760 --> 37:25.400
All right Mumbo, before we wrap up today, did anybody want to share any thoughts or

37:25.400 --> 37:28.760
experiences from Linux Fest Northwest that made it this week?

37:28.760 --> 37:33.640
I was thinking in the EFF clips, a funny story, I actually took one of the papers from the

37:33.640 --> 37:40.320
EFF booth to use as a mouse pad because those tables sucked for a surface for using an optical

37:40.320 --> 37:41.320
mouse.

37:41.320 --> 37:45.480
That is not what I expected as an observation at all.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.320
But it is a factual observation, not what we're going for.

37:48.320 --> 37:49.320
Yeah.

37:49.320 --> 37:50.320
All right.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.320
Anybody else that want to chime in on their thoughts?

37:51.320 --> 37:52.320
Go ahead, Poppy.

37:52.320 --> 37:56.440
Yeah, Chris, as someone who was watching remotely, I thought you did a great job of keeping your

37:56.440 --> 38:00.120
stream going and keeping people entertained remotely.

38:00.120 --> 38:01.440
Oh, thank you, sir.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.440
Good.

38:02.440 --> 38:03.440
I'm glad.

38:03.440 --> 38:06.840
So we basically started when the show floor opened, and we wrapped when it ended.

38:06.840 --> 38:12.440
And then first night, we went out and got a whole bunch of pizza, although I wasn't

38:12.440 --> 38:14.860
going to eat any of the pizza because it would have screwed me up.

38:14.860 --> 38:18.680
So I had a salad bar, and I asked the guy, I'm like, so how's your salad bar?

38:18.680 --> 38:20.480
And he's like, it's OK.

38:20.480 --> 38:21.480
Take the salad bar.

38:21.480 --> 38:22.480
And I'm like, really?

38:22.480 --> 38:23.480
Wow.

38:23.480 --> 38:25.920
And Alan's standing right there, and Alan's like, get the salad bar, Chris.

38:25.920 --> 38:28.800
And I'm like, well, is it a bad salad bar, man?

38:28.800 --> 38:33.360
And so then Alex, who walks over to the salad bar, and he's kind of surveying it, and he

38:33.360 --> 38:36.120
looks over at me, and he shakes his head and gives me the thumbs down sign.

38:36.120 --> 38:38.280
I'm like, man, I'm getting some advice here.

38:38.280 --> 38:41.120
The salad bar is no good, and you're not selling me very much on the salad bar.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.400
And he looks at me and goes, what?

38:42.400 --> 38:43.400
No.

38:43.400 --> 38:44.400
No, it's a good salad bar.

38:44.400 --> 38:45.400
It's fine.

38:45.400 --> 38:46.400
The salad bar is fine.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.400
Really.

38:47.400 --> 38:48.400
I got the salad bar.

38:48.400 --> 38:49.400
And you know what?

38:49.400 --> 38:50.400
It was fine.

38:50.400 --> 38:51.400
It was not that bad.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.400
And now I'm glad I didn't go for any food.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.400
Yeah.

38:53.400 --> 38:54.400
Oh, yeah.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.400
Yeah.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.400
I don't know.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.400
The ultimate pizza was pretty good.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.400
Yeah.

38:58.400 --> 39:02.200
Yeah, I was with Brian in 2014, and after the show at the museum, we went over to that

39:02.200 --> 39:03.840
Bayou restaurant down the street.

39:03.840 --> 39:04.840
How was that?

39:04.840 --> 39:05.840
It was pretty good.

39:05.840 --> 39:06.840
Yeah?

39:06.840 --> 39:07.840
Yeah.

39:07.840 --> 39:08.840
Yeah, that smelled delicious.

39:08.840 --> 39:09.840
Oh, my gosh.

39:09.840 --> 39:12.840
So there was a Cajun restaurant next to the Spark Museum where we went for the after-party,

39:12.840 --> 39:15.880
and they're one of these guys, they're brilliant, Matt.

39:15.880 --> 39:21.080
They put the smokestack on the outside of the building right there on the sidewalk,

39:21.080 --> 39:25.200
so they're just like, as they're Cajun cooking, the smell from the grill is just going right

39:25.200 --> 39:26.200
out into the street.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.200
It smelled wonderful.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.200
Oh, my gosh.

39:28.200 --> 39:32.320
The restaurants have a knack for really nailing it out of the park, and it's one thing I've

39:32.320 --> 39:33.840
noticed, and that's a great example of it.

39:33.840 --> 39:37.480
Yeah, it was like we were all standing in line like, oh, my gosh, that smells so good.

39:37.480 --> 39:41.200
So the guy behind me, literally, I was saying that like a dozen times, the guy behind me

39:41.200 --> 39:43.200
says, yeah, we just went in.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.240
It was like, they're super fast.

39:45.240 --> 39:48.520
So we went in there, we got some Cajun food real quick, we got some jambalaya, and then

39:48.520 --> 39:51.200
we came back in line, and we just lost like 10 spots in line, no big deal.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.960
I'm like, oh, that's interesting.

39:52.960 --> 39:58.080
And then I get in the Spark Museum, and the Cajun place comes up because it smells delicious,

39:58.080 --> 40:01.040
and people are like, yeah, I just jumped out of line and went in.

40:01.040 --> 40:02.040
They're really quick.

40:02.040 --> 40:03.160
And I just lost like a few spots in line.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.160
It was totally worth it.

40:04.160 --> 40:05.160
And then I'm like, oh, that's funny.

40:05.160 --> 40:06.160
Somebody else says to me.

40:06.160 --> 40:09.760
And then another guy walks up and says the same thing.

40:09.760 --> 40:10.760
So it worked.

40:10.760 --> 40:11.760
It made some money that night.

40:11.760 --> 40:12.760
That was pretty cool.

40:12.760 --> 40:17.080
The Spark Museum was really packed, but I felt like a sardine.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.440
Isn't there some cool old tech in there, though?

40:19.440 --> 40:21.280
It's amazing how far it's gone.

40:21.280 --> 40:25.280
Watching a whole group of people try to figure out how to run that old cash register is funny.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.280
Oh, that was awesome.

40:26.280 --> 40:27.280
That was hilarious.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.800
I've never played Pokemon in real life.

40:28.800 --> 40:32.440
Yeah, and I tried to play Star Trek on the, what's that thing called that I tried to play

40:32.440 --> 40:33.440
it on?

40:33.440 --> 40:34.440
Theremin.

40:34.440 --> 40:35.440
Theremin.

40:35.440 --> 40:36.440
But I failed miserably.

40:36.440 --> 40:39.440
Because you're trying to play TNG on the TOS instrument.

40:39.440 --> 40:40.440
Yeah.

40:40.440 --> 40:43.600
I thought of a Star Trek tune, and TNG came to mind, because TNG's awesome.

40:43.600 --> 40:44.600
Right.

40:44.600 --> 40:45.600
Right.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.800
But I think the best part was just getting to meet a bunch of these people in person,

40:47.800 --> 40:53.400
like Blaster, and Eric, and Fate, and Q5, and not Tyler.

40:53.400 --> 40:56.480
Yeah, that was a really cool part.

40:56.480 --> 41:00.000
And I mean, Matt, how awesome was our crew?

41:00.000 --> 41:01.560
Oh, it was amazing.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.280
Not only did we have all these great guys coming from all over the country, and even

41:04.280 --> 41:08.480
from other countries, as Alan will attest to, but also our crew was just fantastic.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.760
They literally enabled us to make this happen.

41:10.760 --> 41:11.760
It was awesome.

41:11.760 --> 41:12.760
Yeah.

41:12.760 --> 41:15.960
I mean, it was like everybody just got to work and did their part.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.240
Nobody was just slacking off.

41:17.240 --> 41:20.720
Everybody had a job, and they found it naturally, and they just dug in and made sure it got

41:20.720 --> 41:21.760
it done.

41:21.760 --> 41:26.000
And Chase tore down his whole studio, his whole production setup.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.520
Put it all in a bunch of bags, and then drove it up to Bellingham.

41:29.520 --> 41:34.560
And then at the end of it all, Sunday night, I go back to his house late after we had a

41:34.560 --> 41:38.680
little after-party here at the studio, and now he's got to hook all that stuff back up

41:38.680 --> 41:39.880
before he can do shows.

41:39.880 --> 41:40.880
So I really appreciate that.

41:40.880 --> 41:43.280
Yeah, I was going to say, I hope he brought up the quality of the stream.

41:43.280 --> 41:47.880
I was going to say something, if you didn't, that Chase deserves a shout-out, because I

41:47.880 --> 41:49.880
think he really made this possible.

41:49.880 --> 41:50.880
Yeah.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.760
And his Wirecast mastery is serious coming through.

41:53.760 --> 41:54.760
Yeah, he's got some serious food.

41:54.760 --> 41:55.760
He knows what he's doing with that thing.

41:55.760 --> 42:00.120
Yeah, and he had all the lower thirds we used in the live stream, he just kind of made up

42:00.120 --> 42:01.800
on the fly as he grabbed assets.

42:01.800 --> 42:04.240
He pulled the last logo from the subreddit.

42:04.240 --> 42:05.520
He just went and found it.

42:05.520 --> 42:06.520
So I loved lower thirds.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.760
I thought that was something you threw together, but he did that?

42:08.760 --> 42:11.960
He did it Friday night as we were setting up the booth.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.960
Yeah, I was sitting right next to him when he was doing that.

42:14.960 --> 42:16.920
It was just like, boom, boom, boom.

42:16.920 --> 42:20.040
It was like, I could not believe how fast he was getting it done.

42:20.040 --> 42:23.120
The funny part is he was actually annoyed by something he did, and he fixed it during

42:23.120 --> 42:24.120
the live stream.

42:24.120 --> 42:27.440
He was just like, I don't like this, I'm going to fix it.

42:27.440 --> 42:28.440
That's exactly what he did too.

42:28.440 --> 42:29.440
He just...

42:29.440 --> 42:30.440
Yeah.

42:30.440 --> 42:31.440
It was great for me.

42:31.440 --> 42:32.440
It looks familiar in the chat room.

42:32.440 --> 42:33.640
It says, I had no idea Chase was so amazing.

42:33.640 --> 42:35.880
Neither did I, but now I do.

42:35.880 --> 42:39.120
I had an idea, but not...

42:39.120 --> 42:40.120
He blew me away.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.120
It wasn't confirmed.

42:41.120 --> 42:42.120
Yeah, exactly.

42:42.120 --> 42:47.440
I decided, I was pretty sure I wasn't going to tear down the studio after we just moved

42:47.440 --> 42:48.440
in.

42:48.440 --> 42:50.420
So I was like, if we didn't do that, I didn't know what we were going to do, maybe laptops

42:50.420 --> 42:51.420
and microphones.

42:51.420 --> 42:53.160
It was way beyond what we would have gotten.

42:53.160 --> 42:55.000
The next year, now we know.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.400
Now we know we're going to go whole hog every year now, because that was just great.

42:58.400 --> 43:01.240
And if we have a crew like that again, assuming to enable us to be able to do it, we'll do

43:01.240 --> 43:02.240
it.

43:02.240 --> 43:03.240
So make your plans, people.

43:03.240 --> 43:04.240
Probably have more.

43:04.240 --> 43:05.240
Just the parallels.

43:05.240 --> 43:09.180
I mean, it's like having that managed, having Chase master that entire setup so that we

43:09.180 --> 43:10.680
could do what we needed to do was just...

43:10.680 --> 43:11.680
Yeah, let us focus on our stuff.

43:11.680 --> 43:12.680
Oh my God.

43:12.680 --> 43:13.680
It was awesome.

43:13.680 --> 43:14.680
Yeah.

43:14.680 --> 43:15.680
Yep.

43:15.680 --> 43:16.680
Absolutely.

43:16.680 --> 43:17.680
It was super cool.

43:17.680 --> 43:19.200
Plus, that's where Chase in your face was born.

43:19.200 --> 43:20.200
Yes.

43:20.200 --> 43:23.760
He was sure excited about that.

43:23.760 --> 43:24.760
What is the website?

43:24.760 --> 43:25.760
Chaseinyourface.tk.

43:25.760 --> 43:26.760
Chaseinyourface.tk.

43:26.760 --> 43:27.760
Chaseinyourface.tk.

43:27.760 --> 43:28.760
Chaseinyourface.tk.

43:28.760 --> 43:29.760
Chaseinyourface.tk.

43:29.760 --> 43:30.760
Yeah.

43:30.760 --> 43:31.760
He's like, you guys couldn't even do a.com?

43:31.760 --> 43:32.760
I mean, like, really?

43:32.760 --> 43:33.760
I was like, no.

43:33.760 --> 43:36.760
He was just like, I mean, if you're going to do that, I was like, we're just going to

43:36.760 --> 43:37.760
do it.

43:37.760 --> 43:38.760
We have all these GoDaddy codes.

43:38.760 --> 43:39.760
Yeah.

43:39.760 --> 43:40.760
There you go.

43:40.760 --> 43:41.760
Yeah.

43:41.760 --> 43:42.760
Get them for a good deal, right?

43:42.760 --> 43:43.760
Yeah.

43:43.760 --> 43:50.880
But I think, too, I really wish more industry people who run these events would come to

43:50.880 --> 43:52.200
this kind of event to see it.

43:52.200 --> 43:56.640
Because you could take some of this format and apply it to other types of fest or cons

43:56.640 --> 43:57.920
or whatever they are.

43:57.920 --> 43:59.880
And I think there would be some winning recipes.

43:59.880 --> 44:02.000
You wouldn't have to change the other formats very much.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.100
But they call it a low stress fest, and that's very true.

44:06.100 --> 44:07.100
It was very true.

44:07.100 --> 44:08.100
It was very low stress.

44:08.100 --> 44:16.280
I was amazed at how nonchalant, just easy it was, just the overall vibe was just calm.

44:16.280 --> 44:20.560
And one thing that's kind of neat, because it's at a technical college, which, first

44:20.560 --> 44:22.520
of all, is a beautiful campus.

44:22.520 --> 44:26.720
And second of all, they really made that showroom really nice that we had as the main room.

44:26.720 --> 44:29.280
But what's neat is to run the network.

44:29.280 --> 44:33.920
It's like some of the networking students' final test, or not final, but one of their

44:33.920 --> 44:37.760
big tests for the whole class is they run that wireless network.

44:37.760 --> 44:41.560
They make sure that LAN stays up, and they are responsible for all of it.

44:41.560 --> 44:43.240
And they're really helpful.

44:43.240 --> 44:46.680
We were able to get a line punched through the firewall, so we were outside the firewall.

44:46.680 --> 44:50.680
We got our own static IP address from their provider, and had a direct connection out

44:50.680 --> 44:51.960
to Scale Engine.

44:51.960 --> 44:54.400
So our stream was very steady.

44:54.400 --> 44:58.600
There was one time when Albert decided to post a video, and he killed our stream.

44:58.600 --> 44:59.600
He didn't.

44:59.600 --> 45:00.600
I probably shouldn't have.

45:00.600 --> 45:01.600
It was totally fine.

45:01.600 --> 45:02.600
No hard feelings.

45:02.600 --> 45:03.600
It just happens.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.720
And so it was really great, because they worked with us.

45:05.720 --> 45:08.840
And we got there, and we had an Ethernet LAN.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.320
They specifically punched it down.

45:10.320 --> 45:13.080
And wireless wasn't perfect.

45:13.080 --> 45:15.400
We had issues, and we also had ways to solve that.

45:15.400 --> 45:19.600
But for what you get at a conference with, I think now the number is actually up to 1,600.

45:19.600 --> 45:22.400
I think it's even higher than what we said in the show.

45:22.400 --> 45:26.000
To have 1,600 people who, all of them probably have a cell phone that has Wi-Fi.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.040
Most of them have a tablet or a laptop that has Wi-Fi.

45:28.040 --> 45:29.680
I had two devices on me.

45:29.680 --> 45:33.000
I had my laptop and my cell phone that were taking up Wi-Fi.

45:33.000 --> 45:37.440
So when you figure 1,600 people, many of which have two devices on the Wi-Fi network, it

45:37.440 --> 45:38.640
gets pretty nuts.

45:38.640 --> 45:39.920
And they still managed it.

45:39.920 --> 45:43.760
I'm just thinking, as somebody who worked in education for a little while, or somebody

45:43.760 --> 45:47.120
who was a student at one point, it would be so cool to have a last lesson like that.

45:47.120 --> 45:50.880
So that's just kind of, at the end of the day, one of the neat little side things about

45:50.880 --> 45:55.620
Bellingham and having the Linux Fest at the Bellingham Technical College.

45:55.620 --> 45:56.620
So there you go.

45:56.620 --> 45:57.840
They've done pretty well for themselves.

45:57.840 --> 46:01.000
Yeah, I was really impressed with that, because I compare it to other conferences I've been

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
to.

46:02.000 --> 46:07.880
I've been to conferences with way less people, way less devices, and the wireless was crap.

46:07.880 --> 46:12.120
And you paid $500 or $600 to get into it.

46:12.120 --> 46:14.360
It's like, wow, OK.

46:14.360 --> 46:17.840
So you compare it to other events, it's like, this is really impressive.

46:17.840 --> 46:21.340
And next year, I don't know how we're going to pull it off, because I loved having the

46:21.340 --> 46:22.340
live stream.

46:22.340 --> 46:23.340
So we'll always have that.

46:23.340 --> 46:24.340
I want to do that every year.

46:24.340 --> 46:28.440
But I also want to try to get to some of the sessions and just attend some of those.

46:28.440 --> 46:30.440
So I think we'll do shifts or stuff like that.

46:30.440 --> 46:34.920
But as it starts approaching, maybe the community can work together and we can find ways to

46:34.920 --> 46:38.260
get folks out so they can experience it, because it's a really good time.

46:38.260 --> 46:41.080
But Matt, with that, I think we'll come to the end of this week's Linux Unplugged.

46:41.080 --> 46:45.640
Now, on Sunday, on the Linux Action Show, we're going to do a gaming episode.

46:45.640 --> 46:48.600
Because honestly, it's just Matt and I have an itch that we need to scratch, and we still

46:48.600 --> 46:49.800
have these loaner laptops.

46:49.800 --> 46:54.620
So we figured, why not have some fun from System76 and run them through their paces.

46:54.620 --> 46:56.080
So tune in on Sunday for that.

46:56.080 --> 47:00.240
We'll be live on Sunday at 10 AM Pacific for the Linux Action Show over at jblive.tv.

47:00.240 --> 47:01.240
Don't forget, we want your feedback.

47:01.240 --> 47:05.200
Go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com, click that contact link, and then choose Linux Unplugged

47:05.200 --> 47:06.200
from the dropdown.

47:06.200 --> 47:10.880
You can catch us on Tuesdays at 2 PM Pacific over at jblive.tv, or go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

47:10.880 --> 47:13.840
slash calendar to get that converted in your local time zone.

47:13.840 --> 47:14.840
All right, Matt.

47:14.840 --> 47:15.840
I'll see you on Sunday, OK?

47:15.840 --> 47:16.840
See you then.

47:16.840 --> 47:17.840
All right, everyone.

47:17.840 --> 47:18.840
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

47:18.840 --> 47:33.080
See you next Tuesday.
