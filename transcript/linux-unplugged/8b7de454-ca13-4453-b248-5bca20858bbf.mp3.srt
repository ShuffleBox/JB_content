1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
I'm already lightheaded because I'm so nervous.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,300
Nervous?

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,100
Yeah, we should all just take a little moment before the show, you know?

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:06,700
I am.

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,100
Calm ourselves, get ready.

6
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,400
I am legit nervous.

7
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,600
Chris, you don't get nervous.

8
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,500
Come on.

9
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,000
I don't normally get nervous, but I-

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,100
You got this.

11
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,200
I don't know what it is, but every now and then, for me, it's-

12
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,800
Well, yeah, no, I'm-

13
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,900
We'll see if I make it through the episode.

14
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,500
I'm pretty nervous.

15
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,600
I probably might be stumbling all over myself.

16
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,800
You got this for me, Wes?

17
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,400
I'll do my best.

18
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,200
You just jump in.

19
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,600
Come on, you're a pro.

20
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,800
No, no, I know, but-

21
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,000
It's like getting in a new relationship.

22
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,300
Mm-hmm.

23
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,100
But we all get to watch.

24
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,800
It really is.

25
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,200
Like, there's a commitment.

26
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,900
There's a huge commitment that goes on for a very long time.

27
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,700
You will have to stay with this thing through good and bad.

28
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,400
All right, let's just start the show.

29
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,300
I'm just going to sit here and be a nervous wreck.

30
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,500
I'll just sit here and dwell on it.

31
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,700
No, I'm nervous.

32
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:59,500
I'm sorry.

33
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,600
Hello, and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

34
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,400
that's being co-hosted by someone who's totally composed

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,000
and really has their stuff together today.

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My name is Chris.

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,800
I always do.

38
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,400
My name is Wes.

39
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,100
What about me, though?

40
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,300
I'm saying me.

41
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,700
You always do.

42
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,000
Wes, I'm just going to let you take over if I go off the rails,

43
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,200
but before we go any further into the show,

44
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,000
which is I'm super excited about today.

45
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,200
We have some huge news, but we also have a great topic.

46
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,300
I want to give a shout out to both Mr. Cheese and Alex.

47
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,000
Hello, gentlemen.

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,500
Hey.

49
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:30,900
Hello.

50
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,000
How's it going, internet?

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,600
Hello.

52
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,300
Hi, nice to see you.

53
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,000
And then I want to say time-appropriate greetings

54
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
to that virtual log.

55
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,900
Hello, Mumble Room.

56
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,100
Hello.

57
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,900
Ho, ho, ho.

58
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,600
Hello.

59
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,500
Hello to Brent and Elle.

60
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,900
And I'm going to say Stinky Karate?

61
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,100
Tech Mav and Turf.

62
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,900
Is that Stinky?

63
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,700
I don't even want to know because that's too good.

64
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,200
OK, yeah.

65
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,100
Let's not fix it.

66
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,800
For my defense, that screen is across the room.

67
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Oh, and Tech Mav just joining in right there at the end.

68
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,300
Hi, there.

69
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,300
Oh, and Carl, too.

70
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,600
Well, hello.

71
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
You guys are the best.

72
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,700
Hello, everybody.

73
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,900
Good to see you trickling in.

74
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,600
We have a huge show today.

75
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,300
I'm very happy to have you here.

76
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,000
Let's start with some community news.

77
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,300
There's some items that we want to cover.

78
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,500
Recently, Linux has been getting a hard time

79
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,600
for its low memory handling.

80
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,200
Recently?

81
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,400
I mean, haven't we complained about that for years?

82
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
OK, well, forever.

83
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,100
But I mean, just like recently, I saw two different people

84
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,100
writing about how Linux falls apart in low memory situations.

85
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,300
Particularly, these are server workloads

86
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,100
where it's something that is just

87
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,100
a massive load that is unexpected.

88
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,600
And then even once you recover the memory,

89
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,200
the system still never really comes back to its full performance,

90
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
I suppose.

91
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,300
Well, that may soon be a thing of the past, Mr. Payne.

92
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,600
This is some good news.

93
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,700
There is a project that has been started by an individual.

94
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,500
I'm going to let you try to guess that pronunciation.

95
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,000
Bastian, what do you think?

96
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,100
I think you're spot on.

97
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,500
You do not.

98
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
You do not.

99
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,100
You're just going to let me take it.

100
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,000
I see how it is.

101
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,500
I see.

102
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,400
I'm on to you.

103
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,900
Anyways, he's working on a project

104
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,100
that's very similar to Android's low memory killer daemon.

105
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,900
Yeah, absolutely.

106
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,400
And just last year, Facebook released something similar.

107
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,500
We talked about it on TechSnap377.

108
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,900
They're out of memory daemon.

109
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,800
And the idea is just try to be helpful.

110
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,500
Don't totally rely on the kernel.

111
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,100
Here's a little daemon that can look for, monitor,

112
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,000
expect situations where there is this sort of system

113
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,200
and memory pressure.

114
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,000
And then fire off signals to let applications know,

115
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,100
hey, if you have memory that you can give back to the system,

116
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,900
now would be a great time to do so.

117
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,900
Sort of seems odd that we don't have that.

118
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,700
I guess we've always just relied on the kernel to go kill things.

119
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,900
Yeah, I mean, we needed someone in the middle

120
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,100
to sort of pass the note.

121
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,500
Yeah, so you know what?

122
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,000
The only thing I think this is lacking

123
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,500
is a deep integration with systemd.

124
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, just wait.

125
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,400
OK, well, while we're talking about performance and stuff,

126
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,800
I just had to squeeze this one in, too.

127
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,300
It appears that Fedora is switching to the BFQ.io

128
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,700
scheduler for better responsiveness.

129
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,300
This is something that I've toyed with on and off.

130
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,800
If you've ever experienced some odd leg in your desktop UI

131
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,100
when you're, say, hitting your disk pretty hard,

132
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,100
this is something that BFQ, I have been led to believe,

133
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,400
can make a big difference with.

134
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,300
However, I've never really noticed a massive difference

135
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,000
myself when I tested it.

136
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,900
Well, you know, there's some interesting quotes here

137
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,900
of some numbers.

138
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,800
Under load, BFQ can load applications up to 20 times

139
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,700
as fast as any other I.O. scheduler.

140
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,100
Soft real-time applications like video playback,

141
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,700
that can benefit, too, if you ever, you know,

142
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,000
stutter in while you're trying to write a USB drive.

143
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,300
There's some interesting benefits.

144
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,300
Although, if you already have a super fast NVMe drive,

145
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,000
well, this isn't enabled for you.

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,600
There's no point.

147
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
You're already too fast.

148
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,200
Yeah, that's probably what it is.

149
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,300
Because my main OS drive is NVMe.

150
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,200
But then, like, by large storage disk,

151
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,600
some of them are still spinning REST.

152
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,100
So maybe it'd be useful there.

153
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,600
It is nice.

154
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
This is one of the things that many interested sort

155
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,700
of super users have been tuning, tweaking, playing with.

156
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,100
Kind of neat to see Fedora actually adopting it,

157
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,300
making it more mainstream.

158
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,900
OK, well, let's talk about something

159
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,500
that everyone on the crew is very excited about,

160
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,700
and that is the Pinebook Pro.

161
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,500
Pre-orders have been, well, there's been, like,

162
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,100
one window already, Cheesy?

163
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,800
Yeah, so there was the initial window

164
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,300
where if you were a forum member,

165
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,700
and you had been for the last three months,

166
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,900
then you could get in the pre-order queue for the first

167
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,800
round.

168
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,200
Now they've opened it up so that anyone can get into the queue.

169
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,000
You don't have to have been a forum member for x amount

170
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,500
of months or anything like that.

171
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,700
$199.

172
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,100
They're coming a long way on the machine.

173
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,300
It's a little different than the original Pinebook, obviously.

174
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,500
It's a magnesium alloy casing.

175
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,300
Keyboard's supposed to be a lot better.

176
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,200
Not supposed to have that flex like it did before.

177
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
An NVMe adapter for it, so you can

178
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,200
toss an additional NVMe drive in there if you want to.

179
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,100
But it's gotten a lot of attention,

180
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,700
and I think that it's going to be a really great little machine

181
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,200
whenever it comes out.

182
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,600
I'm waiting on mine to ship.

183
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,500
I think they said toward the end of October

184
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,200
is when I'll receive mine.

185
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,400
So I'm really looking forward to that

186
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,900
and hoping that none of our American politics

187
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,100
will affect me getting my Pinebook,

188
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,100
because I'm going to be very frustrated if that happens.

189
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,300
I want an unboxing video from you.

190
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,700
I want a full cheese rundown.

191
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,900
Yeah, I'll do it like Unbox Therapy for you.

192
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,700
I'll be honest here.

193
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,500
I've never really followed the Pinebook that closely.

194
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,700
I just love a quick, too long, haven't followed.

195
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,200
What is it?

196
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,500
Why should I care about it?

197
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,400
So it's essentially a single board computer

198
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,200
that's thrown inside of a laptop.

199
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,700
It uses the Rockchip 3399 SoC, which is a pretty powerful SoC.

200
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,400
A little bit better, some may argue,

201
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,300
a little bit better than what's in the Raspberry Pi.

202
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,300
The Pi 4?

203
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:07,400
Yeah, 4 gigs of DDR4, IPS display, 1080.

204
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,500
It does have a hardware switch.

205
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,600
The firmware in the keyboard is programmed

206
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,000
to disconnect Bluetooth and wireless.

207
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,200
Some say that the way that they're

208
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,500
using their kill switch for their radios

209
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,900
is actually better than, say, other distributors

210
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,700
like the way Purism does it, where it's not

211
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,100
necessarily a mechanical switch that could break on you.

212
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
I think they're still working out a few kinks as

213
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,900
far as if you turn the radios off

214
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,700
and you put your machine into spin mode,

215
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,200
getting back out of the spin mode and turning the radios on

216
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,500
is kind of an issue right now.

217
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,600
But essentially what it is is a single board computer put

218
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,500
into the housing of a laptop with 4 gigs of DDR4,

219
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,600
a pretty powerful CPU.

220
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,400
Something that, in theory, if they get it down

221
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,900
to what they're talking about, which

222
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:07,500
is like 0.25 watt draw on suspend,

223
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,000
then they say 100 hours of battery life,

224
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,140
but I would just be stoked to get a good solid 8 or 10

225
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,000
hours out of it.

226
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,600
Worth noting, USB-C charging and the screen size 14.1 inches.

227
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,200
Could be a great little remote machine.

228
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,900
It also has video out over USB-C as well.

229
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,400
So there's some demo videos out there

230
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,800
that Lucas has recorded that I can link to in the show notes

231
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
for people to go check out.

232
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,100
It does play Quake 3.

233
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,300
And so what's the price on that?

234
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:35,800
Is it like?

235
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,100
$199.

236
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,600
Wow.

237
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,400
That's pretty great.

238
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Yeah, it's very exciting.

239
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,100
And this time it's an even better.

240
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,300
That's why they're calling it Pro,

241
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,200
with that magnesium casing, that IPS display.

242
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,500
It's pretty compelling.

243
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,800
I'm very excited to hear what you think of it, Cheese,

244
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,300
because if you like it, I may end up ordering one.

245
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,900
Well, I'm really looking forward to it.

246
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,300
And I think, if anything, it'll be a great little companion

247
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,000
machine to take along with me whenever

248
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,900
I go to these conferences or our Sprint or anything like that.

249
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,800
A little bit lighter.

250
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm not really concerned if, I mean,

251
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,000
obviously I don't want anything to happen to it,

252
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,500
but I'm not overly concerned if something does.

253
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,200
Hey, over on the Linux Unplugged website, LinuxUnplugged.com,

254
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,800
we have a blog you can click at the top of the site.

255
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,700
And Cheesy just posted a summary of some of the fun things

256
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,700
we did during our team sprint a couple of weeks

257
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,600
that JB Summer Sprint, we had our full-time staff

258
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,400
and full-time contractors all came into the Seattle area.

259
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,500
And we worked on a lot of things, some of which

260
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,400
you've seen in the extras feed, some of which

261
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,000
we're about to talk about here in just a minute.

262
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,100
To be honest with you, I am more nervous

263
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,000
than I think I've been in 10 years about this.

264
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,700
And I really encourage you to go check out this post,

265
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,600
because Cheese did a great job of capturing

266
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,400
some of the moments that were so great about the Sprint.

267
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,200
Like the shot of us working on the ferry

268
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,000
while we're having a team meeting,

269
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,500
all in person for the first time.

270
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,600
Yeah, that was great.

271
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,000
On a ferry boat going across the Pacific Northwest,

272
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,900
it's just so great.

273
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,400
I mean, the only challenge was you

274
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,900
had to not just get lost in the scenery floating on by.

275
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,400
Which did happen from time to time.

276
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,700
Like you can see there's a few shots of Cheesy in there.

277
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,700
Oh, yeah.

278
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,400
And our trip out to the Diablo Outlook,

279
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,900
where I learned how to do night photography for the first time

280
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,400
and talked my wife into driving up and down

281
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,000
the side of the mountain so I could get a long exposure

282
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,200
picture of her headlights.

283
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:22,800
And it worked out.

284
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
It did, didn't it?

285
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
That was a lot of fun.

286
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,700
You both had radios, and you were still on this overlook

287
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,000
radioing to Hadia saying, no, wait, wait, wait.

288
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,200
And then you missed the button.

289
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,000
You say, oh, just turn around, honey.

290
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,400
You know, it's no problem.

291
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,200
Brent, you were a great mentor and handled my noobness

292
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,300
with much ease and kind gloves.

293
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,200
I thank you.

294
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,100
Well, you're welcome.

295
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,200
You were a great, great student.

296
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,800
Hardly.

297
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,500
Hardly.

298
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,400
But I managed.

299
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:49,900
I managed.

300
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,200
Anyways, it was a really nice write-up.

301
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
And the sprint was more than just about creating

302
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,900
some new stuff.

303
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,700
It was also about us getting a chance to hang out together.

304
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,600
We did that, including going out to the ice caves

305
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,200
and some epic drone shots of the ice caves in there.

306
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,700
Hey-oh.

307
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,800
Let's check that out.

308
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,300
Yeah.

309
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,700
That was pretty good.

310
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,600
OK.

311
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,100
All right.

312
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,000
Now, there's a moment that we've really been building towards.

313
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,800
Stop wasting time.

314
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,300
I know.

315
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,800
This is We Make News this week.

316
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,500
This is still part of the community news.

317
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,100
Because this week, a well-known podcast network

318
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,900
in the open source community is launching yet

319
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,800
another podcast that is totally free, handcrafted,

320
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,000
and built just for our audience.

321
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,900
I'm very excited.

322
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,100
Alex, do you want to say it?

323
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,400
Do you want?

324
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:33,900
Come on, Alex.

325
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,400
Say it.

326
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,200
Say it, Alex.

327
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,500
We are launching a new show called Self Hosted.

328
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,400
SelfHosted.show.

329
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,900
The teaser's up right now because we're

330
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,200
filling out the RSS feeds.

331
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,700
And we're really excited about this.

332
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,500
In fact, so excited that we're holding a launch party coming

333
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,200
up next weekend.

334
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Our buddy Wendell from Level One Techs

335
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,600
is joining us at the meetup.

336
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,400
Wendell's going to join us for episode two of Self Hosted.

337
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,200
That's great.

338
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,000
We've already recorded episode one.

339
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,800
It's in the cam.

340
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,100
It's going to be premiering on September 12

341
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,200
to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Jupiter

342
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
broadcasting joining Linux Academy.

343
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,900
It's our birthday, and you're all getting a new podcast.

344
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,800
So selfhosted.show slash subscribe.

345
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,400
If you just want to get the RSS feed,

346
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,400
so as soon as episode one goes live, you've got it.

347
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,500
And then keep an eye out for episode two.

348
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,100
We're going to travel to Wendell's lab

349
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,300
and get in a conversation with him

350
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,500
about why self-hosting matters.

351
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah, so Chris is going to fly out

352
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,500
to Raleigh, North Carolina, which

353
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,900
is where I currently reside.

354
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,600
And we're going to take a road trip through the North Carolina

355
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,000
mountains up to Kentucky over the weekend, Labor Day

356
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
weekend.

357
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,200
Yeah, it's an incredibly exciting opportunity.

358
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,500
I'm very excited and really looking forward

359
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,700
to the future with you, Chris.

360
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,300
I am too.

361
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,540
You and I have had a chance over the last couple of years

362
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,400
to get to know each other pretty well.

363
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,940
We met at Texas Linux Fest, and then at Linux Fest Northwest.

364
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,560
Alex had a packed talk.

365
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,340
The room was all standing room only talk about self-hosting,

366
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,560
about getting control of smart devices on your LAN,

367
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,580
about standing up services for your family and friends,

368
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,300
or even business.

369
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,260
And it was really, really well received.

370
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,740
And afterwards, we started talking and saying,

371
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,660
there's a show here.

372
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,740
There really is a show here.

373
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,200
And then we really refined the idea

374
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,040
at this year's Texas Linux Fest and started working on it hard.

375
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,900
And we've been working on it for a little bit

376
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,780
because we really wanted to think

377
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,740
about all the different ways we could do a show like this.

378
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,540
And we wanted to come away with something

379
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,300
that's the essentials of what you need from a podcast

380
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,140
like this.

381
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,620
And we're not anti-cloud.

382
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,540
I think that's going to be an important aspect

383
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,380
about the show is we're pragmatist.

384
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,980
Really for us, self-hosting is about controlling your data.

385
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,820
So if there's a way to intelligently leverage

386
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,620
the cloud, maybe with encrypting your data or some other means,

387
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,060
we're absolutely going to talk about that in the show as well.

388
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,940
Alex's day job is OpenShift at Red Hat.

389
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,460
So it's a huge part of what he does on a day-to-day basis.

390
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,780
It's a huge part of my entire, quote unquote, Linux career.

391
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,420
One of my other projects is linuxserver.io.

392
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,460
And one of the most popular articles on that website

393
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,580
has been the Perfect Media Server series,

394
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,660
which is something I started writing in 2016.

395
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,860
And this show really is just for me a way

396
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,380
to pay it forward to all those that

397
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,460
have helped me along my journey, but also

398
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,780
to bring in a whole new swathe of people

399
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,780
into self-hosting services.

400
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,700
I think with the privacy implications

401
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,460
of giving all your data to Google and Amazon

402
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,860
and all these big companies, that the time to self-host

403
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,060
has never been more prevalent than now.

404
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,420
And the tools have never been better.

405
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,700
That's what's blowing me away is we've had some resources now

406
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,700
to have decent hardware and decent systems

407
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,160
and experiment with different things

408
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,300
and have time to deploy things and learn things.

409
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,620
And it's been eye-opening for me this last year

410
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,700
with Linux Academy.

411
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,540
You have been converted to containers.

412
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,300
It's been a fun journey to watch,

413
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,860
because I've been listening to the network for a long time

414
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,540
now.

415
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,500
And you've been talking about Docker on Coda with Michael

416
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,860
for years.

417
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,700
But I knew you didn't use it, because I could just

418
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,160
tell from the way you were talking.

419
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,220
But now you do use it, and some of the stuff

420
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,300
that Wes is doing on the back end with hosting

421
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,780
all the sites and stuff.

422
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,700
You just talk about it like a giddy school kid,

423
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,340
and it's just wonderful, because you

424
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,180
get my enthusiasm for this stuff, too, now, right?

425
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:27,540
Oh, yeah.

426
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,300
He really does.

427
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,000
Well, and you and I have been discussing

428
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,020
a lot about taking the smart devices

429
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,420
that you get that the vendor drops support for

430
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,420
and reflashing them.

431
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,140
We're using things that just have plugins for them already

432
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,900
and building up infrastructure.

433
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,620
We're going to very early in the series on self-hosted,

434
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,260
we'll just cover a few fundamentals, too,

435
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,660
like port forwarding, reverse proxy,

436
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,100
and the tools we use to do reverse proxy, right?

437
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,860
Just so we have some of those fundamentals as well.

438
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,380
That's all going to be in there.

439
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,140
Very, very, very excited.

440
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,500
It's going to be a twice a month podcast, self-hosted.show,

441
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,940
launching September 12.

442
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,180
And if you're not familiar who this Alex guy is,

443
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,860
check out Linux server IO.

444
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,660
And also, just released three or four minutes ago,

445
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,020
extras.show slash seven is a chat with Brent and Alex,

446
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,360
and you can meet Alex and his journey from Apple to Red Hat

447
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,140
and from London to Raleigh and becoming a podcaster.

448
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,580
It's some great background that I think you'll appreciate.

449
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,580
So if you're curious about one of our new podcast stars,

450
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,460
check out extras.show slash seven,

451
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,540
A New Brunch with Brent.

452
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,340
You cheeky monkey.

453
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,780
You didn't tell me that was coming out today.

454
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,660
Isn't that nice?

455
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,740
Well, I figured you guys had such a great chat.

456
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,580
And what a great opportunity for people

457
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,180
to get to know who you are a little bit,

458
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,020
because they hear you contribute to the show,

459
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:47,300
but it's like we know you as a fully actualized person, right?

460
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,580
And we know your wife, and we know your background,

461
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,660
but the audience doesn't.

462
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,420
And Brent is such a great conversationalist.

463
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,820
It was just such a good opportunity for, I think,

464
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,120
even people that are tangentially

465
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,700
interested in what we might be cooking.

466
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,340
Go meet Alex, extras.show slash seven.

467
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,620
Brunch with Brent should be its own show, I'm just saying.

468
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,180
Heard it here first.

469
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,180
Start the campaign.

470
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,020
Well, that's nice.

471
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,180
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

472
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,860
Alex and I had a great conversation.

473
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,780
I listened to it three times already,

474
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,940
because I might have it in my back pocket

475
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,940
before it gets sent out.

476
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,620
So I just keep enjoying the heck out of it.

477
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,020
So Alex, thanks for sitting down with me and having a chat.

478
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,660
And I think the audience is really going to love it.

479
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,320
Well, thank you.

480
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,060
It was a pleasure.

481
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,700
Now, selfhosted.show.

482
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,260
Again, the teaser is out.

483
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,140
The feeds are getting populated now.

484
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,500
It's selfhosted.show slash RSS if you just

485
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,240
want to pop it into your podcast player of choice.

486
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,080
Episode one, September 12, our Meetup with Wendell

487
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,820
this weekend in Lexington, Kentucky, meetup.com slash

488
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,660
Jupiter Broadcasting.

489
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,300
Join Wendell, Alex, and myself at Goodfellas Pizzeria.

490
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,880
Big thanks to Elle for booking that one.

491
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,060
She picked this one out, and it looks fantastic.

492
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,480
One final plug, if I may, it's the new hashtag

493
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
that we're using.

494
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,220
I want to make this into a two-way conversation

495
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,620
and not just Chris and I talking about stuff.

496
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,240
We've got a hashtag we're going to use,

497
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,900
so you can use it on Twitter and or Telegram.

498
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,000
Ask SSH is the hashtag.

499
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,500
There you go.

500
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,020
Ask SSH and then ask your question away.

501
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,980
We'll try to work it into a future episode.

502
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,480
We do have a couple in the can, and then we'll work them in.

503
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,560
I am so excited.

504
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,300
And today's episode of Linux Unplugged is on theme.

505
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,540
It's really about self-hosting.

506
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,260
I decided to recently self-host my password database

507
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,180
with Bitwarden, but some of the guys on the show

508
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,340
are using the hosted option, so we'll talk about that as well.

509
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,260
So this is sort of on point.

510
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,180
And then those kinds of things and a lot more

511
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,100
from the self-hosted show once it kicks off.

512
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,260
It's real now, Chris.

513
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,460
We can't back out now.

514
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,500
It's real now.

515
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,220
I know.

516
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,860
I know.

517
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,580
We've been working on this for so long.

518
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,900
We really wanted to be intentional,

519
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,740
and I hope everybody likes what we've come up with.

520
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,380
I feel like it's fresh.

521
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:52,940
It's good.

522
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,700
It's an important topic, and the area

523
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,700
is getting so interesting.

524
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,540
There's so many great free software projects out there

525
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,900
right now that you think take all this time and effort,

526
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,300
but really it's all manageable.

527
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,840
And with just a couple of pointers

528
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,260
or a couple of lessons we've learned,

529
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,260
you're off to the races.

530
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,540
So lots of potential.

531
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,660
Now, I have something else for us before we go any further.

532
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,540
We need to talk about odd camp, because that's also

533
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,860
coming up really soon.

534
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,180
October 19th and the 20th isn't that far away

535
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,460
if you need to plan for travel.

536
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,460
And believe it or not, odd camp is now 10 years old this year,

537
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,180
which is amazing, because I remember when odd camp started.

538
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,220
That makes me feel like I've been around for too long.

539
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,540
But if you've never been or you've always gone,

540
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,180
it seems like a pretty good one to go to October 19th and 20.

541
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,100
I'm going to see if I can see if you think,

542
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,980
see what you think of my pronunciation, Alex, of these,

543
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,740
OK?

544
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,460
At the Manchester Conference Center in the Pendulum Hotel

545
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,900
near Piccadilly Station.

546
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,060
Wow, very good.

547
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,780
How'd I do?

548
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,180
It was so close, so close.

549
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,140
Hello, Povie.

550
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,640
Hello.

551
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,700
Which one was it?

552
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,140
It was the Piccadilly Station, right?

553
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:03,180
Yeah, it kind of went off at Piccadilly, but that's fine.

554
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,740
So anyways, oddcamp, oddcamp.org if you're interested.

555
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,100
And Joe had a real quick chance to sit down

556
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,980
with Dan from odd camp to give us

557
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,940
a little taste of what's coming.

558
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,540
And we'll be right back.

559
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,940
So welcome to the show, Dan.

560
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,340
Thank you very much for having me.

561
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,100
So you're here to talk about odd camp.

562
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,540
What is it, where is it, and when is it?

563
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,980
Yeah, so odd camp is a free culture and free software

564
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,460
open source, bar camp, kind of hybrid, we call it.

565
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,900
So it's a UK event.

566
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,220
It's been running for 10 years.

567
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,860
So this is our 10th anniversary this year,

568
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,260
so it's quite a big one for us.

569
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,660
And we've got four different tracks.

570
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,540
We have one kind of scheduled track

571
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,660
with some speakers on there.

572
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,940
We've got some interesting stuff coming up

573
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,540
with Andy Stanford-Clark and Roger Light

574
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,260
are going to talk about Mosquito,

575
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,940
which is a project they created together

576
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,820
at the first odd camp 10 years ago, which is still going.

577
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,860
And it's been quite popular in, you know,

578
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,380
IOT kind of embedded fields as well.

579
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,420
So that's cool.

580
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,340
It's, yeah, so it's coming up in Manchester

581
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,500
in October this year.

582
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,000
It's our 10th anniversary, as I said.

583
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,980
We're going to be at the Manchester Conference Centre,

584
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,420
which is in the Pendulum Hotel.

585
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,060
It's on the 19th and 20th of October.

586
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:15,060
And tickets, well, you can give a donation of tickets

587
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,180
or they can be completely free.

588
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,660
It's whatever you think you can spare.

589
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,980
So that's, you know, we want to keep it open to everyone.

590
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,580
But we just want to get as many people together

591
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,100
and have a, you know, a celebration of open source

592
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,100
and all the kind of crazy goodness that's around that.

593
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,060
Yeah, so the 19th and 20th of October,

594
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,860
that's the Saturday and Sunday,

595
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,480
but there is kind of an unofficial social event

596
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,820
on the Friday night, isn't there?

597
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,220
That's a very good point, actually, yeah.

598
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,220
So on the 18th, which is the Friday,

599
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,520
there will be a party in the hotel.

600
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,660
I think it's about seven o'clock onwards in the main hotel.

601
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,500
There's a bar there and we've got some,

602
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,380
there's food available.

603
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,940
You can order food and you can have drinks and stuff.

604
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,980
And I know it's October,

605
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,320
but there's a really nice courtyard outside.

606
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,580
And it's got like nice outside seating and stuff.

607
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,640
So fingers crossed, I know in Manchester it rains a lot,

608
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,960
but fingers crossed it's not going to rain

609
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,100
and it won't be freezing.

610
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,780
And we'll be able to spread out into that as well

611
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,300
and have a really good kind of, a good get together.

612
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,260
Well, I remember a few years ago,

613
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,340
up the road in Liverpool and that was at Halloween

614
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,740
and I was walking around in a T-shirt,

615
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,580
it was lovely weather.

616
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,700
So fingers crossed, you never know.

617
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,460
You never know, that's very true.

618
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,620
Tickets are available now, as I said,

619
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,860
so I should give you the address, shouldn't I?

620
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,500
If you go to ogcamp.org, O-G-G-C-A-M-P.org,

621
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,020
there's a link on there for tickets

622
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,340
and you can easily sort all that sort of stuff out.

623
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,620
And if anybody's interested in supporting the event,

624
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,100
sponsoring or anything like that,

625
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,060
that's still up there as well.

626
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,700
And you can find out about the schedule

627
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,180
and that'll be getting more stuff on there as we go along.

628
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,820
It's gradually getting filled up.

629
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,020
We're looking for crew now.

630
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,100
There's all kinds of stuff on there.

631
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,140
We're on Twitter as well, at Ogcamp

632
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,460
and Master Don and various other things.

633
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,380
If you search for Ogcamp, it's quite a unique name.

634
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,260
So it'll come up in many places.

635
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,300
Yeah.

636
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,900
So what should people expect there then from,

637
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,780
well, I suppose let's start with the schedule track.

638
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,380
What should people expect there?

639
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,660
Well, lots of interesting stuff coming up.

640
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,260
As I said, we've got our kind of opening keynote this year

641
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,780
is Andy Stanford-Clark from IBM.

642
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,020
He's the CTO of IBM.

643
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,740
He was largely responsible for creating MQTT,

644
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,900
which is this messaging protocol,

645
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,820
which I'm sure your listeners will know better than I do,

646
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,660
to be honest.

647
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,780
But yeah, people use a lot for reporting and messaging

648
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,740
and stuff in IOT and embedded Linux

649
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,540
and just embedded software in general.

650
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,820
So he's gonna come talk about that and how that's changed

651
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,340
and how the project that he created with Roger Light,

652
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,540
he'll also be there, how that's changed.

653
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,580
Then we've got all kinds of stuff.

654
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,700
On the Saturday, there'll be a number of scheduled talks.

655
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,300
We've got some stuff for beginners,

656
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,940
introduction to Ubuntu.

657
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,300
Anna is gonna tell us her story

658
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,140
about how she got into Ubuntu.

659
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,300
We've got other stuff there.

660
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,340
As you'll know, Joe,

661
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:55,140
we've got the podcast panel discussion extravaganza

662
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,260
at the end there, which you'll be...

663
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,060
Which is totally organized and completely final at this point.

664
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,900
Excellent.

665
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,340
So that'll be fun, that's always fun.

666
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,740
And then there's a party on the Saturday night as well,

667
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,820
because one of the big things about OgCamp,

668
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,900
which you can probably attest to,

669
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,540
is that we do like to take our parties

670
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,620
as seriously as everything else.

671
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,580
So we tend to have lots of social events around it.

672
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,460
So there's another party in the evening.

673
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,900
There's gonna be a band playing,

674
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,300
Dev Nol and the Kernel Panics,

675
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,420
who are a Linux band, if you wanna call them that.

676
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,140
They're gonna be playing in the main room

677
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,580
and there's the bar next door

678
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,260
and there'll be more food and stuff.

679
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,140
And on the Sunday, actually, I should mention,

680
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,020
we've got our first...

681
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,100
Well, actually, on the Saturday,

682
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,340
we've got our first ever kids track as well, which is nice.

683
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,900
So there's gonna be stuff to do for...

684
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,060
If you've got family, you can bring them along.

685
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,820
We're gonna have sessions for kids.

686
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,140
We've got a special little kids room

687
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,860
where there's gonna be people putting on sessions,

688
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,780
like building little robots and doing cool stuff,

689
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,100
which will hopefully get the kids interested in technology

690
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,220
and keep them entertained.

691
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,380
And there's an exhibition area.

692
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,820
We're gonna have lots of various stuff going on

693
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,780
in the exhibition area.

694
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,940
Hacker Public Radio are there and lots of other people.

695
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,140
I'm still booking that at the moment.

696
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,820
So if anybody listening has a project

697
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,180
and they think they'd like to be involved

698
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,020
and they'd like to exhibit,

699
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,620
you can just email contact.oddcamp.org

700
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,540
and I'll sort that out with you.

701
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,380
And we can get you on the exhibition.

702
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,820
And then there's the Open Hardware Jam,

703
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,980
which is gonna be in the middle of the exhibition space

704
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,820
as well.

705
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,740
There's gonna be people doing, again,

706
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,740
cool stuff with making stuff with Arduinos

707
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,980
and micro bits and Raspberry Pis

708
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,900
and all that sort of stuff, which should be cool.

709
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,900
And then on the Sunday, we've got our first,

710
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,260
so we're linking up with an event called FloorCon,

711
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,620
which was a security and open source event

712
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,540
due to happen in Huddersfield, which sadly was canceled.

713
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,820
And then we kind of said, do you wanna come and do,

714
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,380
run one of the rooms for us during the day?

715
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,220
So there's gonna be,

716
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,340
I don't know what their content is yet,

717
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,980
but it's gonna be lots of security-based talks.

718
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,500
And they've got some speakers lined up as well,

719
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,300
which I'll publish on the website

720
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,740
as soon as I find out more.

721
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,060
And then this all ends with the fabulous raffle cast,

722
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,140
which goes on for a while,

723
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,740
usually where we give away all the prizes that we've got.

724
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,780
And then on the Sunday night,

725
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,900
I suspect a few people will still be around

726
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,740
on the Sunday night.

727
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,300
So there'll be a few people in Manchester hanging around

728
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,540
for probably food and drinks and stuff

729
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,420
before we all crawl off to wherever we're from

730
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,300
on the Monday.

731
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,420
And it is also an on-conference, isn't it?

732
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,460
So if anyone turns up wanting to speak,

733
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,980
then there's a chance that they will be able to.

734
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,860
They should be able to, yeah.

735
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,420
So that's a really good point, actually.

736
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,540
I should highlight that.

737
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,340
If you have a topic that you wanna talk about,

738
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,260
and actually something that we're trying to do this year

739
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,780
as well, which we haven't done in the past is,

740
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,980
so Lorna's in charge of the schedule

741
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,780
and she's much more organized than I am.

742
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,260
And she came up with a great idea,

743
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,020
which was to have suggested topics.

744
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,060
So if you're listening and you think,

745
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,380
oh, I'd love to see a talk about Git, for example,

746
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,740
but I don't know if there'll be one,

747
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,380
we're gonna have a call for like topics.

748
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,220
So if someone couldn't say,

749
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,780
I wanna see a talk about Git,

750
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,620
somebody else can go,

751
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,780
oh, I actually know a bit about Git.

752
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,100
I could probably do that.

753
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,380
And then we can kind of put those things together

754
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,780
and hopefully build the kind of, you know,

755
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,060
the content that people actually wanna see

756
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,900
and get involved in.

757
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,460
And I think Lorna's also gonna do some,

758
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,940
if you're nervous about talking

759
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,900
and you haven't done it before,

760
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,740
she's gonna run a couple of webinar sessions

761
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,900
during September,

762
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,420
helping people to get used to talking.

763
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,380
She's an excellent speaker

764
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,820
and she's gonna give some tips

765
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,860
on how you can feel comfortable,

766
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,500
do your talk and get the most out of it.

767
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,420
All right, cool.

768
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,100
And there's usually lightning talks as well

769
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,420
for people who wanna just kind of dip their toes in.

770
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,260
There will be, yeah.

771
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,100
I should mention that.

772
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,540
That's on the Saturday, I think on the main stage.

773
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,980
There's five minute-ish talks usually.

774
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,980
Yeah.

775
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,740
Well, I'll be there, you'll be there.

776
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,060
It sounds like it's gonna be excellent fun.

777
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,380
So again, plug the URL for it.

778
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,260
Yeah, go to ogcamp.org.

779
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,340
That's O-G-G-C-A-M-P.org

780
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,780
and all the information's on there.

781
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,020
Quick plug for you then.

782
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,580
Yeah, if anyone wants to find out what I'm up to,

783
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,860
you can go to best place probably Twitter actually,

784
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,700
which is at methoddan or danlynch.org,

785
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,340
which is where my main website

786
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,700
and you can find all the various podcasts

787
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,860
and things that I do on there.

788
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,700
Nice one.

789
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,740
Well, thanks a lot for coming on the show then.

790
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,940
No problem, anytime.

791
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,580
And that panel they mentioned will be recorded

792
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,620
and released in our extras.show feed.

793
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,460
Oh boy.

794
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,060
Yeah, so if you wanna catch that and you can't make it,

795
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,580
we'll try to make that panel available

796
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,180
cause we have that avenue now.

797
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,260
Oh yes we do.

798
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,060
So my friends, we are gathered here today

799
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,980
to discuss Bitwarden.

800
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:17,500
We all know that a password manager in 2019 is a must do.

801
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,140
I've tried them, gone back to LastPass

802
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,740
and I decided I was going to hang out

803
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,300
and wait at LastPass until my subscription expired,

804
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,540
which it expired this month

805
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,140
and I have no intention of renewing it.

806
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,900
So this is something that's been on my radar.

807
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,260
You kinda have to move.

808
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,820
You've been a key pass user for a long time.

809
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,700
For a long time.

810
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,540
I mean, I've already, you know,

811
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,740
I always had sort of sinking infrastructure set up anyway

812
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,220
and I don't, you know, I read a whole bunch

813
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,140
and hardly ever write to this thing.

814
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,460
So for a long time it was fine to just sort of sink it around

815
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,300
and access it when I needed to,

816
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,620
but I just have more and more passwords now.

817
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,180
I thought, you know, it's been a while

818
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,300
since I've tried something else.

819
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,900
For me too, sharing my passwords with all of you

820
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,900
on the team has become much more of a thing.

821
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,860
Yeah, it's okay like, you know, once or twice

822
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,500
if you give someone your account password,

823
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,460
but that does not scale.

824
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,980
Well, they're not really my passwords anymore.

825
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,300
They're the team's passwords.

826
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,620
I just have them in my database.

827
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,220
And so I need like a team password database as well,

828
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,100
but I still want it to be secure.

829
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,660
I want us to host it because of the sensitivity of this.

830
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,300
And we want it to work with mobile.

831
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,020
We want it to have autofill.

832
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,180
And I really was just sort of,

833
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,500
without really saying anything,

834
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,140
observing everyone just switching to Bitwarden

835
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,060
and you were the last domino to fall now.

836
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,100
And you switched over the weekend.

837
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,340
And I was like, okay, this is time for us to talk about it.

838
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,500
So ladies and gentlemen,

839
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,820
I would like to introduce you to Bitwarden.

840
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,420
It is developed by Kyle Speran.

841
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,780
Kyle is the primary contributor to the project,

842
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,220
but it is an open source project.

843
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,460
It debuted in August of 2016.

844
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,220
It does have mobile applications for iOS and Android,

845
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,300
including an F-Droid store version of it.

846
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,780
And it has browser plugins

847
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,020
for your common browser platforms.

848
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,780
You can use their hosted version or you can self-host it.

849
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,420
And there is their version you can self-host,

850
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,300
which they make available as Docker images.

851
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,780
And then there's also a community compatible version,

852
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,100
server side written in Rust.

853
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,460
Yeah, I mean, so if you look at,

854
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,460
and we'll have links of course,

855
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,820
in the doc to all of this stuff,

856
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,380
you can run it just like they do, up in the cloud,

857
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,940
but that's gonna be like a whole bunch

858
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,700
of database containers and a few other things.

859
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,540
It's also based on.NET technology,

860
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:27,180
which isn't always the most familiar to Linux users.

861
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,620
So there is a community maintained Rust server implementation

862
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,940
that is kind of geared at,

863
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,900
you're not building a whole big infrastructure

864
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,020
for many people, you're just hosting it yourself.

865
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,860
So we'll get to that,

866
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,580
because I had a chance to play around with that.

867
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,340
And you also then, like I mentioned,

868
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,660
have the option to just use their services.

869
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,340
Their infrastructure, from my understanding,

870
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,540
seems pretty solid.

871
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,980
They encrypt before they send it up to their servers,

872
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,860
so they just have an encrypted blob.

873
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,940
Their systems run on Azure,

874
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,820
so you have the security of the Azure platform

875
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,740
be at what it is, probably pretty good.

876
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,580
And on top of all of that, the best people could get,

877
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,860
even if they compromise the servers,

878
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,860
would just be that encrypted blob

879
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,900
sitting in a SQL database somewhere.

880
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,860
And Alex, so you elected to use

881
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,420
their hosted infrastructure.

882
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,660
I'm sure you've played with the self-hosted one too.

883
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,980
What do you like about using the hosted version?

884
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,780
For me, a password manager is something

885
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,660
that has to have 100% uptime.

886
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,820
I know that's not a realistic goal

887
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,140
for a self-hosted service,

888
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,940
because I'm not a data center, right?

889
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,940
But the thing is, for me,

890
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,500
particularly over the last 12 months,

891
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,460
whilst I was emigrating,

892
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,900
I didn't have a great way to run,

893
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,820
unless of course I'd spent up on a droplet or something,

894
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,020
I didn't have a great way to run this locally.

895
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:45,020
And for me, I think it's $12 a year or something.

896
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,180
That cost a buck a month is fine

897
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,340
for the service it provides.

898
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,700
I've been extremely happy with the experience

899
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,700
as a Bitwarden user.

900
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,780
And a lot of the integrations you can get on Android,

901
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,860
like auto-complete and stuff like that are pretty nice.

902
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,300
You can do Control-Shift-L in a browser,

903
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,460
and that will auto-fill the form entries on a page for you

904
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,940
if you've unlocked your vault and stuff.

905
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,380
So, I mean, I'm a very happy user.

906
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,060
I've been using it for well over a year at this point.

907
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,820
I think it's sort of set up by default

908
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,540
to use the hosted service when you go to log in.

909
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,020
And if you were gonna throw it up on a VPS,

910
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,900
you're probably better off using their hosted solution.

911
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,380
For me, what was critical is I wanted it behind my LAN

912
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,220
because of the nature of this.

913
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,900
And if it's not available,

914
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,020
that just means somebody on the team

915
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,500
can't log into a service they have to.

916
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,980
It's probably not the end of the world.

917
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,900
And so I'm willing to run it on a box

918
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,540
that could have 99.5% uptime for the year.

919
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,020
Right, we can make arrangements too,

920
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,820
with backups and spinning up new servers,

921
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,740
stuff we have to.

922
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,980
So it's really kind of your choice.

923
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,620
You have the option.

924
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,420
I like having the self-hosted option,

925
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,420
and it's always a balance.

926
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,540
Sometimes it makes more sense to use their infrastructure.

927
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,620
I think that line for something like this is,

928
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,220
if you already have several things you're running on a box

929
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,860
and so you just have a machine that you are routinely

930
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,660
keeping up to date and secure

931
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,940
and following best practices,

932
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,100
you're probably a good candidate

933
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,780
to self-host this particular software.

934
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,780
If you would just be spinning up something

935
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,100
that would be set off in the corner

936
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,740
that you would have to remember to log into

937
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,500
and make sure it stays up to date,

938
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,220
and it could be easily neglected,

939
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,620
probably not a good candidate

940
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,420
to host something like your password database.

941
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,420
And you might also consider, in this case,

942
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,980
that it is all available open source.

943
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,260
So you might think of it as just a way

944
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,900
to sort of fund that development

945
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,660
if you also get a nice service out of it, you know?

946
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,580
One other thing to consider as part of this,

947
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,700
should I self-host it?

948
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,100
Should I use the hosted version?

949
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,900
Is what happens if your internet goes out in your house?

950
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,580
You know, you have all of the passwords

951
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,740
for everything in this database,

952
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,220
and suddenly, okay, I can't log into Amazon right now.

953
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,020
I can't buy this pot of dog food that I need to buy.

954
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,540
Okay, well, I'll just go to Walmart instead.

955
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,100
But there are other things that are more important

956
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,300
that I need passwords for.

957
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,340
And if my internet's out for half a day,

958
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,660
for some reason, thanks AT&T,

959
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,940
then, you know, I need to have access to these things.

960
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,220
So for me, it's worth the price of admission.

961
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,380
I think it's worth mentioning, too,

962
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,540
that the software provides

963
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,460
some pretty handy functionality outside of passwords.

964
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,780
It'll offer secure credit card information storage

965
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,300
and address book and secure note storage.

966
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,900
It's just nice to have some organization

967
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,180
kind of all in one place for that.

968
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,420
And so to answer your question about offline,

969
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,860
so last night, just to see how far I could push things,

970
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,700
I decided to do a bunch of crazy stuff.

971
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,620
And the way I was able to do this safely

972
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,540
was I used a tool called Podman,

973
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,020
but it's also available as a Docker image,

974
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,940
and I Podman installed or pulled down

975
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,340
the Bitwarden Rust implementation,

976
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,740
set up something that only works on local host,

977
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,540
so I just go to local host on my laptop,

978
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,580
and I was able to play with all kinds of crazy features,

979
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,060
like importing large swaths of my password database

980
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,660
into a team database without risking

981
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,900
actually exposing passwords and stuff.

982
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,660
And the entire thing worked offline.

983
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,860
I connected the mobile version of my phone to my laptop,

984
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,660
and I was able to connect the Chrome extension

985
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,460
to the local version on my laptop,

986
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,740
and it all worked beautifully.

987
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,260
Really, like you could run,

988
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,700
if you just wanted something on your laptop all the time

989
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,460
that only listened to local host, it works great.

990
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,140
Or if you want something that only works on your LAN,

991
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,420
and so you sync to your mobile device

992
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,660
when you're on your LAN, you can absolutely do that.

993
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,140
I want like mobile access too, but for experimenting,

994
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,020
it was so nice to know that I could have this sort of safety

995
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,900
of it only is accessed by local host.

996
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,060
Whatever I do on this is only on local host,

997
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,380
it won't go anywhere else.

998
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,860
And if it's a failed experiment, just blow it away.

999
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,020
Did you mess around with the Rust version as well,

1000
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,700
server-side, when you did look at self-hosting?

1001
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,620
Yes, I did.

1002
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,780
And what was your reasons for going

1003
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,780
with the community implementation

1004
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,940
versus the main project release?

1005
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,700
I just kind of wanted to experiment

1006
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,460
and see how well it compared,

1007
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,660
because I'd been using the upstream,

1008
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,780
I'm using their hosted service as well at the moment,

1009
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,660
and that is using the other version.

1010
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,420
So I wanted to see how much they matched

1011
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,820
if it felt like the same experience.

1012
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,020
And so far, yeah, I mean, it really does.

1013
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,260
Now, if you do want to play with the other one,

1014
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,020
they've got some instructions

1015
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,340
for manually getting all the right containers set up,

1016
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,260
because it's kind of a bunch,

1017
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,540
and they hook into Docker Compose to get it set up.

1018
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,820
I would suggest if you want to play with that,

1019
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,860
maybe just allocate a new virtual machine or VPS somewhere,

1020
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,380
because it kind of wants to do a whole bunch of things.

1021
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,980
Yeah, that's why I liked the community implementation.

1022
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,300
It's one single...

1023
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,140
It's just simpler, right?

1024
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,820
It's aimed at like a smaller deployment

1025
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,620
just for kind of running something small for yourself,

1026
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,900
and it's smoother to do so.

1027
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,940
And once it's up and running, you just go to the web URL,

1028
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,900
and you've got the administration front end right there,

1029
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,540
and all the software clients can connect to that.

1030
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,740
And it's very straightforward

1031
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,300
if you use the community REST version.

1032
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,740
One thing I'd like to point out

1033
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,740
is with the community version,

1034
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,340
they have a big disclaimer that says,

1035
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,900
whichever client you're using

1036
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,980
do not use the official support channels, come here first.

1037
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,220
Yeah, yeah.

1038
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,020
There's always that aspect of it.

1039
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,900
That's true.

1040
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,620
And as far as Bitward itself,

1041
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,220
it recently, well, I think it was about a year ago,

1042
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,180
almost, they went through an audit,

1043
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,340
and they found a few things, fixed those things.

1044
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,740
We'll have a link to the information about that.

1045
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,260
So it has been audited by a third party as well,

1046
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,100
even though it is a fairly new project,

1047
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,740
it seems really good.

1048
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,900
And it really does seem like it's...

1049
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,020
What I like about it is it's just absolutely everything

1050
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,540
I need and not much more.

1051
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,540
The team management stuff's just the right amount.

1052
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,060
Being able to autofill the credit cards

1053
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,100
or address information and store different profiles

1054
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,060
and identities, that's just right.

1055
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,820
The mobile apps are functional.

1056
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,380
They support some offline caching

1057
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,580
if you don't have a connection.

1058
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,620
Right, yeah, it looks like it's read only.

1059
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,220
I'm not sure you can add new entries,

1060
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,260
but that's all right with me.

1061
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,860
Yeah, you still get read only access.

1062
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,980
So be aware of that.

1063
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,700
But you're right, it's almost stupidly easy to get to.

1064
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,140
I was looking at the docs for the show

1065
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,460
and I'd just run the app image that they provide,

1066
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,740
but it's also, of course, packaged

1067
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,220
and it's flat packs and snaps.

1068
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,740
And basically, it'd be hard not to find it

1069
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,340
on your platform at this point.

1070
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,140
And the web interface works great too.

1071
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:01,980
Very nice.

1072
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,140
So what I'm getting from this is that I can actually use this

1073
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,060
to store my Apple Card credentials

1074
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,980
since I can't carry it in my wallet or my pants, right?

1075
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,740
Oh, too soon, Cheesy.

1076
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,580
That would be a great workaround, yeah.

1077
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,820
I kind of want to take the temperature of the mumble room.

1078
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,940
Popey, I saw you in there.

1079
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,500
Are you using any password managers?

1080
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,620
Have you tried out Bitwarden or LastPass?

1081
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,220
Yep, I exported everything out of LastPass

1082
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,660
and chucked it in Bitwarden a while ago.

1083
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,860
It's great, I love it.

1084
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,660
There's not much more to say.

1085
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,700
No, it just works, right?

1086
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,260
It's just simple and straightforward and clean.

1087
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,660
I did an export as well, and I'll link to a guide.

1088
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,740
There's just a couple of notes.

1089
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,700
It doesn't directly import the file

1090
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,220
like it does for other password managers.

1091
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,060
There's an extra step,

1092
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,220
but I'll have a link to that in the show notes.

1093
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,460
And yeah, it just totally works,

1094
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,220
really kind of in a unremarkable, remarkable way.

1095
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,700
And their organizational functionality is perfect,

1096
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,220
exactly what I needed to securely share passwords

1097
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,060
with the team.

1098
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,300
And we have it hosted in a way

1099
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,580
that the team can get access to it,

1100
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,300
but it's not publicly accessible.

1101
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,100
Pretty happy with the end result.

1102
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,580
And I think the last time I tried to switch away

1103
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,980
from LastPass, it was a total mess.

1104
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,660
And so I tried this process a couple of times.

1105
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:17,740
And I will warn you, if you have sketchy connectivity

1106
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,620
when you do the import of your LastPass database,

1107
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,980
for some reason, it will import all of the passwords,

1108
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,860
but it will drop all the folders.

1109
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,740
If that happens, you can essentially eject

1110
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,420
the entire password database and re-import again.

1111
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,620
So if the first time you import

1112
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,860
and you don't get your folders

1113
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,580
that you all have set up in LastPass,

1114
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,980
just drop it all and import again,

1115
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,980
and it will bring them in.

1116
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,620
In like three or four times that I did this,

1117
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,140
that happened to me once.

1118
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:42,980
Yeah, interesting.

1119
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,940
But I did a little Google search,

1120
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,220
and other people say it happens,

1121
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,100
and they say it's when you have intermittent connectivity,

1122
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,580
and I did at that time.

1123
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,980
Because it's like it's going out to resolve the favicons

1124
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,860
and stuff, and when that process dies,

1125
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,580
I guess it just doesn't create the folders or whatever.

1126
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,700
I didn't go any further than that,

1127
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,900
but it seemed to be the case, so keep an eye out for that.

1128
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,580
But otherwise, love it.

1129
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,660
Yeah, I was pleased.

1130
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,820
I had several different versions and generations

1131
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,320
and types of KeePass files from the different clients

1132
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,160
I'd used over the years,

1133
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,180
and all of them just sort of imported fine.

1134
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,340
The client version for Linux, the desktop application,

1135
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,300
is available as a snap and as a flat pack.

1136
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,140
And app image.

1137
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,220
Yep, and an app image, and it's sandboxed, I believe,

1138
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,420
as both snap and flat pack.

1139
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,260
I believe so.

1140
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,660
They're in a sandbox, so that's nice and safe

1141
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,500
for a password manager.

1142
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,780
They've also got a little CLI.

1143
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,660
It is node-based, so it's not the most lightweight,

1144
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,260
but they've got a little handy CLI client

1145
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,660
to interact with the vaults, too.

1146
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,540
Yeah, that's right, I wanted to mention that part,

1147
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,300
because that is actually pretty cool.

1148
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,100
It's nerd-friendly, right, but it also kind of

1149
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,160
is good enough to work for your family members

1150
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,220
if you're gonna go that route.

1151
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,940
We will have a link, again, in the show notes,

1152
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,940
linuxunplug.com slash 316, to an article I used

1153
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,460
where it's a one-line command that you copy and paste,

1154
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,380
and you can fire up an experimental container

1155
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,220
and play with this thing.

1156
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,500
We're not talking like it's a big investment.

1157
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,540
Really a big, high recommendation of Bitwarden

1158
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,620
from the team.

1159
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,500
I've been using it now for just a couple of days,

1160
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,380
but it was smoother than any other transition

1161
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,140
I've ever done, so I'm pretty optimistic,

1162
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,040
and you're using it, Alex is using it.

1163
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,500
I'm picking up a theme here.

1164
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,460
Chris is a little resistant to change,

1165
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,460
but once he does, he's like,

1166
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,980
oh my god, this is so much better.

1167
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,900
As long as it's good, it's gotta meet

1168
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,740
all the various needs of the fissure.

1169
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,340
Key paths just didn't do it for me,

1170
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,700
because for key paths, I then needed to rely

1171
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,300
on either Dropbox or Sync.

1172
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,740
There was all this extra stuff to it

1173
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,100
that didn't work for me.

1174
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,080
But this solves those problems.

1175
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,700
I was really sad to see LastPass be acquired,

1176
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,980
and the general posture of that acquisition

1177
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,700
didn't sit right with me,

1178
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,220
and finding Bitwarden was like an oasis

1179
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,300
in the desert at that point,

1180
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,660
and I'm really happy to see how this project

1181
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,900
has matured over the last couple of years.

1182
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,340
It's great.

1183
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,700
Now, if you're curious about their types of encryption

1184
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,540
that they use and whatnot, they have that explained, too.

1185
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,140
I'll have a link to that in the show notes,

1186
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:50,300
and also a link to the audit that they went through,

1187
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,300
so you can give that a read.

1188
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,360
It's always good to be paranoid

1189
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,200
about these kinds of things,

1190
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,560
so we definitely encourage being paranoid

1191
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,320
when it comes to your password manager.

1192
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,800
So check out, we've tried to really pack

1193
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,740
the show notes full of links

1194
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,760
to help everybody who's doing some research,

1195
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,500
but really good recommendation.

1196
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,080
If there's something wrong with it,

1197
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,260
we're all screwed at this point,

1198
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,180
because I'm putting our team passwords in there.

1199
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,220
Watch out!

1200
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,180
I do have one question about Bitwarden.

1201
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,420
Does it also support secure notes and stuff

1202
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,860
that are similar to the feature set that LastPass has?

1203
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,620
Secure notes, secure autofill.

1204
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,460
It also can do two-factor, too,

1205
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,600
if you enable those features.

1206
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,440
And I did.

1207
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,780
I turned on two-factor using Authy.

1208
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,940
It was really straightforward and simple,

1209
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,540
and took me two minutes, maybe, at most.

1210
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,200
Using even just my local installation,

1211
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,160
I didn't have to...

1212
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,820
It seems when you install it locally,

1213
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,340
it has identified you as a paid Pro user,

1214
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,300
because my stuff in my menu says Pro users.

1215
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,660
Maybe because I'm using the free implementation.

1216
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,340
But either way, yeah,

1217
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,180
really nice, smooth two-factor process.

1218
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,260
I'm like, okay, well, that's just great.

1219
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,180
Like, LastPass is kinda clunky.

1220
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,820
You gotta go through some process.

1221
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,620
I've never seen you complain about that.

1222
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,340
Ha ha, yeah.

1223
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,260
Is anyone familiar with any hardware sticks

1224
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,100
that you can use with this?

1225
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:03,920
Is it compatible?

1226
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,760
I imagine it is.

1227
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,100
It would be a fairly standard feature,

1228
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,740
but anyone have any experience with it?

1229
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,240
Believe it works with the Yuba key,

1230
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,860
and there's a few others that I'm not as familiar with.

1231
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,880
So that's definitely a route you can go.

1232
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,500
It can, although I don't really like to recommend it,

1233
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,540
also do two-factor via email.

1234
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,180
I think that's a bit of a stinker.

1235
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,400
And it can also do some recovery code stuff.

1236
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,020
So there's some nice stuff to dig into there.

1237
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,100
It seems like the project has some really good plans

1238
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,840
down the road for that area as well.

1239
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,160
But I think, I know it's a bit of a compromise,

1240
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,220
but the thing that I really appreciate about Authy

1241
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,660
is cross-platform, and I can move between devices

1242
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,820
and not lose my two-factor tokens.

1243
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,660
Right.

1244
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,900
And so it's just that bit of compromise

1245
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,740
between something that isn't absolutely as secure

1246
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:52,540
as like an RSA token, but, you know what I mean,

1247
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,660
or something that, but it isn't something

1248
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,300
that is just as dumb as like SMS text or email.

1249
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,120
It's like.

1250
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:00,960
And of course, I mean, if you're not,

1251
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,220
if something's not too unworkable,

1252
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,060
you're not gonna use it,

1253
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,800
and that's not getting you any security wins.

1254
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,300
Right, so the nice thing about Authy is

1255
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,380
it lets you have all of your two-factor services

1256
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,620
in one spot and it synchronizes them across your devices.

1257
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,600
It's like if you lose a phone or you switch devices

1258
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,640
and you forget to back up your two-factor stuff,

1259
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,900
you're not SOL.

1260
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,380
And so the fact that it works with that,

1261
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,580
works with my workflow,

1262
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,340
I'm not necessarily recommending it for everybody,

1263
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,320
but it is really nice.

1264
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,820
Now we have some feedback to get to.

1265
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,040
We don't do that too often in the show,

1266
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,900
but we just had some great notes on the subreddit

1267
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,340
from our Wayland episode.

1268
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,860
We spent the weekend with Wayland

1269
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,180
and got some good feedback.

1270
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,660
He says, you guys talked about Tilex.

1271
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,220
This is the hoot.

1272
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,740
It's not with threes and zeros.

1273
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,040
He says, you talked about Tilex,

1274
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,340
but I still recommend Guake.

1275
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,660
It's very stable and supports split windows these days.

1276
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,500
It does.

1277
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,120
And he thought he'd also mention backup tools.

1278
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,820
He doesn't like to trust companies like Google,

1279
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,640
Microsoft, or Amazon with any data,

1280
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,580
but Spider Oak One, I have to recommend, he says.

1281
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,580
Also was recommended by Edward Snowden.

1282
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,940
Also, Mr. Poot, I've recommended it too.

1283
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,660
I was gonna say, yeah, you used to be a big Spider Oak fan.

1284
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,500
I used to back up all my different cloud services

1285
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,620
to Spider Oak.

1286
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,460
I might do it again.

1287
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,300
It's pretty great.

1288
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,120
It's pretty great.

1289
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,060
Spider Oak's pretty solid.

1290
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,900
Anyways, oh, he signs it as Guybrush,

1291
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,340
which is much easier to read than the other one.

1292
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,540
And our last bit of feedback, One Tune More writes,

1293
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,860
the Wayland future is like electric cars are the future.

1294
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,500
That's kind of, I like this.

1295
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,120
For a very long time, they were good in theory,

1296
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,500
but recently they've been good for some uses.

1297
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,740
Now they're starting to be good for the masses.

1298
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,820
I think we said something similar in the show.

1299
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,940
He writes, what Wayland is, Wayland being smooth

1300
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:46,460
really means that Mudder has become really smooth.

1301
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,820
Since that's Gnome Shell's compositor,

1302
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,020
Mudder has to implement everything which Xorg used to do.

1303
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,220
So when you guys are talking about Wayland being smooth,

1304
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,600
you're really talking about Gnome Shell being smooth,

1305
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,300
which is a fair point and something they're working on.

1306
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,700
He writes, I'm predicting Mirror is going to be a huge deal

1307
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,580
in a few years.

1308
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,180
They are working with projects on standardizing protocols,

1309
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,500
for example, adopting a layer shell protocol from WL Roots

1310
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,460
and permitting shells built with Mirror

1311
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,140
to add protocols as extensions.

1312
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,700
Going forward, I predict new compositors and desktops

1313
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,660
will choose Mirror or WL Roots to build on,

1314
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,860
depending on whether they want to write a plugin

1315
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,780
for a pre-built display server like Mirror

1316
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,020
or control their own window management rules

1317
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,700
and behavior like WL Roots.

1318
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,380
Mirror is going to be a big part

1319
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,500
of a lot of projects' futures, he says.

1320
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,860
Hey, I think that's spot on.

1321
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,220
For a lot of projects that have to implement-

1322
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,700
Right, you need some helper framework

1323
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,300
because there's a lot to implement now.

1324
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,420
Today, I saw news about the next release of XFCE,

1325
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,580
which is expected in a year,

1326
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,860
and they're already saying no GTK, no Wayland.

1327
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,020
No GTK4, I should say, and no Wayland.

1328
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:53,860
Sorry.

1329
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,660
Yeah, I mean, it's not too surprising.

1330
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:58,220
Also, interesting technical detail about Flameshot.

1331
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,260
That was our screenshot tool that we recommended

1332
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,340
that we all really like.

1333
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,180
It doesn't actually use the Wayland protocol.

1334
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,500
It works with KD and Gnome Shell

1335
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,500
using Dbus for communication.

1336
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,620
Yeah, and they are clear about that.

1337
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,940
If you go look at the Flameshot docs,

1338
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,500
it's basically like, well, these two big guys

1339
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,340
gave us hooks.

1340
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,020
We're going to use them because it makes our stuff work.

1341
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:17,140
That's what that means, is that's your limitation.

1342
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:17,980
Yeah, yeah.

1343
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,540
So he says it'll be quite a while

1344
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,420
before we see the dust settle on all this Wayland stuff.

1345
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,780
Hey, it's an active project, right?

1346
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,100
Yeah, if you didn't catch our episode,

1347
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,300
we spent the weekend with Wayland last weekend.

1348
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,100
I actually am still using it.

1349
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:36,100
On my laptop, I, over the weekend, very proudly,

1350
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,820
played some No Man's Sky using Proton on Wayland

1351
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,060
using an eGPU with a Bluetooth headphones

1352
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,220
and a Bluetooth mouse.

1353
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,460
I think you have to be clear at this point.

1354
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,580
You did that on Linux.

1355
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,500
Yeah, I did.

1356
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,420
And the only downside is my,

1357
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,540
Bose headphones, they convert to phone mode

1358
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,380
when you use voice.

1359
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,340
And so I sounded like I was on a telephone call from 1920,

1360
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,660
but that wasn't Linux's fault.

1361
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,500
Yeah, no, no.

1362
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,780
And you probably sounded pretty good.

1363
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,300
Chris did a whole bit where he was 1938 World's Fair.

1364
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,420
Chris, it was very funny.

1365
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,260
Yeah, it was great.

1366
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,100
It really was great.

1367
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,420
Yeah, but that was the only downside.

1368
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,420
I mean, we played No Man's Sky for a long time,

1369
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,580
and I didn't have a single issue.

1370
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:19,540
I mean, this is one eGPU cable into my laptop,

1371
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,860
which only has Intel graphics, on Wayland

1372
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,620
playing a Windows game, okay?

1373
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,260
Using a Bluetooth mouse without lag

1374
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:30,580
with Bluetooth headphones

1375
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,380
where the sound is matched up with the gunfire.

1376
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,220
That's crazy.

1377
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,060
I can't even with that.

1378
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,180
We played for almost three hours or so.

1379
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,900
Flawlessly, I played flawlessly.

1380
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,140
You were playing on top of Wayland and never crashed,

1381
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,140
but I think Drew had a different setup

1382
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,580
and had crashed a couple of times.

1383
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,300
So I wonder what the difference there was.

1384
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,100
He has a slightly nicer AMD card than I have,

1385
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,900
and he seems to have all of the issues.

1386
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,740
He has a lot of problems.

1387
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:56,540
I wonder if it's just the support thing there

1388
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,940
on the AMD card then.

1389
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,980
Maybe.

1390
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,820
I kind of cheaped out.

1391
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:04,380
I got like a mid-range card since I figured it's in an eGPU.

1392
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,540
So why go like the top of the line?

1393
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,620
And it's just been super solid.

1394
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,300
The only downside is there's this AMD reset bug.

1395
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,140
So when the machine goes to sleep or anything like that,

1396
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:17,060
to get the eGPU, you have to go to the top of the line.

1397
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,900
Get the eGPU working again.

1398
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,540
I have to completely power down, physically power off the eGPU,

1399
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,180
and then power everything back up

1400
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,740
before my eGPU works again.

1401
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,860
It's just like the old days of pass through that.

1402
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,900
You used to have to do that with every single video card,

1403
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,860
never mind just a few specific ones.

1404
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,380
And there's some ways you can fix it,

1405
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:37,020
depending on the type of ROM that's on your card

1406
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:37,540
and all that.

1407
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,940
Sell it and buy the right card.

1408
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:39,700
That's the answer.

1409
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,060
Oh, yeah?

1410
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,900
There is a specific card where I won't even have to mess with

1411
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:42,180
it?

1412
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,220
Just find one that doesn't have the reset bug.

1413
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:47,500
And as we talked about in our VFIA episode a little while

1414
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,700
ago, the right hardware is almost more important

1415
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,780
than the right software.

1416
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,740
Really, it's truly remarkable that that whole stack's

1417
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,460
working, though.

1418
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,220
And you know, it's using X-Wayland in there

1419
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,460
to play the game and all that.

1420
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,980
It's just mind blowing.

1421
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,940
I want to share a pic before we go.

1422
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,260
USB top.

1423
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,340
It's like the top utility we all know and love,

1424
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:09,220
but it shows an estimated instantaneous bandwidth

1425
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,060
on your USB buses and devices.

1426
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,980
You can see who's hogging up all them USB bandwidths.

1427
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:15,700
How neat is this?

1428
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,620
That is neat.

1429
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,620
I gave it a little compile before the show.

1430
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:21,740
It seemed like maybe it's packaged in some repositories,

1431
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,660
but it wasn't available to me that way.

1432
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:27,260
It was easy to compile, and it does exactly what it says.

1433
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,820
You just sort of check, and you run it up,

1434
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,860
and then it shows you all your different buses

1435
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,540
and devices on them, and then if there's any activity.

1436
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,940
You do have to do a bit of legwork.

1437
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,580
You do.

1438
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:38,220
And you have to mod probe USB Mon, like all that kind of stuff.

1439
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,500
You had to do all that in a minute.

1440
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,020
Indeed.

1441
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,220
Yeah, but once you get it going, you

1442
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,980
don't even need to run it as root necessarily.

1443
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,680
As long as you're on a more modern Linux,

1444
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,060
you can just run USB top, boom.

1445
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,500
There's all your bandwidth hogs.

1446
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,500
It's pretty fun.

1447
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,340
So we'll put a link to that in the show notes.

1448
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:57,940
Good luck, because yeah, six months ago it was active,

1449
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,380
but I think the core code is about six years old.

1450
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,140
So good luck.

1451
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,100
Travel safely, but we believe in you.

1452
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,180
We'll have a link in the show notes for that as well.

1453
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:06,780
USB top.

1454
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:07,580
How about that?

1455
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,780
And I think it's really cool too for those little

1456
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,700
single-board computers where everything's on one bus.

1457
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,740
So if you are building a NAS with a single-board computer,

1458
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,220
you can actually kind of measure that throughput

1459
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:21,760
and know if you're getting enough throughput

1460
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,540
or if that's your bottleneck.

1461
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,020
This is amazing.

1462
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,380
I've never seen this before.

1463
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,660
And it's in Ubuntu after you install USB top.

1464
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,660
Jeez, come on, WestPen.

1465
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,060
What are you running over there?

1466
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,460
Aren't you running Ubuntu?

1467
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:33,940
Yeah.

1468
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,180
You didn't have to build it.

1469
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,460
You just did it.

1470
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,780
You're so funny.

1471
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,020
I didn't check because I'm on that.

1472
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,620
I mean, the search doesn't find it.

1473
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,060
But maybe I typed the right thing.

1474
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,260
Maybe Popey knows how to Ubuntu better, though.

1475
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,020
I'm sure he does.

1476
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:46,620
It's possible.

1477
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,180
I hope so.

1478
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,020
It's awesome.

1479
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,260
Well, it's good to have you back, Popey.

1480
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,860
And you didn't get a sunburn, did you?

1481
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,580
Nope, not at all.

1482
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,380
Didn't go outside.

1483
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,700
You didn't go outside.

1484
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:54,780
I know that's false.

1485
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,220
It's too damn hot outside.

1486
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,180
I'm not going outside.

1487
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,500
You can't help it.

1488
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,820
I got a sunburn walking from the hotel across a parking lot

1489
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:06,060
to a Mexican restaurant in Texas last time.

1490
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:09,100
Just the 10 minutes back and forth, I got a sunburn.

1491
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,700
I'm blessed with slightly darker skin than you, though, Chris.

1492
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,700
So I don't tend to get burned.

1493
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,180
You're blessed in many ways, Popey.

1494
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,660
But that's for another show.

1495
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:20,660
Anyways, go check out Ubuntu Podcast and User Air,

1496
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,620
two great shows.

1497
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,020
And while you're at it, if you're on Telegram,

1498
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,420
go get telecast with Popey, recently co-starring

1499
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,620
the one, the only Martin Wimpress from America's

1500
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,940
friendliest airport.

1501
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,660
Go check that out.

1502
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,260
It's great.

1503
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,500
Popey, thank you for joining us.

1504
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,020
Thank you.

1505
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,900
Everybody out there, thank you for joining us.

1506
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,980
I am so elated to announce the self-hosted podcast.

1507
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,900
Again, don't forget our meetup, meetup.com

1508
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,020
slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

1509
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,940
If you're in the Lexington area, come join us.

1510
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,500
And then check out selfhosted.show

1511
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,420
slash subscribe for the RSS feed.

1512
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,460
I should be live from Raleigh next Tuesday.

1513
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,420
So come see if I can pull that one off.

1514
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,980
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1515
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:14,840
See ya.

1516
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:38,880
All right, all right, so here's the, it's just not an 1804.

1517
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,920
Newer versions have it.

1518
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,920
All right, you're off the hook, Wes.

1519
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,920
So Chris, what's this relationship thing we were going to post show?

1520
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,920
Oh yeah, right.

1521
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,120
Well, I mean, it really does, I don't know, like, okay, for example, I'm about to get

1522
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,840
on an airplane and fly down to Raleigh and then we're going to get in a car and drive

1523
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,120
for seven hours to go do something.

1524
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:04,720
Like a new show is very much like, kind of like a polyamorous relationship where you've

1525
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,780
already got a couple of wives and now you've got to work a new wife into the, or husband,

1526
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,280
or husband into the mix.

1527
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,120
Well, you've got to be fair, but you'd still have to, you know, sort of prioritize.

1528
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,120
Right.

1529
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,120
There's a lot of things to juggle.

1530
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,440
Well, it's true, because then I sit here and I think to myself, am I spending enough time

1531
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,640
with Linux unplugged?

1532
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:24,440
And now I've got this new show I'm doing, you know, like, it's a lot of pressure.

1533
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,360
We're a very jealous show.

1534
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:30,160
And the truth be told, like, I know that a new show needs a little bit extra of attention

1535
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,040
and it's just a lot to take on and I've got to be there when I'm sick.

1536
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,320
I've got to be there when I'm healthy.

1537
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,320
I've got to be there in tough and bad and hard and good times.

1538
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:42,840
Like it's, it is a different form of a relationship, but some, some weeks you won't have content,

1539
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,780
you won't know what to do, but you'll have to struggle through and you stick, we stick

1540
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:50,360
with it, you stick with it and it, it's, it sounds silly, but it's, it's so many ways

1541
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,960
there's a lot of analogies.

1542
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:57,280
And so when I'm like really getting committed to something, I freak out a little bit.

1543
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,000
I freak out just not that I have commitment issues, obviously I'm married, but I just

1544
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,280
kind of like, I actualize the amount of commitment I am making because this thing could go on

1545
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,440
for a decade.

1546
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,440
Can I, uh, can I pull out at this point?

1547
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,440
Is that an option?

1548
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,440
I know my freaking us.

1549
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,440
We're all in now, buddy.

1550
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,440
We're all in.

1551
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,440
I've already bought my tickets and I'm headed your way.

1552
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:37,520
I'm getting on a plane to London tonight.
