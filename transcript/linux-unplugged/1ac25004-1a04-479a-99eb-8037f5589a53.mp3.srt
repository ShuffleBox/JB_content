00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
Just missed it, but Debian turned 27 since the last time we were gathered here on the podcast.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:13,440
27th anniversary. How about that? Happy birthday, Debian. You know, we may take you for granted, but I think we're all glad you're still around.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:20,560
Wide variety of hardware support, a large actively maintained software archive, and a packaging system

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:30,040
that made Linux seem possible. Might not use you directly every day, but I appreciate you.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:43,040
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Episode 367, Mr. Payne.

6
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:51,840
I like that we color coordinated this week, just because. Well, you know, we have so much to get into.

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,600
We have some news that we'll start things off with and then something that is applicable to all of you.

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:08,120
I have data to back this up. We'll do a roundup of podcasts, catchers, the ones that we like the best for the desktop, mobile and the web.

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:15,600
It is our podcatcher playoff coming up in a little bit, plus pics and feedback. And to help us chew on all of that, Drew and Cheezer here.

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,320
Hello, guys. Hello, Internet. Hello. Hi, gentlemen. I see you're all wearing purple, too. That's nice. Look at us.

11
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,880
We're just we're just a matching outfit. Now, we really, really need our panel of experts for this one.

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:36,600
So I'm going to just right here before I go any further, without any more delay, before any more segues, before I can think of another thing to delay this.

13
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,480
And I'm not just going to keep talking here. I'm going to introduce our virtual lug. Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

14
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:49,640
Hello. Hello. I was psyching your minds out. I was just messing with you a little bit there. I'm sorry.

15
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,720
Hey, guys, thanks for being here. There is 32 of you. Wow. In the virtual lug today. What good friends we have.

16
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:02,960
And I see that we have a couple of guests from the Manjaro Project that will be chatting with us in a few moments.

17
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:10,360
But I wanted to start with some news and probably let's do a little shout out since we were just talking about Debian.

18
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,920
They have a call for artwork. Cheesy noticed this and threw a link in the show notes.

19
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,800
So this might be something people who maybe couldn't contribute code to Debian, maybe they could contribute a little at their art.

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:31,240
You know, like you're at Westpain, you're an artiste. Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking back fondly to a few of my paintings I've hung on the wall.

21
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,560
They didn't last long. Oh, yeah. But yeah, that's all we really had to say on that, I suppose. Right, Cheese?

22
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,480
Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's pretty much it. Just get your get your artwork into the Debian project and there'll be a link in the show notes.

23
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:52,400
Needs to be submitted by October 15th, I believe. So get in there, submit your artwork and find your wallpaper on the next Debian Bullseye release.

24
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,320
The only thing that's going to be awkward for you, Wes, is the only thing you're good at drawing is Spider-Man. So that's.

25
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,680
Yeah, but I'm really good.

26
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,880
I don't know how they're going to work that into the Debian branding, though. That's on them. That's true. It is really good, though.

27
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:12,560
So Google has made a lot of news in the Linux community this week under the radar of the desktop scene.

28
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:20,840
But there's been like almost on every major news site that I've seen a story about Google introducing some big block of code, something really awesome.

29
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:28,120
That sounds like it's going to have a ton of advantages. And I just can't really for the life of me care or really even understand what it is.

30
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,840
I guess it's a subsystem that Google is open sourcing that they've already created that they're contributing to the Linux kernel.

31
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,080
That's about the first I took it and then I kind of started to glaze over.

32
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:49,200
Yeah, as you do. OK, well, internally, I think this is really another case of Google uses a ton of Linux and makes enhancements, has the kind of scale where they can run their own custom

33
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:58,920
about kernels, all kinds of internal tooling and systems, and they also serve some giant, you know, very resource intensive websites that, you know, run a lot of the Internet.

34
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:09,400
So internally, they developed what's called an MN user space threading subsystem backed by their Google private switch to Linux kernel API.

35
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:17,640
And they use this for latency sensitive services all over at Google, where you need things like fine grained user space control over scheduling or, you know,

36
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,120
what's running because you might really need, you know, as they say, latency sensitive things.

37
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,560
You have very specific workloads that you're running a whole bunch of and the default Linux kernel scheduling, well, it's just not getting the job done for you.

38
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,720
They've actually just started the work to get this upstream, although I don't know if it was that well received just because they started things with, as you'll see from this presentation

39
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,120
we gave back in 2013 and then not a super thorough review of the patch that they were proposing.

40
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,680
So the kernel maintainers weren't too pleased with that.

41
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,640
So it was a big code dump. And then I go watch this video for more information.

42
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:57,480
Yes. You know, it is interesting, though. There's, you know, plenty of stuff, especially Google's own Go language that uses user mode scheduling where, you know,

43
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:07,520
they've got their own concept of threads, sometimes called schedulers or fibers that are different than using the big, quote unquote, heavyweight baked in kernel threading because, you know,

44
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,320
you just have different concerns. The kernel scheduling, it's got to deal with all kinds of generic workloads.

45
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Right. But you might have stuff that really does have sensitive latency targets or has other guarantees that are needed or just have some special tuning you need to do for your workload.

46
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:29,760
So I get all that. But wasn't this figured out back in the 80s when we had preemptive multitasking versus cooperative multitasking?

47
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:38,320
And we essentially had systems that could only do one application and that application was responsible for all of its own scheduling and it managed everything.

48
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:46,000
But you couldn't run that application alongside another. So then developers and engineers went, oh, you know, what we need is the system to handle this.

49
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,800
If we did this at the system level, then it could be aware of all of the applications and it could make much smarter decisions based on the global needs of the system.

50
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,400
I thought we already solved this. Well, you know, in technology, it's all circular.

51
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:06,640
We're just coming back. And when you're running a whole bunch of, you know, one type of specific application, you kind of have different concerns at times.

52
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:14,560
Right. So in an application instance, there's times where that application maybe is for performance reasons or sophistication reasons.

53
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,600
It needs to just essentially be in charge of that kind of stuff on its own.

54
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,920
Well, there's also other benefits, too. It can be really nice as a concept to think about.

55
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:28,280
You know, a lot of these languages today, you know, you have evented things like node.js or you've got stuff using async away like Python or JavaScript.

56
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,040
And all these are, you know, you have a highly concurrent system oftentimes waiting on things over the network.

57
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:44,720
If you send, you know, a million web requests, then all those servers are very slow with threads that can sometimes be difficult to manage, at least, you know, some of the time under some performance constraints.

58
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:54,600
So with this, if, say, this code was accepted to the kernel and people used it outside of Google, but let's just say all these things are given and were accepted.

59
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:05,400
Would that mean you kind of best of both worlds where that scheduling and that and that stuff is happening at the system level, but the application can kind of write to it, it can take advantage of it, doesn't have to implement it itself?

60
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,880
Yeah, I mean, I think really it'll just be some better support in the kernel to support these applications.

61
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:17,440
You know, you can already certainly do this and write your own user mode scheduler just, you know, by yourself on top of the existing schedule that's running.

62
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:25,960
I think this just makes the Linux kernel a little better at handling programs running under it with some new hooks that those programs can use and get, you know, nice performance.

63
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:32,320
So they're targeting kernel 5.9, but it doesn't sound like we have a clear signal from the kernel team if they're actually going to accept it yet.

64
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,560
But that is the trajectory if everything goes as planned.

65
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,800
Yeah. And so far, I think we've just seen, you know, the initial patch series.

66
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,200
It's a, you know, fairly decent size change here.

67
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,000
So as usual, it takes time.

68
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,720
Yeah. Well, I'm glad you explained it to me because I grok that it was somewhat important just because of the amount of coverage it was getting.

69
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,520
But I couldn't quite grok the, you know, I find it interesting sort of in the historic perspective, too.

70
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:02,200
If you think about, you know, containers, a lot a lot of those concepts coming out of stuff that Google figured out they needed inside because they were doing all kinds of interesting,

71
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,400
neat things, pushing the boundaries of Linux.

72
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,120
And in some sense, I see this as the same.

73
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,600
Yeah, I follow you there. Oh, watch out.

74
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:15,240
Watch out. What is this? Oh, my gosh. It's a rust update.

75
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:22,360
In the Mozilla news, it came out that part of that large layoff that we talked about last week,

76
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:31,640
some of the rust team at Mozilla was getting laid off, but more importantly, Mozilla also plays a financial and legal ownership role over some of rust activities.

77
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,800
So the question was, what now?

78
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:44,920
Well, today, just a little bit before we started the old podcast here, there was a post over on the Rust blog and it starts laying the foundation for Rust's future.

79
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:56,160
This was posted by the Rust core team on August 18th, 2020, and they start the Rust project was originally conceived in 2010 as a Mozilla research project.

80
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,960
But the long term goal has always been to establish rust as a self sustaining project.

81
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:11,280
Then in 2015, with the launch of Rust 1.0, Rust established its project direction and governance independent of the Mozilla organization.

82
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:18,960
Since then, Rust has been operating as an autonomous organization, with Mozilla being a prominent and consistent financial and legal sponsor.

83
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:28,040
On Tuesday, August 11th, 2020, Mozilla announced their decision to restructure the company to lay off around 250 people.

84
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,720
That is news that we're still processing. We're still hearing about people.

85
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:38,120
It was a pretty important batch of people. Yeah. And there's been websites launched to help them find work.

86
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,200
That's been really interesting to see. So there's been a lot of outreach, but it's it's really been sad.

87
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:50,240
Anyways, resuming from the blog, they say when Mozilla had to lay off around 250 people, including folks who are active members of the Rust project and the Rust community.

88
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:57,520
Understandably, these layoffs have generated a lot of uncertainty and confusion about the impact on Rust and the project itself.

89
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,920
Our goal in this post is to address those concerns. And they talk a bit about it.

90
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:09,040
They talk about also sort of the unfortunate timing of these layoffs during the pandemic, which that really is so true.

91
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,560
It really is a shame that it had to happen during the pandemic. Nobody should lose their job right now.

92
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:24,840
It's really unfortunate. But they talk about how this and the lessons from this and other things have come together to lay the foundation to launch a foundation.

93
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:32,640
Yeah, you know, it's interesting because they write, while we were able to be successful with Mozilla's assistance for quite a while,

94
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,960
we've reached a point where it's difficult to operate without a legal name, address and bank account.

95
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,840
And yeah, all right. At some point, that does make sense. If you just need to go through Mozilla for everything, you can say you're independent in governance.

96
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:50,040
But are you really? How does the Rust project sign a contract has become a question we can no longer put off.

97
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,480
Yeah, that's awkward. Yeah. And this is something that's been in the works for a while.

98
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,120
They write on the blog last year, we began investigating the idea of creating an independent Rust foundation.

99
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,920
Members of the Rust team with prior experience at open source foundations got together to look at the current landscape.

100
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,600
Building on that work, the Rust core team and Mozilla are happy to announce plans to create a Rust foundation.

101
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,480
The Rust core team's goal is to have the first iteration of the foundation up and running by the end of the year.

102
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,960
This foundation's first task will be something Rust is already great at, taking ownership.

103
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,480
This time, the resource is legal rather than something in a program.

104
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,480
The various trademarks and domain names associated with Rust, Cargo and crates.io will move into the foundation,

105
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,720
which will also take financial responsibility for the costs they incur.

106
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:46,480
This doesn't make for compelling content or a great blog post or an awesome YouTube video.

107
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,160
But the work that goes into the administrative stuff is a lot.

108
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,240
It's a lot of expense. It involves way more lawyers than it should.

109
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,080
And it is a many, many, many, many, many month process.

110
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,080
And it's something that just doesn't get talked about a lot because it's not very compelling.

111
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,000
It's it's the minutiae of open source, but it's really in business stuff.

112
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,720
And now that's what they're taking on. You know, that's what they're doing now.

113
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,000
And boy, do I sympathize with where they're at right now, because it's important work that needs to get done.

114
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,400
But it's not work that gets any code necessarily directly.

115
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,120
It's all the stuff behind the scenes that you have to get right so you can keep going on.

116
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,400
Yeah. So it's like if you're a developer, all you want to do is code, code, code, code and make great stuff.

117
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,520
But meanwhile, you're doing these emails and you're calling lawyers and you're doing all this follow up stuff that takes forever

118
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:43,560
and runs massive expense and isn't even clear what the value actually is and how much of it you'll actually have needed to do long term.

119
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,000
It's a process. So I respect that they're going through that.

120
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,880
And they write up for now will remain laser focused on these initial narrow goals for the foundation as an immediate step to the core team.

121
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,600
They have selected members to form a project group driving the efforts to form the foundation itself.

122
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,960
They'll have follow up blog posts and more information and opportunities to give feedback.

123
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,320
They write and they say thank you to they say thank you to their community.

124
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,600
They say thank you to Rust developers for creating such a great ecosystem.

125
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,840
They say thank you to Mozilla for helping them.

126
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,400
Yeah. I mean, they had Mozilla has been a big backer over us.

127
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,400
This seems like a pretty big step for this language.

128
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,800
You know, a language getting its own foundation is a certain kind of step in its life course.

129
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,040
Like it's not it's not like a code development.

130
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,040
It's not like a big version number, but it's still like a very important milestone.

131
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,840
Yeah. I mean, you know, breaking away from the shores of Mozilla, striking out on its own.

132
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,560
And, you know, you've seen wide adoption at companies outside of Mozilla now, too.

133
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,280
So it's kind of got this stronger, wider community base.

134
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,240
You know, we need is an open source betting platform that, you know, maybe just for funny money.

135
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,160
But we take like Linux tokens and we bet on how long until they get gobbled up by the Linux Foundation.

136
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,680
Like, what do you say? You're like, what are the odds? Right.

137
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,560
And it's just who knows? Maybe never like that could also be one.

138
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:06,080
But then how would you win? But you just got to wonder, will they end up getting consumed by the foundation of all foundations?

139
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,200
The Mothership Foundation, maybe probably depends on how many important tools over the years.

140
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,440
If we actually see if we start seeing some, you know, Rust kernel modules ship.

141
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,600
All right. Well, please make sure your podcast is in the upright position.

142
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,720
We'll be getting to our podcast catcher playoff in a little bit.

143
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,160
But first, we had a little change in the managerial community that showed up on our radar.

144
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,120
And we thought, let's chat with the team to see what's going on.

145
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,080
They write on their form, our forms malfunctioned and all the uploaded images were lost.

146
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,680
We made an effort to recover the lost files, but the backups and archives were affected as well.

147
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,640
We don't yet know the root cause for sure.

148
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,800
But our service provider speculated it might have been due to a botched update.

149
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,720
The missing files left the form in a rather unpleasant state and it could not be cleaned up to a satisfactory condition.

150
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,680
Therefore, we have decided to start from scratch on a new platform to ensure functionality and security on the form.

151
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,160
Philip, welcome back to the show. That must have been a couple of long nights.

152
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,640
Yeah, it was eight p.m. on a Sunday, the 9th of August.

153
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,800
And someone in the forum posted, hey, I cannot see any pictures anymore.

154
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,120
And we said, well, what is going on?

155
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,480
It's always late at night. So disappointed.

156
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,480
It's always an end user who's noticed before you have for some reason because of some series of conditions.

157
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
It's always how it goes.

158
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,760
And so, Philip, I know you brought a guest with you, too. Will you do the introductions for us?

159
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:43,280
Well, it's Matty and he helped a lot and he can talk a lot about what he thought about that as I was all over the servers and checked.

160
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,400
And there was no security risk.

161
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:56,280
It's simply the backups were gone and some pictures were gone and most likely it was an update of a discourse because it was a little funky on this weekend.

162
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:04,440
Oh, man. So, Matty, did you get the panicked call from Philip on this and or the panicked message probably about the forums?

163
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,760
What happened? Tell us the series of events.

164
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:17,960
It has been quite right, but I actually cannot recall anymore because there has been too little sleeping going on for a few days.

165
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,720
Too much stress, not enough sleep.

166
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:29,400
Yeah, we tried to recover the images and get the site back working for a few days.

167
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:40,680
But at one point, we just realized that we really can't get it working properly and it's not going to look nice or be nice to use.

168
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,120
And then we decided that, OK, we're going to start from scratch.

169
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,160
And I think in a way it might even end up being a good thing.

170
00:16:51,160 --> 00:17:01,200
We have refactored the forum, reorganized the categories, and in general, we try to make it even more welcoming place to new users.

171
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,280
It is always kind of nice to start fresh sometimes with forums.

172
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:15,120
I had my butt saved by Alan Jude years ago because we had the Stoked podcast, the official, not the official, the ultimate, because you couldn't call ourselves official.

173
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,240
The Star Trek online podcast, yes, I'm that geek.

174
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,200
And we got we got early info and it was in our forums and nobody else had it.

175
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:31,400
So all of a sudden our forum started blowing up and our host shut us down and no word, no warning, just hard off.

176
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:38,960
And then, of course, a user messages me, hey, Chris, getting a 404 on this.

177
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,560
So I totally can appreciate that position because I think it was about 10 p.m. at night for me.

178
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,440
I was sort of just wrapping up for the evening.

179
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,120
Thank goodness Alan Jude was a night owl.

180
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,600
So, Philip, is your plans to import some of the old stuff or are you guys going to leave the archive up?

181
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:05,920
Now what happens? Because starting fresh means there's a lot of maybe valuable troubleshooting and forum threads that help people do stuff on Manjaro that they're probably going to want access to.

182
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:13,080
Well, in parallel, we also work on the Wiki and the knowledge about what you do and such should be there.

183
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,560
We will try to recover stuff, only what is usable.

184
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:22,880
So there are a lot of junk there as well, because there was some subculture and chit chat going on.

185
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:33,560
And this we want to change, though that's only more focused on the US and Manjaro itself and not about what you drink, what car you drive and what movie you watched last.

186
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,040
So this is something which can go to Facebook or somewhere else, but not in our forums.

187
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:49,040
So with this, we can simply mold it again and have a great community as we started five years ago with the forums.

188
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,680
And hopefully it will be like that again.

189
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,440
Yeah, nice fresh start. Yeah, we'll see.

190
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,120
I signed up, made myself an account.

191
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,760
I don't know if I had one before, so I just thought now why not?

192
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
Now that it's new, go get in now, right?

193
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,280
Get one ready to go. Get one of the early user IDs.

194
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Like that's even a thing anymore, but that's still how I think.

195
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,440
Well, gentlemen, good work on just getting something back up.

196
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:19,440
I know it's never perfect because, of course, there'll be a large, large legacy of user accounts and posts that people are going to want access to that they're going to want.

197
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,920
So there's going to be some upset folks.

198
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,400
I can totally appreciate that position on the Internet now.

199
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,760
But having been in this kind of similar thing where it's like, oh, man, this is not again going back to what we were talking about earlier.

200
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,560
It's like this is not the core thing.

201
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,360
We were just talking about this with Rust.

202
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:43,240
You guys want to focus on making a distribution, not necessarily running a forum, but it's obviously an important part to having a community around the distribution.

203
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,720
So it's really kind of in one of those tight spots.

204
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,880
And sometimes this is what's ultimately best for the project.

205
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,200
So I think it's pretty great. I signed up and I'll be lurking.

206
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,160
So keep us posted on how things go.

207
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,560
Well, most people say, hey, why is that link not working?

208
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:04,120
I searched it on Google and I said, yes, if you put archive dot in front of it, then you might find it.

209
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,320
So it's take a while until Google will find it.

210
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,480
It does. But time will write that.

211
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,440
Philip, Maddie, thank you very much for joining us.

212
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,320
We have to do something kind of special right now.

213
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:24,200
So last week on the podcast, we spun up a test matrix server on a 2009 Mac Pro that we kind of lightly refurbished.

214
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:31,480
But Ubuntu 2004 on it, cleaned it up and then exposed it to the Internet and said, have at it made live again.

215
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:40,720
And we chose Matrix because in the back of our minds, we're thinking maybe around September, November timeline, maybe in October,

216
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,640
we'll start looking at some overall community platform approach.

217
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,320
And we thought Matrix was a candidate.

218
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,280
So maybe it'd be good to get a little hands on for that.

219
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,720
And we decided to roll it out on this test server.

220
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,760
There's a few other things we considered for the load.

221
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,840
We put it on there and it turned out not much load ran.

222
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,920
Great. Don't skip the episode.

223
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,600
I still think it's worth checking out, but it ran great.

224
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,160
And then we started thinking, well, geez, we could probably pretty sufficiently self host something like this.

225
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,640
This wouldn't take a lot.

226
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,640
And we started talking about it more and more.

227
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:21,000
And the dang test went so well, we thought, you know, let's shut down the test matrix server because that really was just a test matrix server.

228
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,280
We don't want that to be the public thing because it's running on an old Mac Pro.

229
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,640
None of it is set up for production.

230
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,920
We're going to go ahead and we're going to step things up a little bit.

231
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,880
I think this is going to be pretty exciting.

232
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,920
I'm going to shut it down with go ahead and kill the switch.

233
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,520
Here we go. Kill switch has been thrown.

234
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:46,400
Old matrix server test matrix server is shutting down and we decided instead of waiting until the end of summer or October or November,

235
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,480
we're going to launch a new production matrix server today, right now on the show.

236
00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:07,920
So I'm going to flip the switch on colony dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com.

237
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:15,880
We now have an official Jupiter broadcasting matrix server launched right now live on the show colony dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com.

238
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,680
It is a work in progress.

239
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:25,240
We will take a methodical approach to rolling out bridges and we'll be setting up rooms or playing with features right now.

240
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,480
We're still learning, so we appreciate any help and input.

241
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,280
But long term, I want this to be a 10 year community platform for Jupiter broadcasting.

242
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,520
So eventually it won't really matter if you're in the telegram or if you're in the mostly defunct discord,

243
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:49,520
or maybe if I can get the Geek Shed admins to drink a bunch of beer or something, I can get a bridge or something for the IRC too.

244
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,640
And I want to just eventually, but we'll carefully methodically bring everything together.

245
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,040
So there'll be one chat platform for all of the Jupiter broadcasting audience.

246
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:04,400
You can either go directly to the core using matrix today at colony dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com,

247
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,640
and you can rock today with a user ID that's Jupiter broadcasting dot com and matrix.

248
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,480
I think that's pretty cool. I like it.

249
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,840
I'm Chris last Jupiter at Jupiter broadcasting dot com.

250
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,800
Boom. It's great.

251
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,720
And that's the core thing.

252
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,680
So that'll be the core of the platform that's up and running right now.

253
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,080
If you have element or whatever, you can get going.

254
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,800
But if you want to hang out in telegram forever or IRC forever, eventually we'll come for you, too.

255
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,600
But when we do, we'll try to do it the best, cleanest, most user friendly native experience we can with the bridge.

256
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,640
Like there's always going to be something that's not quite perfect with the bridge, it seems.

257
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,960
And if you're not familiar with these terms, these bridge terms, I should back up just one step.

258
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:48,400
So matrix, one of the things great about it is it's pretty easy to connect to other even proprietary chat platforms

259
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,200
and bring that into matrix and have the two talk.

260
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,960
That's what's so appealing for us as a network that has chats everywhere.

261
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,000
We can bring it all into one place.

262
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,360
And I find that to be compelling and connected community and not a fractured one.

263
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,760
The brilliant thing about matrix, too, is there's going to be multiple chat clients over the future.

264
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,640
It's sort of like the web, how you have multiple web browsers.

265
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,760
You're going to have multiple chat clients and there already are.

266
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,680
But Element is the most popular, formerly Riot.

267
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:21,360
And I think it's going in the right direction long term to base our future chat platform around this.

268
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,480
So our production server, while new and still has lots of work to do, is up and running.

269
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,400
There's like a community now for Linux unplugged on the matrix server that has rooms associated with Linux unplug.

270
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,840
So there's a Linux unplugged general feedback room.

271
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,120
But I'm going to tell you about another fun room that I've created in a little bit when we get to the feedback segment.

272
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,240
Something specifically for a future segment of the show.

273
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,720
I've just created a room for it in the matrix and I've put it in that group.

274
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,280
So when you go get the Linux unplugged community, you'll see both those channels, hopefully.

275
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,520
So anyways, I think it's got a lot of potential because we can have channels for every show.

276
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,560
We can group them together so you know what channels go with what show.

277
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,840
And it doesn't have to be overwhelming if you don't watch or listen to a particular show.

278
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,240
You just don't join that community.

279
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,720
I like it. I think it's got a lot of potential.

280
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,320
So I'm very excited. Wes, thank you.

281
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,120
You did all of the hard work over the last couple of nights to set up a production server.

282
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,560
We have it running up on Linode.

283
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:21,760
And I think you did a kind of a nicer rig, not like the super nice one, but like a decent rig because it doesn't take a lot of resources.

284
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,120
Yeah, it'll be interesting to watch as more people sign up and start chatting over there.

285
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,480
Did Arch for the server?

286
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,720
I was tempted.

287
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:36,040
He sent me a screenshot with Arch and I'm like, not really, right?

288
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,400
He's like, no, not really.

289
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,600
So very excited about this.

290
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,400
And of course, looking into the future of how we're going to federate this stuff and connect with all the other matrix communities that are out there,

291
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,640
it's going to be a big learning curve for me.

292
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,480
Wes is already kind of getting deep into it.

293
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,360
And thankfully, we have people in our community that are very familiar with it as well.

294
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,920
Maybe we'll set up like a matrix brainstorming room or something.

295
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,720
That's a good idea where people can join and we can talk about ways to improve that experience because it's all new.

296
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,480
But this is like the very core of it set up right now.

297
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,720
Yeah. And maybe we should be clear, too.

298
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:09,560
If you've already got a matrix account somewhere else and you're trying to join that way, the actual server name is Jupiter Broadcasting dot com.

299
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:15,920
Yes. If you'd like to go register on that server, then you can head to colony dot Jupiter Broadcasting dot com.

300
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,960
Put that into your client and register that way, too.

301
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,760
Yep. So the actual. Yeah, that's a great point.

302
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,960
That's the colony at Jupiter Broadcasting dot com is only really necessary if you're setting up element and you want to change servers

303
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,840
and you want Jupiter Broadcasting dot com to be your home server.

304
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,800
But if you're already on another box, yeah, just join Jupiter Broadcasting dot com.

305
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,960
We're out there. It's cool. It's it's going. Are you are people joining?

306
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,480
What's happening right now? Yeah, there's chats happening right before our eyes.

307
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,520
Oh, that's so neat. And IRC and Telegram channels that we have, those are other kind of popular areas.

308
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,960
They probably won't get changed for a while.

309
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,080
But as we come up with solutions to integrate those communities, we will.

310
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,920
And it's they're just as much of a part as they always have been.

311
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:58,880
The matrix chat is just another platform, another opportunity and where the puck is going, but it's not there yet.

312
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:06,800
So if you prefer the Telegram channel and keep your telegram channel, keep chatting there and maybe also try out the new matrix room.

313
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,600
Yeah. Yeah. Give it a go. Why not? I mean, it's all great open source.

314
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,080
It's a really cool project. So it's just it's checking all those boxes.

315
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,920
Not going to replace Mumble for this.

316
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,000
I think Mumble just does a fantastic job for what we do here.

317
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,040
And I don't really see the need to replace it.

318
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:25,600
I mean, if we're using this thing for 10 years, maybe in seven years, I might change my mind.

319
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,160
Who knows? But right now, Mumble works great for our Lug, and it's also free and open source software.

320
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,880
So I don't see any reason to change that either.

321
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,720
Kumbay, open source, y'all West. Yeah, there's just too much good open source software.

322
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:48,680
What a nice problem to have. To just a couple of things to mention in the housekeeping, the Lug that's a separate meetup takes place on Sunday.

323
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,360
It's not during a show unless we're recording something special.

324
00:27:51,360 --> 00:28:00,160
Sneaky. It's just a chance for like minded Linux users to hang out in the lobby of our Mumble server, the Lug, Sunday at noon Pacific.

325
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,400
It's on the Jupiter Broadcasting calendar.

326
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,120
Also, once you get set up for that, you can join this thing here.

327
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,920
This this little podcast that we do, that's on Tuesdays at JBLive.TV, noon Pacific.

328
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:19,040
But same place, Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time.

329
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,760
Now we'll have to have something in this section about how to join our matrix chat.

330
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,440
Oh, we don't have the spiel ready. Yeah, yeah, we're going to have to get us.

331
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,760
You can tell how early days it is. We're going to have to get a spiel ready.

332
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,520
But this will be the section where I'll tell you about the matrix chat.

333
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,400
In the meantime, just go get Element and log into the Jupiter Broadcasting dot com server.

334
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,000
All right, West, guess what? That's all the housekeeping.

335
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,400
Clean and tidy. Yeah, we've been keeping it nice around here.

336
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,040
So we just were chatting about some recent podcast catchers,

337
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,560
that's what we're going to call them, that have made news and thought, you know,

338
00:28:52,560 --> 00:29:00,520
let's do a podcast catcher playoff and talk about some of the different options for mobile, desktop and web,

339
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,880
because everybody listening likely has some way, but maybe you're curious in other options

340
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,080
or maybe you'd like to also listen to podcasts on your desktop.

341
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,480
So we've got a couple. I just read the one that Drew just sneaky put in the list.

342
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,720
He's such a troll. We have a honorable mentions section.

343
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,360
These are like table stakes podcast players that we're not going to spend a lot of time on.

344
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,800
Number one, you can just get known podcasts, which is pretty simple and straightforward.

345
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,120
You know, I'm just realizing I've never used it. I'm going to have to give that a try.

346
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,320
Yeah, it's not bad. It's not bad.

347
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:34,680
G Potter has been a go to around the J.B. Studio for like a decade, I think.

348
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:40,440
So G Potter, another GTK one. And Pod Fox also is getting an honorable mention.

349
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,640
I don't know if it's actively maintained anymore. I'm not positive.

350
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,520
But one of the things I love about Pod Fox is it has a really cool directory structure,

351
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,920
a simple configuration stores for in each podcast in that directory.

352
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,400
So it's just got a little JSON file that holds all the settings for that podcast.

353
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,040
So you just back up your directory and then when you reinstall Pod Fox,

354
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,120
you just restore the directory and all of the configuration settings is all right there.

355
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,680
Bam. Done. Also, an audience member that wrote this.

356
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,120
So what's great is like in their GitHub examples, it's all text app episodes.

357
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,160
Hey, look at that. Yeah. Isn't that neat?

358
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,520
So that's Pod Fox and I wanted to give it an honorable mention,

359
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,160
but just not totally sure if it's active. And then Drew snuck in Spotify.

360
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,560
You noticed I left that one out, huh, Drew?

361
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:28,040
I did. Yeah. Now, you know what, Drew, I thought about it.

362
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,520
You want something that has show notes, something that syncs your play position.

363
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,240
That's nice. And it doesn't cost money just to play podcasts, right?

364
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,880
Spotify free accounts can play podcasts. I would assume so.

365
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,560
I mean, I've been a Spotify subscriber for many, many years now.

366
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:50,720
So for me, it was kind of obvious once it became good enough to take over from Pocket Casts,

367
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,160
which is what I used to use. And yeah, I mean, having a real desktop client is great

368
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,640
because then my media controls work and it syncs position with my phone.

369
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,040
It's not the best, but it does well enough for me.

370
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,160
I have concerns about Spotify from a podcast ecosystem perspective,

371
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,440
but you're absolutely right. And soon will be the exclusive way to get the Joe Rogan podcast.

372
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,080
I mean, it is nice that the Linux client works just fine.

373
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,720
All right. You ready for our contenders of, I think, new considerations?

374
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,680
That was the table stakes, the honorable mentions category in the contenders.

375
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:33,160
We have a mix here of desktop and command line podcast catchers.

376
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,320
So let's start with the desktop ones. Have you seen wins?

377
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,240
No, but this is beautiful.

378
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,720
Wins like the wind that blows, not like the kind you have in a casino.

379
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,080
It's an open source RSS app that also has podcast support.

380
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:51,760
So this is sort of two birds, one stone. It's a nice looking React node based application.

381
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:59,120
It has what they call activity stream and personalization, which uses some smart thinking inside the code of the application.

382
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,320
It has some AWS back end stuff to accelerate stuff.

383
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,840
It's a very nice looking RSS reader and decent podcast player in one.

384
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:14,640
And it supports the links. It has the ability for you to play your podcast while you're reading the news.

385
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,520
So you can hit play on the podcast and then go through and read your feeds kind of like that.

386
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:24,160
I noticed it says it's open source too. It's interesting. There's a lot of these features are stuff you don't get with, you know,

387
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,960
I don't know that all their back end stuff. I don't know if that's open source.

388
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,800
I haven't dug into that, but at least having an open source client and getting some of these more advanced features,

389
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,880
they've got some sort of machine learning to do recommendations.

390
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,920
Maybe you hate that, but maybe you miss that.

391
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,480
That's the machine thinking right there.

392
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:47,640
They do have a system based on your listening to generate new suggestions, which is kind of nice for discovery.

393
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:54,360
And the other thing that I think you need to look for, especially on the desktop applications, is it exports and imports OPML,

394
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,680
which is like a list of all of your feeds with some settings about them and some information about them.

395
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,960
That makes it really easy to move between podcast clients.

396
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,080
Not all mobile clients have support for this, but a lot of the desktop ones do.

397
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:16,320
And so I'll try to call it out if they do. And Wins, W-I-N-D-S, is one of them that has OPML import and export support.

398
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,600
And like you said, Wes, it's open source. It's at version 3.1, so it's had several releases.

399
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,000
It's not like some fly by night podcast RSS reader.

400
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,080
It seems like a serious contender.

401
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,000
And if you want something that is on the desktop that has show notes support, there's not a lot of options.

402
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,040
Right. It's a major flaw with a lot of these.

403
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:41,880
But CPOD seems to have a lot of the basic features you might want in the bag.

404
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,440
CPOD is a simple, beautiful podcast app for all of the desktop operating systems.

405
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,560
It has, I think, a benefit that it uses the iTunes podcast directory.

406
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,000
So that is, in my opinion, a benefit because everybody submits to that directory.

407
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,320
Right. As much of a standard place as we have.

408
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,400
Yeah. And Apple takes some actions to prune inactive podcasts after a while.

409
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:09,040
And there's just a there's an ecosystem there that makes it a pretty decent directory of podcasts.

410
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,040
And it's nice to be able to leverage that without having to have iTunes, right, or Apple podcast, whatever.

411
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,120
So that's CPOD, C-P-O-D.

412
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,680
It has decent search and subscribe support.

413
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,960
It has queue management if you want to queue up a bunch of episodes.

414
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,120
It has filters if you want to filter a date range or, you know, whatever.

415
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,920
Has support for import and export of OPML.

416
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:35,760
And this is an interesting one that not a lot of podcast catchers offer, but I appreciate it.

417
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,640
Is it has a specific option to just refresh all of the podcast artwork because some podcasts actually change their cover art sometimes.

418
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,960
I used to, well, yeah, I used to and we don't as much anymore.

419
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,920
But it was nice to do that.

420
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,920
It's nice. It's nice if it can do that.

421
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Most of them don't have that option.

422
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,600
No chapter support, no proper full show notes support.

423
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,080
It has limited show notes support.

424
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,600
Not a big fan of that. And it doesn't sync across desktop versions.

425
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,080
None of if you have it here on one machine, you have it on another machine.

426
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,960
Those are separate.

427
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,160
Yeah, you're going to you're going to be importing and exporting and then manually moving that file between machines.

428
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,240
You can totally do it, but it's not automatic.

429
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,320
You know, it's not like super easy.

430
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,160
That said, performance is pretty decent.

431
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,760
Looks pretty good. C Pod's a decent contender.

432
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,120
I'm going to and I have one more graphical one I want to throw at you before we get to the terminal.

433
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:33,640
So these are our current graphical contenders wins C Pod and the last one, Airsonic.

434
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,640
It was subsonic, then it became Libre Sonic and now it's Airsonic.

435
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,440
OK, so this is one of those stories tells you everything you need to know.

436
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,920
Absolutely. Airsonic is a web based media streamer.

437
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,200
Full stop. It's not just for podcasts.

438
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:55,280
It gives you access to your music everywhere with a web interface or apps that connect with it.

439
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,600
It makes it easy to share stuff like podcasts and music with friends, family, etc, etc.

440
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,400
It's like Plex, but only for music and free and open source.

441
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,120
And it also has a pretty decent podcast management solution.

442
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:20,400
And what I like about this and something I used to do, but I don't do currently is I would use this to download my podcast to my NAS and then I would just play them from there either over an app or or just copy them to a device.

443
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,400
And I would have one machine and then I would just move them to the devices I wanted to listen on.

444
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,040
But I don't do that anymore. I just I'll tell you what I do it a bit, but it worked really well.

445
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,280
Yeah. No, this seems like a really nice setup.

446
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:37,360
I can see if you weren't already using some sort of integrated streaming service environment, this would be a nice alternative.

447
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,600
You want to roll your own Spotify.

448
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,040
Right.

449
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:47,320
You know, you're doing like the self-hosted podcast style and you just want to have your own music library available over DLNA and, you know, as a terminal.

450
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,720
And you can also just pull up a web page and use it as a jukebox.

451
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:56,000
I've had like a Google Play Music account for a thousand years because they used to let you upload your own music into it and that's ending.

452
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,560
So, I mean, something like Airsonic is looking pretty nice to me right now.

453
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,800
I know. That's sad.

454
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,560
That's one of the services that hurts.

455
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,280
Does. I mean, sure, they haven't invested in it in years, but it's been working mostly fine.

456
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,840
So Airsonic lets you roll your own streaming solution for your music and in there it has podcast management.

457
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,680
So this is a bigger, higher end solution.

458
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:25,320
But I mean, thinking about this, you could easily throw this on a VPS and then just pull up the mobile web page from your phone.

459
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,480
I assume you've already ordered a new Pi to put it on.

460
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,800
I don't need to. I've got plenty floating around at this point, Wes.

461
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,600
Actually, stay tuned. We have a totally cool new use for your Pi that she's found that we'll be mentioning.

462
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:47,160
Out of the three GUIs, Airsonic, CPOD and WINS, if I was going with a GUI on the desktop, I actually like WINS because it's also a decent RSS client.

463
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,120
I like WINS the most.

464
00:37:48,120 --> 00:38:00,960
But for me, if I was going to roll it today and I wasn't going with the current solution that I use, 100 percent Airsonic would be a great solution for somebody that wants more than just an app on their desktop to listen to podcasts.

465
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,320
But they want something that's omnipresent across all their devices that also manages audiobooks and music.

466
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,160
That's Airsonic. Yeah, it could be handy, too, if you wanted to share it with family members or friends.

467
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh, yeah, 100 percent. You just got to do a little bit of the firewall work, but it's designed for sharing.

468
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,480
It's got all the kind of functionality built in.

469
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,480
But, Wes, there is some contenders on the command line.

470
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,560
They're going to be very hard to beat.

471
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,680
Now, I know it sounds silly to manage your podcast on the command line.

472
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:33,840
I hear you. But what if I could tell you not only could you manage your podcast on the command line, but you can do it with a Rust app.

473
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:45,880
That's right. Friends, I introduce you to Shellcaster, a terminal based podcast manager built in Rust.

474
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,680
And it's a doozy. It's all key bindings. It's the whole experience is key bindings.

475
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,000
You know, it's all just and they list all out on the GitHub page, which we'll have linked.

476
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,280
It's one button to add a feed, another button to mark who's played.

477
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,960
And interestingly enough, it has zero playback support directly itself.

478
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,000
So better hope you have a media player installed.

479
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,320
Yeah, it defaults to VLC, which who doesn't have VLC installed?

480
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,560
That's true. Everybody has VLC installed, but you can put anything you want.

481
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:22,200
It's all configurable in there. And Shellcaster also has a sync sub command that can be used to download your podcast there in the database in the background.

482
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,760
You could set that up with a cron job or one of them system D timers that West likes.

483
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,920
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I subscribe to Linux headlines in Shellcaster.

484
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,960
And it's great because there's so many episodes of Linux headlines.

485
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,720
It makes it really easy to just blast right through them with some simple, quick keyboard commands.

486
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,840
You can mark them all as played and throw them to VLC and just then they get marked as play in the database.

487
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:48,040
I mean, it's nice, quick and simple. And once you learn it's like A to do this, B to do that, H and F to do this.

488
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,040
Once you get those basic commands memorized, you're whipping through this thing at light speed.

489
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:57,240
Yeah. Could we client too slow for your podcasting needs? Shellcaster.

490
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,760
That's a pretty good tagline, Wes. That could be totally it.

491
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,040
Yeah, I liked it a lot. I've played with different terminal based podcast catchers over the years.

492
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,440
But Shellcaster is the one that I think I'll be putting into production here in the studio.

493
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,480
I really liked it. But there's a couple other command line ones that I think are worth mentioning.

494
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,840
I think it's probably worth mentioning. Is it Castero?

495
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,480
Castero. Yeah.

496
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,320
You know, it's similar to Shellcaster, but, you know, in the Python world.

497
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:30,200
It might have a nicer way to display like show note information, which is where Shellcaster falls short.

498
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:36,520
Yeah, you know, I think it's a little older of a project, too, so might have a few less rough edges, maybe a few more features and support.

499
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,360
It does also need an external media player, but it'll figure that out with VLC or MPV if you've got those on the system.

500
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,640
And then something a little on the simpler side, very simple configuration,

501
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,760
supports just basic downloading and getting of the files for you and then you manage it yourself, is cast git.

502
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,680
Yeah, I like that this is, you know, we've been kind of talking about like Tooey clients.

503
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:01,080
But what if you just want to write a script that needs to go sync this podcast because you're ingesting it for analysis

504
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,680
or you just want to queue it up for yourself some other way later?

505
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,520
Cast git might be just enough for what you need.

506
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,000
I didn't try cast git before the show. I spent time on Shellcaster.

507
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,720
Looking at this, this might actually be more appropriate to my needs here because I just need these podcasts grabbed and thrown in a directory,

508
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,320
and then I manage them later for the playback systems here in the studio, right?

509
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,840
Right. Yeah, exactly.

510
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,200
I can see like running casket here on the OBS machine to grab the reruns and stuff like that.

511
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,960
Yeah, just runs in one of those system D timers and we're set.

512
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,600
One of your system D timers?

513
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,040
Yeah.

514
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,840
One of the system D timers.

515
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,640
Hipster chron, you know.

516
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,320
That's pretty good.

517
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,560
The command line podcast catchers that we like again are Shellcaster, Castero and casket.

518
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,640
And we will have links to all of these at Linux Unplugged dot com slash three, six, seven.

519
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,480
So you can go grab those there.

520
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,520
If you're looking for something on your desktop machine or your laptop, I think those are some of your best options right now.

521
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,240
Maybe we missed something, though. So please let us know.

522
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,080
Give us some feedback if you're using a command line client that we didn't include.

523
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,640
Yeah, that I would like to know the solid command line ones.

524
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,800
The desktop ones did a pretty extensive rundown.

525
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,680
I don't really like there's are a lot of other ones we didn't mention here, but that's kind of on purpose.

526
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:19,320
Mostly the one that I like that I didn't get a chance to review, but I like the way it looks is vocal,

527
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,200
which I think looks like a really solid, gooey one.

528
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,840
But I just haven't I didn't have a chance in this roundup to try it.

529
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,480
But it does look really great. But of course, not all of us.

530
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,640
In fact, most majority of the podcast audience is listening on their mobile devices.

531
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,960
So we have a couple of mobile mentions.

532
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,320
And I think the top when you're just doing mobile mentions has to be PocketCast.

533
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:47,640
PocketCast is a very solid podcast client with a solid podcast directory, solid playback options.

534
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,080
And you got to pay for it, but a pretty decent web client to not perfect,

535
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,040
but a pretty decent web playback experience, which syncs with your mobile device.

536
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,840
So it makes it pretty nice to finish off like I do this.

537
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:04,080
I'm listening in the car, I get to the studio or I get home and I want to finish the podcast.

538
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,240
The web player is great for that.

539
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:11,320
Oh, yeah. You know, I like PocketCast mostly because I listen to a lot of podcasts in my living room via Chromecast.

540
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,880
And they've got cast support built right in. So that's nice.

541
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,120
Yeah, that is nice.

542
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:23,080
I do have a bit of cautionary information, I guess, about PocketCast.

543
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:33,200
And that is that in 2018, PocketCast was acquired by NPR, a group of other public radio stations like This American Life and others

544
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:44,240
that want to monetize podcasts with dynamically inserted podcast ads and are proposing a standard that tracks more significantly

545
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,800
what you listen to, where you listen to it and what you skip and what you replay.

546
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:55,360
It's a spec that they're proposing and that group has purchased PocketCast.

547
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:03,160
So they will likely use PocketCast to further that agenda at some point, which may not be great for the podcast ecosystem.

548
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:09,800
Yeah. And it's very much feels like, you know, it's like a retail podcatcher in that like it doesn't support a ton of like import, export niceties.

549
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:17,880
And if you want to add some random feed URL, well, you got to go add it to their back end service and they'll eventually index it and then let you subscribe to it.

550
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,680
You know, you don't have that much control, but it works especially, you know, works just fine for popular podcasts.

551
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:29,720
That's why we wanted to also mention the easy to use, flexible and open source podcast manager for Android called AntennaPod.

552
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,360
Yeah.

553
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:42,440
AntennaPod, I hear so many good things from the community about it and it also has OPML import and export support, which is not often found on a mobile app.

554
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:48,600
Yeah, actually, it's really nice and it just feels like exactly what an open source mobile podcatcher should be.

555
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:53,000
You know, it feels like, you know what's going on, you control it, you get to drive it, configure it how you need.

556
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,760
And other than that, it gets out of your way.

557
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,600
Also has Chromecast support, Wes, has Chromecast support.

558
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,960
So it might be worth considering for that.

559
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,800
I don't know how long they've had that, but it's.

560
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,200
Oh, you know, I haven't I haven't tried in a while.

561
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,480
I'll have to give that a shot because actually I'm already using both.

562
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,200
I use a couple of podcast catchers myself on iOS.

563
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,600
There's the built in podcast app is fine, I guess.

564
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,480
But I really like Overcast.

565
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:28,360
It is one of the kind of classic podcast clients, the kind of standard podcast client that used to be what every podcast was what Overcast is.

566
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,840
It open standards.

567
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:35,280
There's no like secret agenda to take over the advertising space and podcasting.

568
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,360
It's created by Marco Armit, who is a podcast host himself and a software developer.

569
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:45,400
So he created Overcast and essentially, you know, his motivation really is to just further the podcast ecosystem.

570
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,280
And so it is not only a great podcast, but the intentions behind it are pretty good, too.

571
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,920
And I think, you know, if you're a podcast fan, it's something to think about.

572
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,800
And so Overcast is my recommendation.

573
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,120
You can get it overcast.fm for iOS.

574
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,840
It does have a web player component.

575
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,000
The web playback is awful.

576
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,120
I mean, it works, right?

577
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,560
You can play it and stuff, but it's you hear the sound.

578
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,560
It's so bare bones.

579
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,440
It's super bare bones.

580
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,560
But it does work with the NSYNC with the client, which is nice.

581
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,720
So Pocket Cast, Overcast and Antennapod for the mobile in that batch.

582
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,600
I think we're given the nod to Antennapod.

583
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,040
Don't you think? Yeah.

584
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,720
I'm going to switch from Pocket Cast to Antennapod on my Pixel.

585
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,040
Look at you. I'm going to do it.

586
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:26,600
I'm going to do it.

587
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,360
I don't know if Pocket Cast will let me export out my subscriptions.

588
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,400
You know, I've never tried.

589
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,600
But it doesn't really matter.

590
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,520
I mean, I know which ones I listen to.

591
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,400
It really doesn't take that long to set back up.

592
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,240
It's just then you have to just go through and mark them all as listened to.

593
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,040
So, yeah, great.

594
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,840
You know, there's a whole other category that I don't know that the open source

595
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,960
world's doing too well in, which is like some people listen to podcasts on their

596
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,480
smart assistants these days.

597
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,440
That's true.

598
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,240
I've experimented with that, but it's not awesome.

599
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,080
Yeah, I'll sometimes yell at the big G, you know, to catch the latest Linux

600
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,440
headlines because that's a quick, easy one.

601
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,000
I don't mind playing through their platform.

602
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,800
But yeah, yeah, yeah, I prefer the shorter stuff.

603
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,520
Linux headlines is kind of an example of one that does work in the in the in the

604
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,480
assistant, too. But otherwise, I like to have something I can take with me in the

605
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,280
car, I can have in the headphones, I can have from the wherever you are.

606
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,400
Yeah, everywhere. That's essentially what it is.

607
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,960
All right. So we'll have links to all that stuff.

608
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,840
Like I said, at Linux Unplugged slash 367.

609
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,600
Moving on now, let's get to the feedback section of the show.

610
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,360
This is a steak and potatoes edition of the Unplugged show.

611
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,680
So extra for me, please.

612
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,440
I know, right? You put a lot of butter on them taters to us.

613
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,200
You know, what about more? But we ran out.

614
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,000
I know. I didn't expect somebody to eat that much butter.

615
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,520
So the fake VIP says he's still using a Mac Pro as his daily driver, which is

616
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,960
what we were running our test matrix around.

617
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,000
He says, I still to this day run a Mac Pro as my daily driver with Windows,

618
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,320
Mac OS and Linux.

619
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,840
I've got Arch with I3.

620
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:55,040
It's a dream machine for me, all the accessibility because he's blind of a Mac

621
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,880
with most of the flexibility of a PC.

622
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:03,400
I've put an RX 580 in mine, as well as an MVME SSD on the expansion card.

623
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,600
And it runs beautifully.

624
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,720
That's pretty cool because when we were talking like these machines base price

625
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,560
with a Xeon and some RAM and some disk, 200 bucks, totally reasonable.

626
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,040
And I mean, yeah, you get the get the glory of the triple boot.

627
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,720
Yeah, you don't see much of that these days. You don't.

628
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,360
That used to be kind of like the golden the golden goose with the Hackintosh.

629
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,200
You could do anything. You had every OS.

630
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:30,600
I did for a little while have a triple boot set up on on a machine and never

631
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,960
really use the other OS's so that I never was in trouble again.

632
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,960
Seriously, I was like, oh, that was neat.

633
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,800
It wasn't worth it.

634
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,120
It sure was a lot of work up up front.

635
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,920
Well, a non why must I'm not familiar with this.

636
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,200
A non why must writes in says I've seen a shift in how things have been going

637
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,680
with cloud convergence, serverless AI and all the buzzwords that the marketers use.

638
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,560
He says, I feel like as a community, we probably need to embrace the web more.

639
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,600
But I have a question for you.

640
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,720
Would you still use Linux if there was no more Internet?

641
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,200
The Internet goes out. Would you still use Linux?

642
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,680
You know, that's interesting.

643
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:13,520
I think, unfortunately, one area that we struggle with and maybe maybe not,

644
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,400
as we've just kind of rounded up here in the podcatcher discussion,

645
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,680
but I don't use that many Linux desktop apps these days.

646
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,920
You know, it's like it's oftentimes electron clients to interface with some

647
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,360
web service that I wouldn't be using or just a browser.

648
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:30,080
Now, if I'm if I'm using the terminal, if I'm programming, doing something like that.

649
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,280
OK, there's plenty of stuff.

650
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,400
But what about like the desktop notifications, the file manager,

651
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,760
clipboard, that stuff? That's all part of the desktop.

652
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,280
It's just parts that are sort of out of the way a little bit.

653
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,840
I'm just wondering, do other platforms have an advantage now?

654
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,240
Maybe not if more and more of those things have become cloud connected

655
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,640
in a way where Linux desktop applications haven't.

656
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,080
But what about, you know, I'm just wondering, would you have more things

657
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,600
you could do offline on a Windows PC that you'd actually want to do?

658
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,480
I don't know. What's your take on this?

659
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,600
If you say, you know, say they announce due to some health risk or whatever,

660
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:10,120
we have to shut down the Internet and we thought 2020 was bad.

661
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,280
But 2021 is the year they take away the Internet.

662
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,080
So you've got until January 1st, 2021.

663
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,800
Are you reloading your machines?

664
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,520
You know, probably what I would do, I would continue to use Linux,

665
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,680
but I would go fetch as many ISOs as I could.

666
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,160
So I would fetch all of the Debian ISOs, pull everything down.

667
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:33,680
So I had access to some degree to just a large library of software.

668
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,840
Totally. Yeah. You begin to build your offline archive.

669
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,200
Right, right. Obviously, if the Internet goes down, though,

670
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,200
you're going to have a problem with updates and how do you get those?

671
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,400
So, yeah, but you also have less security threats.

672
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,240
That's true. That's true. Right. Right.

673
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,920
All right. I want to know what Brent would do

674
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,400
if the Internet was going to be shut down on January 1st.

675
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,160
Would you switch operating systems?

676
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,800
Would you switch distros?

677
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,360
What would be your first steps, Brent?

678
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,440
I think step number one is I would cry a little and hold myself.

679
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,080
But I would say that I experienced this here and there

680
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:12,680
because I often am traveling in locations that don't have the Internet.

681
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,760
Either I'm off grid or something.

682
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,920
Brent's a time traveler and that's what it is.

683
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,920
Don't tell too many people.

684
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,560
And that's actually an interesting experience

685
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,480
because it makes you realize sort of what you can do without the Internet.

686
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,200
And Linux is such a pleasure to use.

687
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,960
Like I'm on I'm on KD, I'm using plasma and have for many years.

688
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,760
And I just love using my computer from a visual

689
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,040
and just from a feel perspective.

690
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,280
And then every single time I go on anything else,

691
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,320
there's that kind of cringe factor for me.

692
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,000
So I think purely from a like

693
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,760
joy of using perspective, I would stay.

694
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,280
But also all of the tooling that's under the hood, like so many times

695
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,600
I'm doing stuff locally and I'm using our sync or I'm using different

696
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,840
terminal applications to just make things happen in a nice kind of streamlined way.

697
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:07,360
And I just don't want to give any of that up, whether I have the Internet or not.

698
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,680
So I don't know.

699
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:14,360
I think there's a huge value in Linux in our back pocket, even if we're disconnected.

700
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,840
I completely agree. I couldn't set it better myself.

701
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,400
That's exactly how I feel.

702
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,240
Computer Kid doesn't this kind of remind you of the scenario

703
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,360
that Endless OS was building for?

704
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:28,480
It's designed for developing countries that don't yet have stable Internet access.

705
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,200
So it's got a large amount of Wikipedia already on there,

706
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,920
all kinds of different auto install applications, which, you know,

707
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,240
they're a controversial topic.

708
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,040
But if you don't have Internet, you kind of want as many

709
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,800
auto install applications as you can.

710
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,480
Yeah.

711
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,920
The ISO is actually 15 gigabytes for the full version.

712
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,280
But I mean, it's 15 gigabytes for a good reason.

713
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,480
But the last 15 gigabytes, you'll never download.

714
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,000
That's right.

715
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,800
You know, Wes, I remember back in my day,

716
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,680
I started using Linux before the Internet was common.

717
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,880
I had to dial up for the Internet.

718
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,960
Limited access.

719
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,400
Most of the time, I didn't have Internet.

720
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,760
So I already started using Linux then.

721
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,840
So I obviously would continue much for the same reasons

722
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,960
that you all have just touched on.

723
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,240
I like Brent's point, too, is if we're going to build our own,

724
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,040
you know, bootleg Internet, Linux is going to be the tool we want.

725
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,480
Absolutely. That would be my next thing is like in the last few months,

726
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,440
I'd be like trying to coordinate with the audience to build like a mesh network

727
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,280
across the world.

728
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,960
I mean, we'd start where we could, right?

729
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,800
JBnet.

730
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,520
Yeah, I mean, absolutely.

731
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,720
So empowered by Matrix, right?

732
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,080
So that would be my first actions.

733
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:44,760
But I have thought about this to a degree because I find it's nice to get away.

734
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:51,360
I don't want to be completely without some of the niceties of modern society.

735
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,160
So I talk about this a ton on the self-hosted podcast,

736
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,800
but I created Project Off Grid and Lady Joop's where I created personal wiki

737
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:04,240
and a markdown note system and an offline media playback system,

738
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,280
all powered by solar that works completely offline.

739
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,000
But we can sit down and we can still pull up news stories.

740
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,120
We can still listen to our music.

741
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:16,680
We can still stream things from our local media, all powered by Raspberry Pies.

742
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,720
And I call that Project Off Grid because what I like to do is go somewhere

743
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,200
where I have no messages.

744
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,640
I'm so committed to this, I can't just turn it off.

745
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,800
Like I don't just, I have to literally be forcibly removed from it.

746
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,200
You don't have enough switch, though.

747
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,800
He just put you in a big fair day case.

748
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,080
That's basically it, right?

749
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,400
And so going these places for even like 24 hours

750
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,120
is a great way for me to avoid burnout, but still be able to do things

751
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:44,760
like watch Star Trek Voyager and read my offline articles that I've saved

752
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,040
and refer to my notes when working on Lady Joop's.

753
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,480
And all of that stuff can still continue.

754
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,720
I just, I don't have ready access to Google and I don't have messaging systems.

755
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,800
It's mostly what it feels like.

756
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:00,560
And that was my solution, was to try to create a LAN locally.

757
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,080
That meant solving DNS.

758
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,640
That meant caching certain things.

759
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,120
That meant syncing things so they'd be available

760
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,640
should the connection just go away.

761
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,520
You just have to be very knowledgeable about the various dependencies

762
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,800
and the systems you're using and when and where they rely on outside networks.

763
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,360
Yeah, it's funny how much stuff breaks now without internet.

764
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:22,160
Right? Even sometimes not the whole thing, but just little pieces here and there.

765
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,480
I thought, though, what would be a lot of fun,

766
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,800
because we could talk about this for ages,

767
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,720
is what if we did just do a little exercise with the community?

768
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,320
How would you prepare for an outage?

769
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,680
And so I thought, let's think about this in layers.

770
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,240
What would you do if the cloud goes out, cloud being a service you use?

771
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,640
What would you do then?

772
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,800
Maybe it's a backup service.

773
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,800
What would you do if your backup service went away?

774
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,920
So some cloud service you depend on.

775
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,320
So that's one layer.

776
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,640
What would you do if your main rig went out?

777
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,800
What's your backup plan for that?

778
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,200
What if, for some reason, you got a bug out?

779
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,920
I mean, let's just have a little fun with this.

780
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,080
Like, what if you got a bug out?

781
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,000
What's your scenario then?

782
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,120
How are you going to have access to stuff?

783
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,480
What do you take with you?

784
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,880
What's your bug out rig?

785
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,240
I thought, let's just have fun and talk about being a Linux prepper.

786
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,800
So in the new matrix server, I set up a Linux prepper room

787
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,680
just so we can have some fun talking about this.

788
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,200
Perfect.

789
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,440
It's part like, let's just think through scenarios

790
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,240
so our backups and our systems can be more resilient,

791
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,200
and part like, let's have a little fun

792
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,840
and pretend like we're being preppers.

793
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,840
And I thought, let's just set up a new room

794
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,680
where we can dedicate the chatter to that.

795
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,760
And that's on the new matrix server in the Jupyter

796
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,160
colony, which has a Linux unplugged community, which

797
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,920
then has a Linux prepper room.

798
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,640
Did I get all that right, Wes?

799
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,120
Matrix isn't confusing at all.

800
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,560
Yeah, and I think just lup is the community name.

801
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,040
Like, lup, colon, Jupyter, broadcasting, dot com.

802
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,720
Something, it's all in there, though.

803
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,120
Anyways, so Linux prepper time, and maybe we'll

804
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,400
get some good conversation going,

805
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,720
and we can kind of come up with some ideas.

806
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,680
And I'll share them in a future episode, maybe

807
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,080
next week's episode of the show.

808
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,600
Linux prepper, Wes, what would you do?

809
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,600
I mean, you've got to fill your bunker with as much Linux

810
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,720
stuff as possible, right?

811
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,360
That's right.

812
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,720
I restated those layers that we should think about, too,

813
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,120
just as some suggestions in the topic of that channel.

814
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,120
So when you get in there, you'll see the layers

815
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,120
that at least I started thinking about.

816
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,960
And of course, you can also send your ideas

817
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,320
if you don't want to hassle none of that matrix nonsense

818
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,320
to just linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

819
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,860
We got a form there you can fill out,

820
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,000
and they'll come on into our emails.

821
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,640
But if you had to be a Linux prepper, what would you do?

822
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,160
Let us know.

823
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,640
I think that'd be a fun topic to kick around

824
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,040
in there for a little bit.

825
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,640
We got a couple of picks this week.

826
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,960
We're going to do a hardware pick and a software pick.

827
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:28,600
What?

828
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,520
Cheese found, I'm sure somebody must have linked you to this,

829
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,440
or you came across this searching for it one day,

830
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,280
Cheese, but an idea that I've been kicking around

831
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,280
in different versions and never saw anything

832
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,720
that's like this solid, almost consumer device

833
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,320
level looking solution for the Raspberry Pi that turns it

834
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,360
into essentially a full-fledged NAS.

835
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:52,320
You may have heard of the company Radaxa.

836
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:57,880
This particular case is a quad SATA kit, a little quad NAS.

837
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,440
And essentially what it is, it's a hat

838
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,280
that sits on top of the Pi.

839
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,720
It allows you to connect up to four 2.5 inch drives.

840
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,640
They do make a Penta version of this

841
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,740
as well that gives you an eSATA connection,

842
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,820
so you could potentially run more disk off of this

843
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,720
if you wanted to go that route.

844
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,800
The case itself is a little pricey at $100.

845
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,360
It does have some neat features.

846
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,160
It has, like I said, the hat that really

847
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,880
drives the brains of it.

848
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,800
It comes with a heat sink and fan.

849
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:31,200
It comes with another board that sits on top of the drives.

850
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,200
It has a little OLED display and an exhaust fan.

851
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,760
And that OLED display will give you

852
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:43,040
load averages, fan speeds, and it'll support up to 16 terabytes.

853
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,080
So that's four, four terabyte disk.

854
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,080
Picked one of these up.

855
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,660
I haven't decided what I'm going to do.

856
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,040
I'm going to go SSD or if I'm going to go spinning rust yet.

857
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,880
But I'll figure it out once the box actually gets here.

858
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,160
And as you were saying about the preppers,

859
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,040
I mean, this could be your little prepper server.

860
00:58:59,040 --> 00:58:59,800
It's small enough.

861
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,140
It's smaller than a 20 ounce soda.

862
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,840
You don't need a lot of power to run it.

863
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,840
So being that we do have a lot of hurricanes and storms

864
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,560
around this area, I wanted to make something

865
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,100
that I could just snatch up real quick

866
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,300
and bring with me if I needed a bug out.

867
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,400
It's pretty neat.

868
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,080
I like it, man.

869
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,640
It's, like you say, it's smaller than a bottle of Coke.

870
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,640
And I think what really makes it magic

871
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,680
is it's a hat and a case together.

872
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,760
And that hat gives you tons of disk.

873
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,600
It looks like, Wes, you remember those old tower airport

874
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,440
express's that were like, totally in the middle?

875
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,360
It looks like one of those.

876
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,360
It's like that size, only maybe a little smaller.

877
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,440
It's a little tower that you put the Raspberry Pi at the bottom.

878
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,480
So you have access to all your ports on the back and inside.

879
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,520
And then you stack the disk towards the top.

880
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,760
And then it's got a little cooling fan

881
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,000
to sort of blow on everything.

882
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,280
I'm just going to call it now.

883
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,840
And in a couple of years, you're just

884
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:55,560
going to be putting pies in regular old ATX cases.

885
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,720
The loop will be complete.

886
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,120
Yeah.

887
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,480
I mean, you'll need it for the amount of cooling

888
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,720
they're going to require at that point, right?

889
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,160
Well, now how about a software pick?

890
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,920
So this week, we're going to pick Outrun.

891
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,840
You may have seen this floating around the web

892
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,880
because it's so cool.

893
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:15,240
It is a Python project that lets you execute a local command

894
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,160
using the processing power of another Linux machine.

895
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:18,920
What?

896
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,160
Local command processing power of another machine.

897
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,600
There's no need to first install the command

898
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,800
on the other machine.

899
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,560
It references the local files and path like you normally

900
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,040
would, so you don't have to think about the remote machine's

901
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:30,800
paths.

902
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,320
How cool is this?

903
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,120
And it works across several distributions.

904
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:39,000
So you could have your machine be Ubuntu,

905
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,360
but it could be an Alpine container on the cloud

906
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,520
that the command's actually executing in.

907
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,520
How do you like me now?

908
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,360
Crazy.

909
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,240
How about that?

910
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,980
I know, when I saw this floating around,

911
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,800
I just had to talk about it.

912
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,680
It's a simple install.

913
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,320
If you've got Python 3.7, it's just pip3 install outrun,

914
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,180
and you're off to the races.

915
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:58,800
Now, there is a couple of caveats.

916
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,000
As you probably guessed, you're going to need to have root

917
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,480
access on the other machine.

918
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,720
You're going to have to trust that machine because it's

919
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,340
going to have access to the local files

920
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,960
that you're using in this command, I mean, clearly.

921
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,400
But in the example, which totally resonates with us,

922
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,720
he shows you using FFmpeg to encode a local MP4

923
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,080
in a remote machine with all the horsepower.

924
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,480
Think about that, Wes.

925
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,280
Think about that.

926
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,000
How cool is that?

927
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,040
So this is just such a neat one, and you

928
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,880
don't have to have FFmpeg installed

929
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,280
on the remote machine.

930
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,760
This is just such a neat one, I had to mention it.

931
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,840
So it's outrun, and it's also linked to the show.

932
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,640
It's fascinating.

933
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,120
Now, it's not purely magic.

934
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:41,040
You can't go running because it actually copies the binaries

935
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,680
over and their dependencies, so you can't go change architectures

936
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,920
or anything like that.

937
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,880
And it probably only really makes sense

938
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,240
for stuff that really needs a bunch of computational horsepower

939
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,880
because other things will be limited

940
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,480
by chipping the files back and forth,

941
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,200
file system performance, and bandwidth.

942
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,960
Yeah, also, if it's something that would just

943
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,160
work better executing on your local machine,

944
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,640
if you think about it, a lot of jobs,

945
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,840
if you include the upload and download time,

946
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,420
it might just be faster to run locally.

947
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,440
But I could see this really being great

948
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,440
if you could go cross-platform because you imagine,

949
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,480
like, Raspberry Pi is a desktop, but then some really

950
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,760
intense compute you execute.

951
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,120
Go run it on your big server.

952
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,080
Yeah, yeah.

953
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:20,400
But even still, I could see this working low-power development

954
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,040
machine or something like that, ultra-portable laptop,

955
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,560
something that's x86 but just low power,

956
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,600
and you're trying to optimize for battery life.

957
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,480
This would make it very easy, especially

958
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,560
if you have a decent connection, to just do

959
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,200
some of that heavy lifting on another machine

960
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,080
without a lot of just awkwardness.

961
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:36,720
That's fuss.

962
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,080
Yeah, right?

963
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,680
You don't have to go to SSH into that machine

964
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,960
and run around and reset up the directory structure.

965
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,240
Install ffmpeg as an example or whatever.

966
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,600
Yeah, so that's what appeals to me.

967
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,440
And it's cool that this is just possible.

968
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,080
I mean, that's Linux right here, right?

969
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,760
Like, that's so cool.

970
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,320
I agree.

971
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,760
So with that, I think that means that we should probably

972
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,400
wrap it up, Wes.

973
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,680
Is there anything else we want to touch on?

974
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,660
Should we mention, maybe, how people

975
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,840
can find you on the Twitters?

976
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,800
Yes, at Wes Payne.

977
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,100
And maybe come find me on our new matrix server.

978
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:05,200
We'd love to have you join us live next week at jblive.tv.

979
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,880
Noon Pacific, get that converted to your local time

980
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:11,120
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

981
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,480
And yeah, do join us in that matrix.

982
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,680
That's the way to go.

983
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,140
I'm going to have it up on my screen.

984
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,440
I'm going to be geeking out.

985
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,680
Thank you, everyone, who helped us test it,

986
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,940
has been giving us feedback and information.

987
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:24,700
We'll try to set up a room on there for matrix conversations

988
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,600
so we can get things dialed in.

989
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,000
It's early days, but I'm excited about where it's going to go.

990
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,400
So I guess we'll probably put up a matrix page at some point.

991
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,120
So look for that.

992
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,560
That'll be coming soon.

993
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,160
But in the meantime, just keep tuning right back in here.

994
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,240
We'll give you all the information

995
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,200
you need here in the podcast in an easy to listen to form.

996
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,560
That's obviously the best.

997
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,600
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

998
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,120
of the Unplugged program.

999
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,560
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1000
01:03:51,560 --> 01:04:11,560
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1001
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:32,880
At just a public service announcement before we go,

1002
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:40,640
DebConf 20 starts this week from August 23 to the 29th, 2020.

1003
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,360
So that's coming up real soon.

1004
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,600
By the time you're hearing this, it'll be basically

1005
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,560
in a couple of days.

1006
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,360
So check that out, debconf.org.

1007
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,440
Before we go, you had a bonus hardware pick.

1008
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,680
Why don't you slip that guy in, and we'll talk about it.

1009
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,440
Yeah, so someone pointed me to a very nifty device.

1010
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,440
Do you like to have a U2F security token?

1011
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,320
Yes.

1012
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,360
And a rubber ducky bed USB?

1013
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,240
Yes.

1014
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,960
And an RFID card reader and emulator?

1015
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,000
I do.

1016
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,840
And an iButton reader and emulator?

1017
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,240
That can't be done.

1018
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,200
And an IR transceiver?

1019
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,280
No way.

1020
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,160
Yeah, so the Flipper Zero.

1021
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,160
Flipper Zero?

1022
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,720
Boy, they should call it the Flipper 6 with all that it does.

1023
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,720
I mean, come on.

1024
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,760
Or is that the 7?

1025
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,280
They have some nice features on it.

1026
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:30,560
And they seem to have delivered a previous device of this kind.

1027
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,480
And so they already delivered on something like this.

1028
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,000
And they had a simple goal.

1029
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,720
They smashed it within a few hours.

1030
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,080
And they're already in the millions with the Kickstarter.

1031
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:45,960
And the Kickstarter is still 10 days left on this recording.

1032
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,400
Well, there you have it.

1033
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,640
That sounds like a pretty cool little device.

1034
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:50,520
Yeah, it sure does.

1035
01:05:50,520 --> 01:06:18,560
And they've got a cute little dolphin logo.
