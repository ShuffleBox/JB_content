This is Linux Unplugged Episode 16 for November 26th, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:43.000
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that already has one foot out the door this holiday week.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
My name is Chris.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
My name is Matt.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Hey Matt, so we've got a fun show today, a lot of things happening.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
Even though it's a holiday week, you'd think, it's turkey, it's turkey day, tomorrow? Yeah, tomorrow here in the United States.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Tomorrow's turkey day.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
No wait, no, Thursday.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
No wait, Thursday.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Sorry, I got my...

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
There's turkey all week long for us.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
I've already got tryptophan all in my blood system.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
I'm a wreck over here, Matt, because all I can think about is that bird.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
And then just planning my turkey strategy so that I leave enough room for pumpkin pie, but not so much room that I eat too much pumpkin pie, right?

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
It's all about finding the right bandwidth for your stomach.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Right, and this is what you would think we would be concerned about right now.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
But no, my friends, no.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
We have more important matters.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Some big things are happening in the land of Linux infrastructure.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
You might be familiar with Docker.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Now, that could be because I talk about it all the time.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
I talk about it too much.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Maybe we should just call this Docker Unplugged.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
But this week, something big happened on the day we record live.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
A new version of Docker is out, and it promises to bring Docker to all Linux distributions.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
And there's only one way I thought to get the appropriate official word on the new version of Docker, and that was to bring on Solomon from Docker.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
He is the co-founder and CTO of the Docker project, I guess?

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
What is the organization behind Docker, Solomon?

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
So it is now officially Docker Inc, Docker.com.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
And that was a transition from?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Yes, from.Cloud.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Ah, right.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
.Cloud was actually, that actually sort of signifies a big transition in how you guys are structuring your business because it wasn't before.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
Weren't you guys more of a software of a service platform, and now you're kind of transitioning to the Docker project?

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah, so we're.Cloud launched in 2010 a platform as a service.

02:22.000 --> 02:31.000
So if you're familiar with Heroku or Google App Engine, a hosted service that runs other people's web applications, basically.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
And so we've been doing that for several years.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
We still do it.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
The product is still there.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
We have lots of customers.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
It's a growing business.

02:39.000 --> 02:53.000
The change of name is really to indicate that Docker is just going so crazy and growing so fast that the only way we can do a good job at maintaining it is making that the number one focus of the company.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
So can we give just a real quick elevator pitch on what do you, when somebody says, hey, what is Docker?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
What do you tell them that just sort of makes it click for them?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Well, it depends how technical they are.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Go technical.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Don't be afraid.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
We have a brave crew with us.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
So Docker is a container engine.

03:12.000 --> 03:30.000
It's a way to package and deploy your application in a sort of a unit that can be moved around very easily from server to server and then executed on any of those servers in a very repeatable way.

03:30.000 --> 03:42.000
And it uses a sandbox execution environment that I like to compare to how iOS or Android sandboxes its application.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
So it's really that notion of it's one thing, you execute it, and it's running in its own little sandbox.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
It's not interacting in any way with other applications that may be running on the same server.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
And so that gives you a lot of flexibility, a lot of power in how you deploy your applications.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
It makes it much easier to automate.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
And Docker is sitting on top of some new ish Linux technologies to accomplish this.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Is that correct?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Yeah, that's right.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
And what are those technologies?

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
So I mean, there is there's three main low level technology.

04:17.000 --> 04:26.000
So the first is namespaces and it's the ability for the Linux kernel to execute processes and have them not see each other basically,

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
to kind of sandbox them so that the you know, simplistically, the process thinks it's alone.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.000
And so you've got a bunch of different namespaces, PID namespaces, network namespaces, et cetera.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
So a process can have its own network interfaces, its own process space.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
So when it lists all processes on the system, it sees only its own, et cetera.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
So that's the first. The second is one called cgroups or control groups.

04:54.000 --> 05:03.000
And that is that is a subsystem in Linux that deals with everything resource allocation and resource accounting.

05:03.000 --> 05:12.000
So if your process can get a certain amount of something and and another process can have another amount, that's cgroups.

05:12.000 --> 05:24.000
So anything from memory allocation to CPU priority to how much IO you're allowed to consume, et cetera, that's all cgroups.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
And so that's what allows you to run a bunch of applications side by side and do things like, hey, this application gets 100 megs of RAM.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
This one gets a gig and they don't walk on each other's toes.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
That's number two.

05:36.000 --> 05:45.000
And the third feature that we we've been using aggressively is copy on write file systems based on the ability to take a directory,

05:45.000 --> 05:54.000
to take a file system and create any number of copies, a lot of copies potentially of that file system.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
It almost instantly with very little performance overhead.

05:58.000 --> 06:08.000
And in starting in version, if I'm correct here, starting with the version that came out today, 0.7, is the file system area one of the areas that we're seeing some of the biggest changes for this release?

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Yeah, that's correct. And these changes are what?

06:12.000 --> 06:21.000
So what we've done is we've taken the the underlying copy and write file system that we have been using from the very beginning,

06:21.000 --> 06:37.000
the UFS and making that moving that from a hard coded default to an optional driver and shipping multiple drivers so that you can pick and choose from one.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
You can pick one of those drivers depending on what your system supports.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
So we're talking multiple Linux distribution support, almost all Linux distribution support.

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
Yes, that was a big that was the big the headline of the 0.7 release today.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
There is there's a lot there's a lot going on in that release.

06:56.000 --> 07:05.000
I'll just start with that. You know, we kind of made a list of seven really important features that that that that shift of zero seven.

07:05.000 --> 07:15.000
Yeah, but you know that definitely the one at the top is the fact that this is the first version that runs on a on a non modified standard Linux kernel.

07:15.000 --> 07:22.000
Which means that Docker runs on basically every every Linux distro, which was not the case before.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
That's awesome. I mean, that's a that's that.

07:25.000 --> 07:31.000
So to me, what reason that takes Docker in a sense not to diminish the other features, the other six features,

07:31.000 --> 07:40.000
but that takes Docker to a sense to sort of in a way becomes the great normalizer amongst Linux distributions because I can I can build up an application

07:40.000 --> 07:51.000
and its environment on a Fedora box. I can I can get everything running and then I can pick that up and I can move it over to a to a Debian box or an Ubuntu box

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
and have the same exact performance results, et cetera, et cetera, that I should have on the other operating system.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
Correct. On the other distro. Yeah, it's it's like one of the big.

08:01.000 --> 08:14.000
Goals of Docker is to make that mobility easier, right, that the goal is really that across all the machines that you have access to from your laptop to your production

08:14.000 --> 08:23.000
servers to your QA servers across multiple data centers, multiple infrastructures, in-house, public cloud, et cetera,

08:23.000 --> 08:36.000
that the commonality between all of those is that they can run Docker and then you have this kind of big, really, really flexible playing field where you can just move containers around.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Right. And that's really, you know, we keep using the metaphor of shipping containers.

08:40.000 --> 08:47.000
And I think at this point, everyone's sick about sick of hearing about shipping containers and Docker being the shipping container of computing.

08:47.000 --> 09:02.000
But that's really it's really relevant beyond the hey, let me explain to you containers for dummies. It's a really good analogy because a container shipping system is only as valuable as the sum of places where you can ship.

09:02.000 --> 09:10.000
You know, no one would care about a shipping infrastructure, a worldwide shipping infrastructure that that was supported by two cities.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Right. No one cares about that. It's valuable because you can ship anything anywhere.

09:14.000 --> 09:22.000
And so that's that, you know, if you look at our roadmap for Docker, that's basically the goal that you can install Docker on any of your machines on one hand.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
And on the other hand, whatever it is that you're developing and packaging that Docker can can package it.

09:28.000 --> 09:35.000
So and this part of it, this packaging part of it is sort of one of the comparisons you always see thrown out whenever I talk about Docker in our chat room is jails.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
People compare it to BSD jails.

09:37.000 --> 09:47.000
One of the differentiators here and maybe you could go into a little detail here is I could build a Docker container that has Apache and MySQL all set up, ready to go.

09:47.000 --> 10:02.000
And then there is a way, a very Git like way for me to take that entire instance and publish it and then go to another machine or have or have a coworker or a fellow developer or whatever the scenario is, pull it down to their computer using another Git like command.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Right. Yep. That's exactly talk about that a little bit.

10:06.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah, I think there's a there's kind of this constant, you know, over time, we've been we've been Docker has been has been tested and used by a lot of people.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
And there's I don't know how many conversations about Docker I've been in, but it's a lot.

10:20.000 --> 10:27.000
And so there's kind of a pattern. There's kind of a pattern in the kinds of questions and reactions we get.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
And there's definitely one particular threat of reaction, which is basically, hey, this is nothing new.

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
Jails. Well, even in Linux, OpenVZ has been around forever.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
Vserver before OpenVZ has been around forever.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
You know, Solaris zones, et cetera, et cetera.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Even LXC, which is the kind of the newest of the bunch, has been around for a couple of years.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
So, you know, there's that question of, well, OK, you know, big deal.

10:51.000 --> 11:02.000
What you know, I will concede me, the expert sysadmin who has been using all these these amazing things for years, I will concede that, OK, this makes it easier for the beginner.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
But beyond being training wheels for the real deal, what the hell is Docker all about?

11:07.000 --> 11:14.000
And I hear that all the time. And I think there's a big misunderstanding, which is that, you know, Docker, we don't pretend to have invented this stuff.

11:14.000 --> 11:27.000
And we try really hard to make sure that constantly credits the you know, that the all the people building the really hard, important stuff that Docker is built on top of.

11:27.000 --> 11:39.000
So really, we're standing on the shoulder of giants here. What's really valuable, what's really new about Docker is that it's not just it's not just a new like a lighter VM, right?

11:39.000 --> 11:48.000
It's not just, hey, I can I can start a machine faster. I can I can sell a VPS for for less because there's less overhead.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
It's it's about using it's about creating a new unit of software delivery.

11:54.000 --> 12:05.000
Right. And the key word is delivery. It's moving things around, having that portable format and and and a portable runtime where you can specify in advance to the developer.

12:05.000 --> 12:18.000
Here's what's going to happen when when this application is run by Docker and everything that I'm telling you now about what's going to happen will be true for every single installation of Docker everywhere.

12:18.000 --> 12:26.000
And that's kind of a big deal. Do you suppose looking into your crystal ball of craziness going way out in the future as hard drives and bandwidth just become more and more plentiful?

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
Could actual desktop applications be delivered this way?

12:30.000 --> 12:43.000
Oh, I think so. I mean, you know, our focus is definitely the server first. But and if you had asked me six months ago, I said, well, you know, maybe one day, but but it will it will be a long time.

12:43.000 --> 12:55.000
Meanwhile, we have an entire subgroup, like an entire underground community without within the community that is porting Docker to to Raspberry Pi.

12:55.000 --> 13:06.000
Oh, wow. That was my next question, because it seems like the Raspberry Pi is it is the perfect device for this because the overhead of virtualization is just way too much. Right.

13:06.000 --> 13:15.000
And it's a perfect thing. And you there's plentiful. You could have dozens of them. You could move Docker instances around on all of them. I mean, so is that happening? Is Pi happening?

13:15.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah. So there was a big blog post. I keep reading about it. I'm just like, wow, who are these people?

13:22.000 --> 13:30.000
But yeah, it's it's it's Docker. We don't officially support 32 bit architectures, mostly not because it can't it doesn't work.

13:30.000 --> 13:40.000
It's basically there's an if statement in there. And if it's if 32 bit, then fail. And, you know, they've removed it and then kind of went through fixing problems as I find them.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
And yeah, there are people running Docker on Raspberry Pis today. Wow.

13:44.000 --> 13:53.000
And likewise. So embedded systems, I think there's a huge opportunity for that. And desktop applications, I see I see a lot of that going on.

13:53.000 --> 14:04.000
Not delivering, you know, not directly running the desktop application. A lot of the intermediary use case that I'm seeing is people want a desktop environment on the server.

14:04.000 --> 14:11.000
You know, they want a remote. They want a remote desktop. But, you know, but they don't want to junk up their main server OS.

14:11.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah. And they don't and they also don't want to set up like this one kind of special case desktop remote VM.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
They're like, you go you have to go and click around to make it work. They just like Docker run.

14:25.000 --> 14:38.000
There was this blog post about, you know, putting a like I forget the name that, you know, an open source alternative to the to the Microsoft suite, like all ready to go.

14:38.000 --> 14:47.000
So you would Docker run it and then you had an X window remote session, which would be, you know, tunnel through SSH.

14:47.000 --> 14:55.000
And then optionally, on top of that, you could have a VNC viewer, which itself had an HTML5 client.

14:55.000 --> 15:02.000
Wow. Wow. So a little desktop in the browser and, you know, under the hood, it was just a Docker container.

15:02.000 --> 15:10.000
So while we still have that crystal ball out, you know, looking at the future of Linux, this is such a great Linux solution.

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
It seems to be that more and more people are getting behind, especially on the SUSE side of the fence, getting behind ButterFS.

15:16.000 --> 15:23.000
Any future plans? How does ButterFS play in with Docker? Because I know that there's some challenges there, isn't there?

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
Like you couldn't use ButterFS in place of, say, an AUFS system, right?

15:28.000 --> 15:35.000
So the short answer is that I'm pasting a link to you right now, and that's a pull request for ButterFS support.

15:35.000 --> 15:43.000
Oh, wow. There it is. And so we're probably going to merge it this week as, you know, under the experimental label.

15:43.000 --> 15:52.000
But the blocker, there was a blocker, you're right. And the blocker was really in the internals of Docker and how our code was organized.

15:52.000 --> 16:00.000
It just had to do with the fact that, you know, Docker had AUFS built in, hard coded,

16:00.000 --> 16:07.000
and it took a little bit of reworking to make that part optional and pluggable and find the right API and all that good stuff.

16:07.000 --> 16:15.000
And it took us a while. Initially, 0.7 was supposed to come out a little earlier, but eventually we figured it out.

16:15.000 --> 16:24.000
And now that we went from one to two drivers, going from two to three and three to ten is really not that hard.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
And so there's people experimenting with, you know, a possible ZFS driver.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Oh, wow.

16:29.000 --> 16:35.000
SEF, GlusterFS. There's some crazy guy doing something that has to do with automatically syncing to bit torrents.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I don't know exactly what's going on there.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Wow. That could be pretty cool, too, though.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
There's a lot of cool stuff you can do.

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
So that's really like if I had to summarize what's going to happen going forward since I saw the crystal ball, right?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Yep.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
Before I get back to you, there's just going to be more of that, of taking things that are hard coded in Docker today

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
and moving that to an optional plugin, defining an API and shrinking the core.

16:58.000 --> 17:05.000
And we're going to do that for storage, for networking, for sandboxing, for service discovery,

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
all of these things that, you know, there's no single true way of doing it.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
There is 10, 20.

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
And everyone has a favorite, you know, everyone has a way they need to customize storage or networking or whatever.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
They should all be able to do it through Docker.

17:19.000 --> 17:26.000
I'm going to be deploying some Docker instances here probably in the beginning of the year because I'm a crazy guy

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
and I like to have kind of a really rapidly rolling system as my main system, but I can bring up in Docker,

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
I can bring up a Zimber installation and keep it nice and steady and stable running on top of a supported distribution.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
And I just look at this and I think this solves so many enterprise problems.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
This solves small business problems.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
This solves developer problems.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
And it also solves end user problems.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
And I think Docker is one of the most exciting things happening at the lower levels of Linux.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
So happy to see version 7 out.

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
But you guys are still not technically saying, hey, this is ready for production, are you?

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
You're still kind of saying we're still working on it.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
I don't know how long we're going to get away with that.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Because people are using it.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Yeah.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
And I can tell you, I got an email.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
I mean, there are a lot of people who are very comfortable saying publicly that they use Docker in production.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
And, you know, basically we're saying, hey, we're not saying we're not forbidding you.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Just a warning.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
If you do it, you better know what you're doing because we're not guaranteeing that anything will work properly.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
There is no particular reason.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
So people sometimes get suspicious.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
I mean, why are you saying that?

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
What's going to happen?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
There is no one thing that's going to.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
It's just engineering good practice, right?

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
You code and we're an ops shop, right?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
We run people's apps in production.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Right.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
We've been in that situation of, oh, cool, let's try that.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Let's use it.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
It'll be fine.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
And then it blows up, of course.

18:44.000 --> 18:51.000
So, you know, but at the same time, you've got Yandex, you know, the Google of Russia, and they're freaking huge.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
You got Baidu of China, and they've got Docker in production on thousands of servers today.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
We got an email from a startup called Runnable.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
And they do like snippets of code like the Google, like, oh, how do I do this and that?

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
And but then there's a run button and you click and you get to look a live running version of it.

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
And they emailed us saying, hey, we have half a million Docker containers in production.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Wow.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Holy cow.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
So, yeah.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Then, you know, what do you say to that?

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Right.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
OK, well, let me know if you have a problem.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
So a question from our chat room.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
They wanted to know, have you heard any indications that maybe this is one of the larger projects

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
running using Go?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
I think it's the biggest in GitHub, at least.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
I don't know.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
We talked to the Go team, the core Go team a lot.

19:41.000 --> 19:47.000
I think, you know, we used Go as a very kind of pragmatic decision process.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
We're a Python shop originally.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
We're not, you know, Go fanatics.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
We're not really fanatics of any language.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
And we kind of reached the conclusion of using Go and started using it and liked it.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
We kind of had that kind of gut feeling that it was cool, you know, as systems engineers,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
that this was something we could rely on.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
And so far, it turned out to be completely true.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
It's a great language.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
But, you know, what happened is, you know, Docker kind of blew up.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
It became popular very unexpectedly, very quickly.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
We were certainly not ready for it.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
And we're still paying the price now.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
I mean, there's chunks of code that, you know, you'll see, you know, fix me.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
This should not exist.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
And it's been there for, like, four months because we didn't have time to get around

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
to just cleaning it up.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
Well, you know, I talked to a couple of guys from the Docker project three, four, five

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
months ago, can't remember now, on the Coda radio show that we have on the network.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
And my comment then was, are you guys ready for how big this is going to get?

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
Because, you know, I was a sys admin for 14, 15 years.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
And this, I mean, let me tell you, I saw all of the problems this solved.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
So I can see how it's blowing up.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Do you feel pressure to get to 1.0?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Do you feel like it's building?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Oh, yeah.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Oh, yeah.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
A lot of pressure.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
I mean, there is just the pressure of, hey, a lot of people using it.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
You don't want to let them down.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
You know, you want that to be worth it.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
And now there's the additional pressure.

21:04.000 --> 21:12.000
You know, as a company, as an organization, a lot of businesses are betting their technology

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
platform on Docker, right?

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
So it's kind of this double, you know, you don't want to let down your fellow maintainers

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
and the community and give them crappy coding and kind of disappoint them.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
And you also, you know, you want to make sure that the businesses betting their technology

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
future on this.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
I mean, it seems kind of it is pretty crazy just how rapidly things happen.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I think it's just a matter of good timing.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
So, yeah, the pressure is definitely there.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
But, you know, it's healthy.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
It's good.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
It's also some of it's also one of the sexier demonstrations of recent low level functionality

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
we've gotten in Linux itself.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
And it's kind of a neat way to see this, see several like you like the three core components

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
you touch on.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
It's a neat way to see all three of them used.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Yeah, very compelling use case.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
And so I think a lot of that's resonating with a lot of people.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
And the fact that you're sitting on top of these established technologies like namespaces

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
and C groups, I think people feel a little more comfortable with that.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
Yeah, I think it's just a natural fit.

22:11.000 --> 22:17.000
Yeah, it's a that's where I'm comfortable personally, that kind of that that junction

22:17.000 --> 22:24.000
between low level systems and higher level APIs and platforms.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
And it's a very delicate it's really it's all about the art of, you know, finding the

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
right balance.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
If you go to too low level, then you kind of lose the end developer.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
What's the point?

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I don't care about this.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
And if you go to high level, then you kind of lose touch with the technical reality.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
And, you know, you start doing crazy abstractions that are pointless.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
It's a really hard line to follow.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
But, you know, I think it's a really cool challenge.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Yeah.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
And the ultimate reward is when you talk to, you know, really hardcore systems guys and

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
say, oh, you know, I'm glad you guys exist.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
You kind of showcase what's possible with the hard work we're doing.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Yeah.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Yeah, that's very true.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
That's pretty it's it's it's pretty cool.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Well, the last I just have a last couple of questions.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
One comes from the chat room, Bacon Flaps, which is always a great name.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
He wants to know if you could share a little bit about your teams, the ID you use and the

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
any kind of tool chain info you could share.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
So we're all we're first of all, it's very different from person to person.

23:22.000 --> 23:29.000
I am the least like what's the word like I'm the least sophisticated person you can find

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
in terms of working environment.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Yeah.

23:32.000 --> 23:39.000
I use stock V.I. on my little digital ocean V.M. right.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
And I'm happy.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Awesome.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
And I think like seriously, people make like everyone in the team makes fun of me is like,

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
what?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
You didn't tune this.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
Like, no, I'll have to remember how to do it again.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Yeah, exactly.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
I totally know what you mean.

23:52.000 --> 23:57.000
So and then it's funny because the rest of the team is kind of split between super, super

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
intense, super jacked up.

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
Emax set up and then super tunes V.I. set up.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
And I'm like there in the middle, like, you know, with my with my shitty set up.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
No, no, no other ideas really.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
I mean, you know, it's it's it is systems work.

24:15.000 --> 24:22.000
So we write and my rule of thumb is, you know, for example, I don't even have C tags configured.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
So when I, you know, when I when I want to look up the definition of a function, I'm

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
calling I got to remember which file to go to and go look it up manually.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
And I also something that everyone else makes fun of me for.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
But I like it that way.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
That's kind of my my canary when I when I can't keep it on my head just by moving around

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
in files.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
I know it's time to refactor.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
The code's too complicated.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Oh, you know, that's that's my thing.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Good point.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Good point. All right.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Well, is there anything you want else you want to touch on before we let you get back

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
to your Tuesday?

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Let's see.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Yeah, there is one.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I mean, yeah, there's a whole list.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
Well, we wrote a blog post about the 07 release.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
Yeah.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
You want to go through some of that?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Yeah.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
There's there's there's a lot.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
So I don't want to go through all of it.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
Oh, you know, I'll just encourage everyone to go look at it.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
I'll have I'll have that linked in the show notes as well as a getting that you're getting

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
started guide.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
You guys have is great.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
And also a little info about this.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
We'll have the link to this which you're about to cover in the show notes.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
So go ahead.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Yeah.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Any parts you want to go through?

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
I'm all for it.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
I love it.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.080
I love the support for links.

25:24.080 --> 25:28.640
That's because it's a it's a it's a it's a small incremental improvement, but it's the

25:28.640 --> 25:34.360
beginning of a really important part of the roadmap, which is orchestration and service

25:34.360 --> 25:40.960
discovery and basically going from one container in isolation to lots of containers working

25:40.960 --> 25:47.440
together on lots of machines and forming a stack that you can manipulate as as a cohesive

25:47.440 --> 25:48.440
entity.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.440
Interesting.

25:49.440 --> 25:54.360
So is this like network networking ports like a turn on networking ports and open for everyone

25:54.360 --> 25:55.360
in that stack?

25:55.360 --> 25:56.360
Yeah.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.360
So.

25:57.360 --> 25:58.360
So this first step is very simple.

25:58.360 --> 26:01.640
It's basically and the feature is called links.

26:01.640 --> 26:05.840
And what it allows you to do is basically connect container A to container B. OK.

26:05.840 --> 26:11.840
So that one can discover and connect to discover the open the ports exposed by the other and

26:11.840 --> 26:13.800
connect to them in a standard way.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.400
Oh, that's really nice.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.400
That makes it much easier.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.400
Yeah.

26:17.400 --> 26:21.540
So basically you do, you know, Docker run database and then you'll say Docker run front

26:21.540 --> 26:27.680
end dash link database and then that the database is linked into the front end and then the

26:27.680 --> 26:32.120
front end can now connect to the database in a simple standard way.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.560
And it's you know, it's it's very simple for now.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.260
It's it's local to one machine only for now.

26:38.260 --> 26:44.400
It uses the simplest possible means of discovery and its environment variables, which is both

26:44.400 --> 26:50.680
simple and easy to start using and also limited like it can't change dynamically at through

26:50.680 --> 26:53.000
as the as the process continues to run right.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.440
If you want to attach a new dependency, you have to restart.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.240
So all of that we're going to fix in future versions.

26:58.240 --> 27:04.140
But the fundamentals are there and it's a super, super important part of Docker's roadmap

27:04.140 --> 27:10.800
because here's the thing contained the way people use containers.

27:10.800 --> 27:15.520
Is is as a group, right, increasingly, if you got a single container, you can you can

27:15.520 --> 27:17.600
do things, but pretty quickly, like, OK, this is great.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.840
I want more of them and I want to wire them up together.

27:19.840 --> 27:20.840
Absolutely.

27:20.840 --> 27:21.840
Here's the risk.

27:21.840 --> 27:25.800
The risk is that, you know, the risk is fragmentation.

27:25.800 --> 27:32.800
We put a lot of effort in in in building this runtime that is standardized and works the

27:32.800 --> 27:33.800
same way everywhere.

27:33.800 --> 27:37.320
That way, once I have a dozen of them, I don't have a nightmare of management on my hands.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.320
Right.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.480
Yeah, because it could start to become it could start to get really wily after you have

27:41.480 --> 27:45.520
four or five, six, seven, a dozen, 20 of these things that could be really nuts.

27:45.520 --> 27:46.520
Yeah.

27:46.520 --> 27:50.440
And so in the same way that we you know, we want any container, any image you get from

27:50.440 --> 27:55.560
the index, from anyone that produced a produce an image from using Docker anywhere that that

27:55.560 --> 28:00.320
should run on a 100 percent of all Docker deployments the same way.

28:00.320 --> 28:01.320
Right.

28:01.320 --> 28:05.440
And now we're reaching the point where a lot of these containers, part of their functionality

28:05.440 --> 28:07.520
is to be connected to other containers.

28:07.520 --> 28:12.880
If I if I build the off the most awesome Postgres container you can think of and I share it

28:12.880 --> 28:18.440
with you, you know, what you want to do with that database is connect to it from from another

28:18.440 --> 28:19.440
container.

28:19.440 --> 28:24.520
So how containers can be plugged into each other needs to be standardized.

28:24.520 --> 28:28.760
Otherwise what will happen is I'll give you this that Postgres container and say, hey,

28:28.760 --> 28:30.560
here's my standard database container.

28:30.560 --> 28:36.400
Oh, by the way, you can only use it if you happen to use ZooKeeper and and and Mezos

28:36.400 --> 28:41.800
because that's what I use for orchestration or you need open stack heat or you need whatever.

28:41.800 --> 28:47.080
So but to solve that problem we need to just put in there just one does that the smallest

28:47.080 --> 28:53.080
possible amount of standardization so that every container uses the same mechanism for

28:53.080 --> 28:59.720
finding another container and then machine by machine you can customize how it's done.

28:59.720 --> 29:03.800
You can still use Mezos, you can still use a pack, you know, open stack heat, you can

29:03.800 --> 29:10.400
still use all of those different orchestration tools, but the container doesn't need to know.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.320
So anyway, that's that's a really important part of it.

29:12.320 --> 29:13.320
Awesome.

29:13.320 --> 29:14.320
There's gonna be a lot more.

29:14.320 --> 29:18.080
I can't wait to watch as more comes out and I'd love to keep a line open to you guys just

29:18.080 --> 29:22.560
to come on in the future when you get closer to 1.0 as you build towards that because it's

29:22.560 --> 29:24.080
an awesome project.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.280
Thank you.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.120
We have gotten a lot of good response from our audience too.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.720
I think there's a lot of people out there are finding use cases for it too.

29:29.720 --> 29:34.080
Definitely and and one call to action if I could just add one more thing is that if there's

29:34.080 --> 29:39.960
one place that I recommend anyone go if you want to learn more about Docker or just interact

29:39.960 --> 29:43.560
more or ask questions or complain or anything at all.

29:43.560 --> 29:44.560
It's the IRC channel.

29:44.560 --> 29:49.680
It's just it's the one place, you know, pound Docker on on free node.

29:49.680 --> 29:51.320
There is a lot of people.

29:51.320 --> 29:56.840
It's super active and people are very nice and I don't know about you guys, but I sometimes

29:56.840 --> 30:02.040
I kind of get a bad first experience from open source IRC channels because it can be

30:02.040 --> 30:07.440
elitist and kind of it can make you feel stupid if you're a beginner and I'm very it's up

30:07.440 --> 30:11.920
there in my top three, you know, things I'm most proud of in Docker is the fact that everyone

30:11.920 --> 30:16.120
is super helpful and nice on that channel and there's like 600 people there.

30:16.120 --> 30:17.120
That's awesome.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.120
That's awesome.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.840
I would say first thing if you have if you're interested in any way just go there and talk

30:20.840 --> 30:24.880
and just or hang out and see what's what's what's going on.

30:24.880 --> 30:25.880
Very good.

30:25.880 --> 30:26.880
All right.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.240
Well, thank you very much Solomon for coming on the show today and congrats on the new

30:29.240 --> 30:30.240
release.

30:30.240 --> 30:31.240
Thank you.

30:31.240 --> 30:32.240
Appreciate it.

30:32.240 --> 30:35.640
And folks can find more at Docker dot IO will also have links to all of that good stuff

30:35.640 --> 30:41.880
in the show notes and I cannot wait to see as it at version dot eight comes out and then

30:41.880 --> 30:42.880
dot nine.

30:42.880 --> 30:43.880
And I don't know.

30:43.880 --> 30:44.880
I don't think I'm going to wait till dot one Solomon.

30:44.880 --> 30:45.880
I just have to warn you.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.880
I think I'm going to be putting in production before then, but I won't tell you I won't

30:47.880 --> 30:48.880
stress you out.

30:48.880 --> 30:49.880
All right.

30:49.880 --> 30:51.880
You know where to find me if you have a problem.

30:51.880 --> 30:52.880
Okay.

30:52.880 --> 30:53.880
Well, thanks so much for coming on the show.

30:53.880 --> 30:54.880
Okay.

30:54.880 --> 30:55.880
Thanks.

30:55.880 --> 30:56.880
Appreciate it.

30:56.880 --> 30:57.880
All right, Matt.

30:57.880 --> 30:58.880
Well, that was fun.

30:58.880 --> 30:59.880
And how great was that?

30:59.880 --> 31:03.160
That was all worked out because I know they're pretty proud of that new release and it sounds

31:03.160 --> 31:04.160
really great.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.160
So I mean, it was great.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.160
It was fantastic.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.160
Yes, it was.

31:07.160 --> 31:11.480
You know, he mentioned he mentioned something in our chat with him that I think maybe now

31:11.480 --> 31:15.080
be a good time to take a little break and mention to the good folks at home.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.640
And that is our sponsor this week.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.760
And that's digital ocean.

31:18.760 --> 31:22.960
Digital ocean is simple cloud hosting that you control.

31:22.960 --> 31:26.840
I'm talking you get the root account of this bad mama jamma and it is yours.

31:26.840 --> 31:29.020
And digital ocean loves Docker.

31:29.020 --> 31:32.000
So if you're not familiar with digital ocean, let me let me give you the background here.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.700
Digital ocean, simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

31:35.700 --> 31:42.660
easy to spin up cloud servers ever use users like, you know, you, me, I do it in 45 seconds,

31:42.660 --> 31:47.600
but maybe you'll get it done in 55 seconds to spin up a totally your own server.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.600
Pricing plans are great, too.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.580
They start around five dollars per month.

31:50.580 --> 31:54.320
Five dollars per month gets you five hundred twelve megs of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD drive,

31:54.320 --> 31:56.960
one CPU and a terabyte of transfer.

31:56.960 --> 32:00.520
Digital ocean has data centers located in New York, San Francisco and Amsterdam.

32:00.520 --> 32:05.040
In fact, I've got last time I checked, there's two data centers in New York.

32:05.040 --> 32:09.760
And the way I've done it is since I'm here on the West Coast, I decided I have some stuff

32:09.760 --> 32:13.680
here on the West Coast that I host out of my own house on my files business connection.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.960
And then for the stuff that I need to have a little bit better performance on or stuff

32:16.960 --> 32:22.240
I just want to help supplement me on the West Coast, I set up a digital ocean VPS in and

32:22.240 --> 32:25.480
I think there's like their New York, New York number two server.

32:25.480 --> 32:30.160
And now I've got it on both ends of the continent, it's on the continent, both ends of the United

32:30.160 --> 32:31.160
States of America.

32:31.160 --> 32:34.800
It is it is really great for the functionality I'm using for in this case, it's BitTorrent

32:34.800 --> 32:38.520
sync with some supporters and a few other a few other functionalities they need internally

32:38.520 --> 32:39.520
to the network.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.520
I just I pay five dollars a month.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.920
But what's awesome is if you're like, yeah, I think maybe there's some things I could

32:43.920 --> 32:44.920
use this for.

32:44.920 --> 32:45.920
I'm not quite sure.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.160
Well, we can get you a ten dollar credit.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.880
And if you get the five dollar a month system like I've got, that'll get you two months

32:50.880 --> 32:53.400
for free when you use the code Linux 13.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.560
One word Linux.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.560
You know about Linux.

32:55.560 --> 32:56.860
You like Linux, right?

32:56.860 --> 32:58.200
So use that code Linux.

32:58.200 --> 32:59.200
And then 13.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.200
Why 13?

33:00.200 --> 33:01.200
Lucky number.

33:01.200 --> 33:04.240
Actually, that's just the episode they joined us like Linux 13.

33:04.240 --> 33:08.820
Digital Ocean also offers a vast collection of tutorials in their community section.

33:08.820 --> 33:12.840
And you can submit you can submit to that community section and get paid fifty dollars

33:12.840 --> 33:14.200
per published piece.

33:14.200 --> 33:18.280
So if they decide they want to publish what you've written, you can get a fifty dollar

33:18.280 --> 33:19.280
fifty dollar bone.

33:19.280 --> 33:21.880
I think they probably give you and I don't think of your bones or if they give you credit,

33:21.880 --> 33:23.440
but you get fifty dollars from Digital Ocean.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.540
I will have a link to that in the show notes.

33:25.540 --> 33:26.540
But I wanted to back up.

33:26.540 --> 33:30.600
So we were just talking about Docker and with Solomon from Docker.

33:30.600 --> 33:34.840
And one of the things that's really nice, in fact, I'm going to go log in and show you

33:34.840 --> 33:35.840
this right now.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.320
Just take a second.

33:37.320 --> 33:43.780
But so one of the challenges I've had is I'll get something all set up here at the house

33:43.780 --> 33:49.280
and then and then it works well enough that I don't actually ever go put it public because

33:49.280 --> 33:54.280
the time it would take to to go reset it up again is just I'm not interested.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.640
I've already spent my time setting up.

33:55.640 --> 33:57.880
It works like I started experimenting.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.320
The experiment was a success.

33:59.320 --> 34:00.320
And then it ends up in production.

34:00.320 --> 34:01.320
Right.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.360
And it's always like, well, this is just going to be temporary and then it never ends up

34:03.360 --> 34:04.360
being temporary.

34:04.360 --> 34:06.720
You can get right.

34:06.720 --> 34:11.440
So this is what this is why I think Docker is going to be really brilliant is I could

34:11.440 --> 34:15.000
take Docker, I could set up the instance that I want to create.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.800
So maybe in my case, it's a BitTorrent sync.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.800
Maybe it's a Zimbra server.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.680
And here I'll show you if you're watching the video version.

34:20.680 --> 34:27.640
I go in, I name my host name on DigitalOcean and I'll just call this Helper.

34:27.640 --> 34:31.680
And I'm going to choose the five dollar month, five twelve megs of RAM, one CPU, 20 gig SSD,

34:31.680 --> 34:33.800
one terabyte of transfer for five bucks a month.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.260
Oh, they they also have hourly rates.

34:36.260 --> 34:37.260
They have hourly rates.

34:37.260 --> 34:40.160
If you just want to try something for a little bit, I'm going to choose New York, too.

34:40.160 --> 34:45.840
Now, so on the select your image, I can choose Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Arch, Linux or Fedora.

34:45.840 --> 34:46.840
Yeah, Arch.

34:46.840 --> 34:49.440
That's not any crazier than Fedora on a server, right?

34:49.440 --> 34:50.440
That's awesome.

34:50.440 --> 34:51.440
I mean, come on.

34:51.440 --> 34:52.440
Not at all.

34:52.440 --> 34:53.440
Not at all.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.440
Nothing wrong with that.

34:54.440 --> 34:55.440
No.

34:55.440 --> 34:56.920
But they also have application images.

34:56.920 --> 34:57.920
And look at this.

34:57.920 --> 34:58.920
Which is very, very cool.

34:58.920 --> 34:59.920
Big time saver.

34:59.920 --> 35:00.920
Saves you time, right?

35:00.920 --> 35:01.920
Yeah.

35:01.920 --> 35:04.960
WordPress on Ubuntu 12.10, Docker 0.7.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.880
The version that came out today.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.120
That's crazy.

35:09.120 --> 35:10.120
Right there.

35:10.120 --> 35:15.360
Ubuntu 13.10, or I'm sorry, 13.04, 64 bit.

35:15.360 --> 35:19.800
And if I just if I click create droplet, I now have a Docker system ready to go.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.720
And I would just use that Docker check in and check out process.

35:22.720 --> 35:28.080
I would check in my Docker instance, log in over SSH and just check it in on this machine.

35:28.080 --> 35:29.080
And I'm done.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.080
I started and it's running.

35:30.080 --> 35:31.520
It's like I'm all done.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.080
All that work I did set up on my local machine.

35:33.080 --> 35:34.080
I just upload it.

35:34.080 --> 35:35.080
I started.

35:35.080 --> 35:36.080
It's brilliant.

35:36.080 --> 35:39.480
And this shows you how sophisticated DigitalOcean is to have version 0.7 today.

35:39.480 --> 35:44.800
And what's beautiful is inside that Docker container, even though this is a Ubuntu 13.04

35:44.800 --> 35:49.080
image that would be running in the host operating system, I could have a CentOS base in there,

35:49.080 --> 35:50.080
right?

35:50.080 --> 35:51.160
I could have I could have an arch base in there.

35:51.160 --> 35:54.720
I could have anything inside that container.

35:54.720 --> 35:59.240
It's just so awesome because it totally normalizes the underlying operating system and DigitalOcean

35:59.240 --> 36:00.240
is down with it.

36:00.240 --> 36:04.440
And you load that on top of their super fast SSD drives and the crazy great bandwidth and

36:04.440 --> 36:08.280
the terabyte transfer you're getting for five dollars per month.

36:08.280 --> 36:11.280
That's cheaper than a lunch at Jack in the Box.

36:11.280 --> 36:14.840
And you have an awesome VPS server that can just load anything you need.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.400
It's totally ready to go and is totally a quantified cost.

36:17.400 --> 36:18.400
I think that's awesome.

36:18.400 --> 36:22.800
So use our code Linux 13 when you're checking out over DigitalOcean and you'll get two months

36:22.800 --> 36:23.960
of credit.

36:23.960 --> 36:27.200
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.200
Oh, definitely.

36:28.200 --> 36:33.520
And you got to love the fact that you are able to not only find yourself among the most

36:33.520 --> 36:37.280
bleeding edge stuff possible, but I mean, but it actually happens today.

36:37.280 --> 36:41.200
I mean, like, I mean, the fact that it's being released today, we thought we had the big

36:41.200 --> 36:44.360
scoop because we got the CTO on the day it comes out.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.080
Meanwhile, DigitalOcean is like, yeah, what else?

36:46.080 --> 36:47.080
We already have in production.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.080
Let's go.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.080
Hey, Matt.

36:49.080 --> 36:55.240
This is CNN breaking news, a little breaking news here in the unplugged headquarters.

36:55.240 --> 36:58.220
Turns out Jack in the Box does not exist in the Southeast.

36:58.220 --> 37:00.240
So seriously, I did not know that.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.240
My apologies.

37:01.240 --> 37:07.240
I made a I made a reference to a crappy burger joint that I still sometimes eat out.

37:07.240 --> 37:08.360
But that's not even in the Southeast.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.800
So I'll take it up a notch.

37:09.800 --> 37:12.280
Did you know that the Waffle House doesn't exist up here?

37:12.280 --> 37:16.320
Yeah, I don't know, though, because I would tell you what, to my knowledge anyway.

37:16.320 --> 37:17.320
Well, here's why.

37:17.320 --> 37:18.320
Here's why.

37:18.320 --> 37:19.320
It's so funny.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.320
You bring that up.

37:20.320 --> 37:21.320
That's kind of weird, actually.

37:21.320 --> 37:27.560
So there's this site I just heard about called Coinmap.org and Coinmap.org is a Google Maps

37:27.560 --> 37:28.560
overlay.

37:28.560 --> 37:34.000
I think it's Google Maps that shows you all the places around you that accept Bitcoin.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.280
And since Bitcoin is the only form of currency I now have to my name, I thought I maybe should

37:38.280 --> 37:40.040
get familiar with the places that accept it.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.240
And I kid you not.

37:41.240 --> 37:42.360
And I don't know.

37:42.360 --> 37:45.140
It's ironic that you brought this up because I was seriously looking at this like two hours

37:45.140 --> 37:46.140
before the show.

37:46.140 --> 37:47.520
We hadn't talked before the show.

37:47.520 --> 37:54.560
But two hours ago, I was looking on a Coinmap.org and oh, this is Waffle Stop.

37:54.560 --> 37:56.200
All that build up and it's not Waffle House.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.200
It's Waffle Stop.

37:57.200 --> 38:00.280
But there's a Waffle Stop in Bellingham that takes Bitcoins for waffles.

38:00.280 --> 38:01.280
Oh, is there really?

38:01.280 --> 38:02.280
Yeah.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.320
Bellingham is pretty, they're pretty good at adopting new technology.

38:05.320 --> 38:06.560
I'm not terribly surprised.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.960
I'm surprised there's not a few medical cannabis stores on this map.

38:09.960 --> 38:10.960
That seems like a match made in heaven.

38:10.960 --> 38:11.960
No, that's on the way to Anacortes.

38:11.960 --> 38:14.960
I mean, not that I know anything about that.

38:14.960 --> 38:15.960
So anyway.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.840
You know, they get a drive through going, right?

38:17.840 --> 38:18.840
Okay.

38:18.840 --> 38:19.840
Yeah.

38:19.840 --> 38:23.120
If you guys want to check out Coinmap.org, it also uses, if your browser supports location

38:23.120 --> 38:26.240
APIs, it'll be creepy and figure out where you're at.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.400
So okay, Matt, here's what I did.

38:28.400 --> 38:32.680
I brought in the Mumble Room, our online Linux users group, and I figured they could help

38:32.680 --> 38:33.960
us answer some of our emails.

38:33.960 --> 38:38.040
Since we're doing the show a little out of order, I wanted to get our guest on and talk

38:38.040 --> 38:42.440
about that because I'm a bit of a docker slut, so I felt like I needed to chat with

38:42.440 --> 38:43.440
him.

38:43.440 --> 38:44.440
Well, aren't we all?

38:44.440 --> 38:45.440
Right.

38:45.440 --> 38:46.440
Right.

38:46.440 --> 38:47.440
Well, it is pretty cool.

38:47.440 --> 38:53.040
So Eric the Great wrote in, and sometimes I make jokes here on the show.

38:53.040 --> 38:57.740
And what I'm about to tell you is not a joke at all, I'm 100% serious.

38:57.740 --> 39:05.440
Eric the Great wrote in a very long email and he wanted to talk about how the problem

39:05.440 --> 39:09.760
with Linux on the desktop is that it's lacking apps.

39:09.760 --> 39:16.280
Ironically, Eric sent the email as an attachment in a doc X format.

39:16.280 --> 39:21.560
Now I got to believe he's screwing with me a little bit here, right?

39:21.560 --> 39:22.560
Maybe, maybe.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.520
But he may have a point to a degree.

39:24.520 --> 39:25.520
Let's hear what he has to say.

39:25.520 --> 39:26.520
All right.

39:26.520 --> 39:31.320
It's been so, so long that I can't read all of it, but he says, industry specific apps

39:31.320 --> 39:34.880
are either not available for Linux desktops or not as mature as they are on their Windows

39:34.880 --> 39:35.880
counterparts.

39:35.880 --> 39:38.560
Number two, there's not enough software that's configured to work by de facto standards.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.360
Don't know what he means by that.

39:40.360 --> 39:44.160
There's no good desktop groupware clients for the Linux that replace Outlook.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.160
Okay.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.160
Arguably true.

39:46.160 --> 39:47.440
Except for Zimber desktop is pretty good.

39:47.440 --> 39:50.680
Number four, the other thing that's a good Linux desktop needs is properly integrated

39:50.680 --> 39:51.680
features.

39:51.680 --> 39:54.440
Many times there's a piece of software that Linux just works, that works well.

39:54.440 --> 39:58.120
MakeFS is one of these encrypted NFS, unlike TrueCrypt, it provides it.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.120
Okay.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.120
Anyways.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.640
And the thing to remember is the desktop should be usable offline.

40:01.640 --> 40:03.440
Oh, is Pope in here?

40:03.440 --> 40:04.440
Oh, is Pope in here?

40:04.440 --> 40:10.820
Oh, the desktop should be usable offline for a small business when the server or internet

40:10.820 --> 40:14.200
connection goes down.

40:14.200 --> 40:20.280
You know, I feel like his main complaint was the applications he wants to buy aren't available

40:20.280 --> 40:21.280
for Linux.

40:21.280 --> 40:24.280
Well, here's the meat and potatoes of it that everybody fails to get is.

40:24.280 --> 40:27.420
And Linux users do it, Windows users do it, OS X users do it.

40:27.420 --> 40:31.000
If it doesn't meet my requirements, then it affects the entire world around me.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.140
And it just drives me nuts.

40:33.140 --> 40:34.140
It drives me nuts.

40:34.140 --> 40:40.040
It's like for myself, honestly, 99.99999% of what I do is in Linux.

40:40.040 --> 40:45.360
I mean, like I literally, the only time I actually run Windows is when I need to run

40:45.360 --> 40:49.680
for business purposes, multiple video conferences in Skype.

40:49.680 --> 40:52.720
And because it doesn't happen to be supported in Linux, that's literally for myself the

40:52.720 --> 40:54.200
only reason that I would.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.920
So and there's other people that have other needs.

40:55.920 --> 40:59.040
Maybe they have an AutoCAD need or maybe they have other specific things.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.240
But I think it's more task oriented.

41:01.240 --> 41:06.680
To claim that the platform is flawed or not usable based on the fact that he's not finding

41:06.680 --> 41:09.640
it meeting his needs is ridiculous.

41:09.640 --> 41:13.440
I agree, although you can apply that same argument to the Mac.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.560
But here's my take on it.

41:15.560 --> 41:21.080
It's like if I'm Eric the Great, I'm good for probably the next 10 years, right?

41:21.080 --> 41:26.640
I got Windows seven's got support till until I don't know when, like for a while, right?

41:26.640 --> 41:28.200
And then even then, yeah.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.200
Oh wow.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.200
Wow.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.200
That's amazing.

41:31.200 --> 41:35.960
And then even then, like if I really, really still loved Windows in 2020, I can probably

41:35.960 --> 41:41.040
jump on the eight dot one bandwagon, install some crappy extra software to give me a start

41:41.040 --> 41:43.080
menu and make it even for a few more years.

41:43.080 --> 41:44.080
Right?

41:44.080 --> 41:45.080
Yeah.

41:45.080 --> 41:46.080
But like there is a path.

41:46.080 --> 41:50.520
But even then, Eric's got to be sitting here going, man, I'm really about to get screwed.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.080
This is this is not going in the right direction.

41:52.080 --> 41:55.160
I mean, he's got to be sitting here thinking, what am I going to do?

41:55.160 --> 41:56.680
Maybe I mean, not immediately, right?

41:56.680 --> 42:00.480
No, but he hasn't experienced that he hasn't experienced the pain point yet for him.

42:00.480 --> 42:04.120
His pain points that he's experiencing is that he's missing specific applications that

42:04.120 --> 42:08.240
do certain things that he's used to the way he's doing it or that even its availability

42:08.240 --> 42:09.240
and that may be the case.

42:09.240 --> 42:13.720
And I think history will look back and go, boy, look at all of the things Microsoft did

42:13.720 --> 42:20.480
to enable their own downfall because I actually think extending Windows seven support to 2020

42:20.480 --> 42:24.720
what you're doing is you're giving time for alternative ways of doing things to develop

42:24.720 --> 42:26.840
and people are going to come up with replacements.

42:26.840 --> 42:30.960
And I talk about this more and more now where I think like video editing on Linux is a good

42:30.960 --> 42:35.760
example of something that will never match the proprietary commercial offerings.

42:35.760 --> 42:39.480
I mean, you can now buy like I don't actually know what the actual price is, but I think

42:39.480 --> 42:44.760
Final Cut 10 is like ninety nine bucks and motion is like ninety nine bucks and you could

42:44.760 --> 42:49.800
make TV grade productions from that from those products.

42:49.800 --> 42:53.440
It's not going to happen on Linux and if it does happen on Linux, it's going to be too

42:53.440 --> 42:58.320
far too late because things like Google Hangouts are going to get better and WebRTC where it's

42:58.320 --> 43:00.340
not really taken off yet.

43:00.340 --> 43:04.200
There is such industry support for that that there's going to be products built around

43:04.200 --> 43:09.920
WebRTC and today when we say video editing in the cloud, that sounds effing crazy.

43:09.920 --> 43:14.440
Well by 2020, it's not going to sound that effing crazy because it's going to be so doable

43:14.440 --> 43:18.520
that there will be software packages that clowns like me that broadcast from a garage

43:18.520 --> 43:24.240
can buy that use WebRTC and I do all of it through my web browser and then I just download

43:24.240 --> 43:27.240
the final file to my Linux box and apply any final touches to it.

43:27.240 --> 43:30.840
And what my point here is, is this is going to completely change the way video editing

43:30.840 --> 43:31.840
is done.

43:31.840 --> 43:35.160
So it's not that the existing method of video editing is going to come to Linux.

43:35.160 --> 43:38.960
We're just going to do video production in new ways and Linux will be there when those

43:38.960 --> 43:40.560
new ways are developed.

43:40.560 --> 43:42.960
And I believe it is the same for CADs and all this kind of stuff.

43:42.960 --> 43:45.360
It's just going to take a really long time.

43:45.360 --> 43:46.920
And it'll all run on Docker, obviously.

43:46.920 --> 43:50.520
Well, I mean, you know what I'm saying, it could totally happen.

43:50.520 --> 43:55.560
Yeah, I mean, I've already seen early attempts at like online video editing, very young,

43:55.560 --> 43:59.260
very much not ready for primetime and it's very, you know, Windows Movie Maker level.

43:59.260 --> 44:00.320
But the stuff does exist.

44:00.320 --> 44:03.320
It's already beginning to happen whether people want it to or not.

44:03.320 --> 44:04.320
Yeah.

44:04.320 --> 44:06.360
Visit the Google Chrome extension store sometime.

44:06.360 --> 44:07.360
I think you'd be surprised.

44:07.360 --> 44:08.440
There's a lot of stuff there.

44:08.440 --> 44:10.440
Not Jupiter Broadcast, you know?

44:10.440 --> 44:11.440
No, not there.

44:11.440 --> 44:12.440
All right.

44:12.440 --> 44:13.440
So Craig writes in.

44:13.440 --> 44:14.440
Go ahead.

44:14.440 --> 44:15.440
Well, that's the thing.

44:15.440 --> 44:20.320
Today, like connectivity is extremely simple.

44:20.320 --> 44:23.640
We've got LTE, we've got 3G.

44:23.640 --> 44:26.480
So it's not hard to be wireless and connected now.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.880
The whole Microsoft ad as well is just stupid.

44:28.880 --> 44:32.180
It's like, oh, yeah, if you're not connected to the internet, you can't use it.

44:32.180 --> 44:34.040
That's not entirely true.

44:34.040 --> 44:36.920
But when are you not connected to the internet?

44:36.920 --> 44:39.880
I mean, I'm always connected to the internet now.

44:39.880 --> 44:43.920
Like anywhere I go, even if I go into like the woods where like it's all Blair Witchy.

44:43.920 --> 44:47.800
Well, and I guess maybe the better question is what are you doing in the woods?

44:47.800 --> 44:48.800
Whoa.

44:48.800 --> 44:49.800
Yeah.

44:49.800 --> 44:50.800
Whoa.

44:50.800 --> 44:51.800
With your laptop, too.

44:51.800 --> 45:00.800
I would challenge him to run a Linux distro for a month and find those alternatives because

45:00.800 --> 45:03.160
it doesn't sound to me like he's done his research.

45:03.160 --> 45:08.960
No, I'm going to wager that this is someone who has, it's what I call a drive-by review.

45:08.960 --> 45:11.720
Well, basically they stuck their toes in it.

45:11.720 --> 45:12.720
Well, come on.

45:12.720 --> 45:20.440
I mean, I don't know, like if I went to work every day and needed After Effects, I mean,

45:20.440 --> 45:21.440
it comes down to needing After Effects.

45:21.440 --> 45:22.440
No, that's fair.

45:22.440 --> 45:24.220
But I think he was happy where he was at.

45:24.220 --> 45:26.080
Someone probably recommended he check it out.

45:26.080 --> 45:27.080
He half-assed it.

45:27.080 --> 45:28.080
He tried it.

45:28.080 --> 45:29.840
And it was kind of like, eh, not really for me.

45:29.840 --> 45:30.840
I'm happy where I'm at.

45:30.840 --> 45:31.920
He gave his honest opinion.

45:31.920 --> 45:36.720
We got a lot of emails from people who say that converting to Linux is like, you got

45:36.720 --> 45:41.560
to understand, it's not just an alternative software selection, it is an alternative way

45:41.560 --> 45:42.960
to use your computer.

45:42.960 --> 45:45.960
Oh yeah, God, me using OS X is like newbies trying to use Linux.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.760
I understand the frustration of stuff.

45:47.760 --> 45:50.040
Believe me, I scream at Mac all the time.

45:50.040 --> 45:51.040
I can't deal with it.

45:51.040 --> 45:53.880
So I understand like that switching platforms frustration.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.240
I totally get that.

45:55.240 --> 46:01.120
But then again, when I'm yelling at the Mac, it's because I'm half-assing it.

46:01.120 --> 46:02.120
I'm not trying.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.120
I'm like, this is hard.

46:03.120 --> 46:04.120
I give up and I go back to Linux.

46:04.120 --> 46:05.120
It's fine.

46:05.120 --> 46:08.380
Well, the thing about the Mac, and this is sort of the truth about the Mac, there's two

46:08.380 --> 46:10.240
ways to do things.

46:10.240 --> 46:13.800
There's Apple's way that they let you do it, and then there's no way to do it.

46:13.800 --> 46:16.280
And if you're okay with the Apple way, then the Mac will work for you.

46:16.280 --> 46:19.300
And if you ever kind of want to go outside that box, that's where it starts to become

46:19.300 --> 46:20.300
a frustrating experience.

46:20.300 --> 46:21.720
But I'm a special kind of idiot.

46:21.720 --> 46:24.080
And you know, when it comes to using OS X, I can, can I do it?

46:24.080 --> 46:25.120
Yeah, I can do it.

46:25.120 --> 46:28.240
Do I find it to be the most ass backwards way of doing pretty much everything?

46:28.240 --> 46:29.240
Yeah, I do.

46:29.240 --> 46:30.560
I just, I can't deal with it.

46:30.560 --> 46:33.000
The way they, the way they lay things out, I've always frustrated me.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.280
I've always gotten grief on it.

46:34.280 --> 46:35.280
Well, idiot, it can use a Mac.

46:35.280 --> 46:36.280
Well, then I'm a special kind of idiot.

46:36.280 --> 46:37.280
I don't know.

46:37.280 --> 46:38.280
That's okay.

46:38.280 --> 46:43.200
You know, I was like, you can use it and want to, or two different ways.

46:43.200 --> 46:48.040
Well, Mac is also genius because when you make, you move files and drag and drop files,

46:48.040 --> 46:49.600
it doesn't, it doesn't make a copy for you.

46:49.600 --> 46:51.920
It makes a shortcut, which everybody wants.

46:51.920 --> 46:54.920
They lost me when I started ejecting stuff by dragging it to a trashcan.

46:54.920 --> 46:55.920
I'm done at that point.

46:55.920 --> 46:56.920
It's like, you know what?

46:56.920 --> 47:05.920
Hey, I know Apple is, he used Ubuntu and then he saw those Amazon ads and was like, what?

47:05.920 --> 47:06.920
Oh, hell yeah.

47:06.920 --> 47:07.920
Yeah.

47:07.920 --> 47:10.880
There's that controversy, but that's just a jab.

47:10.880 --> 47:14.680
Craig writes and he says, Hey Chris and Matt, I love Linux Unplugged and I haven't missed

47:14.680 --> 47:15.680
an episode yet.

47:15.680 --> 47:20.040
Converting to Linux, even for a veteran admin is something no one really wants to do.

47:20.040 --> 47:22.520
There are just too many distros to choose from.

47:22.520 --> 47:26.680
Going through the late nineties, like you said on episode 15 is hardly, is hardly heard

47:26.680 --> 47:30.160
of losing him here about this.

47:30.160 --> 47:31.600
Let me read ahead a little bit.

47:31.600 --> 47:35.560
Upon switching, I had no issue at all as I became more and more interested in computers

47:35.560 --> 47:37.120
and learning what the command line was.

47:37.120 --> 47:40.520
However, my situation was as almost perfect situation as it could ever be for a Linux

47:40.520 --> 47:41.520
convert.

47:41.520 --> 47:44.800
My girlfriend can log into a Ubuntu 13.04 and open up a new tab to research something

47:44.800 --> 47:45.800
for college.

47:45.800 --> 47:49.080
My mother calls me with her wireless mouse, battery's dead and proceeds to tell me she

47:49.080 --> 47:50.080
needs a new computer.

47:50.080 --> 47:52.420
And that's essentially all I have to worry about.

47:52.420 --> 47:58.080
But he brings up the point that it's just a big hassle to switch over and, and it's

47:58.080 --> 47:59.920
not even a matter of being better.

47:59.920 --> 48:03.780
It's a matter of, uh, being a, of a familiarity, right?

48:03.780 --> 48:04.780
It's a matter of that.

48:04.780 --> 48:05.780
I agree with.

48:05.780 --> 48:06.780
Yeah.

48:06.780 --> 48:12.200
So I go back to, I go back to, I look at this and I think, uh, uh, he thinks that, uh, you

48:12.200 --> 48:15.280
know, as you, as you make the switch over, it's just kind of all going to be based on

48:15.280 --> 48:16.560
what your motivations are.

48:16.560 --> 48:22.520
Um, he says, uh, I, he said, if, if, if East East, well, this is one part of that was interesting.

48:22.520 --> 48:26.960
He said, if each distro came together and focused on the major issues like video drivers,

48:26.960 --> 48:30.840
auto audio drivers, audio, video editing, software, gaming, then Linux would be a thousand

48:30.840 --> 48:34.040
fold better than windows or Mac, uh, hands down.

48:34.040 --> 48:36.680
I, you know, well, and see, there's another one of those statements.

48:36.680 --> 48:40.120
It's like, okay, the video drivers and audio drivers, again, based on someone's personal

48:40.120 --> 48:43.580
experience where they running a machine, which clearly is giving them some grief with it.

48:43.580 --> 48:48.200
I have no problems, but I run, I run computers that I fortunately are compatible with what

48:48.200 --> 48:49.200
I'm using.

48:49.200 --> 48:52.440
So, you know, is it truly a widespread problem?

48:52.440 --> 48:54.640
Honestly, you really want to get the brass tacks.

48:54.640 --> 48:59.500
I would say windows has more, uh, retroactive, uh, compatibility issues with driver support

48:59.500 --> 49:01.040
than Linux ever will.

49:01.040 --> 49:05.080
So, you know, so yeah, it's kind of like, it's all perspective, I suppose.

49:05.080 --> 49:06.080
So I mean, yeah, absolutely.

49:06.080 --> 49:09.440
There are people out there that will find that, you know, they get a black screen when

49:09.440 --> 49:10.440
they boot from a live distribution.

49:10.440 --> 49:11.440
Hey, wait a minute.

49:11.440 --> 49:15.400
Did you install the drivers first or did you connect the USB device first?

49:15.400 --> 49:18.680
Because if you connected the USB device before you installed the drivers, it's not going

49:18.680 --> 49:19.680
to work.

49:19.680 --> 49:20.680
Sorry.

49:20.680 --> 49:22.300
And it's really important when you have a Palm Pilot to not install the drivers and

49:22.300 --> 49:24.520
plug that in first because that always works really well.

49:24.520 --> 49:25.520
I remember those days well.

49:25.520 --> 49:28.200
God, it used to frustrate the hell out of me.

49:28.200 --> 49:34.480
My wife has a MacBook pro and sometimes it'll sit on her lap and she'll shut the lid and

49:34.480 --> 49:38.680
go to put it underneath the sofa and I'll see the light still on and I'll say, hang

49:38.680 --> 49:39.680
on a minute.

49:39.680 --> 49:41.280
That's, that's not right.

49:41.280 --> 49:46.840
And my, my game OS, uh, desktop windows seven doesn't suspend.

49:46.840 --> 49:48.000
It flat out won't suspend.

49:48.000 --> 49:52.440
I've tried to spend the energy, it just doesn't, I've gone through all the knowledge base articles

49:52.440 --> 49:54.040
and I cannot make it work.

49:54.040 --> 49:59.040
And no matter how many drivers or firmware or BIOS updates I put on it, it just doesn't

49:59.040 --> 50:00.040
work.

50:00.040 --> 50:05.640
It's just me that the windows and OS 10 outclass Linux on the driver department is talking

50:05.640 --> 50:06.640
out of their ass.

50:06.640 --> 50:07.640
Yeah.

50:07.640 --> 50:09.800
I've got, I've got one windows machine left in the house.

50:09.800 --> 50:14.040
I booted into it, uh, two weeks ago for Koda radio.

50:14.040 --> 50:19.000
And after I was done with that episode of Koda radio, I went to shut it down and it

50:19.000 --> 50:20.860
would only go back to the login screen.

50:20.860 --> 50:24.600
If I restart or shut down, it would only go back to, that's all they could do is log out

50:24.600 --> 50:26.320
and then just hold the power button down.

50:26.320 --> 50:27.960
It didn't matter what I clicked.

50:27.960 --> 50:30.200
And it's just like, what really?

50:30.200 --> 50:31.200
This is, this is ridiculous.

50:31.200 --> 50:35.400
Well, and the one last one, my wife's Mac, her Mac specifically, it never fails.

50:35.400 --> 50:39.280
I put, we go ahead and we put it in suspend as soon as we're ready to go to bed, it comes

50:39.280 --> 50:41.280
to life all by itself.

50:41.280 --> 50:42.280
Hey, are you sleeping?

50:42.280 --> 50:43.280
Are you sleeping?

50:43.280 --> 50:45.080
And it's always Facebook that kicks it on.

50:45.080 --> 50:46.080
It's like, what the hell?

50:46.080 --> 50:47.080
You know?

50:47.080 --> 50:48.080
It misses you, man.

50:48.080 --> 50:49.080
It misses you.

50:49.080 --> 50:50.080
Oh, clearly.

50:50.080 --> 50:51.080
Yeah.

50:51.080 --> 50:52.080
It's, it's beckoning me.

50:52.080 --> 50:53.080
Have you checked the iTunes store?

50:53.080 --> 50:54.080
Come log into iTunes.

50:54.080 --> 50:56.080
I got a very special crowbar with its name on it.

50:56.080 --> 50:58.080
I'll tell you, man.

50:58.080 --> 51:00.240
All right.

51:00.240 --> 51:01.880
So Bob wrote in, this is just a quick one.

51:01.880 --> 51:05.120
He says, great show my experience with mom and dad users that they not only need to use

51:05.120 --> 51:06.920
a web browser, but also an office suite.

51:06.920 --> 51:09.580
I know many of these users who struggle with windows eight.

51:09.580 --> 51:14.560
So I moved a few of these people to Ubuntu 12.04 where they're all able to get by without

51:14.560 --> 51:16.920
any tinkering with the default install.

51:16.920 --> 51:19.800
These users were unable to learn windows eight at all.

51:19.800 --> 51:23.760
So I disagree with some of the statements on Linux unplug that new users need to tinker

51:23.760 --> 51:24.760
more with Linux.

51:24.760 --> 51:29.080
I think the intermediate users probably do, but certainly not new users.

51:29.080 --> 51:33.520
Ubuntu and Mac are only two OSs that I found new users can just pick up with no help.

51:33.520 --> 51:34.520
Yeah.

51:34.520 --> 51:36.920
I think, I think it depends on how you define new user.

51:36.920 --> 51:39.920
My favorite new user is someone that has zero experience with a computer because they have

51:39.920 --> 51:40.920
no perceived misconceptions.

51:40.920 --> 51:43.520
Fewer and fewer of those people now though.

51:43.520 --> 51:45.520
Yeah, they're still out there, but it's nice and nice.

51:45.520 --> 51:46.520
Unless you live out where I live out in the backwoods.

51:46.520 --> 51:47.520
Right.

51:47.520 --> 51:48.520
Yeah.

51:48.520 --> 51:50.960
You go out in the country or, you know, you go up into the older demographics and you

51:50.960 --> 51:51.960
can find them still.

51:51.960 --> 51:54.520
I mean, we still have people chasing cows around with USB cords.

51:54.520 --> 51:55.520
It's scary.

51:55.520 --> 51:56.520
But yeah.

51:56.520 --> 51:59.800
Well, windows eight really is.

51:59.800 --> 52:04.000
I mean, I'm sure I probably overshared this story, but I'll just share it again because

52:04.000 --> 52:06.440
I haven't told it on this show.

52:06.440 --> 52:11.480
When windows eight came out, actually when it was, when it was like, I guess it was done

52:11.480 --> 52:15.480
with RC or whatever, where you could download a trial for a limited time.

52:15.480 --> 52:17.160
You didn't have to buy it.

52:17.160 --> 52:21.440
And so I had a client that had five computers.

52:21.440 --> 52:24.620
So they had this room where they had QA people because they ran a website where they posted

52:24.620 --> 52:27.800
things that had to be QA'd all the time because they came from outside sources.

52:27.800 --> 52:31.160
So they had a team of about a dozen QA people and they had about five computers that were

52:31.160 --> 52:35.760
not being used because they would only kick them into gear during the heavy season.

52:35.760 --> 52:38.960
And then during the slow time they would, it was temp staff and they wouldn't, those

52:38.960 --> 52:40.440
computers wouldn't be in use.

52:40.440 --> 52:45.800
So I took those five computers and per the client's request, loaded the eight one demo

52:45.800 --> 52:49.640
or trial on it and which you could re extend a couple of times.

52:49.640 --> 52:51.920
And I did have to extend it one time.

52:51.920 --> 52:56.640
So we put these five users of various proficiency.

52:56.640 --> 53:01.620
One that I would say is he's definitely not a technical user, but he knows windows seven

53:01.620 --> 53:05.960
so well that he showed me a couple of things and I know windows pretty well.

53:05.960 --> 53:07.840
I've, you know, used to support it for years.

53:07.840 --> 53:09.160
And so he's, he's definitely sophisticated.

53:09.160 --> 53:13.480
I mean, he'd never know anything about like event viewer or, you know, any of that kind

53:13.480 --> 53:16.920
of stuff, but he probably knows about device manager and he can definitely install printers

53:16.920 --> 53:17.920
and all that kind of stuff.

53:17.920 --> 53:22.480
Then I had a user who, you know, is pretty much still struggling with the fact that the

53:22.480 --> 53:25.920
mouse has two buttons and one of them does something different than the other button.

53:25.920 --> 53:27.840
So good range, right?

53:27.840 --> 53:33.240
And none of them, none of them could figure out how to shut down the windows eight computer.

53:33.240 --> 53:34.420
Oh, it's confusing.

53:34.420 --> 53:35.420
None of them could.

53:35.420 --> 53:39.160
Cause the thing is, is they won't, they won't just go poking in the corners.

53:39.160 --> 53:41.920
They won't just go down there if there's no visual indications for them.

53:41.920 --> 53:45.380
And none of them even paid attention to the tutorial, even though I played the tutorial

53:45.380 --> 53:49.220
for all of them that comes with windows a, they didn't, they didn't help at all.

53:49.220 --> 53:54.240
And the other thing that was constantly confusing for them was the, the thing they were QAing.

53:54.240 --> 53:57.880
They had to QA a version of it in IE and a version of it in Firefox and a version of

53:57.880 --> 53:58.880
it in Chrome.

53:58.880 --> 54:03.280
Well, cause the IE one uses active X, only the problem was the Metro version of IE doesn't

54:03.280 --> 54:08.760
use active X. So, and they kept getting confused between, wait, am I in IE on the desktop?

54:08.760 --> 54:10.360
Am I in IE in Metro?

54:10.360 --> 54:13.480
And the, why is the address bar on the bottom and this UI and why is the address bar on

54:13.480 --> 54:14.480
the top in this UI?

54:14.480 --> 54:16.920
And totally disconnected from it.

54:16.920 --> 54:23.560
And these same people, these same users for a, for a short period of time were on an XFCE

54:23.560 --> 54:27.980
desktop and had none of these problems because it, because first of all, who the hell uses

54:27.980 --> 54:28.980
hot corners?

54:28.980 --> 54:29.980
I mean, that's the problem.

54:29.980 --> 54:30.980
So.

54:30.980 --> 54:31.980
Yeah.

54:31.980 --> 54:35.600
Uh, Chris Lee, uh, my friend was looking up, looking to update his laptop.

54:35.600 --> 54:37.680
So we went online, we found the model.

54:37.680 --> 54:45.480
We ended up with a HP Smudge, I believe, and it came with Windows 8.

54:45.480 --> 54:49.000
He's not overly familiar with Windows because when he was first getting into computers,

54:49.000 --> 54:51.920
I actually convinced him to actually use Ubuntu.

54:51.920 --> 54:54.400
So he's always been an Ubuntu user.

54:54.400 --> 54:58.360
He used it for a week and he said there was so many weird things, like because there was

54:58.360 --> 55:03.000
a touch screen, he said we'd type stuff and then Metro would just pop up for no reason

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
at all.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
And he said, it was just, I'm like, yeah.

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
And he's just like, he got so frustrated and like a stupid things like when he's trying

55:09.000 --> 55:13.720
to do like the HTMI out, um, he didn't quite understand you got to slide the bar over and

55:13.720 --> 55:16.080
then you've got like the mirror, but like, it's not just mirror.

55:16.080 --> 55:20.200
You've got like options for like screen resolutions, but the screen resolutions was wrong for the

55:20.200 --> 55:25.520
TV and it killed like the screen on the monitors when it was on the TV.

55:25.520 --> 55:26.520
He had so many hassles.

55:26.520 --> 55:28.600
He said, look, he said, I don't care anymore.

55:28.600 --> 55:32.380
He said, just come over, put that operating system on that I've been used to because I

55:32.380 --> 55:33.680
absolutely hate Windows 8.

55:33.680 --> 55:37.160
I explained to him that like, you know, I'm not going to be able to draw a boot properly

55:37.160 --> 55:38.880
because it's got U F I E problems.

55:38.880 --> 55:41.400
I said, I can do the thing where you do like escape.

55:41.400 --> 55:43.840
He said, no, I do not want Windows 8 at all.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.080
He said, I absolutely hate it.

55:45.080 --> 55:46.480
He said, I don't want it.

55:46.480 --> 55:49.560
So you know, people, and he's not very computer literate.

55:49.560 --> 55:55.680
He's pretty useless on the computer, but he can work his way around it perfectly fine.

55:55.680 --> 55:59.080
I think it's what you get used to using.

55:59.080 --> 56:03.400
I realized something when Chris said earlier that people didn't know how to do the shutdown

56:03.400 --> 56:07.640
and I have messed with a Windows 8 and 8.1 and I've helped people like walk them through

56:07.640 --> 56:11.800
things and when you said that, I realized that I have never shut it down on Windows

56:11.800 --> 56:12.800
8.

56:12.800 --> 56:14.840
I have no idea how to do it.

56:14.840 --> 56:18.200
It's a, I I've worked with eight and it's definitely a, but first you got to do the

56:18.200 --> 56:22.340
hokey pokey and then you shake it all about, twirl around in a couple of circles and then

56:22.340 --> 56:23.440
finally it will appear.

56:23.440 --> 56:26.440
It's the weirdest thing, but yeah, it's about, it's about three different options.

56:26.440 --> 56:27.440
It's be dug into.

56:27.440 --> 56:28.440
Yeah.

56:28.440 --> 56:29.440
Yeah.

56:29.440 --> 56:32.320
The funny thing about Windows 8.1 is that they brought back the start button but not

56:32.320 --> 56:33.320
the menu.

56:33.320 --> 56:34.320
Yeah.

56:34.320 --> 56:37.360
So when people who have a start menu, like a third party installed, that it, they're,

56:37.360 --> 56:40.520
the buttons are in the same place on top of each other, so there's like a 50 50 chance

56:40.520 --> 56:41.520
which one you click.

56:41.520 --> 56:42.520
What a train wreck.

56:42.520 --> 56:43.520
What a train wreck Windows is becoming.

56:43.520 --> 56:44.520
It is so, wow.

56:44.520 --> 56:45.520
Oh, it abuses me.

56:45.520 --> 56:46.520
I'm, I'm fine with it.

56:46.520 --> 56:47.520
I mean, let's be honest.

56:47.520 --> 56:53.960
I mean, I used to do PC repair and Windows is what drove me to Linux.

56:53.960 --> 56:57.720
I mean like actually repairing other people's stupidity is just, that's literally what drove

56:57.720 --> 56:58.720
me to it.

56:58.720 --> 56:59.720
You know?

56:59.720 --> 57:04.240
So two, two more emails and then the grand question I want to ask you and the, and the

57:04.240 --> 57:06.760
mumble room.

57:06.760 --> 57:10.080
But first we should, we should thank our second sponsor this week.

57:10.080 --> 57:12.080
So everybody knows about Ting now, right?

57:12.080 --> 57:14.760
Everybody knows about Ting cause Ting is sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

57:14.760 --> 57:16.760
Now Ting is mobile that makes sense.

57:16.760 --> 57:23.100
And I want you to go over to linux.ting.com linux.ting.com will get you $25 off your first

57:23.100 --> 57:28.920
device or $25 off your first month of service if you already have a sprint compatible device.

57:28.920 --> 57:29.920
Now.

57:29.920 --> 57:31.040
Oh, guess what?

57:31.040 --> 57:32.360
My Nexus 5 shipped today.

57:32.360 --> 57:36.600
My Nexus 5, I'm supposed to, freaking UPS is I'm going to get it tomorrow.

57:36.600 --> 57:37.600
I don't know if that's possible.

57:37.600 --> 57:38.600
I am so jealous.

57:38.600 --> 57:39.600
I am so excited.

57:39.600 --> 57:41.080
Are you going to be cackling at the poor man as he watches it?

57:41.080 --> 57:42.520
Oh, well I'm going to give him a handy.

57:42.520 --> 57:43.520
Are you kidding?

57:43.520 --> 57:51.040
I'm, he's, I'm excited to get my Nexus 5 and here's why I think this is a better time than

57:51.040 --> 57:52.040
ever to sign up for Ting.

57:52.040 --> 57:58.320
First of all, if you have the internet phone with the iOS 4 or 4S, iPhone 4 or 4S and now

57:58.320 --> 58:02.240
compatible with the Ting network, you go over to the BYOD page, which you can find over

58:02.240 --> 58:04.600
at linux.ting.com and they'll give you all the info you need.

58:04.600 --> 58:09.020
If you've got a sprint compatible iPhone, if you've got the Nexus 5, this is what is so

58:09.020 --> 58:13.720
awesome about Ting is they've been very transparent about the entire process because first of

58:13.720 --> 58:17.240
all, they're a CDMA network, which is a huge boon here in the US because that gets the

58:17.240 --> 58:21.520
signal through areas that GSM just doesn't generally penetrate as well.

58:21.520 --> 58:25.640
And so one of the things that a CDMA carrier has had to deal with for sort of the first

58:25.640 --> 58:30.120
time is a phone that requires a SIM card because that's generally something that's only on

58:30.120 --> 58:35.520
the GSM networks and it's been really awesome and encouraging to watch the Ting folks very

58:35.520 --> 58:40.480
publicly in their forums and in their blogs work with their community, work with the experts.

58:40.480 --> 58:45.880
It's so awesome to see a cell phone company recognize that people in their audience know

58:45.880 --> 58:50.360
a lot about these Android devices and are very savvy and very capable of helping them

58:50.360 --> 58:51.960
have a better service.

58:51.960 --> 58:57.280
It's huge for me as a Ting user and to see them work to get the Nexus 5 with their community

58:57.280 --> 59:02.520
has been awesome and it's what gave me the final push to make my Nexus 5 purchase.

59:02.520 --> 59:09.340
I cannot wait to combine the power of purchasing directly from Google on Google Play and unlocked

59:09.340 --> 59:14.560
Google experience Nexus 5 phone and then bring it over to Ting, which is no contracts, no

59:14.560 --> 59:18.080
early termination fees and you only pay for what you use.

59:18.080 --> 59:22.600
That is such an awesome combination and I want you to go over to linux.ting.com to get

59:22.600 --> 59:27.760
started and by the way, if you're in a contract now and you've been thinking about switching,

59:27.760 --> 59:29.920
Ting is going to give you some early termination relief.

59:29.920 --> 59:32.520
You can get more information at ting.com slash ETF.

59:32.520 --> 59:35.600
They're going to give you about up to $75 I believe it is per line that you have to

59:35.600 --> 59:36.600
get canceled.

59:36.600 --> 59:40.400
All you got to do is grab your Ting device, port your number, then submit your ETF claim

59:40.400 --> 59:43.520
and Ting will help you get out of that contract and then you're only paying for what you use.

59:43.520 --> 59:47.280
They include hotspot, they include tethering, their customer support is amazing.

59:47.280 --> 59:53.640
You can call them at 1-855-846-4389 anytime between 8am and 8pm and just talk to them

59:53.640 --> 59:54.640
about the Nexus 5.

59:54.640 --> 59:57.920
They'll just talk to you about the Nexus 5 like you got questions on how that's going

59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.200
to work, how's picture messaging, all that kind of stuff, you just talk to them.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.560
They'll give you, they'll help you out.

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:05.560
They've also got help.ting.com which gives you lots of resources.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:09.360
You can find out more information, do discovery and exploring on your own.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:12.120
So go over to linux.ting.com to get started.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.120
You're going to love Ting.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.120
It makes sense.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.120
It's no BS.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.120
No hidden fees.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:20.680
You can pay for what you use, $6 per line and you can share it pooled minutes.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:21.880
It's really awesome.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:25.240
So I want you to go try it, linux.ting.com and go get started now because the sooner

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.640
you switch, the more money you'll save in the long term.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.060
I love those guys.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.140
They keep my bills stupid cheap.

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:32.140
It's great.

01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:33.140
I know.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.140
It really is awesome.

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.140
I kind of feel like I'm cheating a little bit.

01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:36.140
I don't know.

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.720
Well, that could be interpreted depending on what you have in mind for the UPS guy.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.720
I don't know.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:43.280
Once you're mentioned in there, it's like, wait, what?

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.640
So Carl wrote and he said, dear Linux, please keep on breaking.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:48.640
What?

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.920
He says, my typical day is I fire up windows when I'm at work because there's no efficient

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:56.280
way to get around the fact that they have like a dozen proprietary windows only apps

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.280
they require me to run.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.400
And since I already have windows set up for work, I also get caught in playing steam games

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.320
on windows because well, F, if I got the windows installation, why not?

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.320
He says.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:10.160
However, as soon as the clock strikes five and the workday is over, I hit the switch

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.240
on my desktop and boot into Linux.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.200
The best way I can describe that moment is coming home from a hard day's work and throwing

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.840
off a stiff suit before putting on your sweatpants and cracking up a cold one.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:25.000
Heading out to the garage to restore that car or something like that, Linux will always

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.280
fight me, which is to be expected since I have a multi-headed setup with three monitors

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.880
of different sizes and resolutions.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:37.000
And I'm also sending my sound over HDMI to the one of the monitors connected to my Nvidia

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
card.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.060
In other words, I'm begging for trouble with broken X, but that's fine.

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:45.380
That's part of why I love it, because when stuff breaks and has to be fixed, that's when

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:50.960
you learn how it works, why it broke, and how you can configure it better than before.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:55.340
Hell, half the time I'm almost hoped for something to behave unexpectedly, so I'll have a reason

01:01:55.340 --> 01:02:01.560
to sit down and have a puzzle to solve, he says, walking out knowing a lot more than

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:02.560
I did before.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:06.720
And I think it's one of the hidden charms that keeps a lot of people away from the platform.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.720
Oh, okay.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:12.000
He says, and that allowed me to move quite quickly from hand-holding Ubuntu installation

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.600
to running two servers, a laptop, and a desktop under arch.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.440
I had everything just working.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.840
I might have gotten bored and jumped back full-time to Windows, but now with the challenge,

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:22.840
I press on.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.800
He says, most people can live with Linux.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.400
Tinkers can hardly imagine living without it.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:33.480
Also, all this time spent on Linux has taught me a few still valid tricks on how punching

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.320
my Mac in the face through the terminal when it's ill-behaved.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.320
Nice.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.240
Which is also a reward to itself, he says.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.240
Keep up the good work.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.640
Once again, thanks for the great show, Carl.

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:44.640
Good time.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.000
I'm going to be honest.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.080
I think one of the things that keeps me on Linux is the tinkering factor.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.440
Yeah, I mean, for me, well, see, for me, I think it's different.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.240
It's the consistent behavior.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.200
And like I said, what drove me to it initially was the fact that I was watching, I don't

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.240
want to say de-evolution of humanity, but it felt like it at some days, to where people

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.160
were not only being dumbed down using these other operating systems, but quite honestly,

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.880
it was like it was more operating system than they needed, that Linux could in fact fill

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:13.880
these needs.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:17.000
And a lot of people, when I actually retired from it, I switched them over to Linux, and

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.520
then occasionally provide some remote support, and it works out really well.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.440
I don't have the problems I used to have with it.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.440
So different strokes, different folks.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:29.040
In fact, to put it all in perspective, Terence wrote in, and the headline was...

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.040
Oh, go ahead.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.960
Yeah, Matt, I completely agree with that.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.560
If you're going to install Linux onto someone's laptop or computer, definitely install Team

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.560
Viewer.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.560
So when you do...

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.560
Oh, yeah.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.560
Yeah.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.560
So you could just...

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.560
It takes two seconds.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:44.560
Team Viewer in, click, click, done.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:45.560
And you sort that PC out.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.560
Exactly.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.560
Yeah.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.560
Yeah.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:49.560
Or Splashtop.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.560
Yeah, Splashtop.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.560
Remote access, regardless of what system they're running.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.560
Yeah.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:53.560
Exactly.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.560
Yeah, totally.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.560
That was a real game changer for a lot of folks, for sure.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.560
Mm-hmm.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.320
You know, all of that's going to get real crappy, by the way.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.320
I believe.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.320
Yeah.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:04.440
I believe that Landon and Mir both proposed to make those remote viewers much more challenging.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.440
Well, that's important.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.440
Yeah.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.440
Because, you know, I mean, we have something we can really be proud of, but let's break

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.440
it.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.440
Good news, everybody.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.440
Yeah, right.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:13.440
It's like, okay, Dr. Nick.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.440
Good to know.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.560
And then we'll have to go back into the virtual machine remoting.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.560
Yeah.

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.800
You know, I help people out in Birmingham and stuff on Team Viewer.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.880
Team Viewer is like a must if you're trying to wean someone off like weaned Hazel Mack.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.880
Yeah.

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880
It really is, yeah.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.880
You've got to have that hand-holding experience.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:32.360
Yeah, I have not used Team Viewer as much because I don't like the... Isn't the client

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.680
on Linux a wine app?

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.440
It is a wine, it's a self-contained bottle, yeah.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.440
Yeah.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:40.800
And see, with Splashtop, they actually have a native Linux app, and I just... I use that

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.600
to get into my mom's machine, and it's click, click.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:44.760
You know, it's so fast.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.320
I like that.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.960
So in terms of... You mentioned Mir and remote desktoping.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.840
That won't be a problem for a while because the next LTS release we're going to is going

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.840
to still have X.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:00.520
So for the next five years after 2014, it's not a problem.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.520
Right.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.520
Yeah, true.

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:03.520
Yeah.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.520
That's a good point.

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:05.520
I mean, I guess that's the silver lining.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.520
Good enough for me?

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.520
Good enough.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:10.760
Whalen, however, proposes to introduce that problem.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.760
They are working on...

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.760
Yeah, those guys.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:13.760
Oh, come on.

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:14.760
Whalen at Whalen today.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:20.800
Actually, I think the Whalen guys are working with somebody from one of the VNC groups to

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.840
figure something out, but it is good times.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:27.200
But I think all of this... I think we all need a little perspective right now.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.200
So Terrence writes in.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:33.640
He says, back in my day, insert old man's voice, back in my day, when I installed Linux,

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:38.280
there was a distro called Slackware, and it was an unholy beast in its infancy during

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.800
the late 90s.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.880
One of my beloved 386 XSs.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.600
It took 10 hours to compile the Linux kernel, and one misstep would ruin your install.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.660
Consider yourselves lucky whiny Nancy boys that you even have a window manager or a graphical

01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:55.000
settings manager.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.400
There's no Google back then.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:02.120
All I had was a 500-page Slackware book that came with way too many floppy disks for the

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.120
installation.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.120
Installing Linux...

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.120
Yeah.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.120
We want it, Nancy boy.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.120
That won me over.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.560
Installing Linux back in those days was a blast because it was an adventure with numerous

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:11.560
pitfalls.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.720
You used Linux with pride because it was your baby made with your sweat and tears.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:19.520
Linux is far from perfect, but I feel sorry for people who are locked up in Apple and

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.120
Microsoft's jails.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:25.680
They are narrowing their dimensions of yourselves every day, and eventually all that will be

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.640
left with their services that they'll sell at a premium.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:34.120
Linux is the wild, wild west of operating systems, and may God bless Linus.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.120
Wait.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.120
Linus is our God.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.120
Terrence.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.120
Wow.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:41.120
Tell us how you really feel.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.120
Praise Linus.com.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.120
Yeah.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.120
Really.

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.120
Yeah.

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.120
I like to hold you.

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.120
That was pretty good.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.120
Thank you.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.120
Thank you.

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:51.120
I was just connecting with him there.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:52.120
Yeah.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:57.600
So I have one... We're getting a little tight on time, but one of the things that we've

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.640
been looking forward to on the Linux Action Show is getting our hands on that new Leopard

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.640
Extreme from System76.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.640
Oh, yeah.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.040
Well, so we just got word from System76.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.040
It's better than that.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.040
Oh, yeah.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.560
We're also going to get the new Kudu, right?

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.560
That's what it's called, the Kudu?

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.560
Yep.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.560
Kudu.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.200
And we're going to get their Ultrabook with a brand new keyboard arrangement that they've

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:20.680
just set up for it based on their purchaser feedback.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:25.960
So I thought I'd ask you guys, as we get ready to review these... And I'm going to start

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.800
with Matt to give the mumble room time to think.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:33.700
Matt, what for you... If you were going to buy a computer, what are some of the key things

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.400
you need in a Linux workstation?

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:39.440
Well, and I think we already know that, obviously, compatibility is already set with Ubuntu, so

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.440
that's a no-brainer.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.440
That's done.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.800
But I think a keyboard's a really big thing for me.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:47.120
Keyboard and the actual touchpad placement itself, how that feels.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.480
Do those keys feel responsive?

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.480
Are they working for me?

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.480
Because I'm really crazy.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:54.800
So if you were in the market right now, would you buy a desktop or a laptop?

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.360
Based on current needs, laptop and a stone cold second, yeah.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:05.000
But based on if I needed both, I would probably say desktop first, because I'm kind of weird

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
like that.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.920
But yeah, based on current needs, totally laptop.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:11.840
And I'm really, really specifically weird when it comes to keyboards and laptops.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.880
And System76 has been really good overall.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.680
If I only had one keyboard, I wasn't really in love with, but most of them are really

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.680
awesome.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:18.680
All right.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.680
Just a couple of things for me, I would love... Because you don't really see it on a laptop

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:24.680
keyboard.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.680
I'd love a keyboard with backlight.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:26.680
I could see the keys and stuff.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:27.680
Yeah, yeah, right.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.680
I understand that.

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:29.680
You guys are all really focused on laptops.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.680
Yeah.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.680
I want the Bonomo.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:32.680
Screen resolution or laptops suck.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:33.680
They still suck.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:34.680
Many of them not even 1080p.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:35.680
Yeah.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:36.680
Yeah.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.680
The high resolution on the laptop's important.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.680
Sure.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:46.360
I mean, I got a tablet in a higher screen resolution and most tablets, not to use laptops

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.360
on the market.

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.960
It's ridiculous how low screen resolution laptops are.

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.160
So what about on the desktop though?

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:55.800
Like what do you look into for a desktop, like for the ultimate desktop?

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.800
Quiet.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.800
Yeah.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.800
That's what I was thinking too.

01:08:58.800 --> 01:08:59.800
Quiet.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:00.800
That's what I was thinking.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.800
Quiet and power.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.960
And also not having to wonder, okay, how much of what am I maxing out now?

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.880
Or do I have enough resources to do this?

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.880
So expandability.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.880
Yeah.

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.880
Powerful.

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.880
Yeah.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.880
Power and expandability and quiet.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.880
Those are two different things.

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.880
Case quality too.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.880
Case quality.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.880
Case quality.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:20.520
While I want the quietest computer, I want the loudest clacky keyboard to show that I'm

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:21.520
actually working.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.520
Right.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.520
I know what you mean.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520
Old IBM style clacky.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.520
Yeah.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520
They've got to get the jerry switches.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:29.880
There's a few people in Mumble with very loud keyboards, so I can.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:30.880
Yeah.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.880
Yeah.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:32.880
Yeah.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.640
On TechSnap, I often joke that Alan's keyboard is the third host because he's got one of

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:37.920
those Razer with the clackies.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.920
Yeah.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.520
So this is what I'm thinking for a desktop's quiet expandability, case quality.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:45.040
It sounds like on a laptop, we got keyboard, backlight.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:48.160
It's funny because so far nobody said battery life or wireless.

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.760
Oh, that's a good point.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:50.760
Yeah.

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:51.760
The battery life, yeah.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:52.760
That would be helpful.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:10:00.040
I always want an SSD no matter what, desktop or laptop.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.360
No way I'll ever go to a hard drive now.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:07.840
SSD is kind of getting just the only way to go now.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:13.200
The only feature on a laptop that is a go no go for me is if the keyboard doesn't have

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.400
a touch point on it, I don't want it.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.400
Like the little nipple?

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.400
Yep.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.960
If it hasn't got one, I don't want it.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:19.960
Really?

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:20.960
Yeah.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:25.760
I've spoken to the System76 guys about it and I was like, dude, last time I bought a

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:29.720
laptop, I bought a ThinkPad and if you had a nipple on your laptop, I would totally have

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.720
bought it.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:39.760
I'm the opposite, I hate those nipple things.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:40.760
It hurts my finger.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:41.760
Yeah.

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.760
Well, with all due respect, you're wrong.

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.920
For me, I feel like I should be buying it dinner first or something.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920
It just feels weird.

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.240
It just feels incredibly intimate and awkward.

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:52.240
I don't know.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.240
Pope is all about his nipples.

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:57.880
It's how you caress it, whether it's good or not.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:58.880
I'm Scaramanga.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.880
I have three.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.880
For Chandler.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:10.040
Going back to the Touchpad, I would say the clickable buttons, I cannot stand Touchpads

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.320
without clickable buttons.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.320
Right.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:13.320
Actual clicks.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.320
That's how my H is.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.320
You need that tactile.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.320
Yeah.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.320
Yeah.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:18.320
Yeah.

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.320
Yeah, the Trackpad.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.320
I feel like right now, which is funny because it doesn't match what you're saying, even

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.000
though I completely agree with you, I feel like the only people who have the one button

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.280
Trackpad really great is Apple because even on my Bonobo, I totally can use it.

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:37.920
In fact, I appreciate that it has two finger touch scrolling because that is a very natural

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.360
kind of way to scroll a web page and stuff.

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:43.900
But generally, if I'm going to sit down like what I'm doing last, and it's partially how

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:47.480
I sit too, but I still prefer to go to a physical mouse.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:52.480
That's why I'm... Is the Trackpad or the nipple, is it really that big of a deal?

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.480
Is it a make it or break it?

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:57.280
It's kind of like the Touchpad that you can do like a zoom in for like a Google Earth

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:01.760
and we can see the multi-touch on the Touchpad.

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:10.320
The nice thing about the nipple is with the middle mouse button, you can hold your... If

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:16.880
you imagine holding your index finger on the nipple and your thumb on the... Don't... Steady.

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:21.680
And your thumb on the middle mouse button, you can use that for scrolling.

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:26.200
Usually when I'm laying on the sofa and I've got my laptop, I'm making such minimal movement,

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.200
I look like I'm dead.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.280
So your thumb is on the Trackpad still?

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:30.840
So your thumb is scrolling on the Trackpad?

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.160
No, the middle mouse button.

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.840
It's got three mouse buttons below the space bar.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.840
Oh, right, right, right, right.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:35.840
Okay.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:36.840
So for you, it's about effective behavior.

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:37.840
It's about an effective experience.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:38.840
Totally.

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:39.840
Yeah.

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:40.840
Okay.

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.840
Okay.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:42.840
Hmm.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:48.000
I have my... The only thing I want on a laptop is the button to turn off the Trackpad.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Right.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Oh, yeah.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Yeah.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Yeah.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
You can just install an app for it.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I forget what the hell it is, but yeah.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Yeah.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I have... It's funny.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I have a button on my Bonobo.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.120
If I hold down Function F1, it turns off the Trackpad.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:03.880
And if I hold down Function 1, Function 1 turns all the fans on at full blast, which

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.880
is funny because-

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.880
Oh, really?

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.240
The Bonobo is quite well ventilated.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.240
It has two big fans in the bottom of it, and then it has these big vent outtakes in the

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.240
back.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:16.140
So I've never actually heard it kick up to full fan speed until the day I accidentally

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:21.560
pressed Function 1, and I was like, whoa, this thing really is... I was going to take

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:22.560
off.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.560
It's like air wolf in your lap or something.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.560
Right.

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.080
But now that I know, it's like every now and then I'm like, yeah, I'm about to do something

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.080
that's a lot of work.

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.080
Maybe I'll just kick the fans up for a second.

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.080
Yeah.

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.080
And then I just smack it.

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.080
That's pretty cool.

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.080
That's pretty cool.

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.080
Rev the engine, Matt.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.080
Vroom, vroom.

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.080
Yeah.

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.320
And there's also those apps you can install that will actually keep it... When you're

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.680
typing on your keyboard and your touchpad's being bumped into, you need to be able to

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:40.680
disable that, too.

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:41.680
Yeah.

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.680
So sorry, I didn't mean to go there.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.360
I was talking about laptops, so make sure it has enough ports, too, because a lot of

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.360
times you want to get one or two USB ports in a one-way...

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.360
Oh, yeah.

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:49.360
Okay.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.360
Let's talk about it.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.360
Let's talk about it.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.360
That's a big one, actually.

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.360
For both workstations and laptops.

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.360
So let's first do laptops.

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:55.360
I'm writing all this down for our review.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.760
So okay, on laptops, connectivity.

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.000
So we're talking USB is a must.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.360
Now, USB... Now, remember, we're getting less and less ports these days, so we've got to

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.360
keep it realistic.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.360
Yeah.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.360
HDMI out?

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.360
Is that a must?

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.360
No.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.360
Not for me.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.360
Yeah.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.360
Yes.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.360
Whoa.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.360
That's what I was going to say the other week.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:15.920
I want USB ports just like... I want it to look like a UFO.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:19.760
So maybe we'll just put the difference and say we have to have good video out.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:20.760
Yeah.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.760
So video out.

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.760
Yeah.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:26.240
Because it's really handy if you've got like HDTV, you've got Netflix or... Well, because

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:27.240
it works on Linux now.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:32.400
You can just shove your laptop, put it underneath your TV, connect a wireless keyboard or mouse,

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:36.480
and then you can just sort of like surf on your laptop and use it as sort of like a home

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.480
feature PC.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.480
Oh, yeah.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.480
Basically.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:40.480
Yeah.

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.440
So if it's got Bluetooth built in, that's amazing because I just flip on a Bluetooth

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.240
mouse and go.

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:49.040
Firewire at 100.

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:52.760
The bacon flaps is mentioning none of us... Nobody said anything about price yet.

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.760
I guess that's a scaling kind of requirement.

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:55.760
That's a scaling thing.

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:56.760
It depends on what you value.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.000
But honestly, I want this thing to look like a hub.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.800
I want USB ports all the way around it.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:05.720
I mean, don't talk... I want danglers dangling and I mean, yeah, I'll give up HDMI any day

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.720
because I don't need it.

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:07.720
No, sorry.

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.400
What would you use the USBs for?

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.640
I never know.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.360
I never need them until I'm missing them.

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.360
It's wicked.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.360
Yeah, that's the thing.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.560
See, that's... I have the same question because my laptop only has two USB ports.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.560
Mine has three.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.560
Mine is filled with a Bluetooth.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.560
How about a DVD drive?

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.560
How about a DVD drive?

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.560
How about a DVD drive?

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:28.680
I've just bought a seven port USB three hub from Amazon that's arriving tomorrow because

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:32.480
my laptop only has one USB three port and I want more.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.480
More.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.480
Yeah.

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.480
Yeah.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.480
Well, I have like an old 2008 era system 76 laptop here and it's got four, which is

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:43.240
good but I would be perfectly happy with like 12, eight, you know.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.280
Yeah, that'd be good.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.960
What's people's views on a DVD drive?

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:49.080
I'm not really that big anymore.

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.080
Not anymore.

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.080
Optical is dead.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.080
All right.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.080
Legacy media.

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.080
Optical is dead.

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:55.080
All right.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.080
So I go with that.

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.080
I don't keep it around.

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.080
I keep it around.

01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.360
That's just because I burn DVDs for people.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.920
Well, that's why you need that USB port.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:01.920
Yeah.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.840
And I have external what not for that.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.920
That's what I do now too.

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.920
And that's true.

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:11.400
So, um, you, so, uh, you know, when I, when I expect the bonobo, I went the direction

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.640
of getting a drive, a disc drive.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:19.160
And now looking back on it, I do wish I had gone with like a third disc in that spot because

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.780
like with the Cuda machine, they're saying this, you can actually do an S there.

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:27.380
They have two slots for SSD for drives and then they have, you can swap out the optical

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:28.520
bay for a drive if you want to.

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:34.000
So you can do three SSDs and a laptop, which if you think about it, like you could, you

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.640
could dedicate an entirely separate OS to one of those drives if you wanted to.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.640
You could do anything.

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:39.880
So yeah, I agree.

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.800
Optical is probably dead and I'm going to, all right, so that's a good list right there,

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:43.800
you guys.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:44.800
Thank you.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.280
So that'll be, just kind of wanted to get some updated requirements from folks.

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:51.480
I was going to have passive 3d, but that's a little bit different for laptops.

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:57.080
There is one, there's, you know, your microphone and headphone port merged together nowadays

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:58.080
on the more recent.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.080
Yeah, they are.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.080
You're right.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.080
Audio jacks.

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:02.080
Yeah.

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.240
So if you want the two separate jacks or one which is combined together.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.240
Right.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.480
The one that's combined together, you can get an adapter for pretty cheaply on Amazon.

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.200
So that's really not too much of a factor.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.200
Yeah.

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.760
Well, some people have these very specific mics, simply just how they don't ever want

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:16.760
to change programs.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:20.920
Sometimes they have this special microphone that they want to plug in, which is not, you

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.640
know, like what they're used to.

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:23.640
Very true.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.640
True, true, true, true.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.720
All right.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:26.720
Anything else for me?

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:27.720
Yeah.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:31.400
Make sure, like, also like no weird proprietary connectors, like ethernet adapters.

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.400
Oh, yeah.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:33.400
Right.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:34.400
Oh, yeah.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.400
Got to have ethernet.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.400
I'm gonna write that down.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.400
You got to have ethernet.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.400
I think.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.400
Serial port?

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.400
Absolutely.

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.400
This is totally serious.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.400
I would love to have multiple eSATA USB combos.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.400
Yeah.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.400
Yeah.

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:45.400
Yeah.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.400
That's a nice to have for sure.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.400
I love having eSATA on the Bonobo.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.400
Just curious.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.400
You know, like the old laptops used to have these PCIe slots.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:18:02.400
Do anyone use them anymore?

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.400
No.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.400
PCMCIA.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.400
Just for the...

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:06.400
Yeah.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.400
No.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.400
Just for, like, what?

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.400
For the wireless.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.400
I'm staring at an old Orinoco wireless card.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.400
SSD drives on there.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:17.920
I've seen some hacks where people set out Nvidia, like, graphics cards using the PCIe

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:18.920
socket on a laptop.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:19.920
Oh.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:20.920
That'd be kind of wild.

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:21.920
Yeah.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.320
Q5 Sys in the chat room votes for parallel port.

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.320
All right.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.320
Well, we'll...

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.400
Now, I don't think we're gonna have these in time for next LAS.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.400
I think they're gonna...

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.160
I think they're arriving Monday or so.

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.180
So we'll probably have them in the following LAS.

01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.180
But I'm looking forward to it.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.720
So I think what we're probably gonna do is we'll go after the laptops in one episode

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:42.240
and then we'll abuse the heck out of the Leopard in the following episode after we've

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:45.760
thrown a week of just battery of battery of batteries of tests at it.

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.040
So I think that'll be good.

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.040
All about punishing it.

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.040
Yeah.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.040
Yeah.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.040
Absolutely.

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.040
All right.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.040
Well, thank you to our Mumble Room for joining us today.

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.680
And thank you to Solomon from the Docker Project for calling in at the beginning of the

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.680
show.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:58.000
That was great to get an update from them.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.320
And don't forget, guys, you can watch the show live on Tuesdays.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.040
We begin at 2 p.m. Pacific over at jblive.tv.

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:06.600
Show up about a half hour early to get the pre-show.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:07.600
And you can contact us.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:12.040
Go over to jupitabroadcasting.com, pop that contact link, and just use Linux Action Show.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.520
I don't even know if we have a separate entry for Unplugged in there.

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:17.900
And then fill out the contact info and send it in and we'll read it on a future show.

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:18.900
We'd love to get your follow-up.

01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:21.000
That way we have a thread through each episode.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
All right, Matt.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
We'll have a great week.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Sounds good.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
See you then.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
All right, everyone.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.160
