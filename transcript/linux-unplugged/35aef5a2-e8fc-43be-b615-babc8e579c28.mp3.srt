1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
I was looking at the list of people that are coming

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,040
for Linux Fest Northwest.

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,880
It is gonna be a huge party.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,840
Brent, you're gonna be here.

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,800
I'm super excited, Brent.

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,920
You oughta just stay here for a couple extra days,

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,300
hang out at the studio.

8
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,600
Yeah, so Chris.

9
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,680
What do you mean, what do you mean, what, what?

10
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,520
What's happening here?

11
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,680
What do you mean, um?

12
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,520
What do you mean, um?

13
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,000
I thought this was a lock.

14
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,080
Yeah, I remember saying, even on the show,

15
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,160
it's in one of the shows that I was not not coming.

16
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,200
I remember specifically saying.

17
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,960
Yeah, not coming.

18
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,800
That's a lock.

19
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,120
I'm in this precarious place now

20
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,040
where my very best photo client is,

21
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,020
has just reached out to me for the exact same dates

22
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,200
as Linux Fest Northwest.

23
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,800
So I'm in a real pickle.

24
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,800
So I may not be there for the festival itself,

25
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,840
but I might like fly from Ottawa

26
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,280
straight to the studio afterwards to see if I can maybe

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,880
just catch some of the great people

28
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,760
that are gonna be in town.

29
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,800
Some of the afterglow?

30
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,440
Well, what is it really about?

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,280
It's about the people.

32
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,120
That's true.

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,160
And Linux Fest is kind of the bonus,

34
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,720
so I'm gonna try to see if I can make that work.

35
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,560
I got an idea.

36
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
Okay, I got an idea for you, Brent.

37
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,040
You bring the client to Linux Fest.

38
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,200
They're gonna have a great time.

39
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,800
We'll make sure they get some barbecue.

40
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,400
So how did you know I was also thinking about that?

41
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
You're kind of into podcasting, right?

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,800
Good man.

43
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,920
So I'm gonna see what I can swing here.

44
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,920
Just give me a few days.

45
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,920
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 289 for February 19th, 2019.

46
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,280
Hello there and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show

47
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,400
that this week is taking a look at the community news

48
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,680
as it is deep diving finally into MX Linux

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,560
and saying goodbye to a real trooper of a project.

50
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,520
And then maybe, just maybe wrapping our heads

51
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,720
around that fedora switch to the new C groups.

52
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,320
My name is Chris and joining me every, every single week

53
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,760
is my man, Mr. Wes Payne.

54
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,600
Hello, Wes.

55
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,640
Hello.

56
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,760
Hello, Wes.

57
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,000
It's good to be with you again here in the studio

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,800
in a gray, cold Seattle day.

59
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,640
It's easier that way.

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,480
We don't have to be distracted.

61
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,320
We're not gonna go run out and play in the sunshine

62
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,360
because there isn't any.

63
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,480
That's true.

64
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,720
That's a good point, Wes.

65
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,800
Hey, what do you think about later on in the show today

66
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,400
talking about what it would take

67
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,440
to make the next big Linux distro?

68
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,600
Oh, you're getting ready to announce your distro finally.

69
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,240
That's right, Chris, last Linux.

70
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,400
No, I'm looking at clear Linux

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,480
and I'm looking at some other projects out there

72
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,680
and I'm thinking to myself in 2019,

73
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,160
how do you displace your Ubuntu's of the world?

74
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
How do you topple the fedora of the world?

75
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,600
How do you get up there in that upper echelon

76
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,160
of used distributions?

77
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,680
So I thought maybe you and I in the mumble room

78
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
could all talk about that in a little bit.

79
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,840
And then there's a, not one, not two,

80
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,440
let's count them right now here live on the show.

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,440
One, two, three, that's right, four outrageously good picks.

82
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,440
We may have to end the picks after this, Wes.

83
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,880
Just call it done, yeah, we've peaked.

84
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,040
How are we gonna do better than these picks?

85
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,920
These right here are the very best picks.

86
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,160
And then towards the end of the show,

87
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,640
it's time for us to admit our shame.

88
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,640
We have to look at our dirty, dirty home directories.

89
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,480
When's the last time you went into your home directory

90
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,000
and did a little LSLA?

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,960
Well, I did it today earlier before the show.

92
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,640
But before that it had been weeks

93
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,120
and boy, it's a mess in there.

94
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,040
It's like it's not even my own home directory.

95
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,400
It's like it's owned by all the programs on my computer

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,120
and not by me.

97
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,400
So in a way, I mean, you would never admit to this,

98
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,720
but you actually are bringing this particular soapbox

99
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,540
to the show.

100
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,480
I have a feeling I'll be the one stepping up on it,

101
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,560
but you brought the box.

102
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,440
You're welcome, buddy.

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,000
All right, before we go any further,

104
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,240
we absolutely have to bring in our virtual lug.

105
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

106
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,680
Hello, everyone.

107
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,520
Good evening.

108
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,240
Hello, hello, hello.

109
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,720
Hi, good to have you all here.

110
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,160
Thank you for joining us.

111
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,600
Are you both in the studio?

112
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,560
Yeah, yeah.

113
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
First time in ages.

114
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,120
I guess it actually has been a while.

115
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,640
It feels like a month or something?

116
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,480
Maybe.

117
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,560
I think the last time before this week I saw you

118
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,480
was it's gotta be last year.

119
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,560
That's true.

120
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,400
How did you know, Brett?

121
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,360
What was the tell?

122
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,560
What was the giveaway?

123
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,120
You both sound like you're in the same room.

124
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,000
Well, that could be interesting.

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,200
But also, I have to say, a little behind the scenes,

126
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,960
the bathroom break kind of gives it away.

127
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,840
We went to the bathroom together before the show.

128
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,560
It's true.

129
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,200
It's how we get on sync for the episode.

130
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,280
Yeah, that's how we get our flow going.

131
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,120
All right, well, let's try to dig ourselves

132
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,300
out of that particular hole.

133
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,920
And I wanted to start out with a new release

134
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,040
this week of a distribution that we haven't really

135
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,840
had an excuse to talk about much.

136
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,800
And that's MX Linux.

137
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,660
I've noticed more and more audience members

138
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,280
writing into the show about this particular distribution.

139
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,640
So that's probably what put it on my radar first.

140
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,480
But it's got a few things about it that appeal.

141
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,280
And I thought, you know what?

142
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,440
This new release they have, it's time to give it a go.

143
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,680
So MX 18.1 came out.

144
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,440
It's not a particularly huge release on their part.

145
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,520
It's mostly consisting of bug fixes and application updates

146
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,720
since the 18 release.

147
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,280
One thing of note is it does have that apt fix in there

148
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,360
we covered a few days ago, or a few episodes ago.

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,360
But here's what's neat about MX Linux.

150
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,880
And I'll tell you, I think I'm kind of falling

151
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,360
in love right off the top here.

152
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,320
So my bias is strong right now.

153
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,000
It's based off of Debian 9.8, which is a great release.

154
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,880
It's using XFCE as a desktop environment.

155
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,960
But it's a nice, clean, Unity rip-off style XFCE.

156
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,300
Yeah, I mean, I don't think you'd

157
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,120
be able to identify it unless you were a serious desktop

158
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,600
geek.

159
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,540
Yeah, I mean, looking at this right now,

160
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,160
you've got the sidebar launcher.

161
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,200
You've got icons there that are nice.

162
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,920
I've turned on the dark mode for the GTK theme.

163
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,600
It doesn't look anything like it.

164
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,320
It's XFCE, but not like I've ever used it.

165
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,400
Right, I think the biggest thing is you have the sidebar,

166
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,840
but there's no top or bottom bar.

167
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,480
So it's kind of a different feeling.

168
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,520
They've got a conky style background

169
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,120
where I've got my CPU usage and the clock on there.

170
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,640
And the other thing they do is they include a couple of cool

171
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,420
MX tools, like things that manage your boot environment,

172
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,820
or set up the NVIDIA driver, or install codecs.

173
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,420
And they also include a simple MX package installer.

174
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,480
They have a menu system that pops up,

175
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,140
and you go in there, and right in there,

176
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,080
they have the package installer selected.

177
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,020
And in here, they have a stable repo.

178
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,900
They have the MX test repo.

179
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,880
They have Debian backports.

180
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,120
And they have flat packs, all just right here.

181
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,600
And you can do a search in different categories

182
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,360
to see if they have the applications in those particular areas.

183
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,160
And I wanted to try out to see how easy it

184
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,440
would be to install Chrome.

185
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,840
It's a bit of a benchmark of mine.

186
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,320
Like, how quick do I get to Chrome on a desktop environment?

187
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,240
Kind of like a standard proprietary application

188
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,160
that you actually do need.

189
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,720
And in their popular applications category,

190
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,680
when you search for Chrome, it comes right up, right up,

191
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,960
and installs with Flash and all of that.

192
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,900
Really nice.

193
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,400
It reminds me a little bit, I mean,

194
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,000
this is going way, way, way back.

195
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,840
But if you remember the Drac tools in Mandrake,

196
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,000
or if you're familiar with Yast in OpenSUSE,

197
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,880
MX tools is similar to those, but cleaner, simpler, and more

198
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,920
efficient, and probably a little simpler design, too.

199
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,240
There's a few other things in here

200
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,880
that just bring up command line utilities, like quick system

201
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,560
info.

202
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,760
So I'm running it right here.

203
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,260
I decided to put it on my main studio system.

204
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,840
And I got to say, Wes, just using this thing,

205
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,440
I'm going to launch the file manager.

206
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,360
Watch how fast this sucker pops up, pow.

207
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,440
Oh, that was snappy.

208
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,200
No wasted time on boring graphical effects.

209
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,600
You don't even see the border of the window render.

210
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,200
It's just instantaneous.

211
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,640
It's instantaneous.

212
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,160
And of course, it's because we're talking Thunar here.

213
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,920
We're using Thunar, so it's a little lighter weight

214
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,560
and things like that.

215
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,520
But it's still great.

216
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,960
I mean, Thunar's kind of proven itself over the years.

217
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,760
You know what made me do this?

218
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,160
We had those issues recently.

219
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,360
So yesterday.

220
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,400
I thought you were going to say the little Joe

221
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,920
Resington in your ear.

222
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,240
Well, I think that might have made me really kind of,

223
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,560
all right, I'll try out XFCE, damn it.

224
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,760
It's just it's XFCE that doesn't look like a bastard.

225
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,400
That's the part.

226
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,040
I like XFCE, but I don't always like going through all the work

227
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,240
to style it, and theme it, and make it look modern.

228
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,200
It's a bit much.

229
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,600
Yeah.

230
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,120
But we ran into this weird, weird issue.

231
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,000
This is the only system in our studio that's running Neon.

232
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,200
All of our studio systems run Kubuntu 18.04,

233
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,960
with the exception of the presentation system, which

234
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,960
is actually captured by OBS and sent out on the stream.

235
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,480
For that, we like to showcase the latest Plasma,

236
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,920
the latest application releases.

237
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,280
It ends up being something of a test machine at times,

238
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,080
playing with stuff.

239
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,920
So this one was running Neon, Neon,

240
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,120
which has been pretty solid.

241
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,360
It's been running it for over a year.

242
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,920
However, I came back from Texas, got here in the studio,

243
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,280
and I thought, you know what, Self?

244
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,440
Let's do a system update.

245
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,160
It's been a while.

246
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,120
So responsible.

247
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,000
There's new packages to install.

248
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,240
Got to keep the system secure.

249
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,680
And I have two sides to me on this issue.

250
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,400
Part of me is like, don't ever change the systems.

251
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,800
Everything stays static.

252
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,360
Lock it down.

253
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,600
That's the old school mentality.

254
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,360
The least change possible, things won't break.

255
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,080
Yeah.

256
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,240
That would be a very predictable, reliable approach

257
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,280
to managing the studio system, but not the most secure.

258
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,720
But then there's that righteous side of me.

259
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,840
It's like, well, screw this.

260
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,400
If I can't update my operating system and keep it secure,

261
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,160
then it is a clown show.

262
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,560
And these things are connected to the internet, after all.

263
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,280
I literally said that to you yesterday.

264
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,720
You did say exactly those words.

265
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,880
And I mean, it's true, right?

266
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,600
We should be able to do, especially even with Neon,

267
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,560
on an LTS base, we should be able to do

268
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,160
simple security updates.

269
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes.

270
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,720
Yes.

271
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,560
I mean, that's why I'm running an LTS.

272
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Exactly.

273
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,680
So, and that's what Neon's based on.

274
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,280
However, I recognize that it is more of a showcase

275
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,880
of new plasma technology.

276
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,840
They certainly wouldn't suggest that you deploy it

277
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,880
in your podcasting studio.

278
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,400
But we had this crazy ass issue yesterday.

279
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,160
After all of the updates were done,

280
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,560
we had this problem where the EFI boot

281
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,960
managing software called EFI Manager Signed, I think it was.

282
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,440
Yeah.

283
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,960
I mean, it was the package that contained

284
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,320
like a bunch of the sign stuff and the shim to do UEFI.

285
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,600
And it wouldn't install.

286
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,760
It wouldn't finish setting up.

287
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,240
Right.

288
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,400
It would not fully get through all of the D package

289
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,360
configuring.

290
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,640
What did we ultimately do to solve that problem?

291
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,240
We booted into a live environment.

292
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,400
Yeah.

293
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
We did a little troubleshooting.

294
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,680
And then we just booted into a live environment,

295
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,480
partially, to see like, would it boot?

296
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:43,640
Yeah.

297
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,800
We suspected it was borked.

298
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,080
And it definitely was.

299
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,880
So I just want to make it clear.

300
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,040
My Ubuntu LTS system borked after I did a system

301
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
apt update, upgrade.

302
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,720
Normal way, yeah.

303
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,400
That's all I did is I did sudo apt update, sudo apt upgrade.

304
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,080
I didn't do a dist upgrade.

305
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,960
I just did a sudo apt upgrade.

306
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,800
And what broke wasn't a plasma package.

307
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,480
What broke was some of the low-level boot stuff.

308
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,440
Yeah, we were getting some strange errors about being out

309
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,360
of dist space, despite not actually appearing that way.

310
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,800
And it just wouldn't install.

311
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Also, there was probably a kernel upgrade in there.

312
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,840
So obviously, some complications around trying

313
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,760
to get all the new, like the new kernel in InterRAMFS

314
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,160
linked up with the UEFI system.

315
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,960
End of the day, we had to go chroot into there,

316
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,080
uninstall all of the grub stuff, and do a reinstall.

317
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,160
For some reason, that worked.

318
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,400
Yeah, that did work.

319
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,560
Yeah, I mean, and I knew you and I together

320
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,160
would be able to solve that no problem.

321
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,320
I was not worried about it.

322
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,920
I knew we'd get it recovered.

323
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,380
In fact, I've never had an Ubuntu system that I have not

324
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,460
been able to recover yet.

325
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,040
That has not been an issue.

326
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,600
But there is that thing inside my brain that's like, well,

327
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,320
wait a minute, man.

328
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,640
You didn't do anything weird.

329
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,260
You just did an update and then a reboot,

330
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,920
and your system was completely hosed.

331
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,760
And that's sad with me, because this is my studio.

332
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,640
It sits with me.

333
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,540
So when an opportunity came around

334
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,080
to try something that was perhaps Debian-based,

335
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,960
and now I've learned also is using also a lot.

336
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,560
It's not really like when you go in here,

337
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,640
you're setting also settings, not pulse audio settings,

338
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,640
which could be better for us.

339
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,960
We have had some issues.

340
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,600
That's an angle that does appeal to me, especially simplicity.

341
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,280
The less moving parts, we don't need fancy features,

342
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,440
at least on these machines.

343
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,800
We just need a basic system.

344
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,600
Our laptops, maybe that's one thing, right?

345
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,960
But these systems here that are running 24-7 in the studio,

346
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,080
simplicity.

347
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,360
And MX Linux is super fast.

348
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,920
It's based on Debian, which I trust and know how to use.

349
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,400
And it has a bunch of these tools

350
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,400
that sort of fill in the rough edges that I think you could

351
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,480
look at them in two ways.

352
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,020
In some ways, it's a warning sign

353
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,040
that a distribution needs these tools.

354
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,480
You know, like in here is fixed GPG keys, fixed boot

355
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,640
environment.

356
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,160
Why do we need that?

357
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,320
But at the same time, I just had my boot environment break.

358
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
Yeah, right.

359
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,240
So it's not all the way on your own.

360
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,480
It's not arch or gen 2.

361
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,320
You're not left in the weeds, or even just like doing a manual

362
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,920
Debian install.

363
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,840
But I like their phrasing.

364
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,840
They call it a mid-weight distribution, which

365
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,000
you don't hear all the time.

366
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,800
So it's not all the way full featured,

367
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,080
but you have a few niceties.

368
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,440
Well, this is a combination of a couple of projects.

369
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,560
So you've got MIPS in here.

370
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,600
I mean, you remember MIPS Linux and not

371
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,680
MIPS, or not like the MIPS processor, but MIPS or M-E-P-I-S?

372
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,760
Yes.

373
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,160
So you've got a couple of different distros.

374
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,360
Right, and Anti-X too, right?

375
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,860
That's some of the folks from there.

376
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,240
Yes, exactly.

377
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,280
And I think it's a good example of a distribution that

378
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,600
plays well with others, because there's also

379
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,520
like a minimal version of sort of the same group

380
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,160
that people are working on a minimal version of Linux.

381
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
And this is a mid-level version of Linux.

382
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,200
And it's a good example of cross-community pollination.

383
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,360
And I think it's kind of what's leading to its success.

384
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,080
Their forms are very active.

385
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,760
You've got the overall support network of Debian.

386
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,280
Right.

387
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,120
Yeah, between the support and the availability of software,

388
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,920
that's huge.

389
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,240
Right, whereas like Ubuntu is ultimately based on Debian,

390
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,600
MX Linux is Debian.

391
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,020
It is a Debian install.

392
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,200
And there is a difference there.

393
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,960
And there is perhaps, perhaps, an end result

394
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,000
that I'll see differently in a simplification

395
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,320
here of our audio stack.

396
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,680
So we'll see.

397
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,600
I'm going to try it for a little while.

398
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,400
Yeah, that's what I was going to ask.

399
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,000
You're going to leave it on here.

400
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,500
Oh, yeah.

401
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,560
Oh, yeah, 100%.

402
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,920
Yeah, I thought I'd throw it on for the day.

403
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,240
And I was going to just have a laugh and call it good.

404
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,740
But damn, that just means Joe's going to be right.

405
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,240
Crap.

406
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
Well, I don't know.

407
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,520
I don't know.

408
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,880
That's fine, as long as we do it in our own way, you know.

409
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,480
Right, it's a pretty version of XFCE, right?

410
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,920
And we'll tweak it and stuff.

411
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,360
I'll install Jack on there later.

412
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,520
All right, thanks.

413
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,880
That makes me feel a lot better, Wes.

414
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,500
That makes me feel a little bit better.

415
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,960
Anyways, MX Linux 18.1, if you've

416
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,720
been looking for a new Linux that

417
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,720
is based on a tried and true distro like Debian,

418
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,800
give it a spin.

419
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,840
Give it a spin.

420
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,680
I don't think it's going to, you know,

421
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,180
we're going to ultimately later today,

422
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,480
we're going to talk about what makes the next big distro.

423
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,940
I don't think it's going to be that.

424
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,600
But I think for people like me, I

425
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,200
think it's filling a pretty good use case.

426
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,120
It's almost a nice thing, right?

427
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,680
You don't need it.

428
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,200
You're not looking for a project with huge, ambitious goals.

429
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,120
You want simple.

430
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,880
Yeah.

431
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,360
I really do just want something that just works, Wes.

432
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,400
I just want it to work.

433
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,640
I've never installed gnu slash Linux.

434
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,720
Who brought him in here?

435
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,920
Who brought that guy in here?

436
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,160
Well, we mentioned, you know, Linux.

437
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,420
Yeah, I guess so.

438
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,460
So you may notice, we're sitting around the show today.

439
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,960
And our buddies from Canonical are not here this week.

440
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,640
They're out doing not only, I guess,

441
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,260
what they call an engineering sprint, as it were,

442
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,800
but it's turned into a full-fledged multimedia

443
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,080
production.

444
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:54,480
So our friends over at Canonical have

445
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,760
been doing these SnapCraft summits for a while.

446
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,040
I went to one.

447
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,480
And it's pretty intense and pretty interesting

448
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,440
because there is a lot of pressure to get work done.

449
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,640
And then there's also a pressure to socialize, too.

450
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,200
You're seeing all these people you don't often get to see.

451
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,000
And you know, they're just a fun bunch.

452
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,960
But it kind of all happens behind closed doors.

453
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,880
It all kind of happens out of the view of the community.

454
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,340
And that's a bit of a shame because I

455
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,240
think there's takeaways from the people that

456
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,800
are involved outside of Canonical that

457
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,640
are there trying to solve their problems.

458
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,320
Like, I got a tremendous amount of insight

459
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,920
talking to some AWS engineers and the Plex packaging

460
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,060
individual at the last SnapCraft summit.

461
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:41,320
Like, it just opened my eyes to the scale of AWS, which

462
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,640
you always need a resetting.

463
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,440
When you're not intimately familiar with how

464
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,480
the scale of AWS, anytime you get an opportunity

465
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,280
to talk to an AWS engineer and appreciate the scale they're

466
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,000
dealing with, it's mind blowing.

467
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,800
You realize that the units you normally talk in

468
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,520
are way too small.

469
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,880
No, they're adorable is what they are.

470
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,920
They're adorable.

471
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,640
And then the issues that groups like Plex face trying

472
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,520
to package up the Plex server onto Netgear NASes

473
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,240
and onto every individual particular type of operating

474
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,740
system.

475
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,320
No, thank you.

476
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,040
It's crazy.

477
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,520
It's absolute craziness.

478
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,640
But that doesn't translate to a public understanding.

479
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,020
It doesn't really inform the rest of the Linux community

480
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,640
about what these people are trying to solve.

481
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,600
And that's where I think things could be beginning to change,

482
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,080
depending on how much the folks over at Canonical

483
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,320
are willing to share.

484
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,040
But famous internet leaker, Alan Pope,

485
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,480
is live streaming the SnapCraft Summits.

486
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,040
They're calling these a Bootstrap Summit.

487
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,600
Yeah, they say, we've run a few in-person SnapCraft Summits,

488
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,760
bringing together application developers and experts

489
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,160
from SnapCraft and Linux security

490
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,840
to help get software into the Snap store.

491
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,040
Often, it's paired programming.

492
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,280
And they build a Snap together, and that accelerates

493
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,200
the developer's knowledge and understanding.

494
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,700
Right?

495
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,200
It's great.

496
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,320
I mean, that makes a lot of sense,

497
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,480
especially if you're trying to, you know the application.

498
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,400
Someone on their side knows the packaging technology.

499
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,720
I think this would, if Flatpak could pull this off,

500
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,000
this would serve Flatpak really well.

501
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,700
But the goal of SnapCraft Live is

502
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,360
to bootstrap developers in building snaps

503
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,440
and publish them into the Snap store.

504
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,160
We will cover the tools and set up

505
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,080
required best practices and recommended processes.

506
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,720
We also have an opportunity to ask the experts who

507
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,600
sit in the live stream alongside the live session

508
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,800
and ask them questions.

509
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,040
So they will be live streaming some of these.

510
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,960
They've already done one, the kickoff episode.

511
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,320
They built a few simple snaps.

512
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,760
They had a few people sit around and answer some questions.

513
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,480
And they're going to be doing more of this.

514
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,600
There was a second episode on February 13th

515
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,400
where they did a complex application example.

516
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,320
And long term, I think this is a pretty savvy way

517
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,520
to get the word out on what is involved in packaging

518
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,640
software for Linux and what particularly

519
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,200
these universal packaging formats are solving.

520
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,000
Because you have people listening today

521
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,720
that still don't get it.

522
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,080
And I think this kind of thing is maybe, maybe

523
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,280
the move Canonical needs to make to better explain

524
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,640
the value that these bring.

525
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,340
It is interesting, right?

526
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,240
We're watching them try to grow this new ecosystem

527
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,360
of applications.

528
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,840
So it's a whole new marketplace.

529
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,320
Well, and from a business standpoint,

530
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,940
you've got Canonical spending considerable sums of money

531
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,800
flying all these people to Malta.

532
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,200
I mean, there's a big push on this in all kinds

533
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,520
of directions on their side.

534
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,080
So if they can reach more people through these live streams,

535
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,540
that would be a much, much more effective use of their time.

536
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,080
But as an audience, as a viewer, it

537
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,320
gives you an opportunity to get insight

538
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,400
into how software is built and made for Linux.

539
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,880
And I can't stress how informational that can be.

540
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,200
It changed my perspective on so many things

541
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,600
witnessing this firsthand.

542
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,320
And now you can do it via live streams.

543
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,760
It's not necessarily the same exact thing as being there.

544
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,320
But man, that's a heck of a lot better

545
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,440
than what it was before when it was just

546
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,840
all behind closed doors.

547
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,640
So hats off here to Popi for pulling that off.

548
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,760
And hopefully, it gets a little traction.

549
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,720
People go check this out, and it's

550
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,960
something they can keep doing.

551
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,640
Yeah, I hope so.

552
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,800
And more and more, especially, Popi will come on this show.

553
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,520
And by the end of the episode, he's

554
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,240
snapped up some new application.

555
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
If you watch this, you can probably

556
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,920
go decipher it and snap up applications

557
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,040
that you might want snapped.

558
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,560
That's true.

559
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,880
Yeah, last week, we covered that Solitaire on the command line.

560
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,160
And then by the before our show notes were done.

561
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,880
Yeah, before the notes were even finalized,

562
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,480
he had snapped up the Solitaire command line application.

563
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah, so go out there, go check out what they're doing,

564
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,040
and really get an insight into what it's

565
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,600
like to ship software for Linux.

566
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,400
And I say thank you to Popi for actually streaming that thing,

567
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,840
because having gone to those, I'd say they're super insightful.

568
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,560
And with a live chat room, you can always ask questions.

569
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,920
Live at Malta!

570
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:51,720
Now, the next story we have in the community news is a bit,

571
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,400
I don't know how you describe this one, Wes, it's like sad.

572
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,920
It's also extremely encouraging.

573
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,600
And it's a victory story for open source.

574
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,000
And it's an opportunity for a possible new direction.

575
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,240
But it starts with saying goodbye to the maintainer

576
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,680
of the Shorewall project, which is a really brilliant way

577
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,480
to set up IP tables, makes it super simple,

578
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,280
and easy for end users.

579
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,360
So on TechStamp, we were just talking about Firehole,

580
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,600
which is an alternative.

581
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,360
And by far and away, any time you bring that up,

582
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,040
the very first thing that gets said,

583
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,560
unless it's someone who's just trolling you and be like,

584
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,520
just learn IP tables, is go use Shorewall.

585
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,480
It is kind of dominant, unless you're already

586
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,440
doing Firewall D or UFW.

587
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,400
Yeah.

588
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,960
And it's been mentioned a few times on this show.

589
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,800
It doesn't quite get the attention that Firehole does,

590
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,000
or that maybe PSN does.

591
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,080
It's one of those earlier generations

592
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,640
of open source projects, because it has

593
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,400
been around for a long time.

594
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,200
But its website might not be flashy, but it works.

595
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,600
And it's also, it's got some of those core values

596
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,160
that you want from an edge application

597
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,840
like this, something that's just been around,

598
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,280
it's been reliable, steady, maintained.

599
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,840
Well, the Shorewall maintainer, his name is Tom.

600
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,680
Tom Estep.

601
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,800
Estep, yep.

602
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,320
And I did not know this until today.

603
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,680
He's based in Shoreline, Washington.

604
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,520
I drove past his residence, surely, on my way up here.

605
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,680
40 minutes from the studio.

606
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,960
Man, I'd love to buy that guy a beer.

607
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,440
Boy, Tom, if you happen to listen to Linux Unplugged Show,

608
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,680
reach out to me, chris at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

609
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,000
If you ever make it up to Linux Fest Northwest,

610
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I swear to God, man, beer on me.

611
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,800
Or whatever your beverage of choice is.

612
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,560
Could be a glass of water.

613
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:28,960
We could be halfway.

614
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,720
We'll go to Muckle Tio.

615
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,280
We'll be fine.

616
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,800
I'd like to shake your hand.

617
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,120
So he writes, I'm now in my mid-70s

618
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,160
and have spent almost 50 years in tech-related industries.

619
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,800
More than three years ago, I retired from my position

620
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,760
at Helium Packard Enterprise.

621
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,760
And while I've continued to develop and support Shorewall,

622
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,800
I feel that it is now my time to say goodbye.

623
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,040
Shorewall 5.2.3 will be my last Shorewall release.

624
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,600
If you find problems with that release,

625
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,120
I will attempt to resolve them.

626
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,120
But I am now departing on an extended trip

627
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,960
to visit some, oh man, he won't make it to Linux Fest then.

628
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,040
He's departing on an extended trip

629
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,560
to visit some of the places in the world that I've always

630
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,840
dreamed of seeing.

631
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,040
That's a pretty good reason.

632
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
That is.

633
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,560
That is.

634
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,360
You've earned it.

635
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,600
No kidding.

636
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,120
50 years in IT.

637
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,200
And he's survived.

638
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,920
Can you imagine the change he has seen in 50 years?

639
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,120
And then towards the tip of that,

640
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,200
to be working on Linux and IP tables.

641
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,240
Wow.

642
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,740
Yeah, just doing Linux and IP tables for the past 10 years

643
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,440
has been a crazy amount of change, but then 50 years.

644
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,960
With 50 years of perspective, Linux

645
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,320
is still the new operating system.

646
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,600
Sure is, yeah.

647
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,920
That's just mind bending.

648
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,560
I would love to pick his brain about some of those changes.

649
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,440
Yes.

650
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:41,880
I don't know.

651
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,080
I don't know where this goes next.

652
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,520
The project is a healthy project.

653
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,760
I hope to see it get picked up.

654
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,280
He says, most of all, he ends with, most of all,

655
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,560
I want to thank all of you who have used Shorewall

656
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,480
and who have helped make it better over the years.

657
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,240
You are the ones that I will miss the most.

658
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,320
That's just really sweet.

659
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,840
It really is a great example of open source

660
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,920
and the huge amount of time and investment

661
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,040
that volunteers put into these projects.

662
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,840
And talk about, I mean, just talk about a classy way

663
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,880
to sign off.

664
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,160
Not a rage quit, not a burnout quit, but like, you know,

665
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,680
in my 70s.

666
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,000
Just enough personal information.

667
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,760
Yeah.

668
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,000
And I mean, he does make it clear, too,

669
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,840
that he's happy to help future maintainers.

670
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,040
Like, Shorewall doesn't need to die.

671
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,960
I don't think it will.

672
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,880
I don't think so either.

673
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,840
It's got so much momentum.

674
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,400
Especially if you've got Tom sticking around

675
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,600
willing to answer questions.

676
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,680
I think that makes a huge difference.

677
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,640
Even if he can only do it when he's somewhere

678
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,440
with connectivity as he travels the world.

679
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,440
Various Wi-Fi hotspots around the globe.

680
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,240
Oh, man.

681
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,200
If you use Shorewall, I don't think

682
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,520
you have much to worry about.

683
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,560
Plus, the underlying IP tables is not going anywhere.

684
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,520
It's not going anywhere anytime soon.

685
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,360
That's one of the great things about these.

686
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,320
You know, if you think about this, just as an aside,

687
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,440
in the commercial world, you'd probably

688
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,040
have some sort of custom-grown firewall solution

689
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,200
that is at end of life now.

690
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,920
If the company, if you've got a small business that

691
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,480
develops this product, this happens all the time

692
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,720
in enterprise, if you've got a small business that develops

693
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,080
the product and the guy decides he's going to close up shop,

694
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,800
that's it.

695
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
No more releases.

696
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,080
But with open source, you can look at that and go,

697
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,120
yeah, you know, we've got five Shorewall boxes in production,

698
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,840
but they're all using standard IP tables.

699
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,880
So we've got nothing to worry about here.

700
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
You can move tables, tools.

701
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,280
You can just save that state.

702
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,840
It doesn't matter.

703
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,920
I think that's pretty cool.

704
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,240
I mean, it just shows some of the wisdom, right?

705
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,120
Like, it doesn't matter if you're using Firehole

706
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,520
or Shorewall or UFW.

707
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,440
Because we have a common kernel interface,

708
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,680
we can use whatever tools we want.

709
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,160
Yep.

710
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,640
That's it.

711
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,120
That is it.

712
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,480
Thank you.

713
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,040
You put that much better than I was.

714
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,920
All right, well, let's talk about a big upgrade.

715
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:47,600
I've been playing a lot of Mario recently.

716
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,800
I've been playing a lot of Mario.

717
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,400
It's showing.

718
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,960
Yeah.

719
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,560
You're happier.

720
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,080
It's nice.

721
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,520
I am very pleased, too, with the new release of Geary.

722
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,080
Geary 0.13.0.

723
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,160
I thought I was never going to talk about Geary again.

724
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,880
Honestly, I thought the same way.

725
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,120
Not that I didn't want to talk about it.

726
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,520
It just hadn't been updated.

727
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,360
No.

728
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,960
No, and it was getting a little rough.

729
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,400
It was getting a little rough.

730
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,880
But it is under new maintainership now.

731
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,280
And version 0.13 is a major release,

732
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,240
featuring a number of new features,

733
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,680
including some brand new user interfaces for creating

734
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,040
and managing email accounts, integration

735
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,720
with GNOME Online accounts, which, by the way,

736
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,340
means if GNOME Online accounts is broken,

737
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,440
the Geary is also broken.

738
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,920
Side note.

739
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,120
Not that I would know.

740
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,080
Improving and displaying of conversations,

741
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,160
composing new emails, kind of a key feature, improved.

742
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,560
Interacting with other email apps has been improved.

743
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,080
Reporting problems has been improved.

744
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,720
And a number of important bug fixes,

745
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,560
server compatibility fixes, and security fixes.

746
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,760
And the latest version is available as a flat pack.

747
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,040
So you know what I did?

748
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,000
Gave it a go.

749
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,880
Now, I have got about three inboxes that I'll attach.

750
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,520
The inbox that has the least amount of unread messages

751
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,820
is around 4,000 unread messages.

752
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,520
There's about 30,000 read messages.

753
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,760
It's like an iceberg, yeah.

754
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,380
So I can really stress test these applications.

755
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,760
And I got to say, Wes, my order of op

756
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,640
was add my Google account to GNOME Online accounts.

757
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,400
So you're going system wide here, yeah.

758
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,840
Fedora 29, I added it to GNOME Online accounts.

759
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,520
Then I installed the Geary flat pack.

760
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,560
Launched Geary, immediately had all my stuff.

761
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,600
Immediately had everything.

762
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
All set up, ready to go.

763
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,520
That's like Apple level slick.

764
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,000
It was.

765
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,880
It was like you log into iCloud on the Mac,

766
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,280
and then you open up Mail, and it's just, I presume.

767
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,840
I actually don't think that actually works on the Mac.

768
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,800
Now, they talk about it, but it should.

769
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,500
It should work like that on the Mac.

770
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,320
But it does with Geary now.

771
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,240
And you know what's crazy about that, right?

772
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,280
I'm putting all of that.

773
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,880
I mean, it's not crazy, but it's great.

774
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,320
I'm putting all of that information

775
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,720
into the GNOME Online account system settings.

776
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,880
And a sandboxed flat pack application

777
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,800
still gets to go find all of that detail.

778
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Right, and respects my dark mode theme, all that stuff.

779
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,240
We have come a long way.

780
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,920
Yeah.

781
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,800
It looks really good.

782
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,880
I sent you a screenshot.

783
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,280
You did.

784
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,080
That was beautiful.

785
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,240
So do you think it'll hang around?

786
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Are you going to keep using it for a bit?

787
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,280
Absolutely.

788
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,840
Yeah.

789
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,360
Wow.

790
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,500
See, because that's a big change,

791
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,520
because I feel like just a month ago,

792
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,120
we were like, there are no desktop email clients to use.

793
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm like, I got to buy an iPad to do email,

794
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,840
because I can't even Linux right now.

795
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,840
And we'll see, you know?

796
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,680
We'll see.

797
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,200
You have to wait a little while to find

798
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,880
what little tiny details are wrong.

799
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,040
But I can already tell you, some of the paper cuts

800
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,840
I used to have with the older version of Geary

801
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,040
have been taken care of.

802
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,200
So huge, huge improvement.

803
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,820
Version 13, 0.13 is out.

804
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,540
You can grab it as a flat pack.

805
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,720
And I recommend it.

806
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,840
If you look at the enhancements in this release,

807
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,240
it's literally every major aspect of the application.

808
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,200
Just a huge congratulations to them.

809
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,360
And then while we're talking about great open source

810
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,840
applications getting an update or an upgrade,

811
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,960
our favorite photo management application, well,

812
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,640
maybe one of the favorites, DigiCam 6.00 is released.

813
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,400
And now, Brett, I realized when you and I have talked before,

814
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,840
you're more of a dark table guy.

815
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,960
I was going to say it's our favorite,

816
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,080
but dark table might be our actual favorite, right?

817
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,480
Well, you know, you're including all of us.

818
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,720
For me, definitely dark table has done what I need it to.

819
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,240
But DigiCam does something a little bit different.

820
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,400
So it depends sort of which angle you're coming at.

821
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,120
And some people absolutely love it.

822
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,640
I've used it a lot for more personal side photo

823
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
kind of management.

824
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,000
And for that, it certainly works great.

825
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,320
And it's awesome to see the software keep evolving.

826
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,000
So definitely anyone who's looking

827
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,920
for that type of software should check it out.

828
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,800
So you do a breakdown of you have one photo management

829
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,560
application for your personal pictures.

830
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,360
And then for those listening that don't know,

831
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,320
Brent is a professional photographer

832
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,800
that uses Linux for his workflow.

833
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,720
And then you have a separate application

834
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,300
for your pro app, for your pro photo.

835
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,920
So one personal, one pro.

836
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,520
Is that true?

837
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,920
Is that what I just heard?

838
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,480
That is what I alluded to.

839
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,120
But actually what I meant for a bit more detail, what I mean

840
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,560
is that on the personal side of things,

841
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,840
I suggest DigiCam to a bunch of friends and family

842
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,040
to use because dark table is a bit more involved than what

843
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,840
they're looking for.

844
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,800
And DigiCam just kind of makes it easy in ways

845
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,320
that they don't need to sort of understand

846
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,720
what's going on in the back end.

847
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,120
That's really interesting because I'm

848
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,960
kind of curious about that since I mostly

849
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,880
use dark table myself.

850
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,800
I was here, I was like, where's the sweet spot

851
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,880
that DigiCam fits?

852
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:29,080
Yeah, it depends if like from what I know of you, Wes,

853
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,320
you are probably pretty organized

854
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,000
when it comes to your files.

855
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,820
But some people are just kind of willy nilly with their photos

856
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,200
all over the place.

857
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,600
Applications like DigiCam or the other one that's

858
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,040
passing my mind now, they do a really good job

859
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,040
of just kind of organizing all the photos for you.

860
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,000
Where I'm more of a folder-based organizer

861
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
when it comes to projects and stuff like that.

862
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,920
Same, yep.

863
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,720
Yeah, so if you're using your own methods

864
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,360
to sort all of your projects and photos and stuff like that,

865
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,400
then you really just need to point the software

866
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,520
at the folder that you want.

867
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,640
For some people, they just want to take a broad look

868
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,920
at all of their photos all at once

869
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,560
and then sort of dive in from there.

870
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,000
So for that approach, some of this other software

871
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,680
is just a different workflow, I think,

872
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,200
is a different way of looking at it.

873
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,640
I actually think that's a very, very useful differentiating

874
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,200
way of managing your photos that you just pointed out.

875
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,400
Because myself, I have two modes.

876
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,400
I have the ones that I've taken with my DSLR of my kids

877
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,920
at holiday events or something like that.

878
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,600
Something you planned a little more.

879
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,800
You brought the good camera.

880
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,600
Yes.

881
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,040
That's the ones where I put them in folders.

882
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,120
I organize them that way.

883
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,040
Maybe you can go through them and pick through stuff.

884
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
Yep.

885
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,000
I manually copy them off the SD card.

886
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,880
And then you've got the cell phone pictures,

887
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,160
which I just blast away at.

888
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,440
And I just want to slam all of those in an application

889
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,680
and just scrub through it from time to time.

890
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,680
And you may have taken one photo one day that you care about,

891
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,480
and then 20 the next day.

892
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,880
So the other application I was thinking about is Shotwell.

893
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,160
It does a good job of just amassing a bunch of photos

894
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,440
in a thumbnail style view and figures out all the date.

895
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,360
You can sort it by date, if you want, or by folder.

896
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,120
So it's just like, oh, I've got these 3,000 photos

897
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,880
from the last year in one folder from my phone

898
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,840
or something like that.

899
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,560
So those applications are great for that kind of thing.

900
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,160
But certainly, they're capable of a lot more than that, too.

901
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,600
And the other nice thing that's appealing for some of us

902
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,520
with DigiCam is that it's a Qt-based application.

903
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,760
So it looks really nice on the plasma desktop.

904
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,340
Well, then I'm just going to have to give it a dress.

905
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,720
Well, version 6.00 now includes support for video file

906
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,640
management.

907
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,520
So videos are essentially just as fully supported

908
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
as photos are.

909
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,640
And that's like, OK, Chris, that sounds kind of, well,

910
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,160
to be expected, right?

911
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,280
However, if you think about what they had to pull off,

912
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,000
it actually required, to put it quite simply as they write,

913
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,360
a huge factoring of source code to make this possible.

914
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,440
So you're telling me that videos aren't just

915
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,320
a bunch of moving pictures?

916
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,140
They say the challenge to deal with these videos

917
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,840
was to extract the metadata and then populate

918
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,200
the database in a way that is actually

919
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,640
relevant to the end user.

920
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,160
And they say they started this work in version 5.50,

921
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,520
so the last major release, using the Qt AV framework

922
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,720
to play video files in DigiCam.

923
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,040
Now, Qt AV, for those that don't know,

924
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,800
is just essentially a direct Qt way to get to FFmpeg.

925
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,920
So whatever FFmpeg can play, this

926
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,920
can play, which is really, really nice.

927
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,120
Then they had to build a video thumbnailer.

928
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,840
Yep, yep.

929
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,480
Obviously, right?

930
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:33,960
Absolutely.

931
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,200
But not something you think of.

932
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,320
And they wanted something, again,

933
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
that FFmpeg could help generate the thumbnail

934
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,340
so they could support as many wonky camera formats

935
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,680
as they could possibly support.

936
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,560
And they had to look at the different Qt APIs

937
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,240
to pull that off.

938
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,640
And they had to pick the right one to get that working.

939
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,160
The advanced search tool needs to be

940
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,720
able to search for the metadata in videos.

941
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,120
So they had to get that working.

942
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,480
They had to get that metadata extracted from the videos

943
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,320
into the database to make it searchable.

944
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,920
This is a really good reminder of just,

945
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,280
despite a lot of that metadata filling the same role,

946
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,120
regardless of container format, it's always different.

947
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah, there's always so many edge cases.

948
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,320
Like, there's a standard.

949
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,400
And then there's like six variants to the standard.

950
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
And then undocumented semi-official standard.

951
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,280
Right.

952
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,440
Yeah, so much so.

953
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,240
And there's other nice things in this, too.

954
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,440
They've improved their raw file decoding,

955
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,800
so for even more camera support.

956
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,440
Yeah, that's big.

957
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:22,960
Yeah.

958
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,420
And they've simplified authenticating

959
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,800
with remote web services using OAuth, which I think is cool.

960
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,320
Yeah, that's a good call.

961
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,880
So anyways, it looks like a really solid digicam release.

962
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,200
And I really appreciate that breakdown that Brent did,

963
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,040
because I feel like it actually made me feel a little bit less

964
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,200
like a madman.

965
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,600
Because I felt like I had this sort of bipolar way

966
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,680
to manage my photos.

967
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,280
And it's really just the ones that I've

968
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,960
put a lot of intention into and a lot of thinking behind,

969
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,040
and then the ones that I just blast on my camera.

970
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,680
And that actually might, maybe the solution there for me

971
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,240
is just two different applications.

972
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,820
And I don't know why I never thought of that before,

973
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,480
but it just seems so obvious.

974
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,240
So thank you, Brent.

975
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,040
There you go, community service for you.

976
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,200
Very, very nice, sir.

977
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,440
Thank you very much for that.

978
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,160
Hey, you're in studio.

979
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,480
You got the real bell beside you.

980
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,280
Come on.

981
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,000
Analog bell.

982
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,500
You're right.

983
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,200
Is there a real bell?

984
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,640
What you have to remember is there is no bell.

985
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,960
There is no bell.

986
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,920
Just like there is no system when you're in a C group,

987
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:26,840
Fedora 31 is planning to use C group's version 2 by default.

988
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,920
All right, I got to come clean here.

989
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,520
Didn't really realize there was a version 1 or version 2,

990
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,000
and didn't realize that distributions

991
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,760
may be considering moving to a new version of this C group

992
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,240
thing.

993
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,100
So maybe if anybody else feels this way,

994
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,560
could you just explain to me what

995
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,920
the difference between a version 1 C group and a version 2 C

996
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,440
group is?

997
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,160
And are there going to be version 3 and 4s?

998
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,360
Actually, and maybe explain what a C group is.

999
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,280
Maybe.

1000
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,360
OK, that's a lot there.

1001
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,240
But quick lightning refresher, C groups

1002
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,600
are part of the magic in the kernel that makes what

1003
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,160
we call containers possible.

1004
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,120
They're also known as control groups.

1005
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,800
What's the difference between a C group and a namespace?

1006
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,180
Well, I mean, they basically do different things.

1007
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,360
So a namespace sets up basically what you can see.

1008
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,480
So you might have a mount namespace showing you

1009
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,680
the mounts that you as a process have access to.

1010
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,840
And a control group is for controlling access

1011
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,340
to resources and limiting those.

1012
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,840
So if you want to make sure that your container can only

1013
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,480
use x amount of memory, well, you put it in a C group.

1014
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,600
So I kind of think of namespaces a little bit

1015
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,520
as almost like a VLAN, but that's probably

1016
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,360
a bad explanation.

1017
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,400
But you can namespace an application

1018
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,480
so it exists in this namespace.

1019
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,560
Now, a C group, can I use a C group

1020
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,120
to control what that namespace can get access

1021
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,600
to on the host system?

1022
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,280
No, you really do it at the process level.

1023
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,040
Oh, really?

1024
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,520
Yeah.

1025
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,720
And you can go poke at it.

1026
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,400
They're both tree structured.

1027
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,320
So basically, you'll see in V1, you

1028
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,640
had separate trees for different things.

1029
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,760
So you have under the CPU C group or the memory C group.

1030
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,560
And then you could go add things in there.

1031
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,160
C2 is changing to a unified hierarchy.

1032
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,560
Version 1 has been around for a while, which is, you know,

1033
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,560
we started back in like 2006 at Google.

1034
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,400
And so there's just been some growing pains.

1035
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,880
It was the first time the kernel was really

1036
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,880
experimenting with adding these kinds of in kernel controls

1037
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,720
so that you could actually do that.

1038
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,840
And like some of the benefits, right,

1039
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,380
one of the big ones for memory, you

1040
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,080
can have separate out of memory killers.

1041
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,880
So you can make sure that even if your Java application goes

1042
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,800
crazy, the kernel will never accidentally shoot SSH

1043
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,520
by mistake.

1044
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,560
So those are some handy features.

1045
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,960
But unfortunately, especially because it

1046
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,640
had different hierarchies, it meant

1047
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,320
you kind of had to keep a lot in your head

1048
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,140
as you're like, OK, well, I want to control these six

1049
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,640
different things about my processes.

1050
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,960
Then I've got to go add them to these separate trees.

1051
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,920
Now, it's a lot simpler.

1052
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,120
It's more of what they call a purpose-driven design.

1053
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,640
So you can make one C group under the new hierarchy

1054
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,720
and then add different controllers to it,

1055
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,160
depending on what you actually want to control.

1056
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,800
OK, so I can add a controller.

1057
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,640
What's a controller?

1058
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,200
So that's the thing that lets you control CPU or memory.

1059
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,560
So is it like a group of resources?

1060
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,680
Somewhat.

1061
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,960
You can go find all the links to the nitty-gritty details.

1062
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,040
The funny part about this, and we're even talking about it

1063
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,940
at all, is you as a user, unless you're

1064
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,600
doing a lot of container stuff or you're into this stuff,

1065
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,720
you're not going to see it.

1066
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,800
But what I thought was interesting,

1067
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,060
it's another example of Fedora pushing things.

1068
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,460
Because C groups v2 is considered

1069
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,960
stable-ish in the future from the kernel perspective

1070
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,760
in like 2016.

1071
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,920
And have we talked about it at all since then?

1072
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,480
No, probably not.

1073
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,120
You didn't even know.

1074
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,620
No.

1075
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,280
And that's because no one's really shipping it.

1076
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,240
You can enable it, right?

1077
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,200
The kernel has it.

1078
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,480
So you're telling me we've had version 2 since 2016

1079
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,000
and everybody's shipping version 1?

1080
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,760
Yeah, pretty much.

1081
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,240
And then also, also all the applications

1082
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,640
that are going to take advantage of these new kernel features,

1083
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,300
well, they can only really count on version 1 being out there.

1084
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,080
So a lot of them don't support version 2,

1085
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,680
which means then distros don't have a lot of reason

1086
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,640
to support version 2 either.

1087
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,360
Well, yeah, OK.

1088
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,360
Fedora's breaking that cycle.

1089
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,860
It sounds like, or at least they're

1090
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,460
considering doing that in Fedora 31.

1091
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,400
So whether or not you'll actually care,

1092
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,800
it might make some of the things.

1093
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,380
There are some new features and nice design improvements here.

1094
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,400
So systemd will take advantage of those.

1095
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,640
Docker will take advantage of those.

1096
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,120
In what way does systemd take advantage of those?

1097
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,080
Oh, I mean, systemd uses cgroups all over the place

1098
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,060
to go constrain stuff.

1099
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,640
If you ever look at all those slices on your system

1100
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,000
under the hood, it's using cgroups

1101
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,520
so that you can keep track of stuff.

1102
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,640
That's another way.

1103
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,080
Remember those old init scripts where you double forked

1104
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,480
your daemon and then it could escape from itself?

1105
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,900
That doesn't happen anymore because you're not just trying

1106
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,920
to track child processes.

1107
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,120
They're contained in a cgroup.

1108
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,080
So you might not actually directly notice anything,

1109
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,160
but I think it adds to the story of doing

1110
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,320
the small little improvements.

1111
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
We needed to do this, right?

1112
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,160
The kernel has done it.

1113
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,760
At some point, version one is going to disappear,

1114
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,600
but the kernel community hasn't forced user space to change.

1115
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,360
So it's nice to see someone doing it.

1116
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,880
Yeah, it is nice to see.

1117
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,000
At least if nobody else steps up and moves the ball forward,

1118
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,120
it's nice to see Fedora do it because there's a potential.

1119
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,760
It could eventually end up shipping that way in RHEL.

1120
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,920
Yeah, right, down the road once everything's stabilized.

1121
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,800
And, you know, surely cgroups v2 isn't perfect.

1122
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,560
There'll probably be future changes to the kernel.

1123
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,400
Who knows?

1124
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,640
But we won't know what changes are needed

1125
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,840
until people are really using it.

1126
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,880
Yeah, exactly.

1127
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,200
Let's go to the virtual lug there.

1128
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,000
Neil, I bet you have thoughts on this one.

1129
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So the main thing here to consider about the cgroups thing

1130
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,160
is that for many years Fedora has been running

1131
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,240
in cgroups configured in hybrid mode

1132
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,640
through systemd as a controller.

1133
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,640
So hybrid mode allows us to offer a unified hierarchy

1134
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,320
which provides some aspects of cgroups v2

1135
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,520
along with cgroups v1 compatibility

1136
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,560
for basically most of the world

1137
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,000
which only supports cgroups v1.

1138
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,840
So the idea going forward is that

1139
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,120
we will switch off the unified hybrid mode

1140
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,240
and move fully to the pure cgroups v2 mode.

1141
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,960
This means applications will finally be forced to adapt

1142
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,720
and actually start working

1143
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,280
from the new cgroups v2 controller.

1144
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,440
And to be fair, one of the reasons

1145
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,200
why it's been taking so long for cgroups to get good

1146
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,560
and also to be adopted by things

1147
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,960
and also for switching from v1 to v2

1148
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,400
is because primarily systemd is the driver

1149
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,720
for a lot of the cgroups development.

1150
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,800
That's a lot of good context.

1151
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,240
Thank you, Neil, I appreciate that.

1152
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,720
So this begins to roll out in Fedora 31

1153
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,320
which we will see using cgroups version two by default

1154
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,920
and we still have 30 to get through.

1155
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,920
So it's not like it's gonna like smack us in the face here.

1156
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,720
We have, there is time

1157
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,360
and I think it's good to get that ball rolling.

1158
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,560
And to be fair, at least me personally,

1159
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,560
as Chris, you already know this

1160
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,520
and some of the rest of the world here may not know

1161
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,840
but I am the snapd maintainer in Fedora.

1162
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,960
So I maintain the snappy integration and stuff like that.

1163
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,960
Snapd is going to currently be broken with cgroups v2

1164
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,640
because we leverage cgroups v1 exclusively.

1165
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,560
The hybrid mode is what allows us to work

1166
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,720
even when we access some aspects of cgroups v2

1167
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,040
and now because Fedora 31

1168
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,080
is now planning to move to cgroups v2,

1169
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,840
we're finally going to start.

1170
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,280
Snapd upstream is starting to look at the,

1171
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,400
at moving snapd to be able to support cgroups v2.

1172
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,680
It's an issue we've known for a little bit over,

1173
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,520
well, I wanna say two years now

1174
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,800
because the bug was first filed

1175
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
by one of the system d maintainers

1176
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,240
who was doing the first explorations two years ago.

1177
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,760
So we've known about the issue.

1178
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,480
It's just a matter of like figuring out what we need to do.

1179
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,000
And over the last couple of years,

1180
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,680
cgroups v2 has filled out more

1181
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,240
so that functionality that we require is now available

1182
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,760
for us to use in some form.

1183
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,640
Maybe not exactly the same way

1184
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,520
but we have a means of getting to where we need to go.

1185
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,200
I imagine it'll be the same for Flatpak

1186
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,480
and many other things

1187
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,880
that also in some way leverage cgroups.

1188
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,760
That is good to know.

1189
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,200
Like as the time has been spent,

1190
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,400
it seems like at least on the surface,

1191
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,440
it's been in somewhat of preparation for this.

1192
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,360
It is also interesting that like

1193
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,480
you said roll up pretty quickly.

1194
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,880
All right, well, as a result of this,

1195
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,000
well, snap stuff is fixed.

1196
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,800
Well, that makes it a lot easier for Ubuntu

1197
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,640
to start enabling these things.

1198
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,080
That's true, that's true.

1199
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,440
Mr. Payne, would you go ahead

1200
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,040
and hit the seatbelt sign there?

1201
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,640
We have a little housekeeping to attend to here on the show.

1202
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,040
And I just wanna say meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

1203
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,880
I never in the history,

1204
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,720
in the many, many, many year history of this network,

1205
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,720
have we had three simultaneous meetups going at once.

1206
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,320
I feel like we've hit a new milestone here.

1207
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,160
Don't a big.

1208
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,120
We are going big.

1209
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,000
So the first one coming up is on March 5th, Tuesday.

1210
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,680
It'll be following immediately after Linux unplugged.

1211
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,160
We are doing the Linux operating system

1212
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,120
fundamentals study group.

1213
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,320
The training architect Kenny and Elle

1214
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,760
will be joining us to go over

1215
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,680
some of the fundamentals of Linux.

1216
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,800
This is a course that I have recently released for free

1217
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,880
to community members of Linux Academy.

1218
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,920
People hate it when I talk about this, but it's not an ad.

1219
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,440
This is just part of my day job

1220
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,440
that I don't normally talk about here on the air

1221
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,440
is working with Elle have released about 22, 23, 24

1222
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,280
24 content courses from like lab.

1223
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,760
I say content course because it's like labs, it's quizzes,

1224
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,320
it's all kinds of stuff and video and audio and all that.

1225
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,200
You're just on that content free mission, aren't you?

1226
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,040
I have been.

1227
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,600
Sneaky soldier you.

1228
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,280
And I think my favorite one is,

1229
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,120
the student's favorite one I think maybe

1230
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,800
is subnetting fundamentals.

1231
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,640
Oh, that's a good one.

1232
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,460
Yeah.

1233
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,440
My favorite one is the Linux operating system fundamentals

1234
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,920
because it Kenny goes, if you take the whole course,

1235
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,640
which is available for free,

1236
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,880
Kenny goes from the world before Linux existed

1237
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,320
and the conditions that made it ripe for Linux,

1238
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,680
then the launch of Linux, the introduction of GNU.

1239
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,440
And now like he goes from all of that to like the cloud

1240
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,080
in one course, it's about like an hour and 45 minutes.

1241
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,080
Now what's great is we're gonna do that

1242
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,280
in a condensed interactive version on March 5th,

1243
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,560
immediately following Linux unplug.

1244
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,680
We're just gonna keep the mumble room rolling

1245
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,900
and Kenny's gonna join us

1246
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,120
and we're just gonna go over that.

1247
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,360
We're gonna do a study group on the fundamentals of Linux,

1248
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,840
like the very basics.

1249
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,000
So if you have been using Linux for over a decade

1250
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,400
or if you've just found Linux

1251
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,920
and want some of the gaps filled in,

1252
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,040
you want some of the history,

1253
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,880
you wanna interact with somebody

1254
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,040
who intimately knows that stuff.

1255
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,080
It's like a classroom unplugged.

1256
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,260
That's what these study groups are.

1257
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,320
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

1258
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,960
And then the other couple of things that we have going,

1259
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,880
which is only applicable to those of you in the States,

1260
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,800
but it's pretty exciting.

1261
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,800
We are, I don't know if I can,

1262
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,620
I'm gonna say it, I'll say it, I'll say it.

1263
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,960
We are doing two different meetups and I'm pretty sure,

1264
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,960
I'm pretty sure that Mr. Popey is officially going to scale.

1265
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,720
Wow.

1266
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,700
So Popey, I think, I'm pretty sure he's gonna be at scale.

1267
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,540
I'm pretty sure he's like logged in.

1268
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,360
Well I'm just gonna hold him to it already.

1269
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,440
So there, it's done.

1270
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,120
Yeah, so we're doing a JB dinner meetup.

1271
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,240
I'll be there, Wes will be there,

1272
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,840
Elle will be there and all of you,

1273
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,080
if you're going to scale, go to meetup.com slash

1274
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,000
Jupiter Broadcasting and come hang out with us.

1275
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Thank you to Maddie for setting that up, aka Geek Dad.

1276
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,600
And then, last but absolutely not least,

1277
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,280
I will be driving my home to the beautiful

1278
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,280
Bellingham, Washington, parking it in the parking lot

1279
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,520
of the Bellingham Technical College and cooking for you.

1280
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,220
Along with the great folks over at System 76,

1281
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,300
who will be providing meats and other things.

1282
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,320
I just say things, so I don't wanna put anything

1283
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,020
on the record, but you know what I'm saying, Wes.

1284
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,120
You know what I'm saying.

1285
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,480
Supplies for a wonderful evening.

1286
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,280
That's right, that's right, that's a good way to put it.

1287
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,100
And Levi's gonna be there, you're gonna be there.

1288
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:28,940
Yeah, that's right.

1289
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:31,360
The whole JB crew will be there at Linux Fest Northwest

1290
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,520
and we are going to do a Lady Joob's barbecue

1291
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,340
in the parking lot.

1292
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,180
I'm hungry already.

1293
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,600
It's gonna be so good.

1294
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,560
It's, people are flying in literally

1295
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,920
from all over the world for this.

1296
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,760
Isn't that something?

1297
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,480
It's blowing my mind already.

1298
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,440
It is really cool.

1299
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,840
And you're gonna be giving a talk at Linux Fest.

1300
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,960
Looks like two.

1301
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,140
Really? Yeah.

1302
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,680
Oh, what are they?

1303
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,800
I mean, I know one of them.

1304
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,880
Yeah, well, one's like a nerdy dev talk

1305
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,480
where we're gonna go from basics and explore

1306
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,740
the Lambda calculus and why you might care.

1307
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,920
So that one's a little bit nerdier.

1308
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,880
And then the other one is gonna be a review

1309
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,280
and a basic intro to Linux audio production.

1310
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,400
Did you think, I mean, looking back like a year ago,

1311
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,560
did you think you would have this level of understanding

1312
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,400
like you do now?

1313
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,220
No, I did not.

1314
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,800
And it's changing every day.

1315
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,580
So yeah, Wes has really done a deep dive into Jack

1316
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,360
and Pulse, but also editing under Reaper.

1317
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,120
Like you're really getting some good experience.

1318
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,720
So it's a good time to give a talk on that.

1319
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,920
Yeah, you know, it should be a lot of fun

1320
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,760
and lots to learn.

1321
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,880
Yeah, so meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

1322
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,700
for that information.

1323
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,120
That's really kind of what we had

1324
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,460
in the housekeeping section of the show.

1325
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,800
We're just really excited because

1326
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,440
I think Linux Fest is gonna be,

1327
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,640
it's gonna be really great, not even just for us,

1328
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,760
but it's their 20th anniversary.

1329
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,640
And that's kind of special.

1330
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,040
Yeah, even if you didn't have like all the great people

1331
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,200
that we're bringing in, it's just a good time.

1332
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,560
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah.

1333
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,680
We'd love to have you there.

1334
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,760
Yeah, I know it's not feasible for most of you

1335
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,560
because tens of thousands,

1336
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,840
and there's many, many more than tens of thousands

1337
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,700
of you that listen to this show

1338
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,660
and only a couple hundred of you are gonna make it,

1339
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:01,520
but yeah, it's just a lot of fun.

1340
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,080
And if you can't make it to that,

1341
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,400
consider doing a smaller micro version of that.

1342
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,140
Microdose our virtual lug.

1343
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,560
Think about that for a second.

1344
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,280
You can't get the full Linux Fest Northwest

1345
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,000
or the scale experience.

1346
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,480
Well, come Microdose over here at Linux Unplugged.

1347
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,840
We have a virtual lug.

1348
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,720
We interact with these folks all the time.

1349
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,040
You just have to pass an audio check from time to time.

1350
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,640
I mean, today we didn't even have any mods

1351
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,080
because they're all having lives today.

1352
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,920
So you just got on air today.

1353
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,760
You showed up.

1354
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,000
Again, it's unplugged.

1355
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,840
Yeah.

1356
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,840
And we love having you.

1357
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,800
We just, we really do,

1358
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,560
and we think it makes for a great community experience.

1359
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,320
And it does give you a small version

1360
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,640
of what you get in person at Linux Fest Northwest.

1361
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,480
Yeah, you get to tell us

1362
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,660
when we've just got something horribly wrong.

1363
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,480
Yeah, but I mean like Brent,

1364
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,920
he wouldn't be kind of trying to figure out

1365
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,640
all these crazy ways to like appease his client

1366
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,720
and make it to Linux Fest

1367
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,220
unless there was some real value there.

1368
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,060
I don't want to put you on the spot.

1369
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,600
Or it might just be that he hates his house

1370
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,440
because he's never been there.

1371
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,280
Yeah.

1372
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,000
It's the best way to travel.

1373
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,320
Have a really terrible home.

1374
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,160
That's for sure.

1375
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,480
Or just don't have one.

1376
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,520
That's been my approach.

1377
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,360
Right.

1378
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,080
I mean, I don't want to put you on the spot, Brent,

1379
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,200
but like what, how do you put a value on,

1380
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,800
I'm trying to convince people to come out

1381
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,440
and hang out with some Linux users

1382
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,040
and talk Linux stuff,

1383
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,480
but I don't know how to explain why that's valuable.

1384
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,160
It seems like it's a preposterous idea.

1385
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,720
Like what kind of money are we?

1386
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,360
Who would spend thousands of dollars

1387
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,420
to just go talk about Linux?

1388
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,480
I could jump in an IRC room and do it for free.

1389
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,720
Well, I think it's the intangibles really

1390
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,200
that you kind of hit on.

1391
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,260
There's something about being face-to-face

1392
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:37,520
with the people in the community that is priceless.

1393
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,760
Let's say that, that works well for me personally.

1394
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,160
And I think this might be true

1395
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,520
for a lot of the community out there.

1396
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,760
Last year was my first Linux Fest of any kind.

1397
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,040
I had never been to any Linux conference at all before that.

1398
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,200
And I just happened to be in the area

1399
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,380
when Linux Fest Northwest was happening last year.

1400
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,220
And I thought, okay,

1401
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,040
I'm going to make a little effort here to try to go.

1402
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,120
And for me, that really kick-started my ability

1403
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,880
to be a part of the Linux community.

1404
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,120
I had been listening to the JB shows for years and years,

1405
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:16,540
but now, I mean, you guys can totally see that.

1406
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,280
I was able to put faces to the people

1407
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,020
that I hear on the podcasts every week.

1408
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,840
And we've developed friendships

1409
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,380
with all sorts of people in the community.

1410
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,160
And so for me, as a creative,

1411
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:33,160
I didn't quite know how I could help the Linux community

1412
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,800
by giving back.

1413
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,240
And then once I was at Linux Fest,

1414
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,440
it became really clear that my participating in any way

1415
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,280
was really helpful.

1416
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,520
So I encourage anybody to go to any Linux Fest

1417
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,160
or any Linux conference anywhere just to make connections.

1418
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,080
And it turns something virtual that we connect online,

1419
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,120
but it turns something virtual

1420
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,140
into something really tangible and that's super priceless.

1421
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,320
It sounds cliche to say,

1422
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,220
but we are wired for in-person.

1423
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,760
Like you and I have been doing a show together in Mutt.

1424
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,600
This feels great doing a show together.

1425
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,640
It does, yeah, it's a lot of fun.

1426
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,340
It's great because we're in-person.

1427
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:11,340
Like we've developed like a whole way of communicating

1428
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,780
that is visual.

1429
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,440
It's body cues, it's language.

1430
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,480
It's all of that that when you're not in person,

1431
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,320
you don't get that.

1432
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,680
And it seems so obvious and everybody knows that.

1433
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,800
The text conversations don't necessarily have

1434
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,360
the same context that in-person conversations have.

1435
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,520
I'm not telling you anything you don't know.

1436
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,840
You know that.

1437
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,040
And yet I'm here to tell you,

1438
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,840
I am the biggest recluse.

1439
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,200
I honestly would be happy not seeing another human being

1440
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,440
for weeks at a time.

1441
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,080
I could stay in my room for weeks at a time.

1442
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,280
A real homebody.

1443
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,160
I am, I don't need it.

1444
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,680
Don't need it.

1445
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,600
Don't need it.

1446
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,520
And yet I'm the one sitting here telling you,

1447
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,880
come to these things, it's worth it.

1448
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,600
And it is really hard to imagine

1449
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,240
what you're missing out, right?

1450
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,980
It's like, well, some conferences are not great.

1451
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,320
Some are average, not this one.

1452
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,100
You, my friend, are a bit of a community success story

1453
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:02,940
in yourself.

1454
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:03,760
Yeah, that's right.

1455
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,920
You just decided to come to one of our barbecues

1456
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,760
that we had.

1457
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,760
For this very show.

1458
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,200
And, I mean, how many years ago was that?

1459
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,040
Four?

1460
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,860
Yeah, I think so.

1461
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:13,700
Wow, that's great.

1462
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,540
Four years ago.

1463
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,360
That's crazy.

1464
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,200
And now you're a full-time employee,

1465
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,280
you're doing this as a job,

1466
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,680
and we've been doing this show for years together.

1467
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,120
Because you showed up to a barbecue.

1468
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:22,960
Totally.

1469
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,800
Right?

1470
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,720
I just happened to see you having a party at the studio.

1471
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,040
Yeah, had you gone to Linux Fest in the past before that?

1472
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,440
I had, but that was before I even knew

1473
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,600
about Jupiter broadcasting.

1474
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,440
Wow.

1475
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,880
Who are those jerks over there hogging all the floor

1476
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,400
doing a broadcast?

1477
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,600
Who's making all that noise?

1478
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,920
Yeah.

1479
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,720
Yeah, I just, I don't know.

1480
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,340
I mean, maybe it changes your life, maybe it doesn't.

1481
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,640
But, I mean, you just heard two stories from Brent

1482
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,860
and from Wes, and actually three from me too.

1483
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,100
If you can make it, it's worth it.

1484
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,400
And there's two different events going on,

1485
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,800
Scale and Linux Fest Northwest.

1486
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,840
And we'll be there.

1487
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,360
And I'd love to be part of that story.

1488
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,200
So come see us.

1489
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,000
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

1490
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,760
All right, hit that sign again.

1491
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,120
We got something I want to talk about here.

1492
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,960
It's been on my mind for about a good solid year and a half,

1493
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,400
and I haven't thought of a way yet to address it.

1494
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,640
However, you and I hashed it out earlier today,

1495
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,960
and I think we've come to a way to talk about this

1496
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,240
that isn't a big downer.

1497
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,040
It isn't super depressing.

1498
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,480
And the big question that I want to ask the class today,

1499
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,400
and I have a way for us to think about this,

1500
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,760
so we're gonna frame this a little bit,

1501
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,900
but the question that I want to ask the class today is,

1502
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,840
how can there ever again be a big distro?

1503
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,720
Like an Ubuntu scale distro?

1504
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,800
Are we thinking about numbers here,

1505
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,240
or does brand count as well?

1506
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,560
I actually think both are pretty important metric.

1507
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,600
I think both are pretty important.

1508
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,820
Because that's kind of what you're asking, right?

1509
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,400
Like when do you get another distro

1510
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,040
that pushes its way into the marketplace

1511
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,760
and becomes one of the distros?

1512
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,200
Right, right.

1513
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,960
Okay, so a couple of distros come to mind

1514
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,600
as pretty big distros.

1515
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,240
I think in terms of end user desktop usage,

1516
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,800
it's Ubuntu is the undisputed champion.

1517
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,960
In mindshare, you've got Fedora, and you've got OpenSUSE,

1518
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,760
you've got elementary, which is based on Ubuntu,

1519
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,000
you've got a lot of those distros, like Debian,

1520
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,840
and you know what tier I'm talking about, that tier.

1521
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,200
What else do you see in the enterprise space?

1522
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,280
You've got Debian, of course,

1523
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,620
and there are Ubuntu's in there for sure,

1524
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:18,460
but what else?

1525
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,280
RHEL?

1526
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,160
RHEL, yeah.

1527
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,960
Well, there's a little guy known as ClearLinux then.

1528
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,800
You see that sometimes?

1529
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,640
Yeah, you do.

1530
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,460
You see container sorts of Linux?

1531
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:28,280
So all of these kind of have a common thread, don't they?

1532
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,640
A corporate backer.

1533
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,600
Yes, they do.

1534
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,200
They all have a big corporate backer

1535
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,440
that has a enterprise strategy.

1536
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,160
Support contracts, what have you.

1537
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,560
Now, the one that you say there, though,

1538
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,400
that's maybe not as well known, ClearLinux.

1539
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,800
I think that's a great use case.

1540
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,640
So let's take a look at ClearLinux.

1541
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:47,960
They just published a video, which is all audio,

1542
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,240
so I don't really know why it's a video,

1543
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,420
other than the sound effects are pretty good,

1544
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,560
but they've published a video

1545
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,880
that kind of tries to make the case for ClearLinux.

1546
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,520
So let's play this,

1547
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,480
and then let's talk about if ClearLinux has a shot,

1548
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,400
because A, corporate backer.

1549
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,120
There's a clear strategy.

1550
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:07,080
They're optimized for certain types of workloads.

1551
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,600
They have clearly,

1552
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,000
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1553
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,880
Clearly they have a couple of competitive edges,

1554
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,520
and they have those intel pockets.

1555
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,160
Every application you have runs on an operating system

1556
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,880
made up of several parts.

1557
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,480
So when you update one part,

1558
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,440
it may throw things off balance,

1559
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,640
still leave security threats open,

1560
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,800
and maybe flat out cause the app to not work.

1561
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,000
This means that your team spends time and resources

1562
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,600
manually fixing the issue, or you reject the update.

1563
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,840
That means stability,

1564
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,240
but you may lose out on improved performance in the update.

1565
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,960
Whether breach, crash, or latency,

1566
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,880
not keeping your OS up to date can have real consequences.

1567
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,120
You need ClearLinux, an OS that's secure, performant,

1568
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,520
manageable, and customizable.

1569
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,520
By scanning for vulnerabilities

1570
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,000
and automating the latest security updates,

1571
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,920
ClearLinux delivers an environment

1572
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,800
designed to minimize breaches without causing slowdowns.

1573
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,440
Automated testing checks OS components

1574
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,040
for dependency issues.

1575
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,520
Since ClearLinux is built

1576
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,880
with the end user application in mind,

1577
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,480
it ensures that performance optimizations

1578
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,760
are done at every layer of the stack,

1579
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,120
so that when it comes to end user application performance,

1580
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,480
you get the very best without having to worry about it.

1581
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,400
Where other distros have updates the size of the entire OS,

1582
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,320
ClearLinux software packages

1583
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:35,400
contain only the changed portion, leading to faster updates.

1584
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,240
ClearLinux is also easily customizable,

1585
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,240
so you can build a custom component,

1586
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,480
then use the mixer tool to combine it

1587
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,600
with the rest of the OS without recompiling it all.

1588
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,920
And finally, having a file structure

1589
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,480
that is separated into distinct layers

1590
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,040
makes ClearLinux easier to manage.

1591
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,120
With performance, security, customization, and manageability,

1592
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,840
the ClearLinux OS will be a reliable, stable pillar

1593
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,680
for whatever apps you run on it.

1594
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,360
Learn more at clearlinux.org.

1595
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,880
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

1596
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,960
I mean, that's pretty compelling, right?

1597
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,800
I mean, see what those Intel dollars get you there.

1598
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,480
Yeah, marketing budget.

1599
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,640
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1600
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,840
Yeah, that was great.

1601
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,440
It sounds really corporate to me though,

1602
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,320
in a way that I'm not used to with Linux.

1603
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,120
Yeah, oh, you know, you're right.

1604
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,920
It is very corporate Linux, isn't it?

1605
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,720
It's a product almost, is what it feels like.

1606
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,880
It is, yeah.

1607
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,080
The ClearLinux thing is kind of funny

1608
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,520
because Intel is the steward

1609
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,920
of three different Linux distributions

1610
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,280
that they back for specific purposes

1611
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,400
and have been over the course of the, what, last 15 years,

1612
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,360
five or so of them.

1613
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,920
So it's weird that ClearLinux now

1614
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,600
is suddenly special enough to be considered something

1615
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,200
that might be viable when the four of it

1616
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,920
that preceded it haven't been,

1617
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,800
even though they put the same kind of effort.

1618
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,360
So let me put this out there to you then.

1619
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:04,360
So what does it take to make a Linux distribution big?

1620
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,920
Because I feel like talking like this,

1621
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,880
positioning like this, trying to clearly address a market,

1622
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,800
maybe it's containers or servers or Intel-based systems,

1623
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,120
like they're clearly addressing a particular market.

1624
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,520
They're coming at it with a very measured,

1625
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,600
very focused message,

1626
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:25,560
and it's backed by Intel with plenty of billions.

1627
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,360
Isn't that what it takes to make

1628
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,640
the next successful major Linux distribution?

1629
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,000
Mr. Payne, what do you think?

1630
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,760
Does ClearLinux have a chance here?

1631
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,880
Or are we just locked in?

1632
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,560
Like the big Linux players are the big Linux players

1633
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,600
and so it will remain forever.

1634
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,280
It's a tricky thing to nail down

1635
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,760
because it really is, it's a mindshare thing.

1636
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,680
It's almost a feeling, right?

1637
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,800
It's how you think about it.

1638
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,760
It's how people model that distribution in their mind.

1639
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,240
And sometimes things start slowly

1640
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,320
and build more momentum than you really can appreciate.

1641
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,000
And so Clear feels like it's on the cusp.

1642
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,680
I don't know how far it's gonna go,

1643
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,480
but like when we first started talking about Clear,

1644
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,240
which was ages ago,

1645
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,800
there were some nice benchmarks out at Ferronix,

1646
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,120
but other than that, it was like, yeah, okay,

1647
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,920
well, really, what are you bringing?

1648
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,960
I kind of still feel that way,

1649
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,480
but after we played with it in a bit,

1650
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,240
it was a pretty usable system.

1651
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,880
Now that's not enough to unseat,

1652
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,120
but with time and mindshare, maybe it is.

1653
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,400
But I don't know, it does feel pretty locked in

1654
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,240
and without some big corporate vendor

1655
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,160
deciding that they really wanna play in that space,

1656
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,080
which does seem to be what Intel keeps wanting to do.

1657
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,400
I don't see it happening anytime soon.

1658
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,400
I'll tell you what my insights have given me

1659
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,120
at Linux Academy is that there is so much momentum

1660
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,960
in the industry around certifications

1661
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,720
and qualifications for a job

1662
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,880
that it takes certain things reach a point in the industry

1663
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,040
and then they become like a benchmark

1664
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,120
in which you are measured by.

1665
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,160
So like a Red Hat certification or a Docker certification

1666
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,800
is extremely valuable when you're trying to get a job.

1667
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,240
And so it sort of creates a cycle

1668
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,960
where people go to get that training,

1669
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,240
they go to get that certification

1670
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,520
so they can get those jobs.

1671
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,040
So then those jobs are looking

1672
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,400
for those particular qualifications.

1673
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,800
Right, yeah, you've built that.

1674
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,360
And it kind of gets locked in in a way.

1675
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,680
The other part too is,

1676
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,760
so we're talking about Linux,

1677
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,720
but which aspects are we talking about?

1678
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,360
Because it's like Alpine is a distribution

1679
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,480
that's gotten way more popular.

1680
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,920
It's not gonna be the next big Linux,

1681
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,560
but we talk about it way more than we used to,

1682
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,280
thanks to containers mostly.

1683
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,200
I don't know that I see someone like,

1684
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,440
is there gonna be a next big desktop Linux?

1685
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,120
Or is that Chrome OS?

1686
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,280
That was the other thing I was gonna say.

1687
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,240
Yeah, is that Chrome OS?

1688
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,520
Now on the server, all right,

1689
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,840
well, like Amazon Linux,

1690
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,680
if you wanna consider that separate or a derivative,

1691
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,440
it's kind of unclear at this point.

1692
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,720
That doesn't see much use outside of it, but you can.

1693
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,240
You've got their virtual desktops as well.

1694
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,880
So I could see like stuff on the server happening.

1695
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,480
You're right that there are certifications and stuff,

1696
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,360
but enough of that now,

1697
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,960
I think also ends up being like,

1698
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,720
you can still get certified on AWS

1699
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,480
and switch out distributions and figure it out, right?

1700
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,560
True, yeah.

1701
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,400
Yeah, that's interesting.

1702
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,240
And if you end up just using

1703
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,960
a bunch of configuration management scripts,

1704
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,720
then maybe you're not the person who has to know all that.

1705
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,040
What you're really kind of saying at the meta level there

1706
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,840
is the version of Linux

1707
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,920
and the details about the Linux that you use

1708
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,000
on the different cloud providers

1709
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,480
just simply becomes an implementation detail.

1710
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,520
Yeah, I mean, it might matter,

1711
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,480
but it only matters to the extent that your tools

1712
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,840
are built to use them and take advantage

1713
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,400
of whatever features they might have that you need.

1714
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,680
Wow, I'm just sitting with that for a second.

1715
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,200
I mean, the idea that like,

1716
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,480
it doesn't really matter if I'm using Ubuntu or Red Hat,

1717
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,280
what really matters is that the cloud scripts that I'm using

1718
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,040
or the service provider that I'm using

1719
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,400
has the right tools or the right integration.

1720
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,400
I don't like the way that feels when I sit with that.

1721
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,240
I mean, you are completely right.

1722
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,160
It's kind of a success story consequence, right?

1723
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,000
Or it's just ubiquitous.

1724
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,840
Like Android.

1725
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,400
Yeah, it is, mm-hmm.

1726
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,200
Wow, geez, you're right.

1727
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,520
And then, yeah, and I think you're right too.

1728
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:53,200
Pair that with like Chrome OS is probably the next big desktop.

1729
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,040
It is the same thing.

1730
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,240
End users could care less that it's based on Gen2

1731
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,480
or that when you run a Linux application

1732
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,400
that's running some kind of crazy Debian environment

1733
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,160
on top of a Gen2 box, like, they don't care.

1734
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,000
They just want to use it.

1735
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,760
They just want to get their sound working,

1736
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,600
which is happening too.

1737
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,800
I have Google Drive docs to edit, man, come on.

1738
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,440
The key here is partnerships.

1739
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,520
Everyone has kind of missed the point.

1740
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,800
The Intel thing is only as interesting

1741
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,160
as when the first agreements come in

1742
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,440
for saying like, this will be happening with this

1743
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,160
and this is our recommended solution.

1744
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,000
The way SUSE made Enterprise Linux

1745
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,160
become a success story in itself

1746
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,000
when they pioneered the business model

1747
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,200
was that they partnered with companies

1748
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:37,120
to support exotic hardware platforms, exotic designs,

1749
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,760
and they started working with doing direct engineering

1750
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,880
of migrating systems from legacy Unices

1751
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,960
that we don't know about anymore to Linux-based platforms.

1752
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,320
And when Red Hat took that model,

1753
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,920
they just went and ran with it.

1754
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,520
They built on top of it all kinds of other things.

1755
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,240
And of course, between the two of them,

1756
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,120
they developed a certification programs.

1757
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:58,320
They built life cycles and management

1758
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,000
and tooling and infrastructure.

1759
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,160
And like when you build all these things together,

1760
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,400
you start building an ecosystem.

1761
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,440
And the thing that everybody gets wrong,

1762
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,480
be it server, desktop, containers, or whatever,

1763
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,880
is that you can't be an island.

1764
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:15,840
You have to be an ecosystem.

1765
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,960
If you're not developing an ecosystem

1766
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,200
or if you're not thinking from the point of view

1767
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,960
of making it so people can easily adopt your platform,

1768
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,240
your technologies, or become a part of it or a partnership

1769
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,160
and or help people pull away from one ecosystem

1770
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,400
to pull into the other,

1771
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,000
because the friction is relatively low,

1772
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,440
but there's this perception that it's really high.

1773
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:38,240
As you can easily move from an Ubuntu system

1774
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,160
to a Fedora system, to a CentOS system,

1775
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,800
to a SLES system, to an open SUSE system.

1776
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,480
And it doesn't really matter all that much

1777
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,600
when it comes to like,

1778
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,960
oh, your graphical applications are all kind of the same.

1779
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,040
The libraries are all there.

1780
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,800
You can compile stuff, things like that.

1781
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,960
But it matters when you're trying to figure out

1782
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,640
what the hell you can use it with.

1783
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,680
And if you've got partnerships that say,

1784
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,200
okay, these 3D printers,

1785
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,400
Red Hat through some of their enthusiastic employees

1786
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,640
come together, they build a group,

1787
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,640
but they start talking to 3D printers vendors

1788
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,560
and they get the drivers written.

1789
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,520
And then they put them into the upstream kernel

1790
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,920
and then they bring them into Fedora first.

1791
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,920
And they talk about it as a Fedora feature.

1792
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,200
Then that means that Fedora has an avenue

1793
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,360
in which building another arm to their ecosystem.

1794
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,560
And then that eventually propagates into RHEL

1795
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,520
where the industrial people start taking advantage of it

1796
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,040
and building a platform in which they can do commercial

1797
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,520
or industrial grade stuff built

1798
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:38,840
on top of 3D printing technologies.

1799
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,640
And so like it kind of feeds into this cycle.

1800
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:45,000
And that's just an avenue where volunteer ship

1801
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,200
evolves into something that's valuable for the business.

1802
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,400
It could easily go the other way too.

1803
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,520
It doesn't really matter.

1804
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:55,520
The point is that there's gotta be this connection

1805
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:00,400
between among multiple parties to make it work.

1806
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,600
And this is why desktop Linux has never been successful.

1807
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,680
Everyone tries to do it as a goddamn island.

1808
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,160
There it is.

1809
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,400
I was waiting for it.

1810
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,480
All right, Neil, hold it there.

1811
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,560
We're going to continue on.

1812
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,480
I think we'll pick it up in the post-show though.

1813
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:16,600
And we were gonna look at our home folders today,

1814
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,200
but I feel like we could save that for next week.

1815
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,200
Yeah, that's evergreen.

1816
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,520
Yeah, it is.

1817
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,640
In fact, maybe why don't we do this?

1818
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,840
Go look at your own home folder.

1819
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,080
Do an LSLA and just take a look at it.

1820
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,080
I want you to look at how many dot folders are in there

1821
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,000
versus the dot config directory,

1822
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
because that's where they're supposed to be, right?

1823
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,560
I mean, I guess we'll get into that.

1824
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,960
But yes, you'll probably find a lot.

1825
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,640
Some will have their own subdirectories.

1826
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,720
Maybe there'll be some weird intercasing.

1827
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,960
Yeah, if you've got tree, just type tree in your home

1828
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,640
and go stare at all the lines.

1829
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,680
If you don't have tree, install tree.

1830
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,520
Yeah, there you go.

1831
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,320
And then run tree on your home directory.

1832
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:51,240
And then listen to episode 290,

1833
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,800
because we're gonna be talking about this.

1834
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,160
Because Wes and I have to come clean

1835
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,240
about our home directories,

1836
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,440
and we want you to understand what we're talking about.

1837
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,280
So this will be a good exercise for you at home.

1838
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,080
But I did promise some great pics.

1839
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,240
So let's do those before we get out of here.

1840
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,800
First pic this week is something

1841
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,360
that I am trying out in studio,

1842
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,560
getting ready for the big Linux Fest Northwest.

1843
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,640
Here, can I tell you something?

1844
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:14,960
Oh yeah, I will tell a soul.

1845
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,880
Don't tell anybody else.

1846
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,000
The cone of silence.

1847
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:18,840
Oh, good idea.

1848
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:22,000
They can't hear us outside of that, that's perfect.

1849
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,040
So I wanna make it look like we got our shit together.

1850
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,200
And I was thinking, maybe we could get

1851
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,160
like a couple of media devices set up

1852
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,720
just with our content or with some music.

1853
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,560
So that way when people are hanging out at the studio,

1854
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,400
they got some stuff to listen to.

1855
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,320
The space is ready to go.

1856
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,800
But we just pretend like we've always had it.

1857
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,360
The studio is just, those are built in, yeah.

1858
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,400
Yeah, it's always been here.

1859
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,480
It's like, we use Linux everywhere obviously.

1860
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,440
I don't know what you're thinking about.

1861
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:43,000
Okay. The cone of silence.

1862
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,840
Ooh.

1863
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,960
So let me tell you about Pi Music Box,

1864
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,040
something we use here in the studio.

1865
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,200
And it's pretty sweet.

1866
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,840
Okay, maybe technically I haven't used it yet,

1867
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,680
but I'm about to.

1868
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,840
It is a Spotify SoundCloud Google Music player

1869
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:02,720
for the Raspberry Pi.

1870
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:07,080
In fact, I think it even supports Apple AirPlay version 1.0.

1871
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:11,200
And it turns a Raspberry Pi into a media device receiver

1872
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,120
with a web interface that works great on both the desktop,

1873
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,360
but your mobile device as well.

1874
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,960
So guests can come over, they join your wifi,

1875
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,720
you give them the URL and then they're up and going.

1876
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,360
And they can like cue music up

1877
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,080
and they can play their own mixes and stuff like that.

1878
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,760
So it's called Pi Music Box.

1879
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,560
There's a bunch of stuff, just does a bunch of stuff.

1880
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,400
This really seems perfect.

1881
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,800
Actually, I had some friends over

1882
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,240
and they used a different streaming service than I did.

1883
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,840
And they're like, oh, we have this playlist that you should.

1884
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,080
And I was like, what?

1885
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:36,920
I'm not set up.

1886
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,240
This would be perfect.

1887
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,920
Yeah, that kind of thing happens.

1888
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:44,640
And what tends to be the case is the Chromecast

1889
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,120
becomes the sort of like unifier.

1890
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,840
Everybody's got Chromecast support.

1891
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,600
So then it's like whatever you can send to the TV

1892
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,280
and play on the TV speakers is what you got.

1893
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,280
Not this year.

1894
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,160
This year, we're gonna go all out.

1895
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,440
So that we'll be using Pi Music Box to deliver that.

1896
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,480
Now, this is pretty neat.

1897
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,600
You found this one, it's called ETA.

1898
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,440
And it's a graphical tool for monitoring progress.

1899
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,800
I mean, I don't know that I would call it graphical.

1900
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,160
Command line graphical.

1901
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,720
They call it graphical.

1902
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,680
I don't think the audience would define it as graphical.

1903
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,920
You're right.

1904
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,680
But it lets you get insights into the progress

1905
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,400
of a process that you normally wouldn't get insight,

1906
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,840
like a file transfer or like how long something's taking.

1907
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,360
The nice part, so it's not like, it's not magic.

1908
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,080
You're gonna have to do a little thinking to use it,

1909
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,240
but it sets up a framework for a generic way

1910
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,080
to get an ETA with a little progress bar.

1911
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,120
So if you have some units that are changing

1912
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,760
and you have a way to get what the total size should be

1913
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,440
in a way to get the current size

1914
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,480
of whatever size might mean for your problem set

1915
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,600
on one place versus another,

1916
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,480
it will draw you a pretty progress bar.

1917
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,800
I kind of think one of the things

1918
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,200
that it took me a little adjusting to

1919
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:53,240
when I switched to Linux many, many eons ago

1920
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,800
was returning nothing was a success.

1921
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,640
Right, yeah, right.

1922
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,560
When something goes perfectly,

1923
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,480
the computer tells you nothing.

1924
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,400
Nothing, and it's like, is that, did it work?

1925
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,480
And like when it's like a big file copy

1926
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,320
and you're just waiting and waiting and waiting.

1927
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,520
And you need that, you don't have time to go.

1928
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,600
And then like all you get back is the command line.

1929
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,560
You're like, okay.

1930
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,920
So that's where this could kind of be nice.

1931
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,800
I could see that.

1932
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,440
So I don't, I've moved beyond.

1933
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:17,720
I'm past that now.

1934
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,360
Now I just like PS like a son of a bitch,

1935
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:22,480
but no, I could see how ETA would be very useful.

1936
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,360
It is up on GitHub.

1937
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,440
We have a link in the show notes, linuxunplug.com,

1938
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,240
slash 289.

1939
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:31,680
Now, I feel like we've talked about this next pick before.

1940
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,040
Oh, definitely, definitely.

1941
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,080
But I did a whole site search and I, nothing.

1942
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,120
But either we just are bad at tags.

1943
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:38,960
That could be it.

1944
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,800
We should, let's put it in the tags this week.

1945
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,800
NetData, the open source real time performance monitoring

1946
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,100
and health monitoring application.

1947
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:50,420
If you don't know what NetData is,

1948
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,920
then I have failed in my job as a podcaster

1949
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,400
and I apologize to you.

1950
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,520
So we are trying to make good right now.

1951
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,920
This is so, so, so great.

1952
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,480
If you got like a VPS somewhere

1953
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,000
where you're doing a few things

1954
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,940
and wanna know what it's up to,

1955
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,480
or maybe you got like a home file server.

1956
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,640
It's also great on your laptop.

1957
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,480
Oh, absolutely.

1958
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,080
Yeah, have you used it recently?

1959
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,760
Yeah, it's running on my system right now.

1960
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,680
I feel like it just came up in conversation recently.

1961
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,520
Yeah, it sure did in the most recent episode of TechSnap.

1962
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,680
Yeah, it turns out Jim, he uses it too.

1963
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,000
Okay, there you have it.

1964
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,680
Go check out that new TechSnap.Systems.

1965
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:21,520
397.

1966
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,580
397, Wes and Jim get into some really cool tools

1967
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:27,840
for making your network a little more manageable,

1968
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,480
a little more quality of service, if you will.

1969
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,760
Something to be proud of.

1970
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:34,960
Yeah, so NetData looks really, really good.

1971
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,440
And it is our bad if you're not familiar with it.

1972
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,960
I absolutely apologize

1973
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,600
because it is an open source darling

1974
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,400
and you need to go get it

1975
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,820
if you haven't checked out NetData yet.

1976
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:48,340
So ETA, Pi Music Box and NetData.

1977
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:52,640
In the show notes, we have a link towards like a demo of it.

1978
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:53,660
It's just so cool.

1979
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:54,500
It's just so, so cool.

1980
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,360
Yeah, you're gonna get lost just playing with graphs.

1981
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,560
Yeah, you really could.

1982
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,520
I think though, the cool, the thing is I'm gonna take,

1983
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,840
I'm gonna take my new Raspberry Pi that I got

1984
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,080
and I'm gonna set up this Pi Music Box on it.

1985
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:04,920
I think that's gonna be-

1986
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,280
I have one later and I'm gonna do it too because-

1987
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,120
Yeah, yeah.

1988
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,880
I'm gonna have like, I feel like I need a rack.

1989
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,140
Maybe if anybody has a recommendation,

1990
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:12,560
like a rack of Raspberry Pis

1991
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,720
because I'm gonna have one Raspberry Pi

1992
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,920
doing the music stuff.

1993
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,520
And then you got, I wanna do,

1994
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,880
here's what I haven't told you about this yet.

1995
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,040
I wanna do a dedicated Raspberry Pi for my WireGuard stuff.

1996
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,160
Oh yeah, little WireGuard VPN box.

1997
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,520
Cause I got WireGuard running on my workstation

1998
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,740
in my office, but I feel like now that I'm using it

1999
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:31,480
as much as I am using it,

2000
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:34,160
like it needs to be on a dedicated WireGuard device, right?

2001
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:37,800
So a Raspberry Pi, WireGuard server, perfect, right?

2002
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,000
I mean, we might as well set up a Pi-hole server too

2003
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,520
just cause why not?

2004
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,140
That's true, that's true.

2005
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:46,120
And then last but not least, this Pi music box.

2006
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:51,120
So I want like a four or so rack of Raspberry Pi devices

2007
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,680
that could do like wire management and stuff.

2008
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,000
If anybody has any recommendations,

2009
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,480
go to linuxunplug.com slash contact

2010
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,000
or tweet me at Chris LAS

2011
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,880
and let me know what you recommend for that kind of thing

2012
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,480
because I could see, I could see some of a few.

2013
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,840
I mean, I've got like two or three floating around the studio

2014
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,040
not being used right now.

2015
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:09,960
They just accumulated.

2016
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:12,080
What happens when you're, I guess, a nerd?

2017
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,520
So might as well put them to some good use.

2018
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:15,760
That's right.

2019
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,000
All right, Mr. Payne, where do people find

2020
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,920
that new TechSnap, revamped TechSnap?

2021
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,560
TechSnap.systems.

2022
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,640
Very good, very good.

2023
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:22,920
Can they find you on the Twitter?

2024
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:23,760
At Westpane.

2025
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,960
Ah, ah, I'm at Chris LAS.

2026
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,880
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

2027
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:32,560
And don't forget, go check out Popeye and friends

2028
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,720
live from Malta.

2029
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,800
We'll have a link in the show notes

2030
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,200
if you want to check out their live stream.

2031
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,100
That's pretty cool.

2032
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,640
That is pretty cool, so go check that out.

2033
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:45,240
Linuxunplug.com slash 289 for all of our links.

2034
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,560
We'd love to have you join us live.

2035
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,040
Next week, I'll be flying into a remote location

2036
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,520
and jumping on the live stream.

2037
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,720
So I would love you to make it.

2038
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:52,540
See you then.

2039
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:53,380
Next Tuesday!

2040
01:12:53,380 --> 01:13:09,380
We'll be right back with another episode of TechSnap.

2041
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,400
Welcome to BSD Unplugged, your weekly BSD talk show

2042
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,880
that's too busy getting actual work done

2043
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,120
to care about what your silly display server.

2044
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:32,920
My name is Alan.

2045
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,520
You know what stings about that clip?

2046
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,720
That was like three years ago.

2047
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:41,160
And we're still figuring out the Wayland stuff.

2048
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,480
And we've never properly gotten them back, either.

2049
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,560
Well, no, I mean, we don't have anything to tell.

2050
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,160
No, we don't.

2051
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,840
And once Wayland is finalized, I suppose.

2052
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,720
Anyways, JBtitles.com, go vote, thank you, Mumble Room.

2053
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:56,200
So I think we had a pickup, but I can't remember

2054
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,680
what it was in the post-show.

2055
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,800
Do you remember what it was?

2056
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,140
I said we'd pick it up in the post-show.

2057
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:01,480
The ecosystem thing.

2058
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,480
In the ecosystem.

2059
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:02,980
Ecosystem.

2060
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,480
Do you remember what it was, though?

2061
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:08,120
Because ecosystem has got to be the most generic description

2062
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,720
of what we were going to talk about.

2063
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:13,120
I was talking about how the reason why

2064
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,760
Enterprise Linux is successful is because it's

2065
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:20,000
about partnerships and people and partnerships

2066
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,600
and certifications and all these things that feed into each other

2067
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,020
to help actually sustain it.

2068
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,700
And the reason why desktop Linux has failed

2069
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,360
is because everybody tries to approach it like an island.

2070
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,880
Now you're saying failed.

2071
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:35,440
I prefer to look at it more as like a slow burn.

2072
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,760
And I look at it from an infinite timeline perspective,

2073
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,880
in which what we just have to wait for

2074
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,240
is the Microsoft Corporation and the Apple Corporation

2075
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:49,000
to fade away, and then the desktop is ours.

2076
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,240
Now that we've got a little bit extra time,

2077
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,840
you know what I think we should do?

2078
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,680
Is we ought to get the audience to send us

2079
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,640
some screenshots of all of the dot folders

2080
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,800
in the root of their home directory.

2081
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,080
You know what I think?

2082
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,920
Yeah, I think that's best because you

2083
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,640
can have a number that describes it, which is good.

2084
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,400
Do that, too.

2085
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,240
Yeah, we need the number.

2086
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:06,680
But just seeing the mess.

2087
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:09,840
Yeah, we want to see the mess, the number, all of it.

2088
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:10,720
Take a screenshot.

2089
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,120
Go install that tree application if you don't have it.

2090
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,560
And then get us a screenshot of your home directory

2091
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:18,880
and tweet me at chrisles, or email into the show

2092
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,080
by going to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

2093
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,720
I want to see these home directories

2094
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:27,480
because Wes brought a soapbox, and by God, we're

2095
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:44,520
going to use it.
