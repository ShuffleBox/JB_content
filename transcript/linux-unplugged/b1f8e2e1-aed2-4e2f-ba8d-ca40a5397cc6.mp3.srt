00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,360
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,360
My name is Chris.

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,360
My name is Wes.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,360
And my name is Brent.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,360
Hello, gentlemen.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,940
All of us are in studio gathered together for two episodes today.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,520
We're going to record them back to back to get us ready to hit the road for our West

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,520
Coast tour.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:34,720
So coming up on this episode, we dug deep this week to find our perfect Google Photos

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,720
replacement.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,880
So this week, we'll share our setups that we think work great, are easy to use, and

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,280
are fully backed up.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,080
Get rid of Google plus a new tool that might help do just that for Google Maps and, well,

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,440
at least the hopes and dreams I have for it and why it might just be landing at the perfect

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
time.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,560
Then we'll round out the show with some great boosts and pics and a lot more.

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,280
So before we go any further, guys, let's say time appropriate greetings to our virtual

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
lug.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
Hello, Mumble Room.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
Oh, hello, guys.

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,280
Hello, Chris.

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
Hello, Wes.

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
Hello, Brent.

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
Hello.

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
Hello.

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,240
We also have a whole bunch of people up and quiet listening because, well, they get a

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,360
low latency Opus stream when they do it that way.

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,220
And of course, there's jblive.fm and jupyter.tube.

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,960
We are live on Sundays except for next Sunday.

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
We're not going to be live.

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,840
We're going to be prerecorded.

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,840
Then after that, we're doing that just to buy ourselves one easy Sunday on the road.

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
That's the first Sunday.

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Sunday the 25th.

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
Yeah.

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Thank you.

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,540
That'll probably be a pretty, either we're going to be napping because we'll have been

38
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,360
exhausted by that point or we're going to be trying to put in miles.

39
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,480
I'm not sure which one, but we needed that flexibility, so we're going to do a prerecord

40
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
for one of them.

41
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,840
But then from then on, all the other shows are going to be from the road.

42
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,280
Hey, we better start thinking about that, huh?

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280
Yeah.

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Yeah.

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
We probably, maybe we should chat.

46
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,600
And you know how we're going to stay connected while we do that?

47
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
TailScale.

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,160
So go over and give a good old good morning to TailScale, TailScale.com.

49
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,680
It's a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,480
It's really straightforward to use, super secure because it's using WireGuard's tech,

51
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,080
and really, really easy to set up.

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
Really easy.

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,800
Two minutes per device, maybe?

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
I don't know.

55
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,200
So go say good morning.

56
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,700
Try it up to 20 devices for free at TailScale.com.

57
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,320
You know, I've been using TailScale this week to set up my new dev one, which we'll talk

58
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,760
about in next episode, and it's been amazing.

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,080
I've just been using it to shorthand host names because I'm here at the studio and I

60
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,440
don't know what the heck all the IPs are and stuff.

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,040
It makes things so easy.

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
Yeah.

63
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,080
It's a use case I haven't used yet, and I was so thankful for it.

64
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
It was just super simple.

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
So thanks, TailScale.

66
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,400
And you could just set your bookmarks and stuff to use that TailScale IP.

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,640
I'm using the magic DNS actually.

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,200
And didn't you test that if you're on the same network, they actually do transfer locally

69
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,120
even when you're using the TailScale IPs?

70
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Yeah.

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,640
I was doing some R syncing using that, and it was real fast.

72
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Yeah.

73
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,480
It was really a wonderful, beautiful, like transparent operation.

74
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
I really loved it.

75
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,760
So you can just always use the TailScale IP.

76
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
That's it.

77
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
You just memorize that one.

78
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
Yeah.

79
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
So great.

80
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
All right.

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
Let's talk about Headway.

82
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,520
This is essentially your own Google Maps in a box.

83
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
Now let's not oversell.

84
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,480
I'm sure this is a very hard job, and I'm sure it's not complete.

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,000
But the idea of this resonates so strongly with me that I wanted to talk about it on

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
the show.

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,800
And they write on the GitHub page, quote, with just a few commands, you can bring up

88
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,340
your own fully functional map server.

89
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,960
This includes a front end, a base map, a geocoder, and a routing engine.

90
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:47,200
Choose one of the 200 plus predefined cities, or provide your own open street map extract

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,400
covering any area from the neighborhood to the whole planet.

92
00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:00,880
I have for so, so long wanted to run my own mapping software on my Raspberry Pi server

93
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
in Lady Chupes.

94
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,180
I mean, it just makes so much sense.

95
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,960
First of all, it's one of the ultimate tracking tools for Google.

96
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,520
I mean, everywhere you go, right?

97
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Yeah.

98
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,860
But also, there are so many scenarios where I'm offline and I want to do route planning

99
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,960
and I don't have access to anything.

100
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,400
And wouldn't it be great if I started building these routes and all these favorite locations

101
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,760
for camping or great signal or quiet spot to record.

102
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,760
I've always, always wanted a database like that, but I don't want to build it around

103
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,600
Google Maps.

104
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,360
And the idea that maybe I could install Headway and create something like that on my mobile

105
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,000
RV, such a cool idea.

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,280
So it sounds like it's maybe the sort of the open source components for maps.earth, which

107
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
you can go try.

108
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,440
I assume that gives you a little bit of a somewhat of a preview of what you might get

109
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,640
out of the box.

110
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,520
It could at least route us from the studio to JPL.

111
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,720
So that's promising.

112
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
I think we got it.

113
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,240
We absolutely got to play with this after the show.

114
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,440
Headway is working on AMD 64 machines.

115
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,080
I don't know about ARM machines, but you know, for this test, I'd totally do it on a laptop

116
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
or something.

117
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,320
As far as the project status, they say Headway is currently capable of showing a map, searching

118
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,980
for points of interest and addresses within OpenStreetMap extracts, and providing directions

119
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,000
between two places within that extract.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,320
Supported modes include driving, cycling, and walking.

121
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,320
Transit is a work in progress.

122
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
Oh, exciting.

123
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,240
Now, obviously, for something like we do, you also need another form of routing, which

124
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,640
is basically like commercial truck routing.

125
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,260
You need large vehicle routing and extra tall vehicle routing because there's overpasses

126
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,960
that are under a dozen feet or something like that.

127
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,880
What are you saying about Jubes?

128
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
She's tall.

129
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
She's proud and tall.

130
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,160
And so you have to use special routing software that takes her dimensions into consideration.

131
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,160
That sounds expensive.

132
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
It does.

133
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,320
But in theory, someone could build something like that for a tool like this.

134
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,480
Yeah, that's what's so neat about it.

135
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,480
And some folks in our matrix are making just this point that OpenStreetMaps is a great

136
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,760
project, because now you can get this data and sort of a common language and place for

137
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,120
all of this to collaborate around, and then you can build your own ideas into this stuff.

138
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,000
You know, I've been using OpenStreetMaps as a back end for my navigation apps for years

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and years now, actually.

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,820
And it's gotten a lot better.

141
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,120
So I would imagine the more stuff like this gets out there and the easier it is to use

142
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,600
and the easier it is to sort of update all the maps as well from a user standpoint, the

143
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,740
better and better it'll get.

144
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,720
So it's like open source, long game, always wins.

145
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,840
Yeah, that's a fair point.

146
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,480
You're sitting in that seat right now, having used an OpenStreetMap powered app.

147
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,680
Do you want to mention what it is and maybe make some disclaimers about it?

148
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,360
I mean, it's not perfect.

149
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,980
And that's probably the caveat with all this is how could anything be as good as Google

150
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,500
Maps when you have so many users constantly providing data and you have the financial

151
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,080
budget that Google does to actually invest in routing it, taking pictures, getting satellite

152
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
imagery.

153
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,040
So clearly it's going to have its limitations.

154
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,640
But Brent, you're relatively an authority on this, having just driven from Canada to

155
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,080
Seattle using this.

156
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,320
And I know you used it in our Denver trip as well.

157
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,880
With only a small, you know, few small incidents here and there.

158
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,960
Only three extra mountain passes, it was fine.

159
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,560
Wes, you'll probably find this while I'm chatting about it.

160
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,760
Almost exactly a year ago, Chris, if you remember on Self-Hosted, we sort of explored using

161
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,960
some of these open mapping applications.

162
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,760
And I know some of us suffered a little and some of us had some more experience.

163
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,480
You were fresh at it, I think.

164
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
I think you had a hard time with it in Denver.

165
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,420
It really, yeah, it struggled with the complexity of that city, we've got to say.

166
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:50,320
So the application I'm using primarily is OSM and it's an Android application.

167
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,040
And there are a few others.

168
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,160
Some of them are more simplistic or more user friendly, perhaps I'll put it that way.

169
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,440
I'm not quite remembering them to mind in memory.

170
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,760
But I generally really think it's great for going between large places.

171
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,800
So between cities, things like that.

172
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,660
That has worked out fabulously for me and I find it quite accurate.

173
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,320
What I appreciate about it is the customizability of the interface itself.

174
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,080
So you can add different layers and, you know, I have mine in dark mode all the time because

175
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,500
I like it that way.

176
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,840
And those are some things you can't do with some of the other, you know, bigger proprietary

177
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
apps.

178
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,880
And you've also, one of the things I like about your UI that I wish I could do is you've

179
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,760
configured it to show not just the next turn, but the turn after that.

180
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,760
So you can start doing some of the math ahead of time and only some nav units do that and

181
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,360
you can just turn that on in yours.

182
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,280
Yeah, actually, I wonder if that's a symptom now, but I found it really super useful to

183
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,300
know, you know, as a driver, whenever I have time, I could just look down and just have

184
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,280
an idea of what's coming up next, next.

185
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,840
Yeah, get an idea of which lane to be in.

186
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,080
It's helpful for just you for quick turns, right?

187
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,160
Yeah, because sometimes, especially when you're downtown and four lanes to get across.

188
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,320
Although now that we're talking about it, I wonder if it's a symptom of the fact that

189
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,240
I've noticed that this map mapping application has a bit more of a delay.

190
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,400
So I find sometimes the turn, you know, I'm right up on the turn and then it sort of suggests

191
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,620
that I'm there so that I have found the interface legs a little bit from reality compared to

192
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,000
some of the other alternatives.

193
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,600
So I wonder if that's just my way of trying to solve that is to get ahead of the turn.

194
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,680
Still seems useful to me.

195
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,360
I wish I could turn it on.

196
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,800
It is kind of somewhat common sometimes in some open source things like, all right, there's

197
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,880
some deficiencies, but you can customize it so you could probably work around and no one's

198
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
spying on you.

199
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,440
I mean, there's that now and that's becoming more important to me as time goes on.

200
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,520
The other thing I appreciate is that I can bring up, you know, on the heads up display,

201
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,760
whatever I want, really, there's tons of options.

202
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,720
And so some of them that I like is, you know, navigational directions, like compass directions

203
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,320
a certain way.

204
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,760
But also like total distance that I have to go, what time I'm going to arrive there, things

205
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
like that.

206
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,840
But I find the layout, I guess, more predictable, like all that information is in the same place.

207
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,640
I was using Google Maps a little bit recently and I found it difficult because that information

208
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,080
kept moving around and I found that kind of tricky.

209
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:24,600
So I tend to go to it first, but I will say if you're trying to get to like a business

210
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:33,320
address, especially in a city that businesses change quite often, the search is tricky.

211
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,480
You can search by like address, but you kind of have to do it backwards.

212
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,620
You have to search by, you know, province or state first and then city and then street

213
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,960
name and then number.

214
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,400
So it's a little bit backwards from like human readability in that sense.

215
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,560
That's a little annoying, but understandable.

216
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,400
I understand like it's a hierarchy, so that makes sense once you get used to it.

217
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,500
But as a first time user, you're like, I've seen that in some of the built in navigation

218
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
systems as well.

219
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,600
Yes, I was thinking the same.

220
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
I like, though, that OpenStreetMaps, first of all, makes apps like that possible.

221
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,440
I think it's such an important project.

222
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,880
The other thing, too, is if you had a tool like Headway, which is what we started talking

223
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,260
about, the self-hosted solution.

224
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,680
In theory, Brent, you could kind of plan ahead and then just supply the needed information

225
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,240
to the nav unit, right?

226
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Yeah, that's a great idea.

227
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,200
And then you could plan on your larger screen on your laptop or whatever, which I think

228
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
would be preferable, too.

229
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,240
Yeah, get it all sketched out in advance.

230
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,760
Yeah, that's how I like to do it.

231
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,200
And I like to like look for parking spots and all that kind of stuff.

232
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,080
You could even like print it out if you need it.

233
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
Do you remember?

234
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,480
Did you ever drive when that was a thing?

235
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
MapQuest.

236
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Oh, yeah.

237
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
Yeah, totally MapQuest printouts and stuff.

238
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
And they sucked.

239
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,400
And of course, you had to have like the get to the interstate on ramp, all that stuff.

240
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Oh, yeah.

241
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,080
And towards the end, some of them will let you, like Microsoft had one, they'll let you

242
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,160
like drop off some of the first steps.

243
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,680
I know how to get to the freeway.

244
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
I'm good.

245
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,800
You know, and the big innovation with on your phone is you could start the nav once you're

246
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,080
on the freeway and you didn't have to get all the, I want to just mention because I

247
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,200
know people are going to ask me what I do use for the RV navigation right now.

248
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,760
If you have a large vehicle, I think the Garmin RV 780 is a really good device and it'll take

249
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
into all that.

250
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,720
I like having a dedicated device, too.

251
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,280
I could see replacing it one day.

252
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,040
I think that'd be pretty cool.

253
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,200
Replace with like a Raspberry Pi with an LCD screen running headway and some open street

254
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,600
maps all take into account how big JOOPS is.

255
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,400
Well, a boy can dream.

256
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Chris, I'm curious.

257
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,240
You mentioned you want to eventually put this on a Raspberry Pi.

258
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,040
Do you think the Pi can handle it?

259
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,000
Well, I don't know.

260
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Have to find out.

261
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,760
By the time Chris gets around to that, the Pi will have like 32 gigs of RAM.

262
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,080
I'm already planning projects for the Pi 5 boys.

263
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,080
I'm already waiting.

264
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:49,160
Soon as they announce, I'm ready to go.

265
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,080
Linode.com slash unplugged.

266
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,320
That's where you go to get $100 in 60-day credit and you can go there to support the

267
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
show.

268
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,120
Linode is easy, accessible, affordable cloud hosting and you get that $100, you can really

269
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,080
try it out and see why we rave about Linode, why we have for years.

270
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,880
Linode is how we run everything including our new website that we've built recently

271
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,320
and it's in part because of the great performance.

272
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,360
I mean, that's an absolute minimum line for me.

273
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,120
It's got to meet Linode's level of performance now if I'm ever going to switch away which

274
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,480
just honestly nobody does.

275
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,660
They got 11 data centers around the world.

276
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,080
They're constantly investing in their infrastructure, improving the hardware instead of just like,

277
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,960
you know, coasting like some companies do and then milking that hardware for like 10

278
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,360
years and charging you the same thing.

279
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,480
They're charging you the same great price which is 30% to 50% cheaper than the major

280
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,160
hyperscalers out there and just behind the scenes, they're constantly upgrading things,

281
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,920
making things better both on the hardware side but on the UI interface side too.

282
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,660
They just introduced a brand new marketplace interface.

283
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,360
That's what they call their one-click application deployment screen, their marketplace.

284
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,560
You don't really buy these things.

285
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,840
I mean, they're open source free software.

286
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,600
In fact, sometimes I go there and I just look at some of the different projects and see

287
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,360
what I want to play around with for the evening and they've made that even easier now because

288
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,340
they now highlight the new applications that have been added to the marketplace and they're

289
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,520
adding more than ever now.

290
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,040
So that's a really cool tool and honestly, it's all really cool.

291
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,120
That's what I love about Linode's interface and not only are they always upgrading the

292
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,680
hardware and the infrastructure but they're also upgrading the user interface, the front

293
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,080
end and they've just recently introduced their new Linode marketplace interface which is

294
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,400
what they call their front end to let you see the different projects that you can just

295
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,840
one-click deploy on the Linode infrastructure.

296
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,960
They're always adding new stuff but they made it even easier now.

297
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,080
They have a filter on just the new apps and I go there and I look at that and I think,

298
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,720
all right, let's check it out.

299
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,000
And I found myself just discovering and tinkering around with new cool free software projects.

300
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's the best.

301
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,960
I love it when they add features like that.

302
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,700
Just incrementally making it better all the time.

303
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,640
That's why they've survived nearly 19 years in this business without VC funding, without

304
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,140
raising crazy loans but just by making a great product and selling it.

305
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,100
And on top of that, you get some of the best support in the business.

306
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,840
You get full Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible support and you also get something that's

307
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,880
30% to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there.

308
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,840
That's a big deal when you combine that with the support and it's a great way to support

309
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,140
the show.

310
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,140
Go try it out.

311
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,720
See why we've been building our future infrastructure on Linode and why I think you will too for

312
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,220
yourself or for your business, linode.com slash unplugged.

313
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,320
One more time to support the show, it's linode.com slash unplugged.

314
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,920
All right, Wes brought the vacuum so it's time to clean up a little bit around here.

315
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,800
So thanks to our generous audience, Brent's tank was fueled with sats.

316
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Thank you.

317
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,800
And he took a really cool route out here.

318
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,080
Yeah, I think we should share that route actually.

319
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
Yeah.

320
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Yeah.

321
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,320
I just wouldn't take it at night or when it's raining.

322
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,480
Well it was only partly at night and only partly raining in the mountains.

323
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,180
But the most treacherous part was at night.

324
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,520
We do tell a little story in Office Hours 12 of that adventure that I think is probably

325
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
worth hearing.

326
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
I don't know if you caught it, Wes.

327
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
I did.

328
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,520
All right.

329
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,520
If you had, we'd have to tell you.

330
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
Yeah.

331
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,700
Also, we had a little surprise outage that left Wes and I scrambling after we launched

332
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,280
the website and we talk about that in Office Hours 12 as well.

333
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Yep.

334
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
All good though.

335
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,340
All fixed up now.

336
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,760
Those West Coast meetups are coming up.

337
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,960
Our first one is on the 20th, which is two days from now as we record.

338
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,120
How is that going to work?

339
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,760
I'm going to be in Southern Oregon in two days.

340
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,280
Wrap your mind around that.

341
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,360
Especially that's tricky considering I'm going to be recording Coder right here in the studio

342
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
on Monday.

343
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,520
At this point, two shows to go.

344
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
Yeah.

345
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
Yeah.

346
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
But the meetups are logged in.

347
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,840
Details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

348
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,480
Turned out we're doing a West Coast brewery tour.

349
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,440
All of the meetups are at really great brewery locations that can accommodate us and feed

350
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,700
us and supply us with beverage.

351
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,400
We'd love to have you there, but do sign up so we know.

352
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,680
And it's getting down to the final moment, meetup.com slash Uber broadcasting.

353
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,520
If you need any deets, you want to figure out like carpool and stuff like that, bit.ly

354
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,040
slash West Coast crew is the chat room for that.

355
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,720
And we'll spin up other regions we have.

356
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,840
There's actually a whole bunch of regions already, but we'll spin up more regions as

357
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,880
the meetups extend out.

358
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,960
So do get yourself a Matrix client.

359
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,960
It'll be coming up soon.

360
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:35,760
Hey, we do have a couple of baller boosts this week.

361
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,000
The biggest boost that come into the show we read early and John A comes in for a third

362
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,640
week in a row with 50 sats, gentlemen.

363
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
How about that?

364
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
That is amazing.

365
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
You filthy animal.

366
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,440
I guess we better start dancing.

367
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
Yeah.

368
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,240
Can you keep the streak up?

369
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,440
Because here's the tricky thing.

370
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,240
We're prerecorded next week.

371
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Oh.

372
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,320
We're on a really solid streak right now.

373
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,680
Four episodes in a row.

374
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,440
Nobody's ever done that before.

375
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,520
So we'll see if he can pull it off.

376
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,040
I don't know how he possibly could, but we'll see.

377
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,440
He says in his boost, thank you for doing a show dedicated to all the reasons I love

378
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,240
Gnome and for validating my preferences.

379
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
Did I do that?

380
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
I thought I did the opposite.

381
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,040
You know, we have to say Nate reached out to us.

382
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,440
Nate writes the This Week in KDE blog, and he offered to come on and chat about some

383
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
of those problems.

384
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,680
Not so much as like an argument, but just kind of a back and forth to get an understanding

385
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,520
where the project's out and that stuff, and I think we're going to probably take him up

386
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
on that.

387
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,080
It's just the travel schedule and all of that, but I think that'd be a great conversation.

388
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,040
We figured we'd give a little more time for Brent to find additional bugs just to stock

389
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
up.

390
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
Well, I've got a list.

391
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,520
Oh, Brent Lee, of course you do.

392
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
It's to help.

393
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,160
Like I think that's in the name of progress, right?

394
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Sure.

395
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,160
Awesome.

396
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:58,760
I'm going to show you generously one of our baller boosts this episode with 30,000 sats.

397
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
He clipped that.

398
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,520
He says, also, I think part of the problem with the baller clip in general is that it's

399
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,240
just been one clip.

400
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,520
All the other boosts get some variety.

401
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,600
They don't get old because they largely have some variety.

402
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,680
I think there should be a small pool of baller boosts that you can pull from depending on

403
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,280
the mood and ambiance.

404
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,320
Yeah, I think we're getting that.

405
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,360
We have some really great submissions on a GitHub link that we'll put in the notes.

406
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,600
We'd like some more and the community is coming together and really, I think, coming up with

407
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
some great ones.

408
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,520
So thank you, everybody, who's contributed to that GitHub thread and thank you, Awesome

409
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Matt, for that.

410
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,060
And our last baller boost, we're very privileged.

411
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,760
We've actually gotten three baller boosts and that one came from Gene Bean with 25,000

412
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
sats.

413
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,120
I hoard that which your kind covet.

414
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,720
Brent, I'd love to see you dig into this KDE topic in a brunch with Brent, maybe that includes

415
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,120
Michael Tonnell from Tux Digital and maybe whoever hosts the KDE Corner on Late Night

416
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
Linux.

417
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,120
Ah, Phelan.

418
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Yeah.

419
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Phelan.

420
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,560
Maybe the cross section of y'all's experiences would be really interesting to hear.

421
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,900
That's a great idea.

422
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,900
Thank you.

423
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,900
Yeah, we can get that cooking.

424
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,900
We can at least get it cooking.

425
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,320
I don't know if we can get it pulled off while we're on the road.

426
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,400
That would be tricky, but we can at least get that ball rolling.

427
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,040
Nice to have projects to come home to.

428
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
True.

429
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,400
I just want to say thank you to Gene Bean.

430
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,840
He sends in a lot of high signal boosts just under like the 2K level so we have the option

431
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,680
of reading them or not.

432
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,840
And that works great for us.

433
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,340
We read them all.

434
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,680
We bring some of them to the show and I just want to say thank you to Gene Bean because

435
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
just a ton of great support.

436
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
Yep.

437
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
Thank you.

438
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,840
We really appreciate it.

439
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,760
So let's talk about how we are finally divorcing from Google Photos, a topic that has come

440
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,200
up on the show before, something we are following closely on Self Hosted.

441
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,680
There's several projects in the works like Image, something that really was finally motivated

442
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:52,080
by that story that involved Google sending over a dad's entire Google account history

443
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,320
to the police when they incorrectly identified a C-SAM flag on his Google Photos account.

444
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,600
And that was really just the, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

445
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
I've got kids.

446
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,440
I use telemedicine.

447
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,400
I've got Google Photos turned on on one of my devices.

448
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,680
Really just was the line that was too far for me.

449
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,400
And since then, I have been actively looking at ways of just getting myself off of Google

450
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
because these models only increase.

451
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,320
What they're looking for only increases.

452
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,240
The accuracy is so-so.

453
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,640
And the automatic nature and how they transferred all of that guy's information to the authorities

454
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,360
for him to review every chat, every email, every purchase.

455
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
It's gross.

456
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,680
It's also like Google Photos is less of a good deal than it once was.

457
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,040
You know, they kind of try to sucker everyone in and then change the terms, which is fair.

458
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,600
That's part of the risk of I'm going to put all my photos with you, and then you've got

459
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,760
them and can have me pay whatever you'd like.

460
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,680
It feels like the trade-off cost has shifted more and more to the negative.

461
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,000
And now the trade-offs of having a system that isn't fully managed, that doesn't essentially

462
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,040
have infinite storage, that doesn't have maybe the best machine learning discovery, the trade-offs

463
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,040
of that are worth it now, I think.

464
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,920
So we wanted to build something that pretty much anyone listening could deploy, something

465
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,120
that would run for years, that wouldn't be super expensive and would be fully backed

466
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,480
up.

467
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,680
And I'm on iOS.

468
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,000
You gentlemen are on Android.

469
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,720
We wanted something that accomplishes both.

470
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,720
I know.

471
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,600
You still won't text with me.

472
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,840
They're green, Wes.

473
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,040
They're green.

474
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,520
And if I was on Android, I have to admit this may have been slightly easier because on iOS,

475
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,240
you have the challenge of background tasks are heavily throttled, better or worse.

476
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,920
Hard to compete with the built-in, you know, Apple Photos magic, right?

477
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,400
Yeah, exactly.

478
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,680
And you don't have all of the tools.

479
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,080
Like you Android users can use SyncThing.

480
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,640
I love SyncThing.

481
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,760
SyncThing doesn't like iOS.

482
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,640
They don't want to release SyncThing for iOS.

483
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,320
Now Mobius Sync has come along.

484
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,280
I think it might have been Gamma that told me about this, which is a third-party app

485
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,680
for SyncThing that allows you to use SyncThing on iOS and other devices.

486
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,200
Wes, it is a full SyncThing instance.

487
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
I couldn't believe it.

488
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,800
Like when you install it and you run the app, it just brings up the whole SyncThing UI.

489
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,080
That's just SyncThing right there.

490
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,880
Isn't that funny?

491
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,600
And it's pretty limited in what it can get access to because iOS.

492
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,000
And there are some hacky ways you could possibly get it to look at your photos and back your

493
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,160
photos up, but it's not ideal.

494
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,880
But it would work for like, can you get access to various documents or some other, what can

495
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,880
it see?

496
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,200
It can see like its own folders, so you could put stuff in its own folders.

497
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,840
So if you wanted to sync stuff to have handy on your phone, that could work for that.

498
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,080
Yeah, that would work.

499
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
Yeah, exactly.

500
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,840
But not a great solution for what I'm looking at.

501
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,440
And so if I was on Android, maybe I would use just SyncThing.

502
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
I don't know.

503
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
I can't say.

504
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,460
But that wasn't an option for me.

505
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,360
And we got a bunch of different solutions.

506
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,240
And I tried most of them that seemed reasonable.

507
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,360
And the one that stuck, and I think Brent saw my kind of, because he's been here at

508
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,080
the studio for a few days, he saw my kind of evolution of going through these different

509
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,640
apps and finding the one that really seems stable and reliable and ran in the background

510
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,160
and supported everything I needed.

511
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,360
And that absolutely, hands down, was Photosync.

512
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,880
Photosync-app.com.

513
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,640
This is a really good piece of engineering.

514
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,280
How often have you heard me come on here and say how good an app is engineered?

515
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,360
This thing is beautiful.

516
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:40,080
Photosync will transfer to just about darn near any network protocol.

517
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,200
Whatever you got, Samba, SFTP, WebDAV, it'll work with that.

518
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
You got Nextcloud.

519
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,660
You got a Western Digital My Cloud.

520
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,640
You got TrueNAS, Open Media Vault, Seagate.

521
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
What do you got?

522
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,280
It'll support that, right?

523
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,800
It'll do just straight up file protocols that you got, or it'll work with specific services

524
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,280
that have APIs, including Photoprism.

525
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,120
It has direct support for Photoprism.

526
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,760
We'll get to that in a moment.

527
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,320
But I want to stick just for a little bit longer with Photosync because this is a really

528
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,720
impressive app.

529
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,040
This is a critical component for me, getting the photos off of my phone because that's

530
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,100
my primary device.

531
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:24,480
And Photosync has really intelligent syncing abilities, really easy to select what you

532
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,880
want and what you don't want sent up to the server, crazy easy to manage that happen automatically.

533
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,440
It works with so many different services.

534
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,600
And on top of that, and I think this is just a great feature because I actually was doing

535
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:44,340
this already, if you plug in a SD card reader to your phone and transfer your photos off

536
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,160
of your digital camera, Photosync will read those and it can sync them up to your service.

537
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,160
See, that's nice.

538
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
It's super nice, Wes.

539
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,040
It's super, super nice.

540
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,680
So yes, it has camera support, it also do Wi-Fi cameras.

541
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,880
It can connect to your Wi-Fi camera and transfer all the photos off of that.

542
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,080
It also do like a USB flash drive.

543
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,520
It has baked in Amazon S3, Backblaze and Wasabi support.

544
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,920
If you don't want to go to your own server, you just want to send it off to the cloud

545
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,440
as a backup option and you're happy with just having local photos on your phone just backed

546
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,240
up, Photosync will do that.

547
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,240
That's handy.

548
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,960
So Photosync could be basically for some people the entire solution.

549
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,920
Such a simple app is available for iOS and Android.

550
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
Really like it.

551
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,280
It does have a premium version which I haven't gone with yet.

552
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,600
Now I was going to ask you about that because it seemed like maybe you needed the premium

553
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,920
if you wanted the automatic in the background.

554
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
You got it.

555
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
Yeah.

556
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
That's the thing.

557
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
And then the models are a little different it looks like.

558
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,640
I played a little bit with Photosync and I tried some other software just to mix it

559
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
up here.

560
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,860
But you have the premium version on iOS and then on Android there's various sort of extensions

561
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,860
you can get.

562
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,000
You can get a pack if you just need a little bit more protocols or you can get like a sort

563
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,800
of premium equivalent pack that has all the standard extensions built in.

564
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Yeah.

565
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,200
It's a little confusing.

566
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,240
Maybe a little bit better of a deal on the Android side.

567
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
It does seem that way.

568
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Yeah.

569
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:04,320
But I'm cool with the premium version because that automatic backup is big for me.

570
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,600
And it also feels like the kind of project you want to support and keep it around because

571
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,920
you want to just use it for years.

572
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
Right.

573
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
You want to keep them.

574
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
I'm not going to stop taking photos.

575
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
If anything it goes the opposite.

576
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Yeah.

577
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,920
Only more.

578
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,920
Right.

579
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,200
So it's like a large ProRes video and 4K video and stuff like that.

580
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,480
And it handles all of that.

581
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,680
I also simulated like I crashed the app.

582
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,600
I forced closed the app mid-transfer.

583
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,040
I put the phone to sleep.

584
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Yeah.

585
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
You got a phone call during one of your transfers.

586
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,600
I got a phone call which canceled the transfer and made sure that every time I opened it

587
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,560
up it just figured out what it needed to do, finished it up and it didn't have any weird

588
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,600
like orphan files on the server or anything like that.

589
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,480
So really got the solid confidence in Photosync to use it as my daily backup solution to get

590
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,600
the photos off of my phone.

591
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,320
There is like a companion app for the commercial OSs.

592
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,400
I don't know what that does.

593
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Maybe it backs up the photos.

594
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Yeah.

595
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,440
I think it does allow you if you put the SD card on your Mac desktop or whatever.

596
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
Okay.

597
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
All right.

598
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
Yeah.

599
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
That'd be really nice too I suppose.

600
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,400
So then you have the whole matter of how do you display your photos?

601
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,160
How do you search your photos?

602
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,640
How do you collect them?

603
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,880
Yeah, because right now you could just go to photos.google.com and everything's there.

604
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
Search for RV.

605
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
The RV shows up.

606
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,600
I do that kind of crap on the stream all the time.

607
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,200
Or when I'm making like a home video, Dylan Christmas tree and boom, it shows up Dylan

608
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,080
with a Christmas tree.

609
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,560
And because you've had those features available, you're not necessarily, I mean sure you build

610
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,180
some albums, but you can kind of rely on just if I need to find something by theme, it's

611
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,880
auto done that for me.

612
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
Totally.

613
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
That is so true.

614
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,440
It's a little lazy, but I just don't have time to sit there and go through all the photos.

615
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,160
The amount of photos and stuff, I don't, right?

616
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,600
You take it and you forget it.

617
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,880
So PhotoPrism comes in and we've talked about PhotoPrism before and I'm going to talk about

618
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,240
it now because it's gotten a lot better since we've talked about it.

619
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,640
It is an AI powered photos app, which they say is for the decentralized web.

620
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
All right.

621
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,640
Talking my language.

622
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,160
It makes use of the latest technologies to tag and find your pictures automatically in

623
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,980
the background.

624
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,480
You could even run it on a Raspberry Pi.

625
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,640
It's going to be a little slow, but you could run it on a Raspberry Pi and it will do face

626
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
detection.

627
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,920
It'll classify pictures based on their content and location.

628
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:25,600
It can identify animals, but one of the things that I really want in an app like this is

629
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,840
I want to discover old memories.

630
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,720
I want to be reminded about things.

631
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:37,960
I want to see things and I really enjoy just the process of browsing through PhotoPrism

632
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,980
and remembering moments.

633
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:47,320
One of the ways they do that is they have the map interface and they'll show you where

634
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,480
you've taken various photos in different places and I can go in and I can look at some of

635
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,240
our favorite Montana moments and be like, oh yeah, that was great when we went there.

636
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,720
Or Brent and I were planning to take a little bit of the coast on the road trip and we'll

637
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,600
look, here's the first photo of JOOPS on my very first road trip when we took the coast.

638
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,720
I was like, oh yeah, boy, how much have we learned?

639
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,640
It's just re-experiencing those photos because otherwise they just sit there and they do

640
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
nothing.

641
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,120
Last of time.

642
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,340
And PhotoPrism is really good.

643
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,280
The other thing it does at helping you discover them is it has this thing called labels and

644
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,720
it automatically categorizes the pictures.

645
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,660
Like here's an aircraft.

646
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,440
These are the pictures when Listener Mike took us up for a ride in Denver when we went

647
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,400
on the Denver road trip and here's a video because it also works on video, right?

648
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:41,320
There's a video of that moment of us walking out on the tarmac to go ride in Listener Mike's

649
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,320
airplane.

650
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,120
And what an incredible memory that was and it just automatically tagged that.

651
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,680
I didn't have to do that.

652
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,880
There's a tag for Levi, I think, as well, I spent a lot of time in that one.

653
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,160
Yeah, there's a tag for Beach.

654
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,240
There's a tag for Camper or something, whatever they call JOOPS.

655
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,400
Isn't that the European term for it?

656
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Yeah.

657
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,840
Levi tag automatically just finds all these great photos.

658
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,880
When you hover over the photos, if they're a live photo, it'll automatically animate

659
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
them.

660
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,760
I kind of witnessed you going through this memory palace, let's call it, when you were

661
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,320
first setting this up and not everything was loaded yet because it was just really fresh.

662
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,520
Yeah, still classifying.

663
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:28,640
I can say confidently that, yes, this photo prism did it for you because we sat there

664
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,280
for maybe, what was it, like 15 minutes just going through a bunch of memories and like,

665
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,280
oh yeah, check out when we were at the coast and this is one of our favorite camp spots

666
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,720
and we spent that quality time, just you and I going through those memories.

667
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,720
I can imagine when you sit down with your family and do the same thing, how really great

668
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
that will be.

669
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Yeah.

670
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,960
Photoprism just makes it easy to have that experience, to casually do it because the

671
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:56,400
Photosync software is sending them up via web dev, really, in the backend to Photoprism,

672
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,840
but it's pinging its API, so somehow, maybe it's file system events, maybe it's an API

673
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
event.

674
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,280
The Photoprism is immediately aware of the moment a photo lands.

675
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,800
See, that's a nice little test, right?

676
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,520
How long is it from, take it on your app, take it on your phone and it actually makes

677
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
it all the way into here.

678
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,440
Right, because you want to look at it sometimes right away.

679
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,400
I ran it in verbose mode, the server in verbose mode for a couple of days just so I could

680
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,560
see what it was doing on the backend and it'll go through everything, it'll process everything

681
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,520
and then the last thing it does when it's all done is then it does the face analysis

682
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:31,000
and you can see it light the cores up, man, it really does.

683
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,240
It cooks that thing for a bit, but it rips through it much faster.

684
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,280
I don't have like a coral accelerator or anything like that.

685
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,720
I'm just doing it right on the old CPU and it's working pretty quick.

686
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,720
So it's a great experience in just using it day to day and it's just staying on top of

687
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,560
your photos and I've been checking it throughout the weeks to make sure that it's captured

688
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,520
everything that I've taken and they're all in there.

689
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,720
It's all working just as expected.

690
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,200
One thing I noticed, Chris, that you may not have is I noticed that there were some raw

691
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,220
photos from, I believe it was your phone, I think they were Apple Raw format and those

692
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,240
just came out as white, just white squares.

693
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
Did you notice that?

694
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,640
Yeah, that is actually Alex's Canon R6.

695
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,700
And I don't know why.

696
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,820
There is a premium version, a membership version of Photo Prism, but it doesn't give you any

697
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,820
more formats.

698
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,800
Well, I know from my work in professional photography stuff that sometimes those raw

699
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,080
formats are really tricky, especially for open source projects.

700
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,480
I mean, there's a lot of work that has gone into that, like dark table and raw therapy

701
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,480
and stuff.

702
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,100
They've kind of reverse engineered a lot of those formats, but it's possible that maybe

703
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,860
either the software hasn't tapped into those resources yet or that it just hasn't been

704
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,860
reverse engineered.

705
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,300
I mean, I don't think Alex would be able to tell us because I think he's still using some

706
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,120
of the big software, let's just call it.

707
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,560
And the truth is Google Photos didn't have that problem.

708
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:59,620
I didn't even know those were a special format until I imported the originals of everything

709
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,620
when I was doing this.

710
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:05,360
I went back and got the originals of everything and so I just threw it all up there and discovered

711
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,400
some of that was different formats and it handled everything but those.

712
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,800
Now Chris, I wondered, did you try going through the exercise of exporting from Google Photos

713
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,940
and importing it into here?

714
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,240
Because I would imagine that's a workflow that would be pretty common if you're trying

715
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,640
to switch from one to the other.

716
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,200
No, because I have the originals still and Google Photos was just my backup.

717
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,480
That'd be an interesting experiment.

718
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,640
I have in the past done that with some other apps and it's doable.

719
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,160
It's a big download.

720
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,240
For Photoprism itself, they recommend two cores for your CPU, at least three gigs of

721
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:41,480
RAM and a 64-bit operating system to get all of the face finding and stuff like that and

722
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,880
the automatic classifications.

723
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,720
And I'll link in the notes a demo they have.

724
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,440
They have a demo app too of their classification support and they give you an idea of the range

725
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,080
from animals to cars to pieces of land.

726
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,680
It has this thing called moments too and I don't know what it's doing but it's a moment

727
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,840
that it thinks is something special to you or something like that and it's actually really

728
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,840
nice and it was a surprising label that I had no idea what it did but then I started

729
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,360
looking and I like all of them.

730
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,040
They have fantastic documentation, really good docs to getting all of this set up.

731
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,960
They support some external sharing, it's hit and miss.

732
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,440
They'll let you share to Twitter and Instagram but Purple Dog using Breeze boosted in with

733
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,240
a row of ducks and I agree, he says, the thing I'm missing is I want to be able to share

734
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,800
an album and it doesn't really support that.

735
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,800
I agree the sharing support is not a big aspect for me but it is not as strong as I would

736
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,960
like it with Photoprism.

737
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,520
But the free version that I am using, the community edition, includes nearly everything

738
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,840
except for vector image support and you get simple maps instead of like fancy, really

739
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,600
accurate maps.

740
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,160
And hardware transcoding for the videos is limited to the paid version, wasn't an issue

741
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,160
for me though.

742
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,780
And private support chat is limited to the membered version.

743
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,780
That's reasonable.

744
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,600
Otherwise, it's pretty much everything.

745
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:05,640
I did notice, I think as a photographer anyways or someone who has a fancier camera and likes

746
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:11,640
to do some extra editing on the side, you need to keep in mind that Photoprism is basically

747
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,480
a really nice viewing suite.

748
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,200
It doesn't do any editing capabilities, you know, if you want to crop a photo or anything.

749
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,920
I at least haven't found that yet, I've been poking around, not extensively, but I haven't

750
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
found that anywhere.

751
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,920
So I think that is something maybe that'll come in the future.

752
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,320
Some simple editing tools might be nice if you want to, you know, edit something quickly

753
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,000
there and then export it and share it with some family or something, but that's something

754
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
to keep in mind.

755
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,960
I got an idea for that.

756
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,080
I haven't done this part yet, but this is like my to-do when I get back.

757
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,360
I don't see any reason.

758
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,640
I couldn't point SyncThing at the Photoprism libraries because they're just folders on

759
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:54,960
my hard drive and use SyncThing in send-only mode from the server if I want and receive-only

760
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
mode on the client.

761
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,680
So you could have just a mirrored copy on your workstation using SyncThing or you could

762
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,900
do it in send and receive mode and in theory, it would actually work fine if you made an

763
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:12,520
edit on your workstation and then use SyncThing to sync that back to the Photoprism directory.

764
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,520
I think since Photoprism is just reading from the file system, I think it'd be fine.

765
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,740
And that might be a really, if as long as you had enough local storage to have a copy

766
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,040
of your entire photo database or maybe a subfolder, then you could essentially just open them

767
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,760
up and whatever editing app you like, it'd be a local file, you'd make the changes you

768
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,680
want, you hit save and then SyncThing would send it back up to Photoprism, Photoprism

769
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,240
would re-index it and it would be available to you.

770
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,520
So I'm going to experiment with that further, but that's how I'm planning to address that.

771
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,520
If anybody out there has tried something like that, please let me know.

772
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,040
It would also be interesting in that vein to know if you have some XMP files or something

773
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,360
for your raw format, if it keeps track of those, that would be actually kind of amazing.

774
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,680
Somebody with some experience out there, let us know.

775
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,360
We'll find out eventually though.

776
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
So that's okay.

777
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,280
So we're getting it off our device.

778
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,840
You could use Photosync to get it off your digital camera.

779
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,640
You could use Photosync to get it off of your phone.

780
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
There's other tools out there.

781
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,440
I really like Photosync and also Photoprism recommends Photosync as well.

782
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,680
We'll have links to this in the show notes.

783
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,320
We're using Photoprism to view it, search it, categorize it.

784
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,000
How do we back it up?

785
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,640
And I got a lot of photos.

786
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:27,680
I got a lot of photos and I'm looking to save a buck, but I want them protected.

787
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,160
So I needed an edge.

788
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,580
I needed something a little different because everything out there wasn't going to work

789
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,580
for me.

790
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,640
I mean, I'll consider others.

791
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,140
I'm not completely sold on this, but it sounds pretty amazing.

792
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,160
It's called storage.

793
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,760
They build themselves as fast, secure, decentralized cloud storage.

794
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,800
They also call themselves a web three company.

795
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
So red flag.

796
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Danger.

797
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,840
I'm not sold yet.

798
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,840
Go on.

799
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,060
I found out about them through IX Systems, who has announced integration with TrueNAS.

800
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,860
So they seem to think it's legitimate.

801
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,220
So that raised it up a little notch in my book.

802
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:09,760
They call themselves the first open source decentralized cloud storage layer that's private

803
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,240
by design and secure by default.

804
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,880
They say when an object is uploaded into the storage DCS, it is encrypted, split up into

805
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:24,280
80 or more pieces and distributed across thousands of diverse nodes and ISPs in nearly a hundred

806
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
different countries.

807
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,680
There's no single point of failure or centralized location, so there's no outages, downtime

808
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,320
or bit rot.

809
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,940
Failure doesn't affect you and data breaches are virtually impossible.

810
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,660
The node goes offline for any reason.

811
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:40,360
Your file can be reconstituted from just 29 of its distributed pieces.

812
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,000
I do have a link that has a video that explains how it all works.

813
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,800
I don't know, guys.

814
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,320
I mean, it sounds almost too good to be true when it comes to storage.

815
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,400
It is usually too good to be true if it sounds like it.

816
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,160
But what they're essentially doing is they have a plan that anybody can participate in.

817
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,440
Maybe this is the web three part.

818
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,500
I don't know.

819
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,120
And you can essentially somehow get into this program and allocate some of your data center

820
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,640
storage to their network or something like that.

821
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:13,080
I've genuinely tried to get to the bottom of how it can be so cheap and I am still a

822
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,080
little unsure.

823
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,440
But here's the pricing.

824
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,080
The free plan, which I'm currently using, which I'll have to upgrade from, is you get

825
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,200
150 gigs of S3 compatible object storage for free.

826
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,280
It's pretty good.

827
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,880
Then after that, you get a pro plan.

828
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,640
The pro plan still includes 150 gigs for free.

829
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,520
And then it's $4 a terabyte after that, which is a really good price.

830
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,880
And a $7 a terabyte transfer rate.

831
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,000
That is way lower than just about anywhere else I can find.

832
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,360
And it also claims to be fully encrypted and fully distributed.

833
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,240
And it claims to be all open source.

834
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,440
And I can verify this at least, it is fully S3 compatible.

835
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,480
It's just too good not to try.

836
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,040
I don't know anything else about storage.

837
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,540
I always go into low cost storage extremely skeptical.

838
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,720
But if it's true that they really are distributing it like this and they're splitting it up like

839
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,000
this and they're encrypting it by default like this.

840
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,600
And you're going to test it for us on the show with it being the sole backup of all

841
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
your photos.

842
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
I'm doing it right now.

843
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
Here we go, buddy.

844
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,160
Well, I'm also that's why I'm going to sync thing it to my workstation and stuff.

845
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,320
So I mean, I'm not crazy.

846
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,320
But I haven't set that up yet.

847
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,240
So currently it is the way I'm doing it.

848
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,920
And here is the beauty thing about storage.

849
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,680
It's S-T-O-R-J, by the way.

850
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,520
But here's the great thing about it.

851
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:38,320
My backup app of choice that I've already using to back up all my server configs and

852
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:44,240
all my Docker composes Duplicati has built in support for storage.

853
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,240
Is that right?

854
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,240
Yeah.

855
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,440
And Duplicati is such a great tool.

856
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,560
If you haven't checked it out, it's really easy to get going.

857
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,480
It supports a ton of cloud storage options.

858
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,000
It'll do local AES encryption first.

859
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,200
So one of the things I do is I save my home assistant databases on Google Drive, but I

860
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,440
encrypt them completely locally with Duplicati.

861
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,320
And then Google just gets this big old encrypted tar file that just sits on Google Drive.

862
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,560
And then Duplicati can download if I ever need to restore, manage all of the encryption.

863
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,880
It is like an old school program where you actually can like browse and restore individual

864
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,480
files if you want.

865
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,760
You can get status of your backups.

866
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,000
It's really a great backup program.

867
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,400
I've been using it for years.

868
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,240
So the fact that storage support was built right in and they have docs on how to set

869
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,760
it up was so killer for me because it meant I didn't have to like learn a new backup application

870
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,880
or implement something entirely new.

871
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,760
I just added one more additional backup config to my existing application, which was brilliant.

872
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,080
And set it up, Duplicati sends all my photos up to storage.

873
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,600
It's been doing it for days.

874
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,640
It's been working great and was really easy to get going.

875
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,260
So if you have never tried Duplicati, even if you don't use storage, this could be a

876
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,720
great tool to backup.

877
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,440
You could go to Amazon S3, you could go to Dropbox, you could go to Linode's S3 object

878
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,400
storage, all kinds of services in there.

879
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,400
Really like that application.

880
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:15,600
I also noticed when I was investigating storage that they have a canary on their website.

881
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:21,280
You might have seen this with other like privacy conscious VPNs and such.

882
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,880
And the purpose, as far as I understand, is to just kind of make that canary vanish if

883
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,220
they ever get, Chris, you would understand this better, but if they ever get sort of

884
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:35,640
subpoenaed to give information that they are typically unwilling to give, but if they're

885
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,680
forced into it, then this canary will just kind of go away.

886
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,360
The situation there with the national security letters and the what nots is such that they're

887
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:48,160
not allowed to say that they've been given this order and they've disclosed information

888
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,160
to the government.

889
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,160
They can't say that.

890
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,420
They're under an embargo when they get served in NDA.

891
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,040
But when you pull a canary, you're not saying anything.

892
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,120
You're removing a statement that you had previously before.

893
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,060
So you make a statement saying we've never been served this.

894
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,360
And then when that disappears, you know that it's happened without them having to come

895
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360
out and say it.

896
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,360
That's the canary.

897
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,520
It's kind of wild that that's the world we live in.

898
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,520
Right.

899
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,880
It's a bit of a loophole, I think.

900
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,880
Thanks, George Bush.

901
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,760
Appreciate that Patriot Act.

902
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,600
So there you go.

903
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Storage has a canary.

904
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,600
It has a warrant canary, which is actually really a good thing to see.

905
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,880
And it's actually one of the best I've ever seen.

906
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,040
They include like recent news headlines in the canary just to prove the fact that the

907
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,040
date would be accurate.

908
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,360
So you can kind of do your own homework to make sure that it actually was.

909
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,280
And they do say, oh, we'll send this canary once a month, this warranty canary, and include

910
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,280
headlines and such.

911
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,560
And I thought that was really neat until I noticed that the date is from last.

912
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,020
It's actually from July.

913
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,680
And so I wonder if the canary is out or not.

914
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,680
Someone just forgot to update.

915
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,300
No, because you're supposed to pull it.

916
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,300
That's the idea.

917
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,300
Right.

918
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,300
You pull it when that's happened.

919
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,300
But yeah, I don't know.

920
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,520
If you set the expectation, you're going to update it.

921
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,000
You better keep updating it.

922
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,800
So the pro plan is you pay for what you use, essentially.

923
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,600
I haven't gotten to that tier yet.

924
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,560
I'm so skeptical on this kind of stuff, you guys.

925
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,120
But they're checking all the boxes.

926
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,760
And I felt like I wanted to get my hands on it so I could at least come on the show and

927
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,800
give you my experience in a bit.

928
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,800
So I'm trying it out.

929
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,800
This is what I'm using for my backup.

930
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,520
I really like it so far.

931
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,820
I think the pricing is ridiculous.

932
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,320
And I'm going to embrace it while I can.

933
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,840
And the fact that I can integrate it with duplicati is just a huge win for me.

934
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:33,120
Yeah, I feel like if you're doing the encryption on your side, that makes me feel a lot better.

935
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,420
Yeah, I agree.

936
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,760
That's the thing I want.

937
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,720
I want to control that encryption on my side.

938
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:43,240
I want it to require my key on the restoring side to actually decrypt that stuff.

939
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,320
So I know, Wes, that you've been digging into this too.

940
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,440
You've been solving this problem for a while.

941
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,960
Tell me what tools you've strung together.

942
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,160
Well, you know, there are a lot of different options in this space.

943
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,080
One I noticed that I'm not using but I thought was an interesting approach is called Stingle.

944
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,660
And the client is all open source.

945
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,580
But they do the hosting on the back end.

946
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,740
So it doesn't really fit with the whole self-host everything.

947
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,620
But if what you were looking for is, you know, something that is at least partially open

948
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:13,700
source but isn't sending things to Google in particular, then this might be for you.

949
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,840
The app looks quite nice.

950
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,840
It's simple.

951
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,080
You just pay, you know, for the back end hosting costs.

952
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,960
So right there, you're at least paying for what you're using.

953
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,960
Seems reasonable to me.

954
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,960
Now, I don't know anything about them.

955
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,960
I don't know.

956
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,360
Would I trust that as my sole backup of my photos?

957
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,920
Are they going to disappear at some point?

958
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,360
And can you get your photos out?

959
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,360
I'm not sure.

960
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,100
But you do have some options if you're not quite willing to take on the full load of

961
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,520
like, oh, I got to find storage for these things, and I got to make sure that my server's

962
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,000
up and the sync is going.

963
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Right.

964
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
That does sound nice.

965
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,280
And it would at least get you off of the Google threat model.

966
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,280
Right.

967
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,280
Yeah, at least there.

968
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,920
I don't think Stingle at least has as many GPUs to mine all of your data from.

969
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,920
Also a great name.

970
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,920
Exactly.

971
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
Stingle.

972
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
Stingle.

973
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,920
Yeah.

974
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,920
That's great.

975
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,920
I love it.

976
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,920
Now, you're right.

977
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,000
I have been using SyncThing for a long time to do photo sync.

978
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,240
And I mean, what can you say?

979
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,440
SyncThing really just works.

980
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,400
Like it just syncs, it keeps going.

981
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,200
I think for using it for photos can certainly work on Android pretty well.

982
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,720
You do kind of have to know and understand a bit about SyncThing, I think to feel fully

983
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,720
comfortable with it.

984
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,680
So I don't know that I would recommend that maybe for like a grandma type figure in your

985
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,960
life, especially because you might need a couple you might need to think about the model

986
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,080
you can kind of play with like, send or receive only.

987
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,400
But then if you're deleting stuff from your phone, there might there's sometimes like

988
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,280
a notification that's like, hey, just so you know, you're out of sync, you could ignore

989
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,280
that.

990
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,920
SyncThing works fine.

991
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,200
Another approach is you could just imagine it as a sort of bi directional setup all the

992
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,360
time, where you're just imagining that you're making a copy of whatever's on your phone

993
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,960
on a server somewhere, and then you have a separate sync process that sort of copies

994
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,120
from there and syncs whatever's new that shows up to your real back end folder where, you

995
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:50,560
know, whatever photo viewer your gallery is actually going to pull from.

996
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,560
So if you're comfortable with that, or let's say you already are using SyncThing, you have

997
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,800
a SyncThing network going, you have other stuff on your phone you want to sync to or

998
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,280
from, that seems like a really solid option.

999
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,120
I did look a bit at photosync, it does seem like I mean, I think that is probably what

1000
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,440
I would recommend for someone who wasn't super competent, but just wanted to suck photos

1001
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,220
off their phone because it's polished around for a long time.

1002
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,880
It's like an appliance kind of app.

1003
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,880
Yeah, exactly.

1004
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,800
But I know you were playing with that.

1005
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,680
I want to try something a little bit different.

1006
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,080
So yeah, I found low mirage.

1007
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,080
Okay.

1008
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,640
Oh, you you can give it a shot of pronouncing if you prefer lumarage.

1009
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,740
I almost think it's like something to do with lighting.

1010
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,120
I don't know.

1011
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:33,200
It is definitely not as polished, but it does have an iOS and Android app as well as actually

1012
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,880
a Windows and a Mac desktop version.

1013
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,200
I haven't tried those, no version for Linux just yet.

1014
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,560
It's pretty bare bones, but it comes with a lot of the features, not all of them as

1015
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:48,760
shiny as say PhotoPrism has, but it has a built in gallery, which also means from your

1016
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,720
phone, if you're looking at a photo, you can share it right there from the app on your

1017
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,720
phone.

1018
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,240
And it just has a little token that embeds, you can send that link.

1019
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,240
So that's pretty handy.

1020
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,240
That is.

1021
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:03,000
I should mention PhotoPrism has a progressive web app, a PWA that does work pretty good

1022
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,640
on mobile, but the sharing is still, I'm not my, I think that's its weakest area.

1023
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,960
So far I've been pretty impressed with the actual sync functionality, you know, the Android

1024
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,400
app connected right away and it held right up.

1025
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,080
I think like the full backlog of however many thousands of photos I had sitting on my phone.

1026
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,300
And then over the past week or so, it's been, you know, sucking up new ones as I go on walks

1027
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,820
with the dogs and go explore the neighborhood.

1028
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,320
It's not the easiest to configure, it's definitely not a pretty app.

1029
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,200
It's more of like a, you know, like a technical users app.

1030
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,800
But unlike the experience you get with sync thing, it's focused on photos.

1031
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,200
So like when you open the app up, it shows you all your photos right there.

1032
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,560
You can view them there and it'll tell you like, oh, you've synced this.

1033
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,240
You can configure which folders you want to sync.

1034
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,200
You could, instead of doing all of them, if you just want to sort of manually pick and

1035
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,920
choose, it makes it really easy to sync individual photos that you can just select your group.

1036
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,560
I mean, it looks like they got pretty good docs too for the server installation.

1037
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,360
I mean, look at this.

1038
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:59,680
They got Docker, they got app, they got Raspbian images, they got Unraid, Synology, OpenWRT.

1039
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,680
That's awesome.

1040
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,680
I love to see that.

1041
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,680
Yeah.

1042
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,680
It's pretty lightweight as well.

1043
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,680
So you don't need, you know, it's not super heavy.

1044
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,640
It doesn't have a ton of functionality, especially the gallery that you get on the web.

1045
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,000
Like it's not super fancy, but you can go scroll through them.

1046
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,080
You can, as I said, you can link from it.

1047
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:16,080
One downside is it doesn't seem like the client is open source.

1048
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,120
Now that doesn't seem, there's no ads, there's no, doesn't seem to be any spine that I could

1049
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,120
find.

1050
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,440
Yeah, you got to weigh that.

1051
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,560
It seems like unfortunately we're, besides anything, there's not a ton of great open

1052
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,680
source options, maybe because we do want something that's really polished and reliable.

1053
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,680
Yeah.

1054
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,600
Maybe that, maybe it just takes a lot of investment of time and so people want to make a buck

1055
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,600
off of it.

1056
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:42,280
Again, like you were saying though, it's sort of the threat of a loomerage, how are we going

1057
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,280
to say it?

1058
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,280
Loom range?

1059
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,280
Luma range?

1060
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,280
Luma rage?

1061
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,280
You got to give a shot, Brent.

1062
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,680
Oh, well, I don't know why I want to say it in French.

1063
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,680
I'd say loomerage.

1064
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,680
Luma range.

1065
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,680
Okay.

1066
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,680
All right.

1067
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,680
Been saying Lomo.

1068
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,880
Maybe they're dirty French Canadians, I don't know.

1069
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,080
But I don't think they're going to be profiling me, indexing all of my data, analyzing my

1070
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:10,320
photos for CSAM violations, and then sending my entire account history to the police automatically

1071
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,600
and then shutting my account down, including disconnecting my phone service.

1072
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:19,600
I doubt there's that risk, you know, so this is better.

1073
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,840
And it's not, it doesn't seem to have a huge team of development, but I've seen the developers

1074
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,560
active on some subreddits, the GitHub repo does have some recent commits.

1075
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,320
So it seems to be, if not the fastest project, at least a project that it's steadily adding

1076
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,480
features and continuing to be worked on.

1077
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,360
They also had a blog post from earlier in this year talking about how it works just

1078
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,720
fine with photo prism.

1079
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,360
So you know, it's a good, they sort of promote right out of the gate, like, yeah, you know,

1080
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,120
you can use this for sync, you can use it for more mix and match with whatever tools,

1081
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,720
other tools you might want to use.

1082
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,720
Well, that's a great.

1083
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,840
That could have best of both worlds right there.

1084
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,840
Very nice.

1085
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,040
I did take a look at a couple of different options on the view side, too.

1086
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:00,040
I feel like we should mention Pi Gallery, too, just because it's been around for a while

1087
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,840
and just a simple app, if all you're looking for is something that can easily display photos,

1088
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:09,120
no editing capabilities, nothing super fancy, but it has a nice snappy UI and because it's

1089
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,160
meant to run on a Pi, you know, it's easy for these things to take more resources than

1090
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,160
they should.

1091
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,160
Yeah.

1092
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,600
But this is like legit snappy, even if you've got thousands of photos or big photos.

1093
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:23,080
And what I like about this, too, is you could still use a tool like Photo Sync or Folder

1094
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:27,680
Sync or Lumrage and, you know, you move it over and you can manage it and organize it

1095
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,920
yourself on the file system and then just throw this on top of it.

1096
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,760
And it's a really simple, straightforward Raspberry Pi with a big old USB disk hanging

1097
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,800
off it problem solved kind of solution.

1098
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,880
I also like that it supports both OpenStreetMap and Mapbox.

1099
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,720
Some of the ones I checked out, they mostly just had Mapbox support, which is fine, but

1100
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,560
you need to go like register for a key and, you know, it's only free up to some amount.

1101
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,880
All reasonable, but it is nice to have sort of options there.

1102
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,160
The other two I took a look at, Photoprism seems really nice, but again, I knew you've

1103
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,240
been playing with it, so I wanted to, you know, go farther afield.

1104
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,080
I took a look at Photo View and Libre Photos.

1105
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,080
Oh, okay.

1106
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,880
I've heard of Libre Photos.

1107
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,720
Yeah, Photo View seems to be a little bit newer on the scene.

1108
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:14,420
It has some of the same aims as Photoprism, but at this point, it's just a fair bit simpler.

1109
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:18,920
It does have some autosmarts to try to build albums for you and figure out your timeline.

1110
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,000
It does have map support as well, but you do need to go set that up.

1111
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,520
That was kind of a theme here is like if you wanted some of the extras like map support,

1112
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,080
you kind of had to do that plumbing.

1113
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,360
It didn't work right out of the box, but it had no problems identifying all of my dumb

1114
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,760
selfies right out of the way.

1115
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,480
It found dog pics and it found some, I mean, kind of its own weird set of tags, which was

1116
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,480
fun.

1117
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,960
I think one it found was shrubbery.

1118
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,960
Yes.

1119
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,760
Was it pictures of shrubbery, was it accurate?

1120
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,760
Yeah.

1121
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,760
Well, there you go.

1122
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,760
Not a shrubbery.

1123
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:53,160
And then Libre Photos, a little fancier, not quite up to the level of Photoprism, but it's

1124
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,000
got things like a place tree, it can do word clouds, it has a timeline, it has a social

1125
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,680
graph, and also kind of looks for face clusters in the data.

1126
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,560
They've also got a nice little sharing functionality built right in that has a concept of public

1127
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,560
photos.

1128
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,200
So you can mark some photos as public if you're just like maybe you're trying to, you know,

1129
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,240
want to display some of the stuff that you don't mind the public world seeing.

1130
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,240
Does it spin up a web server for people to view them?

1131
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,240
Yeah.

1132
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,440
And you can just link to it from the web server that it's got.

1133
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,660
And then you can share stuff between different users.

1134
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,660
That's one thing.

1135
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,800
Both of these support having different users on the server, which is nice.

1136
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,680
So if you did want to have maybe, you know, just a gallery that you didn't share with

1137
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,400
the wider world, but you had some friends that you go on trips with, or you have some

1138
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,560
family that are all using the same system.

1139
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,760
Occasional things like family events and whatnot.

1140
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,760
Totally.

1141
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,760
Right.

1142
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,840
So you can give them a sort of internal access to it without having to worry about the whole

1143
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,960
world having access.

1144
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,960
That's a really nice feature.

1145
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,580
I like that a lot.

1146
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,000
That's the kind of sharing stuff I'd love to see come to Photo Prism.

1147
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,400
I don't know if I want it in a web server locally.

1148
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,180
I know they do offer some cloud stuff.

1149
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:54,280
They may offer some cloud sharing with the membership program, but that sounds like what

1150
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,840
you just described there sounds really great.

1151
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,040
And that's Libre Photos that does that.

1152
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,520
Now one other piece that I'm kind of watching for you, I can't you can't easily try it out

1153
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:08,740
yet is I found a Libre Photos Android client looks pretty modern.

1154
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:12,280
So modern that it's actually in private beta right now.

1155
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,020
So I haven't actually tried it, but it looks really nice.

1156
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,160
It's trying to add that mobile front component to it.

1157
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,160
Right.

1158
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,800
So it's trying to compete a little bit more with Google Photos, have a really rich client

1159
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,400
right there on the device and then handle the syncing for you if you want a little more

1160
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,160
fully baked together platform experience.

1161
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,420
Image IMMCH or something like that is doing something similar.

1162
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,440
That's when we're watching closely on self-hosted.

1163
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,580
This is a category like I mentioned that self-hosted tracks because I think going through this

1164
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:42,280
looking at what you found and looking at the tooling and hearing Brent's thoughts about

1165
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,800
Photo Prism where I'm at right now is it's there.

1166
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,800
The tooling is there.

1167
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,500
The capability is there.

1168
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,520
It is absolutely totally possible to replace Google Photos now.

1169
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,840
It's just up to people to decide if they want to do it or not.

1170
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,200
It's absolutely a doable thing.

1171
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,800
It's totally manageable even for people that are really busy because a lot of this is you

1172
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,600
set it up, you get the plumbing done once and then it's just going to run.

1173
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,240
I really like these selections.

1174
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,480
Uhura Photos is what it's called.

1175
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,840
Uhura Photos is the Libre Photos client app for Android that's under development and the

1176
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,640
UI is very similar to Google Photos.

1177
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,920
I think this is one Android user should definitely keep an eye on.

1178
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,760
That looks really good Wes.

1179
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:28,960
And with all these you know if you've just got photos in some folders all of these were

1180
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,960
friendly with that.

1181
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,520
Like they didn't necessarily need to have their own proprietary database.

1182
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,020
They would build that on top.

1183
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,360
Now you might want a solution down the road to help you organize things but I think that

1184
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,820
was nice because I didn't feel locked in to the you know I could I had all of them stand

1185
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:46,860
up on top of my synced data with the low mirage so I didn't have to you know I could try them

1186
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:47,860
all out easily.

1187
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:51,040
I didn't have to like migrate things between them or worry that one of them was going to

1188
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,260
muck up the structure and then the other one could no longer read it so that was handy.

1189
00:56:55,260 --> 00:57:00,160
As for backing things up, low mirage did have an interesting I think they're kind of imagining

1190
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,160
you're doing this at home.

1191
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,200
You're syncing things to your house.

1192
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,620
So they've got this concept of a backup drive so it's got a primary target that it's going

1193
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:10,920
to stick things to and if that fills up or is unavailable you can configure it with an

1194
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,920
automatic backup.

1195
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,540
So I thought that could be handy maybe if you want to stick things on some spendier

1196
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:17,800
cloud storage that you've got mounted but you don't always want things so you could

1197
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,480
have S3 at home you know you could have it dumped S3 if you've run out of stuff at home

1198
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,000
if you're worried about that but not always have things on there.

1199
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,160
I was lazy though so I just started with S3 or S3 compatible storage right from the get

1200
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,160
go.

1201
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:35,520
You know S3FS has an option you can supply your own key if you want to have things encrypted

1202
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,040
on the back end using the key that you provide.

1203
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,080
So that's a real low you know you don't have to worry about extra programs if you just

1204
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:45,100
want to use S3FS have it mount that storage and then you know the containers underneath

1205
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,000
are none the wiser.

1206
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
That's a great idea.

1207
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,280
That's sneaky and performance is fine for what you're doing.

1208
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,280
Yeah it was totally fine.

1209
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,280
That's good.

1210
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:56,120
Now one question I've kind of been having and I haven't totally resolved.

1211
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:02,080
Do I want all of my photos hot forever or am I willing to set some horizon somewhere

1212
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,360
where I'm like willing to transfer those to something else.

1213
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:10,320
I don't always you know that could be in something like Amazon's glacier maybe or if you got

1214
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,320
your own tape backups.

1215
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,320
I don't know.

1216
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,320
I could see a work case for that.

1217
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,200
That would be one workflow I haven't fully thought through yet is like do I want to put

1218
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,320
stuff in longer term storage that I just don't need access to if it's over 10 years old say

1219
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,320
or.

1220
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,280
I feel like for my use case I want all of them online so that I can use that location

1221
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,880
thing that shows all the photos you took in this place or all the faces of the kids.

1222
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,880
Right.

1223
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,080
So you want the whole history but not everybody has those use cases.

1224
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:40,720
I could definitely see especially if there was a way to do a low res JPEG preview of

1225
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,480
the image and then store the really big version like on that glacier that'd be really nice

1226
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,480
wouldn't it.

1227
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,480
Yeah.

1228
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,360
Something you know like OK I can at least check to see if I want to go pull the full

1229
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,840
thing without getting in for it to go find it.

1230
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,400
Yeah I could see that.

1231
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,480
Maybe people out there doing something like that.

1232
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,640
For now I think I'm taking your route though I'm just gonna I'm just gonna pay for the

1233
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,520
photos I take and so be it.

1234
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,280
Well we got a lot of great links in the notes today.

1235
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:08,080
There is some really good resources in there and of course we haven't touched on every

1236
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,960
possible permutation or setup.

1237
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,420
So yeah you know in the past I'd used I just see Matrix folks talking about this I had

1238
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:17,000
used Nextcloud to do photo sync and that was all right.

1239
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,280
I found it to be annoying in some of the particulars of the weird photo formats.

1240
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:28,920
So I would take one of those you know fancy fake bokeh type portrait mode photos and it

1241
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,320
worked fine but each one of those would make a little folder on the Android disk on the

1242
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:36,120
file system and then Nextcloud would tell me it discovered a new photo or new folder

1243
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,640
oh it's going to sync that for you.

1244
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,640
Yeah.

1245
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,640
I don't ever need to see it.

1246
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,320
So in the particulars I was less pleased.

1247
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,040
Yeah I mean if Nextcloud's working for folks then you know you could take out Lumarager

1248
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:51,160
or sync thing or photo sync in my case and you could just use that.

1249
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,660
For me Nextcloud's just way more than I want for this whole pipeline.

1250
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,720
I don't want this I don't want it involved.

1251
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,840
I just don't want it and I would still throw a Photo Prism on top of it anyways.

1252
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,480
But and it's harder to do because Nextcloud's got you know it's mapped all the files through

1253
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,640
its database most of the time.

1254
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,960
True but you know if it was working for you it was one that got sent in a lot.

1255
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,520
We got a ton of great ideas and setups that helped us tinker with different stuff and

1256
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,240
try different tools.

1257
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,980
So thank you everybody who sent in your emails and gave us ideas and inspirations and we'd

1258
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:23,320
love to keep hearing them and of course the boosts are welcome as well.

1259
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,320
I think though for us this is our working setup.

1260
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:30,400
I can safely say I'm done with Google Photos and now I just got to actually take the next

1261
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:37,440
step and go on there and tell it to delete all my data.

1262
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,720
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1263
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,600
Go get started with a free trial for a team or an enterprise or yourself as an individual

1264
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,720
at Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1265
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,960
Bitwarden is simply the easiest way for yourself or your business to store share and sync your

1266
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,200
sensitive data.

1267
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,760
I love that Bitwarden can be customizable you can turn certain features on and off in

1268
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,080
the enterprise that you don't want with policies or as just a user yourself.

1269
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,260
And of course Bitwarden being open source and the fact that it's trusted by millions

1270
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,640
in the community gives me confidence.

1271
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,540
I know that even way way down the road I'm gonna have access to my passwords.

1272
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:15,120
It's what Wes and I use to manage our passwords and also other sensitive data too like two

1273
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:20,400
factor codes some passphrases for some of my apps like matrix and Bitwarden just keeps

1274
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,800
getting better all the time so they make these reads really easy because it's great to see

1275
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:29,260
them add fast mail alias generation now.

1276
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:35,120
Picture it Sicily 1984 you're creating your first online service you're logging in for

1277
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:40,200
the very first time you want to make a complicated password you make it like oh this is a good

1278
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:46,200
password you write it down you come up with your clever clever username oh it's a good

1279
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:51,640
one and you write it down and you sign up you fast forward now it's 2022 you're still

1280
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:55,600
using that same username you still using that same password or you have used it in a lot

1281
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,520
of places that's no good.

1282
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,320
You know it I know it the whole internet knows it everybody knows it has probably been leaked

1283
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,140
more than a dozen times.

1284
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:09,800
Now with Bitwarden you can generate a unique username a unique password and a unique email

1285
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:15,360
address that's only to that site to that service so if anything goes sideways you know exactly

1286
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:21,080
where it came from but also you know you're only compromised just in that one unique set

1287
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:27,080
of credentials everything else is safe nothing feels better than that when that situation

1288
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:31,920
happens nothing feels better than that it is so great and of course Bitwarden is always

1289
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:39,660
adding new features both to the browser extension to the mobile app even to the desktop apps

1290
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:45,780
go check out Bitwarden at bitwarden.com slash Linux see why we like it so much and then

1291
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:54,200
if you know someone out there who is not practicing safe passwords maybe point them to that URL

1292
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,420
get them on board it's probably the number one thing they could do to improve their online

1293
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:03,120
security if they're not doing that right now come on bitwarden.com slash Linux let's all

1294
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:08,120
go over there help out family or friends or workplace or I don't know a stranger on the

1295
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:15,920
corner everybody could use better passwords bitwarden.com slash Linux

1296
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,540
I did want to say thank you to the listeners for sending in some great feedback we got

1297
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:25,320
a lot of suggestions on which photo applications to try so thank you for sending all of those

1298
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:32,360
in Bob did write in about CASA OS hey guys what do you think about CASA OS looks interesting

1299
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:39,080
to me but I'm just a noob I want something to run on my Pi 3b plus just doing document

1300
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:45,080
mp3 and photo sharing mainly what do you think community-based open source software focused

1301
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:50,280
on delivering simple home cloud experience around a docker ecosystem it's a project that's

1302
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:56,000
focused on like leading with the best dashboard the prettiest dashboard yeah that's clearly

1303
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:03,960
their focus none of us have used it but it's it's that kind of typical Linux system with

1304
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:09,460
a docker plumbing underneath these seem to be really solid and popular but I think each

1305
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:15,840
has to be evaluated on their own and you know I really like umbral and they've just added

1306
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:21,080
a bunch of really great stuff but there's these projects are all still really early

1307
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:25,960
days and some of them have some security considerations and whatnot hey you know CASA OS has photo

1308
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:31,680
developers I was just gonna say that that was totally unintentional but very very nice

1309
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:36,320
it also works with looks like it makes home assistant easy to deploy you know these can

1310
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,800
be really compelling the thing that's tricky is like home assistant also wants to do this

1311
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:45,400
job where it wants to be your applications platform everyone wants to manage your apps

1312
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,840
so it's getting to the point where there's almost too many of these but I CASA does I

1313
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:52,120
have to say look like a decent one just going through their website but I definitely have

1314
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,880
to try it to know and it does seem like an area that's that's useful at least if we want

1315
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,200
broader adoption of some of these stuff right we might be comfortable spending a day or

1316
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,040
two getting you know figuring out oh this project has docker commands but I gotta put

1317
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,640
that a compose file or they have instructions for the base OS but that's fine I know I can

1318
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:10,600
just stick it over here or let me go find and vet an image that someone else has built

1319
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:15,480
for this but what are you gonna do if you want you know some of your friends who want

1320
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,800
to take over some of their self-control but they have less skills you know I was trying

1321
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,600
to figure out if we had talked about this on the network previously and I did a little

1322
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:28,520
search at notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com and I think it's important to note that you shouldn't

1323
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:34,720
get confused between CASA OS and Nooboo CASA which I was like oh yeah we've definitely

1324
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,260
talked about that but they're two distinct things yeah Nooboo CASA is the company behind

1325
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:47,560
Home Assistant and CASA OS is a Linux distro based server platform I guess a friend of

1326
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:52,160
the show wrote in as well regarding the conversations we've been having recently about malware on

1327
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:59,080
Linux and how to protect yourself they write I run hundreds of servers many with well-known

1328
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:06,400
public IPs IPs from decades-old running class a networks yeah those class A's oh fun I have

1329
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:11,160
some straightforward suggestions that have kept my public facing bits from getting owned

1330
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:18,240
okay I'd be happy to elaborate but basically number one failed to ban failed to ban everywhere

1331
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:25,680
number two SSH D config with a permit root without password so that means to only allow

1332
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:34,840
root SSH logins when using private keys and number three OS sec and was a or other log

1333
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:40,000
reading aggregators for when you miss things I've been told that many people turn off se

1334
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,160
Linux on their servers during the kickstart installation script I would not know about

1335
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:51,220
that though but it hasn't seemed to hurt them yet wouldn't recommend that's one of those

1336
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:57,480
don't do as I actually do they say things yeah all of us at some point of probably disabled

1337
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:02,080
se Linux a few more times than we should have let's admit it now it's true it's true it's

1338
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:08,580
getting better it's getting better on newer fedora installs but if you can get it working

1339
01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:13,560
it is a nice little peace of mind I have to say Jason also wrote in a bit on malware and

1340
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:18,320
security yeah mentioning crowd sec which I hadn't heard about before but I did read the

1341
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:23,080
description here crowd sec is a free modern and collaborative behavior detection engine

1342
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:28,960
coupled with a global IP reputation network it stacks on failed bands philosophy but is

1343
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:36,800
IP v6 compatible and about 60 times faster so it's go versus python uses grok patterns

1344
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:42,360
to parse logs and yaml scenarios to identify behaviors crowd sec is engineered for modern

1345
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:48,480
cloud containers and VM based infrastructures by decoupling detection and remediation once

1346
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:55,180
detected you can remedy the threat with various bouncers firewalls nginx HTTP 403s captures

1347
01:07:55,180 --> 01:08:01,200
it etc while the aggressive IPs can be sent to crowd sec for curation before being shared

1348
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:08,080
among all users to further improve everyone's security you know I believe Westpain has a

1349
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:12,840
global IP reputation network he runs as well yeah I sure do yeah I do have to send you

1350
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,540
the IPs in the mail so it's you know it's not the fastest to get identified but I do

1351
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:20,280
send them you do and it's been it's been a really good system it's just something West

1352
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:24,440
does for free in a spare time don't know why but you know Jason we got a lot of people

1353
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:30,360
that said crowd sec is a must recommend and I'm really glad I don't have to think about

1354
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:36,600
these things anymore very very very glad there was a time and a place that time and places

1355
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:41,960
no more I keep I keep all my systems behind firewalls I no longer have any inbound ports

1356
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:46,040
on any of my firewalls except for one of the ones here at the studio I just realized I'm

1357
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:52,280
saying that but that's the problem with them you forget about them right yeah but you know

1358
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:56,360
it's I feel a lot better I don't really I don't worry about it too much we could probably

1359
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:02,400
think about this for our cloud instances though I'm impressed recently with how this kind

1360
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:08,840
of crowdsource security is getting pretty common I'm thinking also of crowdsource like

1361
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:15,400
ad blocking and such I think in the last few years these have shown up and it's impressive

1362
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:20,640
what all of us kind of working together can come up with I really like that concept yes

1363
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:26,080
as long as it isn't abused these things are always have that potential like I'm just thinking

1364
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:32,880
of spam blacklists they're mostly good but they also have made it nearly impossible to

1365
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,760
self-host your own email now because of these shared blacklists if you accidentally get

1366
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:42,120
on one for some stupid reason right what are the other processes in place who do you you

1367
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:49,680
know who do you appeal to to remedy things if anyone or at all and now it is time for

1368
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:54,440
the boost we got some great boost into the show this week and I want to mention if you

1369
01:09:54,440 --> 01:10:00,600
don't hear your boosts on here we are recording two shows today so we save some for this episode

1370
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:05,000
and we save some for other episodes and we're curating them now we're picking certain boosts

1371
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,040
we're reading all of them and getting some of them onto the air and hey citizen boosted

1372
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:15,680
in last week with 69 69 sats a citizen and it gives me just an opportunity to talk about

1373
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:22,440
something I love he says he loves Linux and he loves lit now pop quiz for you guys can

1374
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:30,760
any of you guys describe what lit is what does it mean if our show is lit now I should

1375
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:35,400
I mean I know in the sense of the fire emoji I should I'm on board with that yeah that's

1376
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:41,320
true I see here it's you've spelt it specifically or they've spelt it specifically capital L

1377
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:46,480
small I capital T so maybe that's an indicator West for you I can give you a hint yeah but

1378
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:51,720
it might give it away so I'll just tell you it is the live item tag in the podcasting

1379
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:58,320
tutorial oh that's embarrassing now yeah and so apps like pod verse and others have the

1380
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:03,800
ability to actually stream our live stream in their app and you just looking at your

1381
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:08,200
podcasts you know this your list of shows to listen to and Linux unplugged shows up

1382
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:13,440
with a little live badge next to it and wouldn't click that and what's brilliant about it is

1383
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:17,480
it's just done through the RSS feed and if this is one of the namespaces in there's this

1384
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:22,120
live item tag you put that in there and then the podcast catcher sees that and it just

1385
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:26,400
adds it to the list as a live show and it's one of the beauties of the podcasting tutorial

1386
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,880
stuff so much good stuff getting developed over there yep so I just appreciate the opportunity

1387
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:36,480
to actually talk about that because I love it and I think it'll come it'll be it'll be

1388
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:42,080
here one day we first have to get to the stage of completely generating all our own RSS feeds

1389
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:46,880
on our own we'll experiment with office hours and member feeds and then we'll roll it out

1390
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:52,040
to all the shows someday in the near future yeah stay tuned and hey pro tip to you boosters

1391
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:57,760
out there if you mention podcasting 2.0 you're pretty likely to get on there that's true

1392
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:02,560
Blake Collin boosted in with 10,001 sats coming in hot with the boost I love that one he's

1393
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:09,260
got a pro tip speaking of podcasting 2.0 you can boost from the podcast index web page

1394
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:13,520
our Linux unplugged entry there oh right from the source just have to have the Albee extension

1395
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,680
which is top-notch software and we have a link to the Linux unplugged entry at podcast

1396
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,680
index org but yeah you don't need it you don't need a mobile app you could actually do it

1397
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:27,120
from your web browser on your fancy laptop or desktop from the podcast index page and

1398
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:32,600
Blake sent in 10,001 sets doing that and then I guess I just picked all the ones I felt

1399
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:38,560
like talking about today Molybdenum boosted in with just 500 sats but I like the message

1400
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,600
she says I don't like crypto at all but I love the idea of the lightning network and

1401
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:48,560
the use for stuff like this or maybe a game server you're playing on could see how be

1402
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:53,660
able to boost into a game server would be extremely useful I agree I don't like crypto

1403
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:58,600
either don't like it don't like web 3 so far and hasn't impressed me much maybe one day

1404
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:04,840
it will so far it has not and we get into all of that in office hours episode 9 we hate

1405
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:11,400
crypto too and I try to explain the difference between Bitcoin and crypto the green eagle

1406
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:16,920
boosted in with 2,000 sats I'm still using sync thing to backup photos off mine and my

1407
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:22,160
wife's phone as a bonus it allows me to sync other files like notes unfortunately though

1408
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:28,480
I'm still using Google for sharing organizing searching etc so sync thing is really only

1409
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:33,720
a secondary backup I always intended to self-host a solution but I'm afraid the effort won't

1410
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:39,840
be worth it because the bar for spouse approval is too high I run into that issue every time

1411
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,400
I start down the path of switching something off a Google service yeah that's an important

1412
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:52,280
consideration and I I strongly believe that the setup I described today with photosync

1413
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:58,400
and photoprism and duplicati is a totally spouse approved stack because the UI on photosync

1414
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,760
is great the UI on photoprism is great you can have different user accounts on photoprism

1415
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:06,840
so they can have their own login with their own albums and stuff if you want to do that

1416
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,440
really top-notch stuff and then duplicati you know she's never really gonna have to

1417
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:15,240
see that but if I were sick and she needed to check the status of the backup she could

1418
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:20,080
just check the bookmark I have and it's all in a web UI it gives you error messages that

1419
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:25,280
are clear and easy to read for the most part so I think that stack is probably as close

1420
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:30,120
as you can get to a commercial product in terms of polish of UI and it seems like things

1421
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:34,200
are only getting better right I mean you mentioned image and just more solutions coming along

1422
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:38,640
to try to fit that role more polish over time and more on the whole the whole pipeline in

1423
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:44,760
one place just fewer moving pieces and I'd say this Westpain photoprism has gotten noticeably

1424
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:49,080
better since we talked about it last time on the show so solid yeah continuous improvements

1425
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:54,680
over there too the whole stack also a green eagle if your wife is unhappy I mean you can

1426
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:58,880
just blame Chris so center yeah that's totally cool man people do it all the time he guaranteed

1427
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:05,680
that's possible approval Belf Winnie Belf in we Chris we do this one I think you'll get

1428
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:13,640
this one Belf in we I like it all right Belf in we well done boosted it with 512 sets they

1429
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:18,080
say love the show and so glad you talked about Linux Mint every now and then as it was my

1430
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:23,560
first distribution and still my favorite also trying boosts for the first time after listening

1431
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:29,840
to this episode and noticed a few days ago my boosts stop accumulating in my wallet oh

1432
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:34,680
probably talking about fountain earn there I'd imagine right yeah probably talking about

1433
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:40,320
fountain earn perhaps yeah perhaps I love when we get the first boosters into the show

1434
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:45,120
so 512 stats good enough for me I love hearing that that's so great and also yeah we try

1435
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:49,180
to be aware of the fact that there are a decent amount of Mint users out there and even though

1436
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:53,440
it's not our daily driver as they say we still want to try to be represented from time to

1437
01:15:53,440 --> 01:16:00,080
time as best we can as non-Mint users ourselves you know I started on Mint as well and oh

1438
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:05,280
well actually that's not entirely true I started on XFC but we don't talk about that too often

1439
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:09,960
banned from the show yeah I was on there for a year but then moved to Linux Mint for many

1440
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:14,080
many years and really loved it and still have a few friends that I support who are using

1441
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:19,560
it and still loving it so it's just like the distro that just keeps on ticking I know you've

1442
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:28,440
told me but you were a Cinnamon user at that time too right yeah yeah I think I originally

1443
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:33,200
moved to Cinnamon because it was okay I did a bunch of research because I loved GNOME

1444
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:40,440
2 at the time and I knew yeah I knew at the time moving to GNOME 3 was a hot topic we

1445
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:46,000
all had feels about a brand yeah yeah so I thought Cinnamon being a fork might be a nice

1446
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,760
thing and it was not the most stable thing back then but it seemed to be getting a ton

1447
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:55,900
of development I mean they even had a button to like restart Cinnamon that was just a built-in

1448
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:59,840
feature which was if you remember is that still there Wes I think you might have yeah

1449
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:05,600
I think I think so I say keep it but it actually for the most part was really great and was

1450
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:11,880
just customizable enough and so yeah it was a great experience I had nothing wrong with

1451
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:18,280
that and I'm proud to say that I used Mint for a while T-Kario boosts in with ten thousand

1452
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:25,920
sets boost with all the decentralized and open source software that y'all use at JB I've

1453
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:31,440
been wondering what the heck are you using meetups for there appear to be options like

1454
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:37,420
mobile zone get together and I believe meetups is paid so perhaps some of that funding you're

1455
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:42,960
using on meetups could go towards another open source project instead though I acknowledge

1456
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:48,600
you may lose some of the organic discovery provided by meetup and their network effect

1457
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,920
be great to hear what y'all think about it though that's a great question I feel like

1458
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:59,980
we kind of over time move to decentralized or free software tools as that tooling kind

1459
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:04,520
of meets our needs and in some areas like the hackintoshes were a great example and

1460
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:10,320
Wirecast for a long time we had to just live with a proprietary solution that was just

1461
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:14,360
painful and then because I mean from the business perspective you kind of start with the like

1462
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:17,880
we need to do X because we've determined we need to do X to accomplish the goals we're

1463
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,720
doing and then ideally we can do that with open source decentralized software but you

1464
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:26,400
got to get a start from that angle there's definitely that aspect of it and then I mean

1465
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:31,600
not to not to be this guy but there is some truth to this is like sometimes we're just

1466
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,680
early and we start using something and there isn't a free software solution available like

1467
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:43,320
that we've been using meetup for ever before it was ridiculously expensive to use right

1468
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:48,360
but meetup is like number one with a bullet on our services list that we use that we want

1469
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:54,480
to replace we've experiment experimented with get together and we haven't been super happy

1470
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:59,640
with it we would love to use something that our community could also use to self organize

1471
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:03,960
their own meetups because we've heard from dozens of people that want to organize meetups

1472
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:08,060
in their area with other JB audience members but we just don't have a platform for them

1473
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:13,040
to use so it seems like whatever we switch to should probably be the same tooling and

1474
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:18,820
then that just like is a huge lift and that's where we're at right now but it is number

1475
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:24,200
one with a bullet and in the meantime it gets sort of a pass because of that network effect

1476
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:29,320
that you mentioned it is valuable to let people know hey we got a new meetup in this area

1477
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,800
that's but we would hope they would come over to whatever new platform we have and we're

1478
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,400
not using it I mean it's it's quite public in one sense but in the other hand it's you

1479
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,840
know we add some entries there and there's a little bit of back and forth we put some

1480
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,960
details maybe some comments but it's not otherwise it's sort of tertiary to a lot of the rest

1481
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:53,720
of the systems yeah wise Papa John boosts in with 2674 satoshis b-o-o-s-t I'm a serial

1482
01:19:53,720 --> 01:20:00,060
audiobook listener and I only listen to podcasts between books so I'm usually two or three

1483
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:05,720
episodes behind and I actually enjoy having a handful of episodes to binge all at once

1484
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:11,320
I get that I get that I continue to request people send in your listening habits I've

1485
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:15,880
been doing this for 15 years and I still find it absolutely fascinating oh yeah I want to

1486
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,920
know how you find the show I want to know how you listen to the show I want to know

1487
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:22,380
how far behind you are these are all things that we try to factor in when we're planning

1488
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:26,880
content so actually having that information super valuable to use the chapters do you

1489
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,120
want do you need us to do stuff that makes it easier the chapters did you know we have

1490
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:36,480
chapters chapters did you know everything is chaptered these features let us know because

1491
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,840
you know as podcasters we don't get a lot of data that's the way this decentralized

1492
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:45,300
system works we don't really know we just put an mp3 for it and I think everybody likes

1493
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:48,720
it that way so let's just keep it that way so just tell us because you know some of these

1494
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:52,640
podcast out there with their dynamic ads they want all this data you guys know what I'm

1495
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:57,920
talking about hey I want to say thank you to a group out there too first of all we don't

1496
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,600
read all of the boosts on the air we do have another episode coming up but not everything

1497
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,960
makes it on the air we are curating the boosts these days but we read all of them and it

1498
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,720
still makes me smile every time it comes in Brent knows it now that he's here yeah yeah

1499
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:17,780
you hear the little pew that pew that we play the helipad interface plays that in real time

1500
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:21,720
and also does an explosion of confetti and it's a real celebration every time a boost

1501
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:27,960
comes in in this studio it's great it makes us smile so shout out to bond who just caught

1502
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,880
up on the show and got current after falling behind great to have you back on board we

1503
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:36,640
got 1500 sats from Prozac who just wanted to toss a little bit to Brent's gas fund thank

1504
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:40,280
you we super appreciate that what an amazing thing that's been we're gonna talk more about

1505
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:44,960
that on the road we have plans to talk about that it's just stuff we're not getting to

1506
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,880
today we also got a row of ducks from Elrey Elrey I thought we decided we were just calling

1507
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:56,080
them 741 the old seven yeah lucky number he's thanking us though for trying to get

1508
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:01,520
the name right still trying and it's I think I think I have like name aphasia or something

1509
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:08,400
like word aphasia okay cuz like um I just it doesn't stick and I've read that is actually

1510
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:13,200
a problem for ADD people so there you go if you if you wanted a symptom here it is I'd

1511
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:20,440
also like to do an extra shout out to Elrey and chance as well and also CG bass player

1512
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:25,060
while I've been traveling this week and just totally wrapped up in all of the studio projects

1513
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:31,280
we've been doing some may have noticed that I've done a little less appearing on our website

1514
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:37,480
project on GitHub and but the three of them have really taken things up and have been

1515
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:41,720
committing you know there were some merges that I wasn't even aware of Chris and I visited

1516
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:47,640
the website I was like oh look isn't that amazing it's incredible can we just stop for

1517
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:51,320
a second to acknowledge how incredible that is how incredible that is our community is

1518
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:55,280
improving our website while we are heads down preparing for this road trip and planning

1519
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:59,920
multiple shows and Brent and I have been working very diligently on a project that we cannot

1520
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:04,680
tell you about yet that has also been consuming a ton of our time and he's been traveling

1521
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:08,960
and we're gonna be away traveling and so to have our community keep that going and add

1522
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:13,160
new features that we've talked about amazing it's just it's kind of perfect too right because

1523
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:18,040
like I mean I don't really use the website right I mean it's not for me we're behind

1524
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:22,920
the scenes yeah yeah but it's the audience's website that's why we have it it's for them

1525
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:26,240
to make the show accessible and be and so they have way better ideas on how to make

1526
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:30,500
it awesome than I've ever had this is that this is the true incredible aspect of value

1527
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:34,960
for value right I mean the kind of value they're returning right now it's just amazing so yeah

1528
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:39,680
we absolutely should be thanking them and don't worry I'll be back in time but I think

1529
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:43,400
they should be generous we're like we're gonna be a little slow on matrix and telegram we're

1530
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:48,120
gonna be kind of slow on the github because we're gonna be we're either driving sleeping

1531
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:53,000
or recording for like three weeks straight if we see you and appreciate yeah we will

1532
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,000
still be looking as much as we can and all the messages and checking the helipads and

1533
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:07,000
all of that too we got a hello out there to mr I'm gonna say bench nice he just found

1534
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,280
luck for the first time using oh that's awesome the fountain charts so thanks to the boosting

1535
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:16,240
we're getting away we're yeah I'm getting these things I'm getting this message a lot

1536
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:20,280
I'm getting a lot because what happens is people send in their baller boost using the

1537
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:25,400
fountain app we show up on the charts and then people say well this must be a good show

1538
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:31,800
because people are actually totally wrong but they get but anyways bench thanks for

1539
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:35,400
joining us thank you everybody who boosts in we do appreciate it if you'd like to join

1540
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:40,160
the fun you can go to newpodcastapps.com and get a new podcast app or you can actually

1541
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:45,760
just boost from the podcastindex.org website if you got the Albie extension or you can

1542
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:50,620
really be a geek and get boost CLI set up I feel like that's whole there's a whole other

1543
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:54,120
world of self-hosting you have to wrap your head around so if you manage to get boost

1544
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:58,440
CLI up and running I think that's legitimately one of the more impressive technical tasks

1545
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:02,920
you could pull off right now so boost into the show if you get boost CLI working and

1546
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:06,740
that brings us to the end of this week's episode of the unplug program links to all of the
