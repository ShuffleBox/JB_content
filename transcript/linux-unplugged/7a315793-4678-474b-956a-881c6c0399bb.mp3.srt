1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Well, thank you to the archive.org website.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,960
Some precious internet history has been preserved.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,160
It's peanut butter jelly time, peanut butter jelly time,

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,820
peanut butter jelly time.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,680
Way yeah, way yeah, way yeah, way yeah.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,920
Now there you go, there you go, there you go, there you go,

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,040
peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly,

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,240
peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,900
little peanut butter jelly, peanut butter gel smell,

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,080
peanut butter jelly with a baseball bat,

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,900
peanut butter jelly.

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,280
Yeah, this precious internet gem

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,240
amongst many others, is now being preserved.

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,800
These Flash games and movies and videos and comics

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,840
are being preserved on archive.org.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,160
But there's a special twist for fans of this show, Wes.

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,160
Oh, yes.

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,080
It's all powered by Rust.

19
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,720
Rust, you say?

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,560
Well, yeah.

21
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,400
I mean, of course.

22
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,040
How else would you accomplish this magic?

23
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,040
You can watch all this.

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,620
You don't need to have a Flash plug-in installed,

25
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,320
because it's powered by WebAssembly and Rust

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,540
with the Ruffle project.

27
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,400
The only way to make Flash acceptable

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,600
is create an engine in Rust that plays it using WebAssembly.

29
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,760
I think this is a Linux-unplugged

30
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,400
approved methodology to watch your Flash videos

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,280
and to play your Flash video games and whatnot.

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,400
Flash, it's finally hip again.

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:29,680
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,640
My name is Chris.

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,720
My name is Wes.

36
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,680
Hello there, Wes.

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,680
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru, the leader

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,600
in hands-on learning.

39
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,840
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,880
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs, Cloud Linux servers,

41
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,760
and much more.

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,680

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,040
This is Linux Unplugged episode 381,

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,520
which is getting really close to one of my favorites.

45
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,920
I've had the privilege of a couple of shows reaching 386.

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,480
And that and 486 are my two favorite episode numbers,

47
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,360
because I'm a nerd.

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,000
Really good reminder of just how much time you spent here.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,160
Yeah, it's nice.

50
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,000
It's nice, actually, to be looking back at 381

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,680
and feeling like, man, I feel like we still got a lot more

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,480
episodes in us.

53
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,920
We're not even close to feeling like we're

54
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
near done with this show.

55
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,520
We got still a lot to get into.

56
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,020
We have a lot of episode to get into.

57
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,920
This is going to be a really fun one,

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,160
because we have an open source tool that's

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,520
going to help you be a secret spy using, well,

60
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,880
retro technology, a new open source tool that

61
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,040
will make you feel very retro.

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,160
That's a good tease.

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,760
But we also have a bunch of community news

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,040
and some feedback, a pic, too, that I

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,120
think is going to make your desktop look even better

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,520
and your terminal look super sharp.

67
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,720
Oh, you're thinking of us.

68
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,320
I am.

69
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,720
I'm always thinking of you guys.

70
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,820
Well, and well, constantly just dogged by what the hell

71
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,200
I'm going to talk about next on the show,

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,580
like it's some sort of demon that constantly stalks me

73
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,280
every single day and ever.

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,920
Anyways, where were we?

75
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
Oh, yeah, right.

76
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,640
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

77
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,140
Hello.

78
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,640
Hello.

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,140
Hello.

80
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,640
Hello.

81
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,140
Hello.

82
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,280
Hello.

83
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,600
Hello, everybody.

84
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,560
Look at that, 25 in the Virtual Lug today,

85
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,800
a few in the quiet listening, a whole bunch on air.

86
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,800
And it's really awesome to see some new faces, old faces,

87
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,880
and in between.

88
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,720
Of course, we're also streaming at jblive.tv on a Tuesday.

89
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,320
We do it at noon Pacific.

90
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,520
And every now and then, like the last couple episodes,

91
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,440
we tweak it up a bit.

92
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,720
But we try to keep the calendar as best up to date

93
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,360
as we can at jupitabroadcasting.com

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,160
slash calendar.

95
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,800
And let's start with a fun fact of life.

96
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,960
Like it or not, and maybe you do like it,

97
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,680
Chrome OS just isn't going away.

98
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,200
So the question the show has is, could we have some fun?

99
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,760
And there's a couple of projects out there

100
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,080
that would suggest yes, including one that

101
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,400
aims to be a total Chrome OS alternative maybe

102
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,920
for those older Chromebooks.

103
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,600
And it's from a developer we've heard of before, Wes.

104
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,640
Yeah, from the creator of Ubuntu Unity and Ubuntu Ed,

105
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,960
here comes yet another unofficial Ubuntu flavor,

106
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,880
Ubuntu Web Remix, which aims to be an alternative to Chrome OS

107
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,440
or Chromium OS.

108
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,680
I will admit to still watching Ubuntu Unity with a bit

109
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,640
of a curiosity, wondering what could happen there.

110
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,040
As time goes on, it almost feels like it'd

111
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,160
be fun to spend a week in Unity.

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,640
I think it would genuinely feel old at this point.

113
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,040
I have some fond memories, though.

114
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Yeah, it still feels like it'd be kind of fun.

115
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,320
And I don't know if any of these will ever become official Ubuntu

116
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,560
flavors, but they're cool to see out there because you do wonder,

117
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,280
can you have a project that is Ubuntu adjacent,

118
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,520
so it brings a lot of compatibility with it,

119
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,640
that could be utilized to bring new life into old Chromebooks?

120
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,760
So this Remix right now is based off

121
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,980
of a version of GNOME 3.36.

122
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,920
It comes with an app pre-installed

123
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,280
so you can run Android apps.

124
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,000
It has DTube video sharing on there.

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,680
It has the Mastered on Web App and Twitter web apps

126
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,040
pre-installed.

127
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Their focus here is really de-Googled web apps.

128
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,800
I think that's a big focus of that project.

129
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,840
Or at least they're focusing on those tools.

130
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,040
Right, I mean, it uses primarily Firefox instead of Chrome

131
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,560
because otherwise how is it an alternative to a Chromebook?

132
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,960
You should note, though, that if you plan to install the Android apps,

133
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,280
it's experimental right now and might not work properly,

134
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,400
especially on the live session or in a virtual machine.

135
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,900
It's all powered by Andbox under the hood,

136
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,440
and you might have to do some fiddling with things like Secure Boot

137
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,600
to get that all working nicely.

138
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,560
All right, so maybe he's all in on the Chrome OS.

139
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,000
So then maybe you want to bring it to other devices,

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,720
like maybe the Pine 64, which could be legitimately useful.

141
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,280
My kids' schools, they exclusively use Chromebooks,

142
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,480
and maybe it wouldn't be so bad for me to know

143
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,160
how to use the Chromebook OS and interface.

144
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,120
And my Pinebook, which I already own,

145
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,400
could be a great way for maybe me to learn without having

146
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,040
to make a big investment.

147
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,200
I'm going to take a shot at this name.

148
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,720
I'm going to say Fee-ed OS.

149
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,760
Well, I was going to say Fide, but yeah, all right.

150
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,040
Fee-ed OS.

151
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,160
No, no, no, it's Fide.

152
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,400
I just thought, because that's what I thought it was,

153
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,600
it must not be right.

154
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,960
Oh, surely we're both getting it wrong.

155
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,360
That's how it usually goes.

156
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,840
So it's Fee-ed OS, which is a fork of Chromium OS,

157
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,920
the open source version of Chrome OS.

158
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,040
This version is based for Chromium x86,

159
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,880
so it supports a lot of x86 machines,

160
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,720
but they're also making a version for the Pine 64.

161
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,360
Yeah, it is also available if you don't want it on the Pine

162
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
book, you know?

163
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,680
It's pretty flexible.

164
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,880
It's got custom builds for things like the Microsoft

165
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,000
Surface tablets, the Google Chromebook Pixel 2013,

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,320
and the GPD Pocket 2.

167
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,840
Hey.

168
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,680
Yeah.

169
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,760
That's kind of particularly cool and caught my eye.

170
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,320
But we do have a reporter live on the scene.

171
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,960
Byte Bitten, you're reporting live

172
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,040
from using Fee-ed or Fide OS, and you have some notes.

173
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,560
Yes, Chris.

174
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,520
So here with my Pinebook, bro.

175
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,400
So yeah, I've been trying Fide OS

176
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,640
or getting it to install my Pinebook Pro,

177
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,600
but it is very picky with the micro SD cards you're using.

178
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,520
It needs to be fast enough for it to boot.

179
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,840
And I had some what I thought were fast micro SD cards,

180
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,000
but they seem to be not fast enough.

181
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,960
And it is really a miss on that part,

182
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,360
and you need to try a lot of micro SD cards

183
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
if you don't find the right one.

184
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,760
Oh, did you nail down what it is that it's

185
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,360
looking for in an SD card?

186
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,240
Not exactly.

187
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,160
And also, the developer said that it is just

188
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,680
demanding on the micro SD card.

189
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,120
But as soon as you've got it installed on the eMMC,

190
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,760
then it is just smooth sailing from there.

191
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,560
Good to know.

192
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,040
Thank you.

193
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,840
Why don't we transition to a little bit of what's

194
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,080
coming down the pipeline?

195
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,520
As projects are looking to 2021, we're

196
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,040
getting an idea of what Gnome is going

197
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,520
to focus on as a project.

198
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,560
Feronix has an article that also covers

199
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,360
where they spent their money over 2020,

200
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,480
if you're interested in that.

201
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,120
It seems like a lot of it went to GTK4 development,

202
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,360
some technical infrastructure support for Flathub,

203
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,440
and a few other things.

204
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,960
Oh, yeah.

205
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,680
Hey, remember that legal case against Rothschild patent

206
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,440
imaging that costs money?

207
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,680
Plus some good stuff like conferences,

208
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,720
Gwadek, Linux App Summit, GTK hack fests.

209
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,040
They also got themselves a supported instance

210
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,080
of the video chat software Big Blue Button.

211
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,160
Hey, I'm sure that's pretty handy.

212
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,440
And some internships and just general community support.

213
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,480
And all of that is great work.

214
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,840
Yeah, I bet they weren't expecting

215
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,120
to need that video conferencing software quite as much.

216
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,080
No.

217
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,320
In 2021, they're going to focus on organizing Gwadek some more,

218
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,000
as well as the Gnome Summit and the Linux App Summit.

219
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
They're going to host virtual social events, hack fests.

220
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,240
But there's also going to be, of course, work on two more

221
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,800
editions of Gnome.

222
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,300
They're going to look to push forward

223
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,440
smaller projects within the Gnome ecosystem

224
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,480
with some of their funding, including also hiring

225
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,640
interns and paid internships for free software development.

226
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,200
Awesome.

227
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,800
Yeah.

228
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,520
Provide financial and logistical support

229
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,880
for people that are speaking at conferences, which

230
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
for people who are new to speaking.

231
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,800
But maybe you have somebody out there

232
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,160
who can be a really good advocate for you.

233
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,480
That's really nice to handle that stuff for them.

234
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,160
But they're also going to, they note in here,

235
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,600
launch a new initiative, including

236
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,400
the Faces of Gnome, an increased conference participation.

237
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,240
But the Faces of Gnome, I think, is that's interesting.

238
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,620
There is a Faces of Open Source project out there,

239
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,960
which I bet you this has inspired this.

240
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,520
And maybe pretty soon, we're going

241
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,280
to have a way to put more names to faces.

242
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,080
I like that.

243
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,480
Oftentimes, you just get to see a nick or a handle

244
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,960
or an email and a git commit.

245
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,280
But there's real people spending real time

246
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,160
on all this free software that we love.

247
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,640
Yeah.

248
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,560
And I think it's good to also remind everybody

249
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,800
that there's humans.

250
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,120
Humans.

251
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,520
Behind Gnome.

252
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,760
Gnome gets so much opinion in this space.

253
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,080
Everybody has an opinion.

254
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,000
And we kind of just speak of this nebulous upstream gnome.

255
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,880
Yeah, and everybody loves to share it too, right?

256
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,480
They love to share that opinion.

257
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,360
So maybe reminding us all that there's human beings there

258
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,320
isn't so bad.

259
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,200
But looking into our future crystal ball vision,

260
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,520
like we were earlier before, I see something else coming down

261
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,560
the pipeline, of course.

262
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,720
And that is details for Fedora 34.

263
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,700
Looks like we're going to have a couple of new spins,

264
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,520
I guess they call them, in Fedora parlance.

265
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,600
Well, one is the i3 team is working on an official Fedora

266
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,280
spin for Fedora 34.

267
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,280
And it looks like in Fedora 34, we

268
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,240
will see an official KDE plasma spin for 64-bit ARM devices.

269
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,920
I'm looking at you, Pi 400.

270
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,360
Isn't that nice?

271
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,760
And then the big doozy that, of course, Wes and I

272
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,440
care the most about is Fedora 34 may try,

273
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,800
this is still up in the air, but may

274
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,680
try to use pipe wire by default to replace pulse audio.

275
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,080
And I guess, would it also replace jack?

276
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,760
This is where I'm still fuzzy, or would it integrate with jack?

277
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,400
Yeah, I mean, that's just it.

278
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,760
Pipe wire would provide Fedora 34's jack support.

279
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,880
It would be a pipe wire future, at least based

280
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,040
on the Ferronix write-up.

281
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Right, right.

282
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,660
I don't know how I feel about that.

283
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,600
I mean, I really love and support pipe wire.

284
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,560
I'm super excited about the pipe wire future.

285
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,360
But just the history of adopting new sound solutions

286
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
makes me a little bit nervous, even

287
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,760
in a great environment like Fedora, pipe wire

288
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,920
is pretty easy to install in Fedora right now.

289
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,160
I don't know.

290
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,520
If it's ready, it's ready.

291
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,880
Fedora can make that judgment.

292
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,680
It just makes me a little nervous.

293
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,760
Yeah, and it does maybe change our math a little bit

294
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,280
on if we were going to reload.

295
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,880
We have a machine that's super critical to our workload.

296
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,760
I'm talking to Wes on it right now, and recording,

297
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,400
and all of it.

298
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,000
And if it were to go out, we would be so as well,

299
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,080
and we'd have to rebuild that day.

300
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,560
And so the question is, would you rebuild with 18.04,

301
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,320
or at this point, at the end of 2020,

302
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,600
would you go with something else?

303
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,800
And seriously, Fedora would be a consideration in this mix,

304
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,760
but not if in the next release this change is coming.

305
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,640
And I'm all for it at the same time.

306
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,000
I still want them to do it.

307
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,960
It just means you'd use it in the appropriate use cases.

308
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,840
You also got to figure, Wes, that maybe they'd

309
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,040
make it an easy way to just switch back.

310
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,920
Yeah, that very well could be.

311
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,560
Yeah, that could be coming.

312
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,720
And it seems like you just haven't played with it a bit.

313
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,440
And I know our very own Mr. Drew has been evaluating

314
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,840
PipeWire fairly extensively.

315
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,720
And progress is very impressive.

316
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,960
So it very well could be totally ready for this, at least

317
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,360
in most use cases.

318
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,080
Yeah, and kind of in the same wheelhouse,

319
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,880
PulseAudio 14.0 has been just recently released.

320
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,600
It comes with many changes.

321
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,160
But there is this flat volumes controversy

322
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,000
that I guess most distros patched around,

323
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,400
so I was oblivious to it.

324
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,720
Can you explain this to me?

325
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,400
Yeah, I guess it's kind of always

326
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,440
been a controversial feature in PulseAudio.

327
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,720
With flat volumes, the stream volumes controls also

328
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,640
the sync volume.

329
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,520
And so maybe you've seen this feature

330
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,480
where you adjust the volume in your loudest application,

331
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,640
and that ends up adjusting the whole system volume.

332
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,080
So those become linked, and you don't have these two layers

333
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,040
of volume controls like you might think that you have.

334
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,680
And the biggest problem is that sometimes,

335
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,840
after you've adjusted the volume in one app to boost that up,

336
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,480
the next app that plays suddenly plays and blows your ears out.

337
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,920
OK, no wonder why the distros patch around that.

338
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,720
That's not good.

339
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,320
Right, and so that way, because it

340
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,920
can be confusing if you don't understand

341
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,800
that there's the second system volume.

342
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,120
If you are in an app and you go all the way to 100%,

343
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,760
if the system volume is at 30%, it's just not

344
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,120
going to get that loud, right?

345
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,280
So the intent was to fix situations like that,

346
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,360
but I think it ended up causing more confusion.

347
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,880
And clearly, the folks actually downstream implementing

348
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,600
Pulse at the user-facing level kind of think the same thing.

349
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,320
Yeah, that makes sense.

350
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,200
And there's other nice improvements in there,

351
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,040
and I guess one highlighted area that's

352
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,520
probably most relevant to the audience

353
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,400
is USB headset support has been improved.

354
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,720
Various vendors specifically seem

355
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,120
to have gotten improvements as well.

356
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,720
Yeah, isn't that nice to see?

357
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,640
Yeah, I guess so.

358
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,440
I mean, you've got to figure not only are people using it

359
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,240
obviously to play games, but a lot of people

360
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,440
are probably using those headsets to do virtual meetings

361
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,840
and whatnot as well.

362
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,080
I know I sure am.

363
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,560
I actually have been thinking about it with my big headset

364
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,600
just because I like the way it feels and all of that,

365
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,080
but I don't know.

366
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,160
I feel silly with it on video.

367
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,080
That's my only kind of slow-my-roll thing

368
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,840
on that one.

369
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,600
But maybe I'll just get over it, because after all, it

370
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
does look very cool.

371
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,960
Linode.com slash unplugged.

372
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Go there to support the show and get a 100.

373
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,560
Wait, hold on.

374
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,080
What?

375
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,840
I got to check this.

376
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,600
$100 60-day credit.

377
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,720
Who authorized this?

378
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,240
That's too much.

379
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,440
Wes, did you authorize $100 60-day credit for new accounts?

380
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,200
I mean, it just sounds like such a good deal, right?

381
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,240
Who wouldn't want that?

382
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,560
You move the soundboard guy to the deals job,

383
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,720
and now this is what we get.

384
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,000
Well, I mean, there's no way they're

385
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
going to keep this going.

386
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,520
So you better go to linode.com slash unplug.

387
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,200
They're our cloud hosting provider.

388
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,680
They've been around since 2003 as one of the first companies

389
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,480
in cloud computing, and they started

390
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,040
because they freaking love Linux.

391
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,560
They saw where things were going in the kernel in regards

392
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,760
to virtualization and said, hey, you know what?

393
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,000
Hey, we could probably build a business around that.

394
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,880
I can relate with that.

395
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,840
I mean, that's how we saw with podcasting 13 years ago.

396
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,480
We saw where the technology was going.

397
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,120
You said, hey, you know what?

398
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,040
I could go talk about Linux on that.

399
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,280
And I can relate with that.

400
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,800
Now they're still the largest independently-owned cloud

401
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,480
provider.

402
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,840
They started with a love for Linux,

403
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,000
and now here, look at them.

404
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,360
And they've got fantastic customer service.

405
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,960
And if you don't know a lot about Linux

406
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,520
or you've never really ran a server before,

407
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,680
they got you covered.

408
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,440
I just deployed an Azurecast server.

409
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,760
And Azurecast, do you remember how we say that, Wes?

410
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,400
Azurecast.

411
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,240
Let's go with Azurecast.

412
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,800
Azurecast.

413
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,520
Yeah, yeah, with the role there.

414
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,800
And I deployed it in like 10 seconds on Linode.

415
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,400
And I'm thinking maybe in the future,

416
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,240
we're going to have this cool, new, upgraded live stream.

417
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,720
And I've been on the fence if I was

418
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,520
going to do that forever, for like a year now.

419
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,520
But with Linode, and it was just like one click,

420
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,320
I thought, well, why not?

421
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,520
But then once it started deploying,

422
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,720
I was like, oh, of course.

423
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,920
Of course this is how it works.

424
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,840
Linode is awesome.

425
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,760
So when you're deploying it, whenever they can,

426
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,720
they'll give you multiple choices of distros.

427
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,360
So it's a one-click application deployment,

428
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,520
and you choose the base OS.

429
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,360
So I chose Ubuntu 20.04, which matches our other Linodes.

430
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,400
And now it's up and running.

431
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,880
On a dedicated machine, I decided to go dedicated CPU,

432
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,960
since it's going to be doing multiple MP3 streaming codes.

433
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,720
And I positioned it in Dallas, Texas,

434
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,280
because I feel like for the majority of the audience

435
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,880
that will be streaming it during the daytime,

436
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,240
that's going to be US audience.

437
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,680
And so probably should centralize it as much as I can.

438
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,800
And they've got 11 data centers all over the world.

439
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,180
So you can pick which one's close to you or, in my case,

440
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,800
close to the client or the audience.

441
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,400
They've got native SSD storage that's

442
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,640
blazing fast 40-gigabit network connections

443
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,680
and a totally easy-to-use dashboard that

444
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,800
makes all of this possible.

445
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,200
But generally, just one click away to go deep.

446
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,980
If you know what you're doing, if you

447
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,800
know what a mount point is, you can go deeper.

448
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,480
It's great.

449
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,360
And that's what I love about it.

450
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,060
Not like the entry-level service providers

451
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,000
that try to block all that stuff off.

452
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,200
Plus, they have object storage, Kubernetes support,

453
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,800
Terraform support, node balancers, built-in firewall.

454
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,920
It's pretty feature-packed.

455
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,680
And that $100 credit's going to get you really far

456
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,520
with their base rig starting at $5 a month.

457
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,120
So go to lanode.com slash unplugged.

458
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,040
Go there, support the show, and get yourself $100 credit.

459
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,840
And go in there, let them know you heard about it on the show.

460
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,400
That helps, too.

461
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Maybe share it with your friend.

462
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,160
I don't know.

463
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,040
Maybe print it out and put it up all over the town

464
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,560
on the post saying, server missing.

465
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,240
Go to lanode.com slash unplugged if you see it.

466
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,680
No, that's not my best idea.

467
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,720
That's not my best idea.

468
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,680
Maybe you should tweet me and let me

469
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,600
know what you're doing with your lanodes.

470
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,120
Tweet me at quizlast and let me know.

471
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,440
Lanode.com slash unplugged.

472
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,840
Well, while we're talking about new stuff,

473
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,160
let's mention kind of a nice win for LVFS

474
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,800
and, of course, for any users that use LVFS to upgrade.

475
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,480
More importantly.

476
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,320
ASUS is now offering their first motherboard firmware,

477
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,400
which looks like more to come now that the groundwork has

478
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
been laid down.

479
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,880
The lucky board in question is the P11C-C-4L,

480
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,440
which is a workstation or server board.

481
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,840
It's an eATX board for the Intel Xeon ePlatform.

482
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,080
So maybe not one you've got on hand,

483
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,840
but you've got to start somewhere.

484
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,680
Actually, it would be a really solid workstation.

485
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,080
And if I had built a workstation around that motherboard,

486
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,840
I'd be feeling real good right now

487
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,920
that I was getting firmware updates via LVFS.

488
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,320
And you know that's just the beginning.

489
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,720
There's going to be more.

490
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,520
And it's a nice little win for the project.

491
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Also, fwupd, the front end that you

492
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,720
see on your machine that communicates with that service,

493
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,400
got a nice update.

494
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,520
There's various things you can go read in the show notes

495
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,120
if you want.

496
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,160
But the one thing that I like to see in here

497
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,240
is a plug-in has been developed for the Pinebook Pro.

498
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,040
Although, Huzy in here notes that it needs further work

499
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,520
before it'll actually work correctly.

500
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,880
But I like that it's there and that it's possible.

501
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,320
Yeah, right?

502
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,040
I mean, OK, you need a little help from the vendor

503
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,640
to make sure you can figure out which keyboard layout is

504
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,440
installed, getting the touchpad version worked out correctly.

505
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,840
But if you've got the bones, that's

506
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,160
the best place to be to add on these little things

507
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,240
to make it really work.

508
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,480
You talking about the doctor?

509
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,320
I sure am.

510
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,640
It's nice to see this thing hum right along, isn't it?

511
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,880
If you think about it, a couple of years ago,

512
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,280
none of this existed.

513
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,360
And the idea that you wouldn't have

514
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,520
to be booting into this sketchy DOS boot

515
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,200
disk or, God forbid, Windows to update your firmware,

516
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,320
I just expected that and kind of never updated my firmware.

517
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,160
Now I'm just in home software, and I'm updating my firmware

518
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,600
anytime I see one.

519
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,000
Well, this next update is just one I wanted to mention.

520
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,600
It came out over the weekend, and we've

521
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,760
had mostly just cloudy skies here in the Pacific Northwest,

522
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,080
which is nice, actually, because it acts as nature's blanket,

523
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,560
and it keeps us warm.

524
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,160
So I don't mind the clouds at all in the evening.

525
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,440
But every now and then, there's been a break, and just

526
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,800
the most brilliant stars.

527
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,720
And so I have kind of taken up an interest in those night sky

528
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,560
apps for the phone.

529
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,940
We kind of can pan the phone around

530
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,600
and see what constellations and what nots you're looking at.

531
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,200
And K-Stars is among one of a handful

532
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,520
of just really fantastic apps to do this for your Linux desktop.

533
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,620
And version 3.50 came out this last weekend.

534
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,280
And this release marks a significant milestone

535
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,640
for K-Stars because they've done the integration of Stellar

536
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,200
Solver, which, get ready for this,

537
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,600
is a cross-platform sex tractor.

538
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,320
Just what you need, right?

539
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,120
I can relate.

540
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,240
Let me tell you, Wes.

541
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,280
Let me tell you.

542
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,980
It also integrates with astronomy.net's

543
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,800
based internal astro-metric solver, which

544
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,240
this is getting serious, Wes.

545
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,160
I'm hoping maybe you can explain some of this to me.

546
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,660
Yeah, OK.

547
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,360
So there's already some tools out there

548
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,800
to do these things that you might need to do if you're

549
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
an amateur astronomer.

550
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,840
You're trying to make sense of the night sky

551
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,440
and plot things correctly, including astrometry.net.

552
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,400
But that application is command line only

553
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,360
and has some rather nasty dependencies,

554
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,580
depending on what system you're on.

555
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,080
Or maybe you're just more focused on staring up at the sky

556
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,880
and appreciating the beauty of the universe

557
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,760
or about tracking down LibJPG.

558
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,840
I can appreciate that.

559
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,760
Sure.

560
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,040
So now, with this integration with Stellar Solver,

561
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,160
you don't have to fuss with any of that stuff.

562
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,120
You just get K-Stars installed, and you're good to go.

563
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,320
Yeah, that is really nice and simple.

564
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,920
Because this is like one of those great little demos

565
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,800
when your family member or a kid even has questions or yourself.

566
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,960
And you just want to just sit down and get the answer

567
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,200
and kind of demonstrate some of the cool open-source software

568
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,160
that's out there.

569
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,960
So some real significant retooling went inside K-Stars

570
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,160
to integrate this stuff.

571
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,160
And they feel like it's going to be

572
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,600
a big benefit for their end users.

573
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,880
They seem very excited about it.

574
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,220
They put a lot of work into it.

575
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,440
And it's just a cool piece of software to remind you.

576
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,960
There's a big universe up there, Wes, and it's open source.

577
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,200
There's also an Android version.

578
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
Yeah, there's an Android version,

579
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,440
which I'm actually just going to have to give that a try.

580
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,960
Because I've got a couple of apps for trying to identify,

581
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,040
hey, just what star is that, or planet up there?

582
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,120
But all of them are free Android apps.

583
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,600
And therefore, terrible.

584
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,880
But you still haven't explained to me what a sex tractor is.

585
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,160
Maybe when you're older.

586
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,760
And also, I'm not even sure I know

587
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,320
what an astronomic plane is.

588
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,560
I read through this project announcement

589
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,760
and realized, man, there's a lot I don't know.

590
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,560
So apparently, you need an astronomic plate solver.

591
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,240
And I didn't even know astronomic plates

592
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,680
were a problem.

593
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,200
Yeah, well, I think a lot of this

594
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,700
comes down to when you're trying to match up

595
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,000
what are you looking at and match it to existing things

596
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,480
in star catalogs, say.

597
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,160
So here I am in the universe.

598
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,600
Here's what I'm looking at.

599
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,880
How do I find out actually where that is on the larger

600
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,040
picture of the night sky and what I can catalog

601
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,840
and know as a reference is there?

602
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,000
All right, well, let's clean it up around here a little bit

603
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,240
and do some housekeeping.

604
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,920
Shout out to the Luplug who had, sounds

605
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,620
like a very productive jellyfin bugathon this last Sunday.

606
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,480
They found some bugs and proved some documentation

607
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,580
and increased distro compatibility.

608
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,520
So like, wow, congratulations, you guys.

609
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,560
That sounds like it was a big success.

610
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,360
And I want to extend an invitation to anyone else

611
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,920
in the open source community who would like to participate

612
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,640
in our bugathons.

613
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,000
We have a dedicated matrix channel.

614
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,960
And you can join that matrix channel

615
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,640
on our jupitabroadcasting.com matrix server

616
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,880
and raise your hand in there.

617
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,680
And they'll jump on it, and they'll help organize it.

618
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,840
And then we'll promote it on the show here

619
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,400
so we get some people to show up and help

620
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,640
get a lot of eyes on it.

621
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,480
The idea behind this is to help developers in a way that

622
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,880
is within their bandwidth.

623
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,200
We don't want to just organize hundreds of people on the show

624
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,760
to just throw a bunch of bug reports at a project

625
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,960
and inundate them with a bunch of technical debt

626
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,640
that they can never address and burn them out.

627
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,880
We want to work with developers on their terms.

628
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,160
So they've set aside time.

629
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,200
They're ready to work in an interactive high bandwidth

630
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,640
environment where they can communicate in real time.

631
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,480
And they're there to address the issues that come up

632
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,880
and answer the questions.

633
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,160
And there's a set time window.

634
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,080
And when it's done, they go back to their life.

635
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,200
And this, I think, was a great example

636
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,200
of pulling that off because the developers there, several of them

637
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,500
were there at the same time with our community.

638
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,520
We had a lot of community participation.

639
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,840
And big results, I think, came from it.

640
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,040
So good work, guys.

641
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,600
Good work.

642
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,160
Way more productive than we were.

643
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,420
Yeah, well, you know?

644
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,060
And I think this could go, this could even

645
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,400
be a situation where if multiple developers participate

646
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,200
in the Bugathon and they join that matrix room, well,

647
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,320
some of them are sticking around afterwards.

648
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,680
And so all of a sudden, you may have a resource where projects

649
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,560
that aren't necessarily related all of a sudden

650
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
have a common chat room that they're talking in

651
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,940
and solving problems and have a community they can call upon

652
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,160
when they need some eyeballs.

653
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,080
It could go somewhere.

654
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,200
And it could all be on their terms,

655
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,160
which I think is the beautiful thing about it.

656
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,760
So keep your ears peeled, whatever the saying goes.

657
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,640
Keep your ears at the ready that don't know.

658
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,480
Your balls ready for future announcements on Bugathons.

659
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,240
And if you're interested, do contact our Luplug.

660
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,400
Things are in the works, too.

661
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,900
So be sure you're subscribed to the Jupiter Broadcasting All

662
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,200
Shows feed if you haven't already.

663
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,520
And if you're looking to sponsor on this here podcast in 2021,

664
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
give me an email.

665
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
You know, whatever.

666
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,280
I'll take it.

667
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,600
I mean, if you're going to give me money,

668
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,240
you can send me an email.

669
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,760
It's fine.

670
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,840
Chris at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

671
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,680
You go there, and maybe you'd be a good fit for our audience.

672
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,480
Let's talk.

673
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,280
Let's talk.

674
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
Let's talk.

675
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,440
Could be a good year with you and me together.

676
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,600
And that is the housekeeping.

677
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,640
All right.

678
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,440
So I'm going to share a URL in the chat room.

679
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,600
Is there an easy way for them to do this live really quick?

680
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,920
Because what we want to talk about today is Waveshare.

681
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,560
And I'm going to put you on the spot, Wes.

682
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,960
Can you explain kind of what Waveshare is

683
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,280
and why it's the coolest retro new thing?

684
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,480
Well, it's retro because of the way it sounds.

685
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,920
We'll have a sample of that in a moment, I guess.

686
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,200
But Waveshare is a neat project we found over on GitHub.

687
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,880
It's peer-to-peer file sharing using WebRTC,

688
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,840
but with signaling performed through sound.

689
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,320
This is really great.

690
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,000
So think about this as a way to transmit information.

691
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,760
I'm going to play an example of it in the show right now.

692
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,880
And if you have Waveshare set up and you

693
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,360
play this portion of the show back,

694
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,800
you will receive data from it.

695
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,440
It will decode data for you.

696
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,240
Here's an example.

697
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,360
This is the slow mode.

698
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:14,680
A little unpleasant on the ears, but it

699
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,240
is magic to my old man ears in the sense

700
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,280
that it completely reminds me of a modem.

701
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,600
Yeah, it sure does.

702
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,000
And it's kind of just a neat technology in general.

703
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,240
Now, Waveshare, the project itself is even more impressive

704
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,080
because it basically lets you set up a WebRTC connection

705
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,320
with no server side involved at all, just peer-to-peer.

706
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,320
And it's powered by this underlying technology

707
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,200
that can encode data in these audio tones.

708
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,600
Yeah, it's like a modulator demodulator.

709
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,800
Yeah, the current approach uses a multi-frequency, frequency

710
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,560
shift keying modulation scheme.

711
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:54,160
The data to be transmitted is first split into 4-bit chunks.

712
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,520
And then at each time slice, three bytes

713
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,200
are transmitted using six tones, one tone for each 4-bit chunk.

714
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,600
And you can kind of hear that as it

715
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,120
alternates between the tones in the sample.

716
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,960
Yeah, and we'll have a link in the show notes

717
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,200
that has a web-embedded version of this

718
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,400
that you could play with.

719
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,960
But it also has a really pretty straightforward command line

720
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,880
interface, too.

721
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,280
Yeah, so the web version is a little more involved

722
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,440
because it lets you set up a connection that, if you've

723
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,880
got your own network going, it uses

724
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,520
sound to establish the connection.

725
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,080
So you've got two laptops, you've

726
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,760
got their microphones on, you've got their speakers ready.

727
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,880
You can just connect them via sound and the local network

728
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,360
and then swap files back and forth.

729
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,480
But underneath that is this little technology

730
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,240
to actually just encode and decode

731
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,440
from these fun audio samples.

732
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,840
And Waveshare's got a nice little command line client,

733
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,920
super easy to get going.

734
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,600
You just clone the repo.

735
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,100
They've got build instructions right

736
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,720
in the README, which, of course, we'll

737
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
have linked in the show notes.

738
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,120
And then it just prompts you.

739
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,840
You can enter text to encode it.

740
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,480
Or if you just leave it open, it starts

741
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,600
listening on your microphone, you play back the podcast,

742
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,520
and you'll get Chris's little secret link.

743
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,200
Yeah, there is a secret message that we have embedded.

744
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,680
So I played for you the slow version.

745
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,000
There is also a fast version that, well, is faster.

746
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,440
And not like a ton, but I'll play it

747
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,080
so you can hear the difference here.

748
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,080
And you could also capture this and then get the secret message.

749
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:36,480
Oh, hey, oh, I completely forgot to mention this,

750
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,360
but I'm doing a Black Friday sale for the Unplugged Core

751
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,040
Contributors.

752
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,720
Random plug, if you want it to become one.

753
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,960
I'm taking two bucks off, unpluggedcore.com.

754
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,760
Keep the show independent, help reduce the ad load needed,

755
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,800
and get one of two feeds, limited ad feed or full

756
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,360
live stream, no cuts, no edits, all the nitty gritties.

757
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,800
You get to hear how Chris tries to pronounce it,

758
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,000
the really embarrassing part.

759
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,760
That's probably true.

760
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,640
It turns out several people, at least, people tell me,

761
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,080
are listening to the totally unedited feed

762
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,720
because when we recorded early, we

763
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,300
started getting feedback into the show

764
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,160
before we'd even posted the episode.

765
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,440
This is like, that was weird.

766
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,600
But that's totally a thing.

767
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Like, if you sign up and become a core contributor,

768
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,080
you can get the live feed.

769
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,480
And we try to post that as soon as possible after we record.

770
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,360
So if we record on a Sunday, it means

771
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,040
you're going to get the show on a Sunday.

772
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,120
I don't know if that works better for you.

773
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,800
But when that comes up, which may come up from time to time,

774
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,200
that's a nice perk of getting that feed.

775
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,640
And right now, if you use the promo code BlackFriday,

776
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,200
all one word, you use that coupon code BlackFriday,

777
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,360
it'll take two bucks off.

778
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,200
And I'm not going to do that very often.

779
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,720
So take advantage of that.

780
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,760
And you can just go, I mean, I don't know.

781
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,320
I haven't done it.

782
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,080
You can just go to unpluggedcore.com.

783
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,160
And when you're checking out, put that Black Friday coupon

784
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,080
code in there.

785
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,220
Anyways, that was totally random and unplanned.

786
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,960
Back to Waveshare.

787
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,840
It's fun in like a spy sense, Wes.

788
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,240
Like, it makes me fantasize about sending secret messages

789
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,000
at the end of every episode of the podcast.

790
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,360
Like, we could fire off a little tone,

791
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,700
and it would give the audience like an extra little bonus

792
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,600
link that if they wanted to run through a thing,

793
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,140
it could give them a special thing.

794
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,360
Like, it's all these fun ways to actually use it.

795
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,840
But I don't know how practical it is.

796
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,400
Have you given thoughts to how you could practically use this?

797
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,000
Yeah, I don't know that we need it especially often

798
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,480
in our current day-to-day world.

799
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,180
But I think it's an interesting proof of concept.

800
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,480
It's a neat hack with some existing technology.

801
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,160
And it's kind of convenient that this can all

802
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,200
live on a totally serverless, just a static web page.

803
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,100
So if you wanted to be able to quickly share files

804
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,400
with devices, you could have this

805
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,880
going on your local network.

806
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,320
There's instructions in the GitHub

807
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,440
for if you want to get this all built and host it yourself.

808
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,080
Totally possible.

809
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,000
And then it's all powered by WebRTC,

810
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,440
which is just really neat because it

811
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,560
turns your browser into this powerful communications agent.

812
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,820
So not only are we using that to actually send audio data back

813
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,020
and forth right now, but here on the browser,

814
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,280
you can use it for just sending regular data,

815
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,940
transmitting files, whatever you need.

816
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,580
And you don't have to worry about a larger connection

817
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,700
to the internet to poke holes through firewalls

818
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,440
to get everything working or have to set up and maintain

819
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,000
some sort of handshake server that does the signaling

820
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,400
and sets up the WebRTC connection for you.

821
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,520
As long as you've got speakers and a microphone,

822
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,440
this can do it.

823
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,400
Yeah, that's the fun thing about it, I think.

824
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,120
Smartphone, computer, podcast playback.

825
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,560
So that's the thing I think that's really fun.

826
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,360
So that's called Wave Share.

827
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,320
We'll have a link in the show notes.

828
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,400
And you could do the three different speeds if you want.

829
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,940
I think the easiest way to use it

830
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,200
is how we're probably using it.

831
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,900
The most straightforward is to transmit

832
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,160
a small bit of information, like a URL.

833
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,760
And that URL then sends you to the larger bit of information.

834
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,120
Because otherwise, I mean, could you

835
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,300
do a base encode of some kind for the image?

836
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,280
And could you actually transmit the image, Wes?

837
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,560
Yeah, absolutely.

838
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,600
You just have to be willing to listen back to the audio.

839
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,880
Yeah.

840
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,800
There is an even faster speed that we haven't tried yet.

841
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,600
Oh, really?

842
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,560
Like a hyper speed?

843
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,440
Ultrasonic, they call it.

844
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,920
But is it actually ultrasonic?

845
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,480
We'll have to find out.

846
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,560
Man, computers, how do they work?

847
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,360
How do they work?

848
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,600
I think magnets.

849
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,520
ByteBitton, you have a vision of how this could be used.

850
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,480
And I like it.

851
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,440
Yeah, so not all phones have NFC.

852
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,560
And you have got the royalty fees

853
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,600
for having NFC implemented in there

854
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,320
for headsets and other Bluetooth kind of devices.

855
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,920
So well, headsets usually already have a microphone

856
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,560
in them.

857
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:38,240
So you have the app that sends a pairing code.

858
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,080
And that way, it's just setting your headphone in pairing mode.

859
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,200
It starts listening.

860
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,040
And your app sends that audio.

861
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,480
And you've got a pair.

862
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,560
That's also something they use with Furbys, for example.

863
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:54,800
The newer generation back then had a chirp app kind of thing.

864
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,240
And I also remember something that

865
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,040
was developed on Android where you could send messages

866
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,880
with a sort of chirp from Android phone to Android phone

867
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,680
using this kind of technology.

868
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,160
Yeah, what a great way to pair information or maybe even

869
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,840
transmit Wi-Fi passwords between two local devices

870
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,160
if they're trusted that isn't something that's audible

871
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,520
that anybody could hear.

872
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,240
It just should take off everywhere.

873
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,160
This seems like it'd be great on smartphones.

874
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,640
Great way to pair a Linux watch to a Linux phone.

875
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,100
Yeah, they're already listening to everything

876
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,440
you're doing anyways, right?

877
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,840
Why not make it useful?

878
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,040
Look at you busting out the bacon there.

879
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,640
I like it.

880
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,120
I thought we should share it with you guys.

881
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,000
It's a super fun one.

882
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,520
And it's an opportunity that we could put it in the show.

883
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,800
Yeah, so just to rehash the easiest way

884
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,040
to go find the secret little message,

885
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,520
go check out the repo, build the command line tool,

886
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,920
and play the podcast right back at it.

887
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

888
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,880
And you get the secret bonus content

889
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,240
that reveals the real star of the show, I think.

890
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,560
Indeed it does.

891
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,880
Putting us to shame.

892
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,680
All right, Wes.

893
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,480
Well, before we get to the picks,

894
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,200
let's do a little bit of feedback.

895
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,600
I think we've got enough time to get to a couple of them.

896
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,040
And this one got my interest.

897
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,320
I didn't get a chance to read this one before the show.

898
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,280
But it's from Eric.

899
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,000
And it's about his wonderful workstation,

900
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,920
which that gets my interest.

901
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,520
He says, in episode 380, you guys

902
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,720
asked about our setup and workloads.

903
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,400
The company I work for develops a desktop software package

904
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,780
for image analysis and quantification.

905
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,360
It has some really awesome 3D rendering capabilities

906
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,440
and support for deep learning image processing

907
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,840
with TensorFlow.

908
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,200
I have a pretty sweet workstation

909
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
to develop and test our own software.

910
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,240
I'm running an AMD Threadripper 2970 WX with 24 cores

911
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,360
and 128 gigabytes of RAM, one NVIDIA Quattro RTX 8000,

912
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:54,720
and two RTX 2080 Supers with an NVLink bridge.

913
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Whoa.

914
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,840
I just got to breathe that in for a second.

915
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,160
I got to just sit with that for a moment.

916
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,400
Wow.

917
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,280
He goes on to say, I admit this workstation is

918
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,960
super overkill for software development,

919
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,360
but I recently managed to convince my managers

920
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,200
that we need to sell a VDI, a virtual desktop infrastructure

921
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,720
solution, to our customers rather than trying to get

922
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,480
their IT department to set it up.

923
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,600
I've been developing a framework for easily deploying

924
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,520
a local cloud system with VDI that

925
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,920
meets our customers' needs.

926
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,720
And I'm using Terraform, which Wes mentioned

927
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,160
in the past episode, to reallocate resources

928
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,520
from one VM to another without having

929
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,400
to code the API calls to the hypervisor myself.

930
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:31,920
Yeah.

931
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,120
By the way, that's why one of the reasons

932
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,880
I mentioned in our Linode read that it has Terraform support,

933
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,600
because that kind of crap is amazing.

934
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,560
Exactly.

935
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,400
What do you call it, Wes?

936
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,040
You call it that infrastructure by code?

937
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,000
Is that what you call it?

938
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,680
Yeah, right?

939
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,800
Well, don't you want it as code?

940
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,640
Everything code.

941
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,720
That sounds fancy.

942
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,380
He says, he goes on to say, I recently

943
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,680
added the RTX 8000 to my setup and started

944
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,160
playing with GPU pass-through.

945
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,840
Oh, yeah.

946
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:57,240
And also NVIDIA's virtual GPU capabilities,

947
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,160
which Terraform supports with VMware.

948
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,760
Wow.

949
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,080
It's really amazing nowadays how much one person can automate

950
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,700
with great tools like Packer, Terraform, and Ansible,

951
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,440
even if it's on corporate premises.

952
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,960
Sadly, I'll soon have to ship out my three video cards

953
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,880
to the head office so that our staff can

954
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,840
use my local cloud solution and integrate that

955
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,680
into their real workflows.

956
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,520
I'll be left with my humble GTX 1060.

957
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,920
Oh, wow.

958
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,160
You know, I've been thinking a lot about my future laptop.

959
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,720
Because I think everybody that listened to the show

960
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,600
for a while knows that I threw Linux Academy, then

961
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,520
a Cloud Guru.

962
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,560
I had a ThinkPad that I thought was really great.

963
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,920
But when that wrapped up, that was a company machine.

964
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,360
I no longer had access to it and had to send that back.

965
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,280
And I've been thinking for a long time,

966
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,200
like, what will I go to next?

967
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,880
And I've been really watching the market.

968
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,920
And it has crossed my mind a few times

969
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,060
that one thing that is just inescapable when

970
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,480
you're pricing a laptop and you're

971
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,440
looking at speccing a laptop is you

972
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,160
could get so much more with that same money in a workstation.

973
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,320
And that's a hard pill to swallow.

974
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,520
But when you need mobile, you need mobile.

975
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,800
And there's just no getting around it.

976
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,320
But yeah, that has been something

977
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,720
I've been watching closely and thinking,

978
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,560
I'll see what Apple does with the ARM machines.

979
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,160
You'll see where we get with the ThinkPad X ones that

980
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,280
come with Fedora.

981
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,780
And then System76 just updated the Galago.

982
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,320
So I've been sitting back and watching

983
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,800
and hearing Eric talk about his workstation

984
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,160
and knowing in the back of my mind what I could do with that.

985
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,280
Do you want to read the next one?

986
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah, sure.

987
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,360
OK, so next feedback.

988
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,920
Andrew writes into the show asking about container host

989
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,600
choices, something near and dear to your heart there, Chris.

990
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,900
He's looking to repurpose an HP Elite Desk G4 Mini,

991
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,160
i7, 16 gigs of RAM, 500 gig NVMe,

992
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,040
nothing to shrink at all.

993
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,880
As a container management host for home automation services.

994
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,720
And he writes that he'd like to use something that would allow

995
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,520
him to avoid manually rebuilding in the future

996
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,560
should anything go wrong.

997
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,960
But he doesn't have any experience with things

998
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,800
like NixOS or Ansible.

999
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,160
What would our recommended approach be?

1000
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,920
OK, I know you're probably going to recommend something

1001
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,360
that's more practical and would be a better skill that

1002
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,560
could be used for employment opportunities and whatnot.

1003
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,160
So I'm going to go the other way.

1004
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,560
And I'm going to say, Andrew, you

1005
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,440
may be just kind of reading this email,

1006
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,400
kind of reading where you are at technically,

1007
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,120
just between the lines.

1008
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,320
There's a real easy solution depending on what you need.

1009
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,520
And it's called Home Assistant, my friend.

1010
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,640
You can get the entire Home Assistant stack, which

1011
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,560
includes a supervisor container which can manage and install

1012
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,560
machines, but also more importantly, snapshot,

1013
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,240
restore them, back them up, help you do easy installations

1014
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,400
with just about any popular open source automation or hosting

1015
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,640
service out there from DNS to ad blocking

1016
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,920
to virtual machine managers.

1017
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,960
I mean, the whole nine yards can now

1018
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,720
be deployed when you're using the entire Home Assistant

1019
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,640
stack versus just like Home Assistant Core, which

1020
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,000
would be the container version.

1021
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,080
But if you get their whole purpose OS,

1022
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,200
or there's other ways to go about getting it on a Linux

1023
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,840
box, you have a system that makes this really approachable

1024
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,920
and is using really modern tools under the hood.

1025
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,920
Now, it's not what you're going to want

1026
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,960
to use at any kind of scale.

1027
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,760
You're not going to want to use it in an enterprise deployment.

1028
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,080
You're not going to want to put this necessarily on a resume.

1029
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,400
But if you have a home machine and you're particularly

1030
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,820
looking at automation, this is one

1031
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,120
of the things people don't understand about Home Assistant

1032
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,680
is it has a lot of really well-managed one-click

1033
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,480
deployments of very popular open source software.

1034
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,880
And it gives you an easy snapshot backup management

1035
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,200
update UI on top of it, and then has an extensible community

1036
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,880
hack store you can add if you want.

1037
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,320
And it's just all one stack OS that you could actually

1038
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,800
just flash to a Raspberry Pi 4 image and run it all day long,

1039
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,960
which I do.

1040
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,400
And I am extremely sensitive to performance.

1041
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,240
And it's just all out there for the taking.

1042
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,960
And I don't think enough people appreciate or understand it

1043
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,520
because they're not listening to self-hosted.

1044
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,240
End of rant.

1045
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,520
Ah, maybe they should head over to self-hosted.show

1046
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,760
and check that out, where there's many fine episodes

1047
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,200
that touch on basically all of this.

1048
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,760
Yeah, you like how I turned it into a plug?

1049
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,000
But I'm sure you'd probably have something that might

1050
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,920
be a little more practical.

1051
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,360
Well, I mean, I think it depends.

1052
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,640
He writes container host.

1053
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,760
If it is just containers and pretty much everything

1054
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,840
in containers, I think you can get

1055
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,680
a good amount of mileage just from Docker Compose.

1056
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,440
If you don't really customize anything on the system,

1057
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,320
it's just sort of a bog standard LTS

1058
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,320
installer, the latest Fedora.

1059
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,880
Install Docker and go from there.

1060
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,760
That can work pretty well if you're OK

1061
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
with that level of involvement.

1062
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,880
Otherwise, over on Linux Action News,

1063
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,080
we recently talked about the new backup server

1064
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,040
that Proxmox has going.

1065
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,920
And I wonder if, especially if maybe you've

1066
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,400
got some mixed workloads, some VMs with some containers

1067
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,080
involved, that might be an interesting choice as well.

1068
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,800
That's a great point.

1069
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,240
Proxmox is maybe something you should seriously

1070
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,560
consider as at least the base of whatever home solution

1071
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,800
you're going to do for hosting.

1072
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,760
Because even if you deploy the applications in a container,

1073
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,720
it's nice to have that host OS in a VM.

1074
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,040
Because if this is successful, then it

1075
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,120
makes it easy to migrate to a more powerful box

1076
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,320
in a couple of years.

1077
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,120
If you experience a failure, having everything virtualized

1078
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,600
makes it significantly easier to backup and then thus restore.

1079
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,160
And it abstracts out the hardware,

1080
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,280
so that way you could move it about in the future.

1081
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,320
You could even do things like take snapshots and then

1082
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,000
test an upgrade.

1083
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,200
If it doesn't work, roll back the entire OS.

1084
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,080
So I think, like I knew he would,

1085
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,840
I think Wes nailed it with the Proxmox recommendation.

1086
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,400
And with that new Proxmox backup server,

1087
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,000
that is even more of a solid choice.

1088
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,880
And if you're not familiar with it, well, right into the show

1089
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,920
and let us know if you'd like to hear about that.

1090
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,720
Because it's something Wes and I are debating,

1091
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,920
spending some time with, and then reporting back

1092
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,600
on the show.

1093
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,920
Lastly, Cory wrote in.

1094
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,160
Everybody went to linuxunplug.com contact, right?

1095
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,480
Cory wrote in and said, have you guys heard of Podify?

1096
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,660
All right, get ready.

1097
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,200
If you're going down the road, you

1098
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,240
may need to pull over and listen to this one,

1099
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,880
because this is a game changer.

1100
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,640
Podify uses YouTube DL to create podcast RSS feeds, which

1101
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,400
then you subscribe to in your podcast catcher of choice

1102
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,760
or some other mechanism.

1103
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,640
How awesome.

1104
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,560
We're out of a job.

1105
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,520
Yeah, Cory just, I think, just maybe came in

1106
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,280
with the best pick of 2020.

1107
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,520
How did we not find this, Wes?

1108
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,320
This is amazing.

1109
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,760
So again, it's called Podify.

1110
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,560
We'll have a link to it in the show notes.

1111
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,240
It's up on GitHub.

1112
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,400
And it's awesome.

1113
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,440
I even like the UI.

1114
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,760
It's simple, straightforward.

1115
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,760
Yeah.

1116
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,120
Self-hosted, you get a web UI.

1117
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,260
You paste in your YouTube link.

1118
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,040
And then it downloads it with YouTube DL in the background,

1119
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,880
adds it to a feed.

1120
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,120
And then you can go add that feed

1121
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,920
to whatever RSS player, podcast player of your choice,

1122
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,040
and then have access to the stuff right there.

1123
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,960
Way better than me downloading it manually

1124
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,640
and then using Telegram to send it to myself.

1125
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,280
Yeah, I think I've got to give this a go and then

1126
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,040
do a report back.

1127
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,320
But I might hold that report back for self-hosted,

1128
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,600
because this is totally up that show's alley.

1129
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,880
This turned into a big plug fest.

1130
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,120
That is so great, Cory.

1131
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,600
If you have a pick similar to that

1132
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,600
or something else you find really useful,

1133
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,480
do send it in to us.

1134
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,040
We love those submitted at linuxunplug.com

1135
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,040
slash contact, because that's great.

1136
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,120
Now, speaking of picks, this one feels sort of not

1137
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,600
as awesome now.

1138
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,200
Cory stole your thunder.

1139
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,880
Yeah, I got to follow Cory.

1140
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,680
But I stumbled across dev fonts this week.

1141
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,480
He was making the rounds on the internet,

1142
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,440
and I wanted to pass it along to our community.

1143
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,840
It is a way to go look at some really well-known popular fonts

1144
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,480
that are quote unquote for developers.

1145
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,880
But they're really for anybody who

1146
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,560
likes very readable fonts in either their terminal, which

1147
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,960
is what I really recommend you do,

1148
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,760
or in your text editor of choice.

1149
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,600
And there's a bunch of famous ones in there

1150
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,480
and probably some you've never seen before.

1151
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,760
And what's really nice about this website,

1152
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,640
beyond some of the filtering options and whatnot,

1153
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,040
is it gives you a preview in a code editor.

1154
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,240
So you can see what the font looks like in the content

1155
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,000
you'll be using.

1156
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,380
And it's a really clever website,

1157
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,920
so I wanted to give it a plug.

1158
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,520
It's devfonts.gafl.dev.

1159
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,160
But I'll have a link in the show notes,

1160
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,200
so you don't have to try to remember that.

1161
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,680
But it's devfonts is the website.

1162
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,200
You can probably just Google it, too.

1163
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,400
I think that's an I.

1164
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,200
Oh, OK.

1165
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:03,960
Oh, you're right.

1166
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,480
Sorry.

1167
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,840
I got across the room.

1168
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,720
They should have used a better font.

1169
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,200
devfonts.gafl.dev.

1170
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,640
Yeah, that's got to be it.

1171
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,280
That's why the link would just be a better way to go.

1172
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,160
But don't you like how it previews it for you

1173
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,740
and you can kind of get a sense of it?

1174
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,360
Oh, yeah.

1175
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,440
You can choose different themes.

1176
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,200
You can also change the syntax highlighting.

1177
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,480
So if you want to paste in some of your own work or code

1178
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,800
samples to see how it looks in Python or Ruby or Java,

1179
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,760
well, that's an easy little dropdown.

1180
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,240
And they've got a lot of nice options here.

1181
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,080
Cascadia code right at the top, which

1182
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,480
is Microsoft's new dev-focused font.

1183
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,040
Right below that is Fira code, which

1184
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,480
is one I use myself because I'm a sucker

1185
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,240
for those fancy ligatures.

1186
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,280
Yeah, I really like that one, too.

1187
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,720
I find it makes my terminal much more readable when

1188
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
you need to distinguish important little bits there.

1189
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,200
And then once I get it going in my terminal,

1190
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,600
I'm like, well, now I want it in my text editor, too.

1191
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,440
Put it everywhere.

1192
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,260
It's pretty nice.

1193
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,600
So check that out.

1194
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,160
Link to that.

1195
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,040
Not nearly as cool as Potify.

1196
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,000
But Potify, I'm going to knock at one point

1197
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
because of that name.

1198
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,080
It sounds like a Docker management tool.

1199
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,040
It sounds like a Podman tool or something, right?

1200
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,040
Potify.

1201
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,320
So I'm knocking at a point.

1202
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,240
All right, all right.

1203
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,280
You still win.

1204
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,080
Yeah, that's what I'm going for.

1205
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,040
Thanks, Wes.

1206
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,360
I needed that win.

1207
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,680
You know what else I need is I need you to join us live.

1208
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,960
Yeah, so how about you do it?

1209
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,000
Because we'd love to have you join us live at jblive.tv.

1210
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,160
We put the times up at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1211
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,360
But nominally, it happens Tuesday at noon Pacific,

1212
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,400
3 PM Eastern.

1213
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,680
The other live show we have right now is Coda Radio.

1214
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,180
But you never know.

1215
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,180
I'm thinking about doing more live stream stuff.

1216
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,840
So if you haven't followed us on Twitch,

1217
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,920
that's maybe the best way to know when we're going live.

1218
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,400
If you use Twitch, you can, I don't know,

1219
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,080
subscribe or follow or whatever.

1220
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,240
I don't think there's a bell.

1221
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,480
But you can get involved over there

1222
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,760
in some way with our channel.

1223
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,040
And then you get notifications when we go live.

1224
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,040
Old Man Chris tells the internet how to use Twitch.

1225
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,520
And then there's the YouTube, which

1226
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,360
is truly the source of all evil on the internet.

1227
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,240
But you can also, if you bell us up over there,

1228
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,880
I think you get the notification should the algorithm so

1229
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,880
deem when we're live.

1230
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,220
And the reason why I mention that

1231
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,520
is because I'm going to be experimenting coming up

1232
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,920
after the holidays predominantly.

1233
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,080
But even maybe before the end of the year,

1234
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,560
I'm going to experiment with a couple of different show ideas.

1235
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,880
And I thought, I'll do it on the live stream.

1236
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,840
And I'd like to get your feedback.

1237
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,960
So if you're not already following us

1238
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,000
on one of the places where you can watch us live,

1239
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,960
it might be worth it.

1240
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,400
Because you never know what could be there.

1241
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,280
You never know.

1242
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,720
Also, just one more plug for Linux Action News.

1243
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,480
I'm really happy where that's at.

1244
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,520
I think Wes has been able to really add

1245
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,600
a lot of value to the show.

1246
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,580
And while I still miss doing it with Joe,

1247
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,000
I just love doing it with Wes.

1248
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,880
And if you're not subscribed to Linux Action News,

1249
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,680
you're missing a lot of what we cover.

1250
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,080
I think truly one of the best ways

1251
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,640
to stay informed in free software and the open source

1252
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,800
world is weekly.

1253
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,320
There's just enough there every week

1254
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,240
that changes that it's good to keep track of that stuff.

1255
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,200
And there's a lot of stories we're not putting in this show.

1256
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,760
Because this show is really focused more on community stuff

1257
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,000
and things that we can get a conversation really

1258
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,240
rolling about and looking at like Fedora in the future.

1259
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,520
But Linux Action News is like the things that really

1260
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,080
happened in the open source world that week that matter.

1261
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,000
And it's been really great having you on there, Wes.

1262
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,380
So if you guys out there haven't subscribed to that yet,

1263
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:17,520
go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for that.

1264
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,400
But see you next week.

1265
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,920
Same bad time, same bad station.

1266
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,640
That does bring us to an end of this week's podcast.

1267
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,380
Thank you so much everybody who decided to download and listen

1268
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:28,880
to the show.

1269
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,920
Big thank you to our core contributors.

1270
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,720
But even if you're not a core contributor,

1271
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,420
we still really appreciate you listening.

1272
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,040
We're thankful for your time.

1273
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,960
We're thankful any time you have an opportunity

1274
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,360
to share the show or if you take advantage

1275
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,320
of one of our sponsors.

1276
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,320
That's all things that really matter a lot to us.

1277
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,880
And I've been ending now I think for three months officially.

1278
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,840
I think I'm crossing the three month threshold today.

1279
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,280
And I'm reflecting on that and just extremely grateful

1280
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,320
for all of you out there.

1281
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,160
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

1282
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,520
of the Unplugged program.

1283
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,040
And we will indeed see you right back here, not Monday,

1284
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:01,800
but next Tuesday.

1285
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:28,360
Yeah!

1286
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:39,440
All right.

1287
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,460
The duty has fallen upon us to title this here podcast.

1288
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:47,740
So those of you watching live head over to JBtitles.com.

1289
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:52,780
Today's episode is a real a phonic experience because we started with peanut butter jelly

1290
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,820
time.

1291
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:57,240
And then in the middle of the show, we were transmitting you secret messages using modem

1292
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:01,260
sounds and then coming up here in a little bit, I have something else that I'm going

1293
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,260
to play for you.

1294
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,260
That's some special audio.

1295
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,520
Assuming I can get it to download.

1296
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,240
Oh, there we go.

1297
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,240
Got it.

1298
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,240
Just in time.

1299
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,240
All right.

1300
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,240
JBtitles.com.

1301
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,240
Everybody go boat.

1302
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,920
Yeah, we don't know what the title should be.

1303
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,920
We can't know.

1304
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,280
Wes, I'm getting positive reports that Test Turkey 2 is doing very, very good.

1305
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,840
Ten pounds seems to be the perfect size for the smoker.

1306
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,840
I was worried.

1307
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,840
I know.

1308
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,800
And that's why I wanted to keep you up to date because I didn't want you stressing about

1309
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,800
it.

1310
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,920
Now, will we have a live stream of you eating said turkey later on?

1311
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:35,400
I don't think anybody wants that.

1312
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,560
Nobody wants that.

1313
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,680
Nobody wants to have to watch me try to carve a turkey either.

1314
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,680
Let me tell you.

1315
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,920
Maybe a sensual gravy pouring a little bit.

1316
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:49,660
I feel so embarrassed when I'm trying to carve a turkey because I feel like as a dad, I should

1317
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,660
have that down.

1318
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:54,400
And let me tell you, I am just horrible at it because you do it once every few years

1319
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,400
at best.

1320
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,080
And at least I do.

1321
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,340
So I'm not very good at it.

1322
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,440
I had a little quick thing I wanted to do.

1323
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,500
Wes and I came across this bit of audio.

1324
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,400
You guys know we're audio geeks.

1325
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,400
This is what the Perseverance rover sounds like.

1326
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,940
Now, Wes, make sure I don't mess this up.

1327
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:16,120
But they did like an internal diagnostic from the surface of Mars and captured some sound

1328
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,560
of the internal machinery.

1329
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,760
And that's what we have here, right?

1330
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,760
Yeah.

1331
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,000
So it's actually while it's on route.

1332
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,860
This is one of the first times they've attached microphones to a spacecraft like this.

1333
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,740
And the intent is to hear what it sounds like as they enter the Martian atmosphere and go

1334
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,140
in for a landing.

1335
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:35,360
But out in the void, quiet void of space, you can actually get a feeling for what it's

1336
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:40,720
like coming along, hearing its own machine, internal machinery, and nothing else in the

1337
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,720
void.

1338
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:47,160
Oh, that wasn't the right one.

1339
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,160
Dang it.

1340
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,160
Slack.

1341
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,160
Dammit.

1342
00:50:50,160 --> 00:51:00,120
You know what happens is it's a snap, and then it's not in the actual downloads folder,

1343
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:05,960
but it's in the downloads folder inside the snap folder.

1344
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,320
That's why I played the wrong one.

1345
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,800
I have been trolled.

1346
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,080
I have been trolled.

1347
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,080
Self-troll.

1348
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,080
Yeah.

1349
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:22,600
Well, you know, you don't want just Slack having loosey-goose access to your file system

1350
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,600
like an animal.

1351
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,840
All right.

1352
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,840
Here's the sound.

1353
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:36,840
Here we go.

1354
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:41,720
And I guess, I mean, it's not all that interesting, really, other than you hear some machinery

1355
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,720
in there.

1356
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,480
But one of the things, I guess, that's making the most noise is its internal heating elements.

1357
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,160
I didn't realize, of course, this makes sense.

1358
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,440
This is the rover that's en route.

1359
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,040
And when it lands, does that mean we're going to get to hear what it sounds like on Mars?

1360
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,040
Yeah, we'll see.

1361
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:59,160
I mean, I guess, as long as all the microphone equipment makes it through, yeah, because

1362
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,160
they're really aimed at experiencing what the landing is like, like the mortar that

1363
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,400
sets off the parachute that helps break its fall, all that kind of element.

1364
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,400
But in theory, if all of that survives, if it keeps working and you get it on the surface,

1365
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,120
yeah, we'll have audio from Mars.

1366
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,120
That's crazy.

1367
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,120
Yeah, it is.

1368
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,400
Tell me what you think.

1369
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,080
I've got an idea for a combo, okay?

1370
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:25,120
So tell me what you think of this combo for like the secret message of the week.

1371
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,920
So this will be, this is how we do the secret message of the week.

1372
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:35,720
The cone of silence.

1373
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,440
Can you overlap the sounds like that?

1374
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,440
Will that work?

1375
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,920
I bet so.

1376
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,720
We'll have to try it.

1377
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,720
Somebody let us know.

1378
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,720
I'll do it.

1379
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,720
I'll do it.

1380
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,280
You know, one more time and then you let us know if this works.

1381
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,240
If you're listening live, let us know.

1382
00:52:48,240 --> 00:53:10,600
The cone of silence.
