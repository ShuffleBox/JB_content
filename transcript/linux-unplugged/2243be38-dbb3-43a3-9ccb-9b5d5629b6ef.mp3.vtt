WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.580
A nice open source alternative to Google Hangouts, jangouts, did you know there's an open source

00:06.580 --> 00:07.580
alternative to Google Hangouts?

00:07.580 --> 00:11.100
Alright, hold on, before you look it up, hold on, stop, here's my prediction, okay?

00:11.100 --> 00:16.280
It will be something that is slightly less reliable than Hangouts, offers no real actual

00:16.280 --> 00:19.980
production value over Hangouts, but will be open source.

00:19.980 --> 00:23.180
It's just kind of like the same thing with, like when the guy was like, there was that

00:23.180 --> 00:28.000
web version of Jitsi, and yes, it exists, the web version of Jitsi exists, it sucks,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.220
it's totally unusable and really gives us nothing that Hangouts didn't give us, but

00:31.220 --> 00:32.220
yes, it exists.

00:32.220 --> 00:33.220
It does exist.

00:33.220 --> 00:34.220
So now let's go look at jangouts.

00:34.220 --> 00:39.100
So this is a video conferencing software based on WebRTC and the Janus Gateway with a UI inspired

00:39.100 --> 00:40.420
by Google Hangouts.

00:40.420 --> 00:43.620
It's called jangouts, it's Janus Hangouts, is what it stands for, it's a solution for

00:43.620 --> 00:46.180
video conferencing on WebRTC, there you go.

00:46.180 --> 00:49.800
It's a JavaScript application running exclusively client side, the server simply needs to provide

00:49.800 --> 00:51.740
a bunch of static files through the web server.

00:51.740 --> 00:56.620
You have to have a Janus Gateway set up, then you configure jangouts by checking it out

00:56.620 --> 01:01.780
from the git server, then you install the required things like node.js and npm, and

01:01.780 --> 01:04.180
then you get up and running, you get the node.js server started.

01:04.180 --> 01:07.580
Okay, so it's definitely more work than Hangouts, so what do I get for...

01:07.580 --> 01:09.380
Yeah, your own self-hosted Hangouts.

01:09.380 --> 01:10.380
Okay, so how is that...

01:10.380 --> 01:11.380
So it's a WebRTC...

01:11.380 --> 01:13.540
So hold on a second though, we can already do a WebRTC.

01:13.540 --> 01:14.540
I know, I don't get it.

01:14.540 --> 01:18.360
And WebRTC doesn't offer me the ability to specify codecs or video resolution or audio

01:18.360 --> 01:22.740
codecs or audio settings, I can't do that yet either, to the best of my knowledge, right?

01:22.740 --> 01:24.100
I don't know, let's go to...

01:24.100 --> 01:25.100
Yeah, you're right.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.820
You might, well, see, this is why I'm surprised you're concerned, but don't you think you're

01:27.820 --> 01:30.060
never gonna get those options unless it's something open?

01:30.060 --> 01:31.060
No, I don't...

01:31.060 --> 01:34.140
Well, no, I think they'll eventually get there, but until they do, there's no...

01:34.140 --> 01:37.420
Here's the thing, I'm all for using an open source solution, I'd be the first one to say

01:37.420 --> 01:41.420
I want to stop using Hangouts if an open source solution exists, but the problem is, it's

01:41.420 --> 01:45.540
not even that the proprietary solution is better, it's that an open source solution

01:45.540 --> 01:47.140
doesn't even exist.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.140
It's not even that...

01:48.140 --> 01:49.140
Well, Jitsi.

01:49.140 --> 01:50.140
Yeah.

01:50.140 --> 01:53.620
I can get Jitsi to work, I am 100% confident of that, and when that works, then...

01:53.620 --> 01:54.820
Can I tell you something though?

01:54.820 --> 01:55.820
Please.

01:55.820 --> 01:56.820
Please.

01:56.820 --> 01:57.820
I don't even...

01:57.820 --> 01:58.820
I have a problem with that, even.

01:58.820 --> 01:59.820
I don't even want it...

01:59.820 --> 02:00.820
It's not perfect.

02:00.820 --> 02:01.820
I don't want it even in the web browser.

02:01.820 --> 02:02.820
I don't...

02:02.820 --> 02:03.820
That's why I'm not...

02:03.820 --> 02:04.820
Well, Jitsi isn't.

02:04.820 --> 02:08.740
I know, well, WebJitsi is, and this is, like all these WebRTC things are all in the web

02:08.740 --> 02:09.740
browser.

02:09.740 --> 02:11.700
I don't want it in the web browser.

02:11.700 --> 02:12.700
You know what?

02:12.700 --> 02:15.460
On its surface, I agree with you, and for the same reason that I think that...

02:15.460 --> 02:18.540
For the same reason I haul around a laptop with me everywhere, because I'm just stuck

02:18.540 --> 02:22.620
back in the time where that's what you did, but I think to some degree that as your and

02:22.620 --> 02:25.740
I's perception of...No, hear me out.

02:25.740 --> 02:30.180
Your and I's perception that a native application is more responsive, is more reliable, is more

02:30.180 --> 02:35.700
stable than a plugin that runs inside of a web browser, because that's just a hacked

02:35.700 --> 02:38.940
together solution to accomplish what we should be using a native client for.

02:38.940 --> 02:40.500
I agree that there is...

02:40.500 --> 02:45.060
I do carry a bit of that bias, and it does make me inclined to think that.

02:45.060 --> 02:48.460
However, I'm now going to just say I'm basing this on empirical data.

02:48.460 --> 02:53.620
You look at all of the video teleconferencing we do in this network to make remote host

02:53.620 --> 02:58.020
possible, and unquestionably, the least reliable solutions are always the web-based ones.

02:58.020 --> 03:01.700
Yeah, but you've also shoehorned a solution that was never meant to be...

03:01.700 --> 03:05.100
Hangouts is great for you and Angela to sit there and chat.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.740
No, Hangouts is meant for group chat.

03:06.740 --> 03:08.340
Okay, fine, fine.

03:08.340 --> 03:12.420
Great for you and Dylan and Angela and a couple other people to sit inside of a Hangout and

03:12.420 --> 03:13.420
chat.

03:13.420 --> 03:17.140
It is not meant for transmitting broadcast quality content from one location to another.

03:17.140 --> 03:18.420
It's not what it's there for.

03:18.420 --> 03:22.180
To be fair, neither is Jitsi, and we're shoehorning that into a solution as well.

03:22.180 --> 03:29.920
But I think that the differentiating point is that Hangouts is that it wasn't designed

03:29.920 --> 03:31.540
for it, not the fact that it's web-based.

03:31.540 --> 03:33.960
I don't think it'd make any difference if Hangouts was a native application.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.060
I think it would be better suited to broadcast.

03:36.060 --> 03:41.580
In terms of the video codec quality and the audio codec quality, connection quality, and

03:41.580 --> 03:44.260
maybe even UI design.

03:44.260 --> 03:46.340
Maybe UI design, maybe not.

03:46.340 --> 03:47.860
All of that doesn't matter that's in the browser.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.060
The browser doesn't change any of that.

03:50.060 --> 03:55.460
What the browser introduces is instability, because it is one more huge, gigantic piece

03:55.460 --> 04:00.340
of software that has all of the strategy attacks associated with it that Google has with Chrome,

04:00.340 --> 04:04.180
or that Mozilla has with Firefox, or that Apple has with Safari, or that Microsoft has

04:04.180 --> 04:05.180
with IE.

04:05.180 --> 04:08.680
There's all of this strategy attacks that's associated with these browsers that all get

04:08.680 --> 04:11.480
tugged and pulled in different ways that the market wants them to go, well, you kick that

04:11.480 --> 04:12.620
guy out of the room.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.860
They want us to all go in different ways.

04:14.860 --> 04:16.500
They want to build a platform on their web browser.

04:16.500 --> 04:20.740
They're building in things like remote desktop and WebGL, all this really great technology

04:20.740 --> 04:24.780
that I don't need in my video communications program.

04:24.780 --> 04:26.460
I just need something that makes calls and does video.

04:26.460 --> 04:28.540
I don't need this entire runtime.

04:28.540 --> 04:30.980
The browser is feeling like the Java runtime to me.

04:30.980 --> 04:35.620
The browser is feeling like this entire massive virtual environment I have to have now to

04:35.620 --> 04:36.980
run these web applications.

04:36.980 --> 04:40.380
I don't want that much dependency and that much room for failure and that much room for

04:40.380 --> 04:43.900
software bugs to sit between me and my call.

04:43.900 --> 04:48.460
There is something to that is that we do introduce a lot of unneeded overhead to get done what

04:48.460 --> 04:49.460
we want to get done.

04:49.460 --> 04:54.340
The advantage to that though is that we get access to a wider variety of applications

04:54.340 --> 04:57.900
on this common platform, which is the web browser.

04:57.900 --> 05:05.140
But I think that whatever we do, if we plan to do this on Linux, I think we have to accept

05:05.140 --> 05:08.500
that we're going to have to shoehorn some solution that wasn't really meant for broadcasting,

05:08.500 --> 05:09.500
kind of shoehorn it in.

05:09.500 --> 05:13.540
But I think that between you and Rekai and I, I think we can figure out how to do that

05:13.540 --> 05:15.600
so that most of the people won't notice.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.060
When Jitsi worked, it worked great.

05:17.060 --> 05:18.060
I know.

05:18.060 --> 05:19.060
It's just getting it to work.

05:19.060 --> 05:21.420
I want to see more effort behind native apps.

05:21.420 --> 05:22.420
I really do.

05:22.420 --> 05:25.700
But you're right, there's less incentive for a lot of these people to make stuff natively

05:25.700 --> 05:26.700
for Linux.

05:26.700 --> 05:29.060
So a good web app is our best next option.

05:29.060 --> 05:31.500
And I don't think we shouldn't have web apps.

05:31.500 --> 05:35.580
I just wish it wasn't like, it feels like, I guess maybe this is more to my point, to

05:35.580 --> 05:39.720
nuance down what I'm trying to say a little bit is I feel like all of the really interesting

05:39.720 --> 05:43.060
development in video conferencing right now is all happening in the web browser.

05:43.060 --> 05:44.500
And there's really nothing happening on the native app.

05:44.500 --> 05:48.980
You've got Skype, you've got Jitsi, you've got telephony apps, Ecogea, things like that.

05:48.980 --> 05:53.340
But there's nothing really interesting happening in the native client-side application for

05:53.340 --> 05:54.340
video conferencing.

05:54.340 --> 05:57.220
All of the interesting things, all of the development, all of the energy, all the time

05:57.220 --> 05:59.540
is being focused on these web-based solutions.

05:59.540 --> 06:00.980
And WebRTC is a huge part of that.

06:00.980 --> 06:05.380
And I'm just, here we are, years into WebRTC, and I'm still not super impressed.

06:05.380 --> 06:06.380
It does...

06:06.380 --> 06:07.380
But it is getting close.

06:07.380 --> 06:09.020
And if you just want to hang out with some buddies while you're playing a game, it's

06:09.020 --> 06:10.740
like it could be a real easy replacement for Mumble.

06:10.740 --> 06:11.740
Right.

06:11.740 --> 06:15.940
And Mozilla, Firefox, Hello, whatever, like things...

06:15.940 --> 06:16.940
Which is an RTC solution.

06:16.940 --> 06:17.940
Yep.

06:17.940 --> 06:18.940
And it works great for that.

06:18.940 --> 06:22.740
So it's not that I don't want that to continue, because I absolutely want that to continue.

06:22.740 --> 06:23.740
I just also want...

06:23.740 --> 06:24.740
For a different reason.

06:24.740 --> 06:25.740
I want native apps to continue, too.

06:25.740 --> 06:26.740
I don't...

06:26.740 --> 06:28.260
I wish we wouldn't just chase the shiny so much.

06:28.260 --> 06:33.500
I wish we could continue to invest in technologies that have some good fundamentals behind them.

06:33.500 --> 06:37.380
So and you know, Palasso asks a question in the chat room, and we've gotten this in numerous

06:37.380 --> 06:41.260
times in the feedback, which is why don't we use a separate video stream and an audio

06:41.260 --> 06:42.260
stream.

06:42.260 --> 06:43.260
And the reason for that is very simple.

06:43.260 --> 06:46.260
When you send two different pieces of information from one location to the other...

06:46.260 --> 06:47.260
Especially over the internet.

06:47.260 --> 06:48.820
They arrive at different times.

06:48.820 --> 06:51.860
And not only do they arrive at different times, that time changes.

06:51.860 --> 06:52.860
It drifts.

06:52.860 --> 06:53.860
Yeah.

06:53.860 --> 06:54.860
And so sometimes the audio is ahead, and sometimes the video is ahead.

06:54.860 --> 06:55.860
Yeah.

06:55.860 --> 06:56.860
And to make Rakai sit there...

06:56.860 --> 07:00.420
You would employ a full-time person eight hours a day just to do a show where they have

07:00.420 --> 07:01.980
to sit there and line that up.

07:01.980 --> 07:02.980
It's just not practical.

07:02.980 --> 07:03.980
We just wouldn't do video.

07:03.980 --> 07:04.980
Yeah.

07:04.980 --> 07:05.980
It's just not practical.

07:05.980 --> 07:06.980
Yeah.

07:06.980 --> 07:07.980
But yeah, I give you my vote.

07:07.980 --> 07:13.340
You may not...You may not always...Everyone may not always agree with...Attack the same

07:13.340 --> 07:16.620
problem the same way, just like I probably wouldn't solve the same problems that you

07:16.620 --> 07:17.620
would solve the same way.

07:17.620 --> 07:19.540
But I can tell you this.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.540
I have a strategy.

07:20.540 --> 07:21.540
I have an idea.

07:21.540 --> 07:26.180
And once I think I put it down, I think we'll have a reliable Jitsi solution that will work.

07:26.180 --> 07:33.380
You just have to approach that box as if it's...Just pretend I am production co, and I just sold

07:33.380 --> 07:37.380
you a $5,000 video conferencing box, and you don't know what software is running on it.

07:37.380 --> 07:38.380
It's a magic box.

07:38.380 --> 07:39.380
Yeah.

07:39.380 --> 07:40.380
It's a magic box.

07:40.380 --> 07:41.380
And you just click on the button, and then it works.

07:41.380 --> 07:42.380
Yeah.

07:42.380 --> 07:43.660
That makes...That makes you make an appliance, and it stays reliable, and you don't use it

07:43.660 --> 07:44.660
for other things.

07:44.660 --> 07:45.660
Right.

07:45.660 --> 07:46.660
Yeah.

07:46.660 --> 07:51.180
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 102 for July 20th, 2015.

07:51.180 --> 08:07.340
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's getting really hydrated.

08:07.340 --> 08:10.060
Because we've got some beer drinking to do tonight.

08:10.060 --> 08:11.060
My name is Chris.

08:11.060 --> 08:12.060
My name is Noah.

08:12.060 --> 08:13.060
Hey, buddy.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.060
What are you doing in studio?

08:14.060 --> 08:15.060
I don't know.

08:15.060 --> 08:18.420
This is the show I belong on, though, because even if it's unplugged, I still like Linux.

08:18.420 --> 08:19.420
Yeah.

08:19.420 --> 08:20.420
Yeah.

08:20.420 --> 08:21.420
You were on Coder Radio early today.

08:21.420 --> 08:22.420
I appreciate that, being a non-developer and all that.

08:22.420 --> 08:23.420
Yeah.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.420
Yeah.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.420
You did good, man.

08:25.420 --> 08:26.420
You did good.

08:26.420 --> 08:27.420
Yeah.

08:27.420 --> 08:28.420
We've got a great show coming up today.

08:28.420 --> 08:29.420
We're going to do a quick update on the latest news for Ubuntu Touch in a little bit.

08:29.420 --> 08:32.380
And also, our friends over at Ubuntu Matei Project have an update.

08:32.380 --> 08:33.620
They're just asking people to test.

08:33.620 --> 08:35.180
We'll do a little coverage on that.

08:35.180 --> 08:40.600
The Free Software Foundation and the Software Conservancy have announced a deal with Canonical,

08:40.600 --> 08:42.140
a little change to the contributor agreement.

08:42.140 --> 08:44.340
We're going to talk about that today, because we've covered that before.

08:44.340 --> 08:46.260
AMD has a dirty secret.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.260
And I'll tell you it.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.260
It'll make your Linux games actually work a lot better.

08:49.260 --> 08:50.260
It's very easy.

08:50.260 --> 08:51.260
I'll tell you about that.

08:51.260 --> 08:52.260
If you've got an ATI card.

08:52.260 --> 08:53.260
This is them?

08:53.260 --> 08:54.260
Yeah.

08:54.260 --> 08:55.260
Right.

08:55.260 --> 08:56.260
Ouch, dude.

08:56.260 --> 08:59.680
And then, your good buddies, your friends over at Dell, they just took a crap on Linux

08:59.680 --> 09:00.680
users again.

09:00.680 --> 09:01.680
Oh, no.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.280
Right after they released that computer.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.280
That's the problem, actually.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.280
Oh, no.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.280
No, it's not.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.280
Yes, it is, actually.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.280
That's not the problem.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.420
So, we're going to talk about that in the second half of the show.

09:11.420 --> 09:16.220
And then, there's also something that I have been predicting for like two prediction episodes,

09:16.220 --> 09:18.500
you know, like we do them at the end of the year in Linux Action Show.

09:18.500 --> 09:19.500
Yeah.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.220
Two years in a row, I've been predicting something.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.540
And we haven't really seen it take off today.

09:23.540 --> 09:24.540
So wouldn't that mean it's wrong?

09:24.540 --> 09:25.540
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:25.540 --> 09:26.540
No, it was delayed.

09:26.540 --> 09:27.540
It was delayed.

09:27.540 --> 09:28.540
Oh, okay.

09:28.540 --> 09:29.540
All right, all right.

09:29.540 --> 09:30.540
Delayed, delayed.

09:30.540 --> 09:31.540
All right.

09:31.540 --> 09:32.540
I hate you, no.

09:32.540 --> 09:35.780
I hate you, no and why Linux users will run and scream in fear, because look at that.

09:35.780 --> 09:36.780
They're actually...

09:36.780 --> 09:37.780
Don't look at what it is.

09:37.780 --> 09:38.780
Don't look at what it is.

09:38.780 --> 09:39.780
Okay, all right.

09:39.780 --> 09:40.780
I'm not.

09:40.780 --> 09:41.780
I'm not.

09:41.780 --> 09:42.780
I'm just looking at the price.

09:42.780 --> 09:43.780
I'm just going to say it was a Kickstarter.

09:43.780 --> 09:44.780
They had a goal of $50,000 and they've already raised $530,000.

09:44.780 --> 09:45.780
Oh, my goodness.

09:45.780 --> 09:46.780
And it's going to replace the Linux desktop.

09:46.780 --> 09:47.780
Don't look.

09:47.780 --> 09:48.780
Not looking.

09:48.780 --> 09:49.780
All right, fine.

09:49.780 --> 09:50.780
All right.

09:50.780 --> 09:51.780
So, before we get into that, I wanted to start.

09:51.780 --> 09:56.580
Hugo Sylvia, who we've met, I think, at one of the conferences before, writes for opensource.com.

09:56.580 --> 10:00.920
And he did a pretty interesting write-up about different open hardware platforms that

10:00.920 --> 10:03.700
are out there right now, and I just wanted to show you this one, Noah, because I think

10:03.700 --> 10:04.700
you're going to like this one a lot.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.660
Now, there's a whole list.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.740
This one, though, from Old Spice.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.560
This is an open hardware platform.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.380
This is Old Spice muscle music.

10:12.380 --> 10:13.380
Have you seen this?

10:13.380 --> 10:14.380
No.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.380
You have not seen this?

10:15.380 --> 10:16.380
Okay, good.

10:16.380 --> 10:17.740
So, can you describe to the people listening what's going on right now?

10:17.740 --> 10:20.220
Well, I'm looking at a mostly naked man.

10:20.220 --> 10:26.020
He does seem to have something covering his band bits, and now he is flexing his muscles,

10:26.020 --> 10:27.580
and drums are going off.

10:27.580 --> 10:28.580
Oh, my goodness.

10:28.580 --> 10:29.580
Yeah.

10:29.580 --> 10:30.580
Muscle, muscle, muscle.

10:30.580 --> 10:39.060
So, he's flexing individual muscles, and each muscle correlates to another instrument.

10:39.060 --> 10:40.060
So he's able to-

10:40.060 --> 10:41.060
Well, those are all drums, I would say.

10:41.060 --> 10:42.060
By flexing his chest, his gut.

10:42.060 --> 10:43.060
And here's his keyboard solo.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.060
Okay, all right.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.060
Never mind.

10:45.060 --> 10:46.060
Not just drums.

10:46.060 --> 10:47.060
Nope.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.060
Oh, my.

10:48.060 --> 10:49.060
Yeah.

10:49.060 --> 10:55.140
So, this is the advantage of open hardware.

10:55.140 --> 11:01.140
You can build things like this.

11:01.140 --> 11:02.140
Yeah.

11:02.140 --> 11:03.140
Now he's playing flame sax.

11:03.140 --> 11:07.540
Those are saxophones that are blowing fire.

11:07.540 --> 11:09.540
For you audio listeners, you really do have to watch this.

11:09.540 --> 11:12.940
This might be worth sharing even online, because this is actually pretty funny.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.540
Now they have a view behind him, too.

11:14.540 --> 11:17.540
Would you mind explaining what this has to do with Linux?

11:17.540 --> 11:18.540
Open hardware, buddy.

11:18.540 --> 11:19.540
Open hardware.

11:19.540 --> 11:22.840
So, this is over at opensource.com, and this is just to sync you.

11:22.840 --> 11:23.840
This is just to hook you.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.700
I'm going to recommend the rest of you go check out the article.

11:25.700 --> 11:31.700
They actually have a whole list of different types of hardware and different projects.

11:31.700 --> 11:34.780
All kinds of stuff, like neuro knitting, error writing.

11:34.780 --> 11:37.460
This will work if your body isn't made out of stone and then chiseled, right?

11:37.460 --> 11:38.460
Yes.

11:38.460 --> 11:39.460
How about this one?

11:39.460 --> 11:40.460
This one we've talked about before.

11:40.460 --> 11:42.060
And they're actually developing this under Linux.

11:42.060 --> 11:47.000
We've talked a little bit about it, but it's about controlling your devices using x-ray

11:47.000 --> 11:49.060
and sonar and stuff like that.

11:49.060 --> 11:52.380
So it's like for people that have a lot of different disabilities, or just another way

11:52.380 --> 11:55.100
to interact with the computer, and they're developing all of this under Linux.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.800
And they have, so you don't even have to touch the device in order to move the cursor and

11:57.800 --> 11:58.800
things like that.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.260
They're going to try to build them into laptops.

12:00.260 --> 12:01.260
There's another example.

12:01.260 --> 12:03.740
There's a whole bunch over at opensource.com that was written up.

12:03.740 --> 12:06.220
I just played the old Spice one because I thought that one was kind of funny.

12:06.220 --> 12:07.220
It was amazing.

12:07.220 --> 12:08.220
It was.

12:08.220 --> 12:11.860
And if you got to watch the video version, you know why I played it.

12:11.860 --> 12:15.420
So just before we went right on air, Popey jumped in the room, and I was just starting

12:15.420 --> 12:16.420
to pick his brain.

12:16.420 --> 12:19.100
I saw, I think it was you, Popey, that tweeted, you're getting a new update coming out to

12:19.100 --> 12:20.100
your MX4.

12:20.100 --> 12:22.780
And it looks like this is the fifth over-the-air update since the device shipped.

12:22.780 --> 12:23.780
Is that right?

12:23.780 --> 12:24.780
Absolutely.

12:24.780 --> 12:25.780
Yeah.

12:25.780 --> 12:26.780
Tell me about it.

12:26.780 --> 12:27.780
Yeah.

12:27.780 --> 12:33.460
So I've just pasted the link to the release notes in your IRC channel.

12:33.460 --> 12:35.220
Thank you, sir.

12:35.220 --> 12:39.580
And so this update went live.

12:39.580 --> 12:44.700
It was tested over the last couple of weeks, and it went live today.

12:44.700 --> 12:52.020
And that goes straight out to MX4, Mazer MX4 users, and the BQ phone users in 4.5 NE5.

12:52.020 --> 12:53.020
So wait a minute.

12:53.020 --> 12:54.020
Hold on.

12:54.020 --> 12:55.420
You're telling me you can push out updates.

12:55.420 --> 12:56.540
Hold on now.

12:56.540 --> 13:00.300
Now the carriers are going to hold on to these updates, and the BQ is going to get it in

13:00.300 --> 13:01.460
a couple of months, right?

13:01.460 --> 13:02.460
That's how this works?

13:02.460 --> 13:03.460
No.

13:03.460 --> 13:04.460
Yeah.

13:04.460 --> 13:05.460
So that's why.

13:05.460 --> 13:11.500
I mean, I've mentioned this before on the show, but we split the updates up.

13:11.500 --> 13:16.740
The bit in the middle that you have to worry about, the Ubuntu stack, we update that, and

13:16.740 --> 13:19.340
we put those updates out.

13:19.340 --> 13:25.700
We do partner with BQ and Meizu, and those guys do a lot of testing as well.

13:25.700 --> 13:30.180
So we don't just push out updates to their customers, because they are effectively their

13:30.180 --> 13:33.180
customers.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.300
We get it validated first, and it went out today.

13:35.300 --> 13:41.300
And usually we do phased updates, where it goes out over a 24-hour period, and you may

13:41.300 --> 13:46.380
get it straight away, or you may get it later on, or you may get it tomorrow.

13:46.380 --> 13:50.700
But this time we did it all in one hit, so everybody got the update at the same time.

13:50.700 --> 13:51.700
Yeah.

13:51.700 --> 13:52.700
It's cool.

13:52.700 --> 13:53.700
Isn't it?

13:53.700 --> 13:54.700
It is really nice.

13:54.700 --> 13:59.460
And UI improvements, new icons, a new theme, but the big thing is shell rotation, which

13:59.460 --> 14:03.780
everything was mostly locked in portrait mode, but now we've made it so that you can

14:03.780 --> 14:04.780
use it in portrait and landscape.

14:04.780 --> 14:05.780
Ah.

14:05.780 --> 14:06.780
You know, there's something else.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.340
And I thought maybe it was just my Nexus 5, and I still kind of write it off as just something

14:08.340 --> 14:09.340
on my Nexus 5.

14:09.340 --> 14:12.980
I've heard now from a couple of different folks that have, I think maybe they're using

14:12.980 --> 14:17.780
the BQ, I'm not sure, but huge, huge ranges in battery life.

14:17.780 --> 14:22.180
Like some battery life is like unbelievably long, and some battery life is unbelievably

14:22.180 --> 14:23.180
short.

14:23.180 --> 14:24.180
What's going on there?

14:24.180 --> 14:25.180
Is that something?

14:25.180 --> 14:26.180
Yeah.

14:26.180 --> 14:27.180
So some of it is device-specific.

14:27.180 --> 14:33.660
So the BQ ones that we worked on early on and discovered some ways in which we can improve

14:33.660 --> 14:34.660
battery life.

14:34.660 --> 14:38.260
And they can go for days and days and days on standby, just sat on your desk and not

14:38.260 --> 14:39.260
plugged in.

14:39.260 --> 14:40.260
Yeah.

14:40.260 --> 14:41.260
These phones are on standby for like three days.

14:41.260 --> 14:43.060
They're getting battery life of three days on these Ubuntu phones.

14:43.060 --> 14:44.060
One standby.

14:44.060 --> 14:48.820
And then you turn it back on, or you wake it up and it's got 50% battery left, or some

14:48.820 --> 14:51.020
crazy amount of battery.

14:51.020 --> 14:56.460
Whereas the Meizu, we've got some known problems with it at the moment, and that's a critical

14:56.460 --> 15:00.100
bug, a high-priority critical bug that's being worked on at the moment.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.500
And I'm not sure the status of it.

15:01.500 --> 15:05.660
I've been on vacation for the last week, so I'm not sure the status of it right now.

15:05.660 --> 15:11.380
But I know there was talk of, you know, networking issues, holding, you know, chewing up.

15:11.380 --> 15:14.020
And I was almost wondering if it was just the display sensor, it almost seemed like

15:14.020 --> 15:15.020
a display bug too.

15:15.020 --> 15:16.500
Like maybe it just wasn't reading the first time.

15:16.500 --> 15:20.420
No, there's stuff going on in the background, and it's, you know, it's not necessarily,

15:20.420 --> 15:24.100
I don't know the technical details, but it's, yeah, it's being worked on.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.100
Yeah, it's cool.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.980
I'm waiting for Noah to get one.

15:26.980 --> 15:28.300
Yeah, here's the thing.

15:28.300 --> 15:33.420
I get more and more convinced every time I see them, when we were at Self, I get a chance

15:33.420 --> 15:37.020
to play with the Ubuntu phone, and there was a couple people there that were using it as

15:37.020 --> 15:43.980
a full-time device, which back at Scale, which mind you was just six months prior, they were

15:43.980 --> 15:44.980
showing them.

15:44.980 --> 15:47.260
They were like, no way would we ever carry these as a full-time device, it's just not

15:47.260 --> 15:48.260
there yet.

15:48.260 --> 15:49.260
That's in six months.

15:49.260 --> 15:52.660
And do you remember at Scale, like they had to borrow somebody's phone.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, to come over and do the demo.

15:55.380 --> 15:58.500
And now itself, like people are using those full-time phones, just in that amount of time.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.500
Yeah, it is.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.500
It has crazy cool development.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.700
You know, and I guess I have two concerns.

16:03.700 --> 16:11.300
One is, my one concern is, will there be a competitive advantage that you'll be able

16:11.300 --> 16:15.880
to leverage against things like iOS and Android?

16:15.880 --> 16:20.700
But past that, if that can be solved and we can get actual decent apps on it, I'm all

16:20.700 --> 16:22.900
in for a Linux, for an actual Linux-powered phone.

16:22.900 --> 16:23.900
Hmm.

16:23.900 --> 16:24.900
You know, let's open this up to the whole Mumbroom.

16:24.900 --> 16:25.900
Time appropriate greetings, Mumbroom.

16:25.900 --> 16:29.600
Do the rest of you have any thoughts on the future of maybe you?

16:29.600 --> 16:33.180
The whole world, I'm not asking about everybody else, I'm not asking about all this different

16:33.180 --> 16:34.220
platform wars.

16:34.220 --> 16:35.220
Just you.

16:35.220 --> 16:41.100
Is anybody in the room waiting for a device to come on sale in their country, or is almost

16:41.100 --> 16:42.180
ready to pull the trigger now?

16:42.180 --> 16:46.700
Anybody speak up if you are, because I'm really curious to know if anybody else in the Mumbroom

16:46.700 --> 16:50.780
is walking the same fence that Noah is, and is willing to maybe try taking a plunge.

16:50.780 --> 16:53.780
I'm buying the MX4 as we speak.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.300
Who's that?

16:55.300 --> 16:57.060
Who said that?

16:57.060 --> 16:58.060
That's great.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.060
At the beginning.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.060
That's great.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.060
Oh, well, will you come back?

17:01.060 --> 17:03.660
Will you let us know your opinions on it and how it goes for you when you do get it?

17:03.660 --> 17:04.660
Sure.

17:04.660 --> 17:08.740
I'll be on the whole experience now to have a laptop on desktop running Ubuntu 15.04 as

17:08.740 --> 17:09.740
well now.

17:09.740 --> 17:10.740
Ooh, very nice.

17:10.740 --> 17:11.740
Very nice.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.100
You still can't use the MX4 in the US, right?

17:14.100 --> 17:15.940
On anything greater than 2G or whatever it was?

17:15.940 --> 17:16.940
I think, yeah.

17:16.940 --> 17:19.620
Like, you only get like a couple of the bands or something, I'm not sure.

17:19.620 --> 17:24.100
In the UK, so it's not so much of an issue, because we're pretty much stuck on 3G and

17:24.100 --> 17:25.580
hints of 4G.

17:25.580 --> 17:26.580
Yeah.

17:26.580 --> 17:27.780
Razer, you want to try getting one?

17:27.780 --> 17:30.300
Yeah, you're in the UK, could you pick one up?

17:30.300 --> 17:35.620
Yes, but for me it's just finances at the moment, so I'm keeping an eye on eBay and

17:35.620 --> 17:37.780
seeing if I can pick up a Nexus 4 cheap.

17:37.780 --> 17:38.780
Oh, yeah.

17:38.780 --> 17:39.780
Oh, yeah.

17:39.780 --> 17:40.780
The Force, yeah.

17:40.780 --> 17:41.780
My phone is a Nexus 4.

17:41.780 --> 17:45.020
I do actually have one, but it's my primary unit, it's Android at the moment.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.020
Yeah.

17:46.020 --> 17:49.820
It's a bit of wear and tear, so I would like to pick up another one just for a few quid

17:49.820 --> 17:52.220
and then root it and run it and see what it's like.

17:52.220 --> 17:55.540
You know, I've had a lot of fun with my Nexus 5, but I know it's not really, you know, I

17:55.540 --> 17:58.780
don't really use it to judge the quality of the release of the OS because I know it's

17:58.780 --> 18:01.540
not a target platform, so I use that on Ting.

18:01.540 --> 18:09.100
If something that was better than Nexus 4 and compatible with Ting's GSM network, I

18:09.100 --> 18:10.760
think I would get a dedicated device.

18:10.760 --> 18:15.100
If I could get like maybe something that worked, I want to have all the bands available, because

18:15.100 --> 18:17.700
I don't want to be out there and be like, oh, this thing's so slow and have it affect

18:17.700 --> 18:19.140
my opinion of it.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.140
Right.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.140
Yeah, and it would.

18:21.140 --> 18:22.140
It would.

18:22.140 --> 18:23.140
And that's been my hesitation too.

18:23.140 --> 18:26.340
And I'm still waiting for it to get kind of get, I guess, a little more.

18:26.340 --> 18:27.500
It does get more time in the oven.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.500
Yeah, right.

18:28.500 --> 18:33.340
But here's the thing that is so crazy to me is how fast things are maturing.

18:33.340 --> 18:41.060
How fast things are going from not usable to usable to totally replaceable.

18:41.060 --> 18:42.060
Yeah.

18:42.060 --> 18:44.540
I guess we didn't say this early in the show, but Noah's in studio today because we're

18:44.540 --> 18:45.540
going down to OSCON tomorrow.

18:45.540 --> 18:46.540
Did we mention that?

18:46.540 --> 18:47.540
Are we going to OSCON tomorrow?

18:47.540 --> 18:48.540
Yeah.

18:48.540 --> 18:49.540
Oh, that's good.

18:49.540 --> 18:51.740
We're going to be there Wednesday, and that's why we're recording on a Monday today for

18:51.740 --> 18:53.060
the Linux Unplugged show.

18:53.060 --> 18:54.220
And I'm going to keep an eye out.

18:54.220 --> 18:57.980
I'm going to be seeing like what is, you know, we always do this anyways, but I'm going to

18:57.980 --> 18:59.500
keep an eye out and see if we see what.

18:59.500 --> 19:03.940
You think we, Noah has a red book prediction that we'll see zero devices that are not Android

19:03.940 --> 19:04.940
or iPhone.

19:04.940 --> 19:05.940
Maybe.

19:05.940 --> 19:06.940
We'll see.

19:06.940 --> 19:07.940
We'll see.

19:07.940 --> 19:08.940
Android.

19:08.940 --> 19:09.940
Did you say Android or iPhone?

19:09.940 --> 19:10.940
Yeah.

19:10.940 --> 19:11.940
Okay.

19:11.940 --> 19:12.940
I think they're all going to be Android or iPhone is my bet.

19:12.940 --> 19:13.940
You think we'll see any Firefox?

19:13.940 --> 19:14.940
Well, except for presenters.

19:14.940 --> 19:16.300
I think presenters might have some there.

19:16.300 --> 19:17.300
Yeah.

19:17.300 --> 19:18.300
Hmm.

19:18.300 --> 19:19.300
All right.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.880
Well, I think you'll see, depressingly, I think you'll see a whole lot of MacBook Airs

19:21.880 --> 19:23.500
and MacBook Pros at OSCON.

19:23.500 --> 19:24.500
Yeah, we do.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.500
Sadly.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.460
Well, that's true for a lot of conferences too.

19:27.460 --> 19:28.460
Yeah.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.460
Yeah.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.660
That is, but so that's true for, I think that's true for the, for the conferences that are

19:32.660 --> 19:33.860
very business oriented.

19:33.860 --> 19:35.860
I think that MacBooks tend to dominate that.

19:35.860 --> 19:39.340
I think for the community oriented ones, I think that's very much not the case.

19:39.340 --> 19:45.160
So for example, the email that went out to the presenters were, if you bring some freedom

19:45.160 --> 19:47.980
hitting device, bring your own adapters because we won't provide them for you and we won't

19:47.980 --> 19:48.980
help you set them up.

19:48.980 --> 19:53.580
I, the irony though is the, is the ThinkPad really any less freedom hating?

19:53.580 --> 19:55.620
I think that Apple has a prescribed incentive.

19:55.620 --> 19:57.660
Remember that wireless thing you talked about?

19:57.660 --> 20:00.980
Yeah, yeah, which apparently has gone away on the X series, which I told you.

20:00.980 --> 20:01.980
Okay, good.

20:01.980 --> 20:08.860
But, so Apple has a prescribed, a prescribed advantage to having people keep Mac OS on

20:08.860 --> 20:09.860
the laptop.

20:09.860 --> 20:10.860
I agree with that.

20:10.860 --> 20:13.260
Whereas I don't think Lenovo really cares what OS is on the laptop as long as you're

20:13.260 --> 20:14.260
buying their hardware.

20:14.260 --> 20:19.140
But I do agree that Apple in that regard, and I just meant from a totally like, from

20:19.140 --> 20:20.420
a fundamental standpoint.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.420
No.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.140
From like a, from an actual like.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.140
No.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.580
No, and I don't think I've ever said otherwise.

20:26.580 --> 20:32.260
Unless you're buying a System76, I don't, or the Librem, I don't think you can, or the

20:32.260 --> 20:36.780
ThinkPenguin stuff, I don't think you can truly make an argument that you're significantly

20:36.780 --> 20:38.340
better one brand over the other.

20:38.340 --> 20:42.220
That said, if you have a glowing white Apple on the back of your computer, I feel like

20:42.220 --> 20:46.020
even if you're, yeah right, even if you're running Linux on that, I feel like you're

20:46.020 --> 20:49.500
advertising to everyone else that you don't, that you're not particularly a fan of Linux

20:49.500 --> 20:50.500
on the desktop.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.500
I heard you, I heard you speak up for a second.

20:51.500 --> 20:55.060
Did you have thoughts, is the ThinkPad maybe more freedom respecting than the MacBook,

20:55.060 --> 20:56.940
or is it a silly metric, or what do you think?

20:56.940 --> 21:00.420
It's, yeah, I think it's a bit daft, because they've all got non-free blobs in them somewhere

21:00.420 --> 21:06.020
or other, unless you like go full RMS and get a MIPS like funky laptop.

21:06.020 --> 21:10.300
But the difference is you're paying with your dollars.

21:10.300 --> 21:14.900
You know, if you're buying an Apple laptop, then you're giving money to Apple.

21:14.900 --> 21:21.860
You are funding that system, whereas if you go and buy a System76 machine, you are fundering

21:21.860 --> 21:30.700
the smaller guy who is producing laptops which are more open, more free, and...

21:30.700 --> 21:34.820
Well, there's also the aspect that they contribute to the community in regards, and that they

21:34.820 --> 21:38.020
maybe help further development of that platform.

21:38.020 --> 21:44.820
So in the vendors of ThinkPenguin and System76, they, even if they have a proprietary blobs,

21:44.820 --> 21:48.020
and they have, you know, they're not using some core boot or something like that, they

21:48.020 --> 21:50.620
are still contributing to Linux in a greater capacity.

21:50.620 --> 21:52.620
Well, not only that, I think you're underselling that.

21:52.620 --> 21:55.500
When you buy a ThinkPad, you're buying a vote for a Windows license.

21:55.500 --> 21:59.340
I think you're underselling that a bit in that it's more than just that.

21:59.340 --> 22:02.860
I mean, there may be proprietary blobs in there, but they're not hindering proprietary

22:02.860 --> 22:03.860
blobs.

22:03.860 --> 22:08.740
So, I can get to my BIOS and boot UEFI or native BIOS boot if I want to.

22:08.740 --> 22:13.580
That is actually, as it turns out, pretty difficult to do in some of the newer computers.

22:13.580 --> 22:14.580
That is a nice thing to be able to turn on.

22:14.580 --> 22:18.620
Yeah, I mean, and so there are a lot of, I think there's a lot of little things like

22:18.620 --> 22:19.620
that.

22:19.620 --> 22:23.260
And I think that ThinkPad gets its reputation, its positive reputation from Linux users

22:23.260 --> 22:28.820
in that all the things I want to do on the ThinkPad, I can, even if it's not totally

22:28.820 --> 22:33.740
a free computer, I can guarantee you, I'll go on record and say right now, you find me

22:33.740 --> 22:37.380
any ThinkPad, I'll plug a thumb drive into it, I'll boot into it, and it'll let us work

22:37.380 --> 22:38.380
on the box.

22:38.380 --> 22:39.380
And it's been like that for a long time.

22:39.380 --> 22:40.380
Right.

22:40.380 --> 22:41.380
And I think that's what's built that reputation up.

22:41.380 --> 22:42.380
Right, right.

22:42.380 --> 22:44.060
Not necessarily that they care about freedom, it's just that you can get Linux to work on

22:44.060 --> 22:47.260
it almost as if it was right out of the box.

22:47.260 --> 22:51.220
And that is exemplified by the fact that Red Hat issues ThinkPads to all of their employees,

22:51.220 --> 22:52.220
right?

22:52.220 --> 22:55.380
Yeah, I mean, I think the end practical result is you can't deny you're going to have a better

22:55.380 --> 22:58.740
bet if you just go to Best Buy and you have to buy a laptop at Best Buy, you're going

22:58.740 --> 23:01.020
to have the best chance with a ThinkPad.

23:01.020 --> 23:02.020
I don't necessarily know.

23:02.020 --> 23:03.020
If you can buy ThinkPads.

23:03.020 --> 23:04.700
If that's enough, though, for me.

23:04.700 --> 23:06.500
Yeah, in a perfect world, it wouldn't be.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.980
Because I'm asking about personal use, not like what you recommend to people or businesses,

23:09.980 --> 23:10.980
just for my personal use.

23:10.980 --> 23:15.060
Yeah, so personal use is you want to go with a computer that you're going to have the least

23:15.060 --> 23:16.060
amount of trouble.

23:16.060 --> 23:21.620
So then you would go with something like System76, but there are some hard limits of System76

23:21.620 --> 23:23.620
in that, for instance, screen size.

23:23.620 --> 23:26.540
I don't like anything bigger than a 13-inch laptop.

23:26.540 --> 23:30.980
And I can't buy a 13-inch laptop from System76.

23:30.980 --> 23:36.980
So I like, there are a lot of people that like aluminum chassis.

23:36.980 --> 23:40.220
To the best of my knowledge, System76 doesn't make a laptop with aluminum chassis.

23:40.220 --> 23:41.700
What size screen is your Lemure?

23:41.700 --> 23:42.700
A 14.

23:42.700 --> 23:43.700
Oh, okay.

23:43.700 --> 23:44.700
Yeah.

23:44.700 --> 23:48.540
Yeah, I mean, so, yeah, I think, I guess what I, to come back to sort of bring this all

23:48.540 --> 23:51.860
together is I think there's not a great option either way.

23:51.860 --> 23:56.620
And I guess what I kind of want to get to is I don't like that we sometimes shame people

23:56.620 --> 23:57.620
for the hardware choices.

23:57.620 --> 23:59.060
I just rather they run Linux.

23:59.060 --> 24:00.060
No, I agree.

24:00.060 --> 24:04.540
This is actually what I told the Mozilla girl when we were at scale.

24:04.540 --> 24:09.300
She had a MacBook Air, but she never actually booted, she never even booted Mac OS on it.

24:09.300 --> 24:12.300
She got it, she opened it up, she formatted it, wiped Mac OS totally off and put Linux

24:12.300 --> 24:13.300
on it.

24:13.300 --> 24:15.640
That's, to me, that's 98% effective.

24:15.640 --> 24:19.380
The only thing is, is when I walked by the Mozilla table for the first two days, I assumed

24:19.380 --> 24:22.780
she was running Mac OS because she had a glowing white Apple on the back of her laptop.

24:22.780 --> 24:26.620
But that's, like I said, in the grand scheme of things, that's like 2% out of the 100.

24:26.620 --> 24:28.580
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

24:28.580 --> 24:34.420
Whereas when I was at FOSDEM, there were people from Mozilla giving talks at the FOSDEM, Free

24:34.420 --> 24:39.420
Open Source Developer European Meeting, giving talks from their MacBook in OS X.

24:39.420 --> 24:41.620
Yeah, I called people out like that.

24:41.620 --> 24:43.380
Yeah, I did as well.

24:43.380 --> 24:49.580
And I asked the question, do you not think it's hypocritical to tell us to use this freedom-loving

24:49.580 --> 24:54.500
software like Firefox, yet you're telling us that from that device running that OS?

24:54.500 --> 24:58.460
Do you not think you should be dogfooding your own stuff?

24:58.460 --> 25:01.980
And her answer was, I bought this myself, I like this product.

25:01.980 --> 25:04.740
So you can't argue with that, can you?

25:04.740 --> 25:09.300
So the most ridiculous answer I heard was, this was a couple years ago, this was probably

25:09.300 --> 25:10.300
four or five years ago.

25:10.300 --> 25:13.780
There was somebody from the Free Software Foundation running a Mac.

25:13.780 --> 25:16.860
And I thought that was particularly funny, and so I went up and said something to him.

25:16.860 --> 25:17.940
Here was his answer to me.

25:17.940 --> 25:21.620
His answer was, I volunteer and work for the Free Software Foundation because they care

25:21.620 --> 25:24.460
about users' freedom to be able to choose whatever they want, and so I chose to run

25:24.460 --> 25:25.460
a Mac.

25:25.460 --> 25:26.460
Really?

25:26.460 --> 25:27.460
Really?

25:27.460 --> 25:28.460
Really?

25:28.460 --> 25:29.460
Here's the sticker.

25:29.460 --> 25:30.460
That's not an answer.

25:30.460 --> 25:31.460
That kind of is an answer, though.

25:31.460 --> 25:32.460
That's not an answer.

25:32.460 --> 25:33.460
Come on.

25:33.460 --> 25:38.900
If you are part of the one organization that literally just brutally badgers people for

25:38.900 --> 25:43.500
not running the most perfect lack of binary boxes, then you're not only going to show

25:43.500 --> 25:46.740
up running not Linux, he's running Mac OS on proprietary.

25:46.740 --> 25:47.740
Come on.

25:47.740 --> 25:48.740
Yeah, that's a little weak.

25:48.740 --> 25:49.740
That's a little weak.

25:49.740 --> 25:51.860
That was the most pathetic answer I think I've ever heard.

25:51.860 --> 25:52.860
I don't know.

25:52.860 --> 25:53.860
All right.

25:53.860 --> 25:57.140
See, I was trying to get us away from judging people for the hardware they run, but it's

25:57.140 --> 25:59.340
just run whatever you want as long as it's Linux.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.900
That's kind of where I was going, but I will be curious.

26:01.900 --> 26:04.660
The only reason we even bring it up is it's just always such an interesting thing we observe

26:04.660 --> 26:07.700
before we go to OSCON or any other convention, any convention.

26:07.700 --> 26:12.260
It is a little bit of practice what you preach, a little bit of dog-fooding like Popey was

26:12.260 --> 26:16.380
saying, and it's a little bit of if you are in free software because of these, like with

26:16.380 --> 26:20.180
these Firefox developers, their argument would clearly be, well, I don't develop Linux.

26:20.180 --> 26:22.940
I develop Firefox, and I'm running Firefox on my Mac.

26:22.940 --> 26:26.100
That's the argument, but isn't it come down to, well, don't you believe in the philosophy

26:26.100 --> 26:27.100
behind Firefox?

26:27.100 --> 26:28.100
No.

26:28.100 --> 26:29.780
Well, maybe Firefox, yes, but you know what the reality is?

26:29.780 --> 26:32.580
I think a lot of people at OSCON, I don't think they do.

26:32.580 --> 26:34.020
I don't think they care about the philosophy.

26:34.020 --> 26:36.540
I think what they care about is I want to make money.

26:36.540 --> 26:37.540
I'm serious.

26:37.540 --> 26:41.300
I want to make money, and I think that a large part of making that money is catering to the

26:41.300 --> 26:45.100
solutions that people want, and a lot of those solutions, open source has a lot of advantages

26:45.100 --> 26:46.100
that you can leverage.

26:46.100 --> 26:47.100
So it's a business perspective.

26:47.100 --> 26:48.100
That's what I want to do.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.100
I think that's as far as they look into it.

26:49.100 --> 26:52.020
I think that's a huge portion of the people at OSCON, but then you do have like open source

26:52.020 --> 26:53.380
hardware alleys and stuff like that.

26:53.380 --> 26:54.940
Well, Brian's going to be at OSCON.

26:54.940 --> 26:59.100
So Brian, from the guy, the gentleman we spoke with that, yeah.

26:59.100 --> 27:00.100
So I mean people...

27:00.100 --> 27:01.100
The hardware and the laptop guy?

27:01.100 --> 27:04.180
You're talking about the hardware, the wood laptop guy?

27:04.180 --> 27:05.700
No, no, no.

27:05.700 --> 27:09.500
We had an interview with him at Self, and he was, we were talking about the core...

27:09.500 --> 27:10.500
I remember.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.500
He writes for opensource.com.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.500
Yeah.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.500
I don't think so.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.460
I think it was somebody else.

27:15.460 --> 27:19.180
But the point is that there are, certainly there are people that are there, but I think

27:19.180 --> 27:24.580
that the conference is primarily towards marketing open source, and to be fair about it, I value

27:24.580 --> 27:28.380
that because I make a living off of selling open source software, and so if I didn't have

27:28.380 --> 27:29.380
those conferences...

27:29.380 --> 27:34.260
And the reality is, when I'm going to make my living, whatever hardware they're using

27:34.260 --> 27:38.060
to present on, or whatever hardware they're using to develop on, as long as I get a solution

27:38.060 --> 27:39.660
that I can sell, I can put food on the table.

27:39.660 --> 27:43.760
Now, I might not be particularly happy about how that food got there, or the sacrifices

27:43.760 --> 27:48.740
had to be made for that to happen, but the end result is the same, right?

27:48.740 --> 27:49.740
Yeah.

27:49.740 --> 27:50.740
That's deep, man.

27:50.740 --> 27:51.740
That's deep.

27:51.740 --> 27:52.740
You know what that deserves a little bit?

27:52.740 --> 27:57.100
That was so inspirational that I just want to give you a little...

27:57.100 --> 27:58.100
Thanks, man.

27:58.100 --> 27:59.100
That was nice.

27:59.100 --> 28:00.100
No problem.

28:00.100 --> 28:01.100
That was real nice.

28:01.100 --> 28:02.100
I'm here for you.

28:02.100 --> 28:03.100
All right.

28:03.100 --> 28:04.100
We've got to talk about...

28:04.100 --> 28:05.100
Well, actually, probably if you're going to stick around, maybe you have some thoughts

28:05.100 --> 28:07.820
on this too, the change that the Free Software, Canonical, and the Software Conservancy just

28:07.820 --> 28:08.820
recently announced.

28:08.820 --> 28:11.540
But first, I want to talk about DigitalOcean.

28:11.540 --> 28:14.540
Go to digitalocean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

28:14.540 --> 28:17.180
Noah, that's one word lowercase, so don't mess that up.

28:17.180 --> 28:18.180
I won't.

28:18.180 --> 28:20.340
You know, you can go there and apply to your account right now and get a $10 credit, because

28:20.340 --> 28:22.700
if you probably forgot to it, check out, so you should go do that.

28:22.700 --> 28:26.060
So go to digitalocean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

28:26.060 --> 28:30.020
Now, DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive

28:30.020 --> 28:32.320
and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

28:32.320 --> 28:35.420
And of course, you can get started in less than 55 seconds, and pricing plans start only

28:35.420 --> 28:36.420
$5 a month.

28:36.420 --> 28:41.020
That'll get you 512 freaking megabytes of RAM, which Linux is a boss at managing.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.020
It's really...

28:42.020 --> 28:44.940
It's one of these things where you think, geez, 512, I would never put that on my machine.

28:44.940 --> 28:48.420
And then you realize, of course, if I'm running it headless, I'm running services on it, and

28:48.420 --> 28:51.380
I take advantage of the Linux kernel's memory management, I can get a hell of a lot of work

28:51.380 --> 28:52.620
out of 512 megabytes of RAM.

28:52.620 --> 28:56.740
On Sunday, I was using 512 megs to do my X2Go client.

28:56.740 --> 28:57.740
Nice.

28:57.740 --> 29:02.340
So that was my desktop, had 512 megs, and I had Thunderbird, Telegram, Firefox with

29:02.340 --> 29:05.340
a couple of tabs open, and it was all performing flawlessly.

29:05.340 --> 29:06.340
And of course...

29:06.340 --> 29:07.340
Not to mention the Core OS.

29:07.340 --> 29:09.860
And a big part of that is, you know, it's because you're running on top of SSD drives.

29:09.860 --> 29:12.240
They're all SSDs, so that gives you a ton of performance.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.780
They have really, really good I.O.

29:14.780 --> 29:19.180
Like for example, their data center in Germany, each hypervisor has 40 gigabit E connections.

29:19.180 --> 29:21.060
40 gigabit E, right to the hypervisor.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.060
That's smoking fast.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.620
They've got data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and like

29:24.620 --> 29:26.660
I mentioned, Germany and London.

29:26.660 --> 29:28.940
They have a really simple interface to manage all of it.

29:28.940 --> 29:32.180
So this part is sort of the thing that keeps you coming back.

29:32.180 --> 29:34.980
Every time Noah and I are like, oh, I need a server to do this.

29:34.980 --> 29:39.060
In the past, just the process of setting up the system, getting the OS loaded, getting

29:39.060 --> 29:42.500
the updates installed, getting everything configured, you know, that's a couple hour

29:42.500 --> 29:43.500
job.

29:43.500 --> 29:45.900
DigitalOcean really has boiled this down to like 55 seconds.

29:45.900 --> 29:47.700
It sounds unbelievable, but it's true.

29:47.700 --> 29:50.580
And it's part of it is they're super intuitive and awesome control panel.

29:50.580 --> 29:53.780
And if you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, you're going to try it out two months for

29:53.780 --> 29:55.300
free when you get the $5 rig.

29:55.300 --> 29:58.540
It's a very simple and intuitive control panel, and then you can replicate the functionality

29:58.540 --> 29:59.540
of it with their API.

29:59.540 --> 30:03.140
A lot of people in our audience that are smarter than me use it for like really nice things.

30:03.140 --> 30:08.100
Like I don't remember the exact details, but I think what he did is he set up, so you know

30:08.100 --> 30:12.140
an app, when you're installing packages, you can actually have it run pre and post scripts.

30:12.140 --> 30:16.460
And he set up a pre script and a post script that uses the API, and he didn't even write

30:16.460 --> 30:17.460
all of the code for it.

30:17.460 --> 30:18.860
Like there was already an example bash script out there.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.860
I think maybe it's a Python script, I can't remember.

30:20.860 --> 30:26.140
And it goes out and it uses the DigitalOcean API to create a snapshot, and he can make

30:26.140 --> 30:29.180
iterated snapshots of it so he can iterate back to different versions.

30:29.180 --> 30:32.860
It installs all of the packages and then does a completed snapshot.

30:32.860 --> 30:36.580
So the guy's got pre and post snapshots that are all taken advantage of the DigitalOcean

30:36.580 --> 30:40.260
API, and if anything goes wrong, he just clicks one button and he's right back to where he

30:40.260 --> 30:41.260
left off.

30:41.260 --> 30:42.660
That's a really nice piece of mind.

30:42.660 --> 30:45.260
And you know they have one click deployments for all kinds of great applications.

30:45.260 --> 30:48.180
They got CoreOS, they got Fedora, they got Ubuntu, they got Debian.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.620
They even have free BSD.

30:49.620 --> 30:52.700
Just use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED over at DigitalOcean and try it out.

30:52.700 --> 30:56.820
Go create yourself a droplet, put something cool up there, like an own cloud rig, a mumble

30:56.820 --> 31:01.060
server, Minecraft server, GitLab, ghost installation.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.060
I mean...

31:02.060 --> 31:03.060
X2GO.

31:03.060 --> 31:04.060
X2GO is a great solution.

31:04.060 --> 31:05.060
That's what Wimpy uses too.

31:05.060 --> 31:06.060
Yeah.

31:06.060 --> 31:07.060
Wimpy's up there.

31:07.060 --> 31:12.060
You know, if you really want to get nuts, dude, you should consider doing this, is in

31:12.060 --> 31:15.840
DigitalOcean there's an option for private networking and the transfer of a private networking

31:15.840 --> 31:17.420
doesn't count against your terabyte.

31:17.420 --> 31:20.740
And so one of the things Wimpy has done, and you could do it too, is he has another rig

31:20.740 --> 31:23.140
on a private network that acts as a file server.

31:23.140 --> 31:26.580
So he X2GOs into his machine and then he's got like file servers and all stuff all over

31:26.580 --> 31:31.100
private networking, all up on DigitalOcean, all crazy fast speeds, and he's only, only

31:31.100 --> 31:34.460
one machine's got the public IP and he's only paying for transfer on that, and it's one

31:34.460 --> 31:36.180
terabyte, so it's like it's going to last forever.

31:36.180 --> 31:37.180
Right.

31:37.180 --> 31:38.180
But you know what?

31:38.180 --> 31:39.580
I have never once been hit with the transfer charge.

31:39.580 --> 31:40.580
No, no, never.

31:40.580 --> 31:41.580
Ever.

31:41.580 --> 31:42.580
No.

31:42.580 --> 31:44.900
So I'm just going to continue putting them on the internet and tell something bad happens.

31:44.900 --> 31:46.300
It's just, it's a neat idea to like...

31:46.300 --> 31:47.300
From a security perspective.

31:47.300 --> 31:48.300
Yeah.

31:48.300 --> 31:51.180
Like a droplet that is private networking that is your file server and all this backend

31:51.180 --> 31:52.460
stuff all up in the cloud.

31:52.460 --> 31:53.460
But I mean...

31:53.460 --> 31:54.460
For $5 a month.

31:54.460 --> 31:57.700
Think about self alone, how much data I moved over, you know, for all those footage.

31:57.700 --> 31:59.260
Even then I didn't hit a transfer limit.

31:59.260 --> 32:01.700
And that again is on a $5 a month droplet.

32:01.700 --> 32:02.700
I know, it's great.

32:02.700 --> 32:03.700
I don't know.

32:03.700 --> 32:07.180
Promo code DOUNPLUGGED and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the unplugged

32:07.180 --> 32:08.180
program.

32:08.180 --> 32:11.300
You guys are busting it up.

32:11.300 --> 32:13.100
So I'm going to, I'm going to read this.

32:13.100 --> 32:14.220
I'm not a lawyer.

32:14.220 --> 32:18.900
I'm not a lawyer, but I know that everybody was really upset about the contributor agreements

32:18.900 --> 32:22.420
around Canonical and licensing stuff and conflicts with the GPL.

32:22.420 --> 32:26.860
So the Free Software Foundation and the Software Freedom Conservancy have both put out statements

32:26.860 --> 32:30.980
about a change to Canonical's intellectual property policy that was negotiated over,

32:30.980 --> 32:32.500
they say, the last two years.

32:32.500 --> 32:36.940
Effectively, Canonical has added what they call a Trump Clause that clarifies the licenses

32:36.940 --> 32:41.700
of individual packages that override the Canonical policy when there is a conflict.

32:41.700 --> 32:42.700
I want to read that again.

32:42.700 --> 32:47.300
The Trump Clause means that the Canonical policy is overridden if it's conflicting with

32:47.300 --> 32:49.180
another license, like say the GPL.

32:49.180 --> 32:52.740
They say, while the Trump Clause is a reasonable way to comply with the GPL in a secondary

32:52.740 --> 32:55.700
licensing document, the solution is far from ideal.

32:55.700 --> 33:00.020
Redistributors of Ubuntu have little choice but to become experts in the analysis of Canonical's

33:00.020 --> 33:01.020
policy.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.020
That's their opinion.

33:02.020 --> 33:05.420
They must identify on their own every place where the policy contradicts the GPL.

33:05.420 --> 33:10.100
If a dispute arises on a subtle issue, Canonical could take legal action.

33:10.100 --> 33:12.820
Arguing the Redistributors' interpretation of the GPL was incorrect.

33:12.820 --> 33:17.380
Now this is all could be woody, would Canonical even do this, they're speculating.

33:17.380 --> 33:21.140
Even if the Redistributor was correct that the GPL trumped some specific clauses in Canonical's

33:21.140 --> 33:24.820
policy, it may be costly to educate the issue, you know, take it to court.

33:24.820 --> 33:28.900
While backing the change made, both the Free Software Foundation and the Software Conservancy

33:28.900 --> 33:32.380
recommend further changes to make the situation even more clear.

33:32.380 --> 33:38.100
There has been a very, very wide range of reactions to this, from elated to some folks

33:38.100 --> 33:42.340
like Jonathan from Kubuntu saying it's not enough.

33:42.340 --> 33:45.720
Benjamin saying it's a good start, it helps developers, there's a lot of different takes

33:45.720 --> 33:53.160
on this, but to me, it seems like a really smart move, because essentially what this

33:53.160 --> 33:58.920
allows is, if there's ever a conflict between a Canonical contributor policy and the GPL,

33:58.920 --> 33:59.920
the GPL wins.

33:59.920 --> 34:03.300
And it's kind of like this trump clause that at the end of the day, the GPL wins.

34:03.300 --> 34:05.180
And that to me seems like a pretty big step forward.

34:05.180 --> 34:08.300
Popi, if you have any opinions on this, am I missing any of the details?

34:08.300 --> 34:12.420
Is this about, am I sussing it out quite right, from what you know?

34:12.420 --> 34:15.580
I feel uncomfortable talking about this because I'm not a lawyer and I work for the company.

34:15.580 --> 34:18.660
That's how I feel, I'm not a lawyer either, so that's fine, I know.

34:18.660 --> 34:21.060
You don't have to say anything if you don't want to.

34:21.060 --> 34:29.380
The only thing I would say is that I think people think that this is used for more nefarious

34:29.380 --> 34:30.820
purposes than it really is.

34:30.820 --> 34:33.020
It sounds like it.

34:33.020 --> 34:38.800
And I don't think there's any way in which we would use it for the ways in which many

34:38.800 --> 34:41.140
people think we would.

34:41.140 --> 34:46.260
And it's difficult because you can come up with a hundred different hypothetical scenarios

34:46.260 --> 34:51.560
where Canonical will be the bad guy, yet for the last 10 years arguably we've been the

34:51.560 --> 34:52.560
good guy.

34:52.560 --> 35:01.980
We have been contributing, we have a very open trademark policy, and it's unfortunate

35:01.980 --> 35:08.220
that it's taken a lot of backroom conversations between Canonical, SFLC, and FSF that's resulted

35:08.220 --> 35:11.020
in one paragraph change at the moment.

35:11.020 --> 35:15.180
I guess there may be more changes in the future, but I'm not party to those discussions, so

35:15.180 --> 35:16.660
I just don't know.

35:16.660 --> 35:19.100
Yeah, that's kind of where I think a lot of us sit.

35:19.100 --> 35:26.280
From the outside to me, watching this as an observer, it sounds like a lot of upset about

35:26.280 --> 35:30.260
what could happen, what Canonical may have the legal authority to do if they were so

35:30.260 --> 35:35.100
inclined, had the money, had the time, and wanted the bad PR, they could in some cases

35:35.100 --> 35:39.380
go after somebody for using a package in their redistribution of Ubuntu or something like

35:39.380 --> 35:40.380
that.

35:40.380 --> 35:46.940
It's more, from my perspective, while I work for Canonical, I'm kind of an outsider to

35:46.940 --> 35:50.280
this because I don't take part in any of these conversations.

35:50.280 --> 35:55.760
So from my perspective, it seems more that this policy is more to say, look, if you go

35:55.760 --> 36:00.980
to a vendor of whatever type, whether that's a hardware vendor like System76 or a cloud

36:00.980 --> 36:08.100
vendor providing cloud images, if they say to you what we're providing is Ubuntu, then

36:08.100 --> 36:13.020
that should be something that is verifiably Ubuntu, and it's not been monkeyed around

36:13.020 --> 36:18.260
with in particular ways that would make it not Ubuntu.

36:18.260 --> 36:22.460
When I say not Ubuntu, I mean it might have nasty proprietary stuff added, or they may

36:22.460 --> 36:28.540
have changed the configuration massively, or it might have backdoors in it, or it might

36:28.540 --> 36:33.020
talk to some other server that you wouldn't want, and you would trust us not to do in

36:33.020 --> 36:34.780
official Ubuntu images.

36:34.780 --> 36:40.780
So it's more, if you think about how this might be used, that's more how it would be

36:40.780 --> 36:47.580
used is to say, well, you're supplying hardware and you're saying it's Ubuntu, but actually

36:47.580 --> 36:48.580
is it?

36:48.580 --> 36:51.380
Or you're providing cloud images and you're saying that is Ubuntu.

36:51.380 --> 36:56.780
That gets in a weird spot for the brand and for Canonical and user expectations, yeah.

36:56.780 --> 36:57.780
And I can see that.

36:57.780 --> 37:02.260
Derek Devlin, you wanted to jump in on the Canonical defense side real quick?

37:02.260 --> 37:10.780
Yeah, just honestly, I think Bobby then finalized it and expressed what I felt about the situation,

37:10.780 --> 37:11.780
but overall, yeah.

37:11.780 --> 37:17.140
Yeah, I do too, and I kind of come at it from a more pragmatic standpoint, like I actually,

37:17.140 --> 37:21.340
I'm really happy to see this much movement, and I'd love to see more movement on the issue.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.780
It just seems to be something that is a big hangup for some people.

37:23.780 --> 37:26.380
Yeah, lawyers don't work quickly, do they?

37:26.380 --> 37:29.100
Well, it's not in their interest, is it?

37:29.100 --> 37:33.820
I have always felt, on one hand, I've always felt that if somebody isn't going to use a

37:33.820 --> 37:42.220
power for, if the argument is, well, the CLA would never be used for anything bad, we would

37:42.220 --> 37:46.620
never actually force that on anyone, then I would ask why is that power necessary?

37:46.620 --> 37:52.140
I think what that is, is there's only so many tools in the chest, right?

37:52.140 --> 37:56.660
And you have to write it in a way where you can accommodate for future scenarios.

37:56.660 --> 38:01.260
Yeah, I mean, I've always been a little uncomfortable, but on the other hand, here's the other side

38:01.260 --> 38:02.260
of that.

38:02.260 --> 38:04.980
Canonical is a company, and they exist to make money.

38:04.980 --> 38:08.900
They have to pay employees, they have ongoing expenses, and let's face it, their biggest

38:08.900 --> 38:14.420
product, Ubuntu, they give away on the website for free.

38:14.420 --> 38:20.300
So there was a post a while back where somebody talked about the dynamic of open source and

38:20.300 --> 38:24.060
how if you're a paid developer, then you're given a paycheck and you write code and then

38:24.060 --> 38:26.540
the company owns that code, and they don't give anything back in this, that, and the

38:26.540 --> 38:27.540
other.

38:27.540 --> 38:31.140
Where it's open source, there has to be a two-way exchange for that to be a profitable

38:31.140 --> 38:33.060
relationship, right?

38:33.060 --> 38:37.780
And I guess my instant thought when I heard that as a business owner is, I think, aren't

38:37.780 --> 38:43.060
they giving back the finalized product of Ubuntu constantly away for free?

38:43.060 --> 38:48.460
I mean, it's not in the free as in beer, not as in free as in freedom sense.

38:48.460 --> 38:51.500
I see that there's a very clear distinction there.

38:51.500 --> 38:57.680
But I think to some degree, what Canonical does is says, we need to be able to protect

38:57.680 --> 39:01.660
our ability to make money, and so we find something we can profit on.

39:01.660 --> 39:02.780
Maybe, but only in a broader sense.

39:02.780 --> 39:09.460
I think what it is, what Poppy was just saying, is think about what's the main reason that

39:09.460 --> 39:13.040
Google hates it when the carriers take Android and they muck it up?

39:13.040 --> 39:14.580
Carriers come in with one expectation.

39:14.580 --> 39:15.580
Somebody else takes that.

39:15.580 --> 39:16.580
They change it.

39:16.580 --> 39:19.460
They still call it Android, but the buttons are in a different place.

39:19.460 --> 39:21.060
The things do different things.

39:21.060 --> 39:24.740
My phone gives me a volume warning about my hearing every time I turn up the volume, but

39:24.740 --> 39:25.900
my Nexus doesn't.

39:25.900 --> 39:27.160
There's different changes.

39:27.160 --> 39:31.180
And as a user, I want to know that if I go in and I get brand A of phone, I'm going to

39:31.180 --> 39:33.060
get the things that brand A has.

39:33.060 --> 39:35.920
It's the same reason why I like to buy Heinz ketchup, because I always know what Heinz

39:35.920 --> 39:37.900
ketchup has, and it always tastes the same.

39:37.900 --> 39:40.700
And I want to know, as a customer, Heinz ketchup will always taste the same.

39:40.700 --> 39:44.420
And I, as the Heinz company, if somebody else comes along, takes my Heinz bottle, empties

39:44.420 --> 39:47.820
it in a new bottle, and adds a bunch of salt and sugar, and calls it something else, or

39:47.820 --> 39:49.900
still calls it Heinz, that's even worse.

39:49.900 --> 39:52.500
That's much worse, actually, if they still call it Heinz, than me as a company.

39:52.500 --> 39:55.220
I've got to do something to protect what people expect when they buy Heinz ketchup.

39:55.220 --> 39:58.420
So, and again, excuse my ignorance if I'm missing this here, but doesn't open source

39:58.420 --> 39:59.780
provide for exactly that?

39:59.780 --> 40:02.780
If you fork a project, you can't use the original product.

40:02.780 --> 40:03.780
I mean, those...

40:03.780 --> 40:06.420
Well, that's where these tools and copyright and trademark come in.

40:06.420 --> 40:07.420
Right.

40:07.420 --> 40:12.100
My understanding was, the beef of the CLA was essentially that people were upset that

40:12.100 --> 40:16.660
they could make contributions to Canonical, and then those wouldn't necessarily be submitted

40:16.660 --> 40:17.660
back up street.

40:17.660 --> 40:18.980
They could potentially be re-licensed, actually.

40:18.980 --> 40:20.900
This isn't really related to the CLA.

40:20.900 --> 40:21.900
Yeah.

40:21.900 --> 40:28.020
This is more the intellectual property policy that is on every website about using Ubuntu.

40:28.020 --> 40:31.500
And so this is more about, yeah, okay, so the CLA, still in effect.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.420
A lot of projects have contributory license agreements.

40:33.420 --> 40:34.420
A lot.

40:34.420 --> 40:36.260
Like, a lot of them have it.

40:36.260 --> 40:40.380
So this intellectual property thing, this is more about like, I mean, honestly where

40:40.380 --> 40:43.420
I can see this coming up, and we could just, let's just use our buddy Wimpy because he's

40:43.420 --> 40:45.220
not going to get any trouble.

40:45.220 --> 40:49.420
But you know, a distro like Wimpy's Ubuntu Mate's project comes along, gets a hardware

40:49.420 --> 40:54.580
vendor and they start calling it an Ubuntu machine, but yet it's not an Ubuntu experience.

40:54.580 --> 40:55.580
Right.

40:55.580 --> 40:56.580
Yeah.

40:56.580 --> 40:57.580
Yeah.

40:57.580 --> 40:58.580
It's Ubuntu Mate.

40:58.580 --> 41:04.220
So at some point, like, what if a really big company came along and did that?

41:04.220 --> 41:09.020
They've got to have the tools possible to protect, because they could just become irrelevant

41:09.020 --> 41:10.780
if they didn't defend that.

41:10.780 --> 41:11.780
So I think that's what this is about.

41:11.780 --> 41:16.780
But if you relicense it, doesn't it then become the potential for not being able to contribute

41:16.780 --> 41:17.780
that back upstream?

41:17.780 --> 41:18.780
Mm-hmm.

41:18.780 --> 41:22.800
And so then, isn't it, so then I guess, and I realize we're getting further and further

41:22.800 --> 41:24.420
down the rabbit hole of what if, but...

41:24.420 --> 41:27.180
Yeah, I really, because I don't know, I'm not a lawyer, but yeah.

41:27.180 --> 41:31.180
But it just, I guess the concern I see is, I could potentially write code and think I'm

41:31.180 --> 41:36.020
contributing to all of these projects, and in the end, Canonical could, as the way it's

41:36.020 --> 41:37.820
written, just take it and say, no, we own that.

41:37.820 --> 41:40.780
Well, you are, again, that's, you're confusing the life of the contributor agreement with

41:40.780 --> 41:41.780
Ubuntu.

41:41.780 --> 41:42.780
Yeah, maybe I am, yeah.

41:42.780 --> 41:45.780
But even the CLA doesn't say that.

41:45.780 --> 41:50.340
You get to keep the rights over your work, you just grant us the ability to redistribute

41:50.340 --> 41:51.340
that work as well.

41:51.340 --> 41:52.340
Okay.

41:52.340 --> 41:53.340
That's the difference.

41:53.340 --> 41:54.340
So you...

41:54.340 --> 41:55.340
Which does include a relicense, though.

41:55.340 --> 41:56.340
By contributing to us.

41:56.340 --> 41:59.540
Like, you could, like, isn't it, it does allow to relicense to, like, Apache or it doesn't

41:59.540 --> 42:01.980
allow for some relicensing to of code?

42:01.980 --> 42:04.580
Doesn't mean they can't contribute to their own code still, though, right?

42:04.580 --> 42:08.500
Potentially, but you still get to keep the rights over your code, so you could still

42:08.500 --> 42:11.180
distribute it under the GPL or whatever license you had it under.

42:11.180 --> 42:15.220
Yeah, so they haven't changed the code then, or they haven't changed the licensing then,

42:15.220 --> 42:16.220
right?

42:16.220 --> 42:18.500
I mean, so they forked it and changed it.

42:18.500 --> 42:21.940
They would fork it, relicense it, now Canonical could continue to develop that version that's

42:21.940 --> 42:26.340
under a different license, and you would continue to have your version under your license.

42:26.340 --> 42:32.540
That doesn't seem egregious to me, because at the end of the day, there is no way that

42:32.540 --> 42:37.220
somebody else can take a software and say, this is Ubuntu, if it's not in fact Ubuntu.

42:37.220 --> 42:41.340
And at the same time, you're not hindering the efforts of people contributing.

42:41.340 --> 42:42.340
Right.

42:42.340 --> 42:48.340
So I think the thing that people find egregious, but not separate from the whole legal discussion,

42:48.340 --> 42:54.220
is that potentially you as a manufacturer, you could make a phone, right?

42:54.220 --> 43:01.260
And you could go and get all the pieces that make up Ubuntu, the brand, the distro software,

43:01.260 --> 43:05.260
you could go and get all those pieces and put them on a phone and say, hey, look, we've

43:05.260 --> 43:10.540
made a phone and it runs what you would normally call Ubuntu, but you couldn't sell that and

43:10.540 --> 43:15.900
call it Ubuntu until you talk to us, until we have a conversation with you about licensing

43:15.900 --> 43:18.340
that brand, that trademark.

43:18.340 --> 43:23.260
And once you do have that conversation, we're all golden, but you can't until you've done

43:23.260 --> 43:24.260
that.

43:24.260 --> 43:25.260
And that's fair.

43:25.260 --> 43:26.260
The same with laptops and cloud.

43:26.260 --> 43:29.700
That's why I think it's a little silly that such, I mean, I do totally get where people

43:29.700 --> 43:33.740
are coming from, but I don't really think it's as huge of an issue as we made it out

43:33.740 --> 43:37.120
to be, because the only time it would become a really, really huge issue is if Canonical

43:37.120 --> 43:39.340
got to the size of Google, Microsoft, or Apple.

43:39.340 --> 43:43.580
But even then, I guess I'm still seeing where, even if they did get to be that big size,

43:43.580 --> 43:47.700
and even if they did have nefarious ideas, what could they do?

43:47.700 --> 43:48.700
What could they-

43:48.700 --> 43:50.180
Okay, then we're gonna, I think we gotta move on.

43:50.180 --> 43:54.420
I'll just give you the worst case, total, not-gonna-ever-happen scenario.

43:54.420 --> 43:59.600
Let's say Canonical, in 20 years, they buy Apple, they're so big, right?

43:59.600 --> 44:02.500
They're so rich, and let's stick with this.

44:02.500 --> 44:06.780
Say Apple buys CUPS, this printing system that all Linux boxes use, right?

44:06.780 --> 44:11.260
They get this program called CUPS, they take it, and they decide to really make iOS and

44:11.260 --> 44:14.100
Macs really integrate super well together.

44:14.100 --> 44:17.140
They're gonna fork and re-license CUPS, and they're gonna continue to develop CUPS separately.

44:17.140 --> 44:20.060
They're not gonna take away CUPS from the rest of the community, because that remains.

44:20.060 --> 44:21.780
They'll just languish on GitHub or whatever.

44:21.780 --> 44:24.980
But they take CUPS, and they drew in a whole new direction that adds a whole bunch of really

44:24.980 --> 44:26.340
neat printing features.

44:26.340 --> 44:29.040
Now the rest of CUPS doesn't get any of that stuff.

44:29.040 --> 44:32.500
And so the CUPS developers are like, oh man, you took our code, and you made it way more

44:32.500 --> 44:34.260
awesome, and you never contributed back.

44:34.260 --> 44:35.260
That's the total waste-

44:35.260 --> 44:37.620
But they're doing that on their own dime.

44:37.620 --> 44:41.860
In today's world, in the way the world is set up today, if Canonical did that, a few

44:41.860 --> 44:43.180
million people would use that.

44:43.180 --> 44:47.160
The rest of the entire industry would still use the open standard, regularly licensed

44:47.160 --> 44:51.100
product that everybody else is using, and it doesn't really change the technology landscape.

44:51.100 --> 44:52.240
It doesn't really change anything.

44:52.240 --> 44:55.640
So the only reason why this agreement on the CLA and all this stuff I think really would

44:55.640 --> 44:59.720
matter is if Canonical was so huge that they would be able to deprive the original source

44:59.720 --> 45:03.620
project from really any innovation, which is very unlikely to happen.

45:03.620 --> 45:04.620
Right.

45:04.620 --> 45:05.620
Right.

45:05.620 --> 45:06.620
Yeah, that makes sense.

45:06.620 --> 45:09.540
So you could potentially stifle innovation, but even then-

45:09.540 --> 45:12.900
But you'd have to be at such a scale that essentially all of the majority of users in

45:12.900 --> 45:14.700
development would move to the other project.

45:14.700 --> 45:17.780
And then who's going to want to do that if you're relicensing it in the first place?

45:17.780 --> 45:18.780
It's just not very-

45:18.780 --> 45:23.020
It just doesn't seem like a super critical major problem.

45:23.020 --> 45:27.840
I guess the whole concept of open source to begin with was the idea of having a license

45:27.840 --> 45:31.260
to begin with was that you couldn't change the license, and if the license can be changed

45:31.260 --> 45:35.220
at any time, then it kind of defeats the entire purpose of take a share and redistribute.

45:35.220 --> 45:37.900
Now that we've got the software license, I just-

45:37.900 --> 45:40.860
The lawyering stuff and the licensing stuff, man, it's just not my-

45:40.860 --> 45:41.860
Yeah, because let's be fair.

45:41.860 --> 45:42.860
Neither of us really have a clue.

45:42.860 --> 45:45.300
And we don't really care either.

45:45.300 --> 45:48.220
I know a lot of Linux users do, and I totally respect that I'm not downplaying it, but

45:48.220 --> 45:51.020
me personally, I've never been-

45:51.020 --> 45:52.420
That's not the first reason I jump in.

45:52.420 --> 45:56.100
Because we've got so many other more critical problems to deal with long before we ever

45:56.100 --> 45:57.100
get to that.

45:57.100 --> 45:58.100
I'm glad.

45:58.100 --> 45:59.100
Some people are worried about it though, that's for sure.

45:59.100 --> 46:00.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:00.100 --> 46:03.620
And some of you, and that's good, and it's good to see some results too.

46:03.620 --> 46:06.300
I think that's also really good, and it took them a couple of years, but some people made

46:06.300 --> 46:09.580
some, some lawyers made some good money, and some donations were well spent.

46:09.580 --> 46:13.840
All right, now in the meantime, let's spend a little money on ourselves.

46:13.840 --> 46:18.820
Let's get a little more in our toolbox, a little more educated, a little better at something

46:18.820 --> 46:21.300
that could make us maybe more competitive in the workforce.

46:21.300 --> 46:22.660
I'm talking about Linux Academy.

46:22.660 --> 46:25.380
Go to Linux Academy right now, won't you, and go get our discount.

46:25.380 --> 46:30.340
In fact, if you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, you get our 33% discount.

46:30.340 --> 46:31.340
Boom, Noah.

46:31.340 --> 46:32.340
33%.

46:32.340 --> 46:33.340
That's a big discount.

46:33.340 --> 46:34.340
That is.

46:34.340 --> 46:35.340
That is.

46:35.340 --> 46:36.340
Are you a Linux Academy user, Noah?

46:36.340 --> 46:37.340
Of course I'm a Linux Academy user.

46:37.340 --> 46:38.340
Yeah.

46:38.340 --> 46:42.260
One of the things I learned about Linux Academy when I signed up was how well it worked for

46:42.260 --> 46:48.540
the way I work, like I log in, and I was like, oh man, do I really want to take, do I really

46:48.540 --> 46:52.100
want to tap, like this case it was Ruby, do I really want to tackle this topic?

46:52.100 --> 46:56.260
Like to me, the idea of learning Ruby is like a commitment.

46:56.260 --> 46:58.860
Like I'm going to, I'm going to, this is a life journey I'm going to take.

46:58.860 --> 47:02.220
I'm going to go learn Ruby, and when I logged into Linux Academy, and I looked at the Ruby

47:02.220 --> 47:06.780
course, and I was able to take this huge, ginormous, nebulous topic of learning a new

47:06.780 --> 47:12.300
programming language, and I was able to put five hours and 35 minutes on it, I was like,

47:12.300 --> 47:15.980
holy crap, you mean I can learn Ruby in five hours, that is something my brain can not

47:15.980 --> 47:18.980
only process, but I know how to fit that into my life, like that is something I can wrap

47:18.980 --> 47:19.980
my head around.

47:19.980 --> 47:22.360
It's no longer this huge thing that's an unaccomplishable task.

47:22.360 --> 47:25.980
It is all of a sudden, it's very laid out, it's step by step, what I'm going to do, how

47:25.980 --> 47:28.060
long each section is going to take me, and it's like, ugh.

47:28.060 --> 47:31.180
Because why even start a project if you know that halfway through it or even a tenth of

47:31.180 --> 47:34.180
the way through it, you're going to run out of time and you're not going to be able to

47:34.180 --> 47:35.180
finish it anyway.

47:35.180 --> 47:36.180
So why even bother starting?

47:36.180 --> 47:38.100
Because they have availability selectors, you're going to tell them how much time you

47:38.100 --> 47:40.820
have available, they have seven plus distros you get to choose from, so all of the courseware

47:40.820 --> 47:43.980
will match that, and the servers that spin up during your courseware match that as well.

47:43.980 --> 47:47.140
It's really nice, you get to keep track of your progress, ride as you go and pick up

47:47.140 --> 47:48.780
right where you left off when you come back.

47:48.780 --> 47:52.700
They have so many great new OpenStack Essential courses, the best AWS courses out there with

47:52.700 --> 47:57.180
scenario based labs, Docker, Vagrant, I mean the list goes on, I go through this list all

47:57.180 --> 47:59.580
the time, and it's like, I could just sit here and go off, but you don't need to.

47:59.580 --> 48:03.580
Go to Linux Academy and go look at the courses, go look at the nuggets, they've got so many

48:03.580 --> 48:04.580
different things up there.

48:04.580 --> 48:07.860
DevOps courseware, I don't ever really talk about that very much.

48:07.860 --> 48:12.500
Learning Vagrant, Docker Deep Dive, Chef DevOps Deployment, Learning Puppet, all this kind

48:12.500 --> 48:15.740
of stuff is extremely, extremely handy, and it's not just Linux, it's all the stuff built

48:15.740 --> 48:16.740
around Linux.

48:16.740 --> 48:20.780
You know, things like Puppet too, Chris, are one of those things that's a very difficult

48:20.780 --> 48:21.780
thing.

48:21.780 --> 48:22.780
It's very dry.

48:22.780 --> 48:26.700
If you're reading a tutorial, my god, to go through things like Puppet inside of a

48:26.700 --> 48:28.500
written tutorial, it's painful.

48:28.500 --> 48:32.740
And you can download the guides and stuff, and the audio, and listen to it like in the

48:32.740 --> 48:33.740
car and stuff.

48:33.740 --> 48:34.740
You can get that.

48:34.740 --> 48:35.740
They have the videos.

48:35.740 --> 48:36.740
They demonstrate how they do it.

48:36.740 --> 48:40.260
And you know, when I can hear a person explain, now we're going to do this, and he breaks

48:40.260 --> 48:45.220
up that just monotonous block of text, that's hugely helpful.

48:45.220 --> 48:48.380
And there are certain things that I've learned on Linux Academy that I would have never been

48:48.380 --> 48:51.020
able to get through if I was going out and searching tutorials myself.

48:51.020 --> 48:54.580
And on top of that, they hold QA sessions through Hangouts and stuff, which is really

48:54.580 --> 48:55.580
nice.

48:55.580 --> 48:56.580
So you can ask the instructor questions.

48:56.580 --> 48:59.620
They have a good community you can follow on, which are stacked with JB members if you have

48:59.620 --> 49:03.060
any tough spots or a success story you want to share.

49:03.060 --> 49:06.060
And they have team accounts if you are a small business or a group of people that want to

49:06.060 --> 49:07.100
work together.

49:07.100 --> 49:09.580
And they're adding new labs all of the time.

49:09.580 --> 49:10.580
All of the time.

49:10.580 --> 49:14.340
It's such a great system because it's built by true Linux and open source enthusiasts

49:14.340 --> 49:16.140
who want to help spread the platform.

49:16.140 --> 49:19.220
And the way they want to help contribute to Linux and open source is by creating something

49:19.220 --> 49:21.420
that helps more people take advantage of it.

49:21.420 --> 49:23.140
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

49:23.140 --> 49:25.800
Go get our special 33% discount.

49:25.800 --> 49:29.920
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

49:29.920 --> 49:31.580
You guys are the bestest.

49:31.580 --> 49:36.380
Now this one I don't really know if we're going to get a lot of conversation about,

49:36.380 --> 49:40.420
but I pretty much buy NVIDIA cards if I'm going to have a debt.

49:40.420 --> 49:43.220
It's either Intel or NVIDIA for me most of the time.

49:43.220 --> 49:44.220
Right.

49:44.220 --> 49:45.220
Does somebody else make graphics cards?

49:45.220 --> 49:46.220
Well, ATI AMD's got.

49:46.220 --> 49:47.220
Do you have any rigs with AMD?

49:47.220 --> 49:48.220
No?

49:48.220 --> 49:49.220
No.

49:49.220 --> 49:54.220
I bought one AMD or one ATI card, whatever it was, eight years ago, yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:54.220 --> 49:58.260
And I had such a pain in the rear trying to get the stupid thing to work with Linux.

49:58.260 --> 50:02.340
And even today, even like this is, you know, that was back in 1204 days.

50:02.340 --> 50:07.220
Even on like 1404, 1410, I go to install it and it is such a pain to get drivers working

50:07.220 --> 50:08.220
for ATR.

50:08.220 --> 50:11.420
I feel like they keep teasing us with like new driver models, they're going to fix all

50:11.420 --> 50:12.420
of this.

50:12.420 --> 50:13.420
Here's what you have to do.

50:13.420 --> 50:14.420
Nobody's ever done this.

50:14.420 --> 50:18.740
You have to kill X, go into the, go to the command line, take the dot run file, modify

50:18.740 --> 50:20.940
the permissions so you can run it, run the stupid thing.

50:20.940 --> 50:21.940
Then it's just a huge thing.

50:21.940 --> 50:22.940
Yeah.

50:22.940 --> 50:23.940
They don't even market executable.

50:23.940 --> 50:24.940
They don't even market executable.

50:24.940 --> 50:29.340
So I go to NVIDIA, I click on the little checkbox that says enable NVIDIA drivers and restart

50:29.340 --> 50:33.620
my machine and then I have NVIDIA drivers until I don't even have to do that.

50:33.620 --> 50:37.820
Anybody in the mumble room want to become an AMD ATI video card defender before we move

50:37.820 --> 50:38.820
on?

50:38.820 --> 50:39.820
I know some of you have success with the open source drivers.

50:39.820 --> 50:42.420
So what he means to say is, does anyone want to get kicked out of the mumble room?

50:42.420 --> 50:43.420
No.

50:43.420 --> 50:44.420
No, does anyone have a counter?

50:44.420 --> 50:50.100
I'm just waiting for the ARM cards also to get real.

50:50.100 --> 50:53.500
I mean the ARM space is coming along.

50:53.500 --> 50:54.500
Yeah, yeah.

50:54.500 --> 50:55.500
That's very true.

50:55.500 --> 50:59.780
And I really want to see that to become an also a platform for competition with the desktop

50:59.780 --> 51:00.780
market.

51:00.780 --> 51:01.780
Yeah, that would be very interesting.

51:01.780 --> 51:02.780
All right.

51:02.780 --> 51:03.780
So here is the pro tip.

51:03.780 --> 51:08.060
If you're not getting enough performance out of your AMD card Linux users, I have something

51:08.060 --> 51:09.060
for you.

51:09.060 --> 51:12.020
This was discovered as you would probably not be surprised to learn.

51:12.020 --> 51:15.180
I believe over at the Ferronix forums, surprise, surprise.

51:15.180 --> 51:22.380
But and it's been tested now, AMD Catalyst Linux drivers perform wildly different based

51:22.380 --> 51:24.820
on the file name of the game you're playing.

51:24.820 --> 51:25.820
What?

51:25.820 --> 51:26.820
Yeah.

51:26.820 --> 51:29.860
So in the past years, AMD Catalyst driver has yielded a better performance of naming

51:29.860 --> 51:34.020
the executable Doom 3.86 or Compass, like if you just named it that.

51:34.020 --> 51:37.800
But these days, the application profile concept is made more absurd with games that are coming

51:37.800 --> 51:39.340
to Linux all the time.

51:39.340 --> 51:45.820
So the latest example, you can get a 40%, I'm going to say that again, a 40%.

51:45.820 --> 51:48.940
People do massive hardware upgrades to get a 40% improvement, right?

51:48.940 --> 51:49.940
Less than that.

51:49.940 --> 51:50.940
Yeah, yeah.

51:50.940 --> 51:55.060
They get a 40% better performance by renaming Counter-Strike Global Offensive on Linux.

51:55.060 --> 52:01.220
If you rename the CSGO underscore Linux binary to HL2 underscore Linux for Half-Life 2 within

52:01.220 --> 52:05.620
Steam, the frame rates suddenly increase across the board.

52:05.620 --> 52:09.800
This is with the latest Catalyst 15.7 Linux driver, while CSGO has been on Linux for nearly

52:09.800 --> 52:12.340
a year now.

52:12.340 --> 52:15.180
Is this a thing on other graphics cards or is this ATI specific?

52:15.180 --> 52:17.020
Well, it's not totally uncommon.

52:17.020 --> 52:20.980
You know what it is, is like it's a cat and mouse game because the video card manufacturers

52:20.980 --> 52:24.940
are trying to compensate for crappy developers and developers are trying to compensate for

52:24.940 --> 52:26.780
crappy video card manufacturers.

52:26.780 --> 52:30.160
And so they're writing profile specific settings for games, and the only way they can really

52:30.160 --> 52:32.540
figure out how to do it is by looking at the file name.

52:32.540 --> 52:36.380
But the question is, should they even be doing this at all anymore?

52:36.380 --> 52:37.380
It's a clown show.

52:37.380 --> 52:38.380
Yeah.

52:38.380 --> 52:39.380
Yeah, it really is.

52:39.380 --> 52:40.380
What do you think, Daredevil?

52:40.380 --> 52:44.820
And you think it's for maybe benchmarking?

52:44.820 --> 52:45.820
Not just benchmarking.

52:45.820 --> 52:51.020
I think actually this has potential agreement between the graphics video card companies

52:51.020 --> 52:52.020
and the game companies.

52:52.020 --> 52:53.020
Oh, dirty play.

52:53.020 --> 52:55.940
Some games are successful and not others.

52:55.940 --> 52:59.380
And this raises the question if they shouldn't be probed about this.

52:59.380 --> 53:05.260
Yeah, I mean, you've definitely, like, Samsung got busted last year whenever you would run

53:05.260 --> 53:06.860
a benchmarking app on Android.

53:06.860 --> 53:10.540
They would detect that and overclock the CPU during the benchmark app's process time.

53:10.540 --> 53:13.420
And then when you close the app, they de-clock the CPU.

53:13.420 --> 53:14.420
Very nice.

53:14.420 --> 53:15.420
Dirty, dirty, dirty.

53:15.420 --> 53:16.420
Maybe.

53:16.420 --> 53:19.340
And, you know, some game manufacturers do get a little money from Nvidia to put the

53:19.340 --> 53:23.260
Made for Nvidia splash screen that comes up.

53:23.260 --> 53:24.260
I don't know, though.

53:24.260 --> 53:27.940
I think it's more like AMD trying to be too smart, and I think it's also a little bit

53:27.940 --> 53:31.500
of a hit and miss in 3D applications under Linux over the last few years, because these

53:31.500 --> 53:35.780
guys have a whole history of, you know, writing drivers for Linux for a long time.

53:35.780 --> 53:39.500
They've been through the bad days where this maybe was kind of needed.

53:39.500 --> 53:44.900
These situations have been targeted before for market competition laws.

53:44.900 --> 53:48.020
I pretty much think this sounds extremely illegal.

53:48.020 --> 53:49.020
You know, you could be right.

53:49.020 --> 53:52.900
Because they should be focusing on making the driver for the graphics card to work,

53:52.900 --> 53:56.420
and the program should be doing the calls, not the driver.

53:56.420 --> 54:00.460
But if you're ATI and AMD and you're getting all these reports about this game crashing

54:00.460 --> 54:05.380
only on your card, and the developer of the game isn't releasing any patches to fix it,

54:05.380 --> 54:09.660
don't you feel some pressure to fix it on your end if you know how to give your card

54:09.660 --> 54:10.660
a better name?

54:10.660 --> 54:14.420
Because you don't want the internet going, oh, man, this Half-Life 3 game is so amazing,

54:14.420 --> 54:16.540
it finally came out, except for on ATI cards.

54:16.540 --> 54:17.860
Like, that's not the story you want.

54:17.860 --> 54:18.860
So I guess, let's start with...

54:18.860 --> 54:19.860
Here's what you do.

54:19.860 --> 54:20.860
Here's what you do.

54:20.860 --> 54:25.620
You do an update system that is transparent to the user that it says, NVIDIA is providing

54:25.620 --> 54:31.580
a special configuration for this game, and, you know, so that it's clear.

54:31.580 --> 54:34.980
You go to notify the users instead of trying to manipulate the driver.

54:34.980 --> 54:35.980
Exactly.

54:35.980 --> 54:37.700
So, I guess let's start with this.

54:37.700 --> 54:43.660
I guess I'm still back lost at what is the ATI market nowadays.

54:43.660 --> 54:44.660
Because there was a...

54:44.660 --> 54:45.660
Okay, hear me out.

54:45.660 --> 54:46.660
Price, dude.

54:46.660 --> 54:47.660
NVIDIA was...

54:47.660 --> 54:49.220
No, that's Intel to me.

54:49.220 --> 54:53.640
To me, Intel integrated graphics is what AMD used to be, which is that you can do reasonable

54:53.640 --> 54:57.300
amount of games with a little less performance, but it's at a drastically better price point.

54:57.300 --> 54:59.900
And if I want a really good graphics, I'm going to go with NVIDIA.

54:59.900 --> 55:03.740
So I mean, I suppose that ATI tries to split that down the middle, but...

55:03.740 --> 55:04.740
Yeah, exactly.

55:04.740 --> 55:05.740
They're kind of...

55:05.740 --> 55:08.220
They're more powerful than Intel's by a large margin.

55:08.220 --> 55:10.580
I think they're cheaper than NVIDIA's.

55:10.580 --> 55:11.580
And nothing says...

55:11.580 --> 55:14.260
I mean, nothing says NVIDIA isn't necessarily doing this either.

55:14.260 --> 55:15.260
Right?

55:15.260 --> 55:18.540
And they could be doing it on Windows just as easily as they're doing it on Linux.

55:18.540 --> 55:20.940
This is something that driver manufacturers have done for a while.

55:20.940 --> 55:23.740
It's just that when they tested, they only found ATI doing it, but it could be NVIDIA

55:23.740 --> 55:24.740
too.

55:24.740 --> 55:25.740
We don't know.

55:25.740 --> 55:26.740
So we can't totally slam ATI.

55:26.740 --> 55:27.740
I agree.

55:27.740 --> 55:30.860
I don't know if you're a primary Linux user what the main advantage to an AMD video card

55:30.860 --> 55:31.860
is.

55:31.860 --> 55:34.180
Although they do have a pretty new cool open source driver model they're working on where

55:34.180 --> 55:37.460
there's going to be most of it in user space, and it's going to be a lot easier to update,

55:37.460 --> 55:38.460
a lot easier to install.

55:38.460 --> 55:39.460
You know what?

55:39.460 --> 55:41.420
Even the Windows guys I know.

55:41.420 --> 55:42.700
They're just sold on NVIDIA.

55:42.700 --> 55:47.100
I haven't met an ATI fan guy, a fanboy, in a long time.

55:47.100 --> 55:55.380
If I'm not mistaken, and I could be wrong, please, I read a while ago that there was

55:55.380 --> 55:59.740
some probing between NVIDIA and Intel or something on market dominance.

55:59.740 --> 56:09.020
And I think ATI is being given a market share naturally because of these instead of a fine

56:09.020 --> 56:16.500
is being applicable as per as many laptops as go in an X brand will have to go with ATI

56:16.500 --> 56:20.940
as well or something like that as competition laws, at least in Europe's side.

56:20.940 --> 56:22.380
But I'm not 100% sure.

56:22.380 --> 56:26.820
I need to recheck that, but definitely I remember reading something about this.

56:26.820 --> 56:29.660
It's definitely an interesting take on this.

56:29.660 --> 56:34.260
I hadn't thought of it being a conspiracy, but that's how I like that.

56:34.260 --> 56:35.820
It's fun nonetheless either way.

56:35.820 --> 56:40.340
I just, yeah, it is right now, it doesn't appear to, these particular profiles also

56:40.340 --> 56:44.800
don't appear to be affecting Windows users, and it comes down to if you're going to do

56:44.800 --> 56:48.700
crap like this, and I'm talking to you, AMD, if you're going to do crap like this and you're

56:48.700 --> 56:53.220
going to have specific application profiles, then it is incumbent upon you to keep that

56:53.220 --> 56:54.500
crap updated.

56:54.500 --> 56:55.620
You keep on top of it.

56:55.620 --> 57:00.860
If you're going to limit my games by 40 effing percent, then it is your gerb because now

57:00.860 --> 57:02.580
they have the opposite of problem.

57:02.580 --> 57:04.020
Now they're crippling all my games.

57:04.020 --> 57:08.540
So seriously, if you're going to do this crap, you got to stay on top of those application

57:08.540 --> 57:09.540
profiles.

57:09.540 --> 57:10.540
I don't think that's realistic.

57:10.540 --> 57:12.020
And also give me an option to turn it all off.

57:12.020 --> 57:13.660
Yeah, I was going to say, I don't think that's realistic.

57:13.660 --> 57:15.860
I don't think it's realistic that you can stay on top.

57:15.860 --> 57:16.860
I mean, think about what you're saying.

57:16.860 --> 57:17.860
Right.

57:17.860 --> 57:18.860
They just come out so fast.

57:18.860 --> 57:19.860
There's so many indie games.

57:19.860 --> 57:20.860
Exactly.

57:20.860 --> 57:21.860
Steam's got, yeah.

57:21.860 --> 57:22.860
It's not practical.

57:22.860 --> 57:23.860
There's no hope of them actually, there's no realistic.

57:23.860 --> 57:24.860
Not to mention open source games they've never even heard of.

57:24.860 --> 57:25.860
Yeah.

57:25.860 --> 57:26.860
There's no realistic expectation to be able to do that.

57:26.860 --> 57:27.860
I like your idea.

57:27.860 --> 57:28.940
Give me a button to turn it off.

57:28.940 --> 57:35.980
Call it a game optimization for select games that we know about, blah, blah, blah.

57:35.980 --> 57:37.460
That I think is the way they should do it.

57:37.460 --> 57:38.460
We'll see.

57:38.460 --> 57:39.460
We will see.

57:39.460 --> 57:42.300
And if you are an ATI user, or I'm sorry, AMD, and you want to defend them, or you got

57:42.300 --> 57:47.980
a really good reason, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact, or go find 102 or in the Linux

57:47.980 --> 57:50.180
Action subreddit, or even better, the Mamba Room.

57:50.180 --> 57:51.180
Yeah.

57:51.180 --> 57:56.780
They still get royalties, by the way, guys, on the x86, 64 architecture and a couple of

57:56.780 --> 57:59.340
their APU models, which is money.

57:59.340 --> 58:01.460
Yeah, that is their source of money, isn't it?

58:01.460 --> 58:02.460
Yeah, I can't blame them.

58:02.460 --> 58:03.660
They got a good thing going there.

58:03.660 --> 58:06.260
They helped develop a good technology.

58:06.260 --> 58:12.340
All right, Mr. Noah, let's talk about our next sponsor as we round out to the last minutes

58:12.340 --> 58:13.340
of the show, Noah.

58:13.340 --> 58:16.700
And what we're going to talk about is that Dell situation that we mentioned at the top

58:16.700 --> 58:19.500
of the show, and also my prediction that's finally coming true.

58:19.500 --> 58:20.500
Finally, that's good.

58:20.500 --> 58:21.500
Yeah, I know, right?

58:21.500 --> 58:22.500
Linux.ting.com.

58:22.500 --> 58:23.500
Go there, won't you, friends?

58:23.500 --> 58:28.180
Linux.ting.com, and go get yourself a device with no contract, no early termination fee,

58:28.180 --> 58:30.860
and you only pay for what you use.

58:30.860 --> 58:32.980
No BS here, guys.

58:32.980 --> 58:33.980
This is really slick.

58:33.980 --> 58:34.980
I love no contracts.

58:34.980 --> 58:37.500
I love only paying for what I use because it allows me to have a couple of phones to

58:37.500 --> 58:38.500
experiment with.

58:38.500 --> 58:40.000
You heard me mention earlier, I have a Nexus 5.

58:40.000 --> 58:44.540
I'm able to keep that and use that and not feel bad about having a phone sitting on my

58:44.540 --> 58:47.460
desk that cost me $50, $60, $70, $80 a month.

58:47.460 --> 58:48.460
Yeah.

58:48.460 --> 58:49.460
It feels really good.

58:49.460 --> 58:50.460
You know how many phones I brought with me?

58:50.460 --> 58:51.460
Ting phones I brought with me?

58:51.460 --> 58:52.460
No.

58:52.460 --> 58:53.460
Little Noah has one.

58:53.460 --> 58:54.460
I have one in my backup.

58:54.460 --> 58:55.460
Sarah has hers.

58:55.460 --> 58:56.460
We have a little hotspot.

58:56.460 --> 58:57.460
So that's like five devices?

58:57.460 --> 58:58.460
Yeah.

58:58.460 --> 59:00.980
We brought like five out of the nine that we have.

59:00.980 --> 59:01.980
Yeah.

59:01.980 --> 59:02.980
It's nice.

59:02.980 --> 59:06.460
The Mi-Fi is a great way to go with Ting because if you don't need a ton, you can just turn

59:06.460 --> 59:08.780
it off when you don't need it, and then when you do need it, you just pay for what you

59:08.780 --> 59:09.780
use.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.420
You know what my backup for my SIP system is?

59:11.420 --> 59:12.460
They sell this.

59:12.460 --> 59:18.300
It's a home device that connects to the cellular network, and then I have a jack on this Ting

59:18.300 --> 59:21.940
box that plugs into the FXO jack of my SIP server.

59:21.940 --> 59:25.860
So if my SIP line ever goes down, if I lose the internet, I can still make phone calls.

59:25.860 --> 59:26.860
That's awesome.

59:26.860 --> 59:28.420
As long as my local network is working, I can make calls.

59:28.420 --> 59:29.420
Which it always is.

59:29.420 --> 59:30.420
Yeah.

59:30.420 --> 59:31.420
And it'll just send them out over Ting.

59:31.420 --> 59:32.420
Now do I really care?

59:32.420 --> 59:35.540
Since I'm not using any minutes most months, it cost me six bucks to have that box connected.

59:35.540 --> 59:36.540
That is a great idea.

59:36.540 --> 59:37.540
Yeah.

59:37.540 --> 59:39.880
So if anyone ever thinks they're going to be clever and like they're going to cut my

59:39.880 --> 59:42.140
phone lines or they're going to cut the internet line, go right ahead.

59:42.140 --> 59:43.140
I can still call out.

59:43.140 --> 59:45.580
My alarm system can still call out because it's all going through.

59:45.580 --> 59:46.860
That's a slick backup, dude.

59:46.860 --> 59:48.620
We should set that up here at the studio.

59:48.620 --> 59:51.580
So this is really nice because when you go to linux.ting.com.

59:51.580 --> 59:52.580
I want that, Noah.

59:52.580 --> 59:55.100
You want more backups for your phone?

59:55.100 --> 59:56.100
Is that what you're telling me?

59:56.100 --> 59:57.100
No.

59:57.100 --> 59:58.100
What I want is-

59:58.100 --> 59:59.100
You're not interrupted enough?

59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.100
We've had it.

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.780
We had a situation, it was a year ago now, but Comcast went out all day and we brought

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:06.220
in my, I think I was at Nexus 5 at the time.

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.220
With Allen, right?

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:08.220
Yeah.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.220
I remember this.

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:10.220
We hotspotted off that.

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:11.220
Got the show done.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:12.220
And I was like, gosh.

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.220
But then of course, Rekai couldn't do it.

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.580
It'd be nice to have something that was whole house wide and I'd pay $6 a month to have

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:16.580
a backup internet connection.

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.580
Heck yeah.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.580
That's genius.

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.580
Of course, I wasn't streaming on it.

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.580
I'm making phone calls.

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:24.140
Actually, here though, I get 20 up, 20 down over Ting here in the studio.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:25.140
Well, no.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:26.140
I'm not saying the speed wouldn't be good enough.

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:31.180
I'd be a little concerned if you were going to do internet broadcasting all day.

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.180
Oh, yeah.

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:35.820
All we did is we just recorded locally and just did the audio stream and it was flawless.

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:36.820
Oh, yeah.

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:37.820
Yeah, just the audio stream.

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:38.820
It worked fine.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:41.020
And actually, if you think about it, with all the money you'd saved, because I saved

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.060
$2,000 somewhere around there.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:48.460
If you add that up, even if it cost you $400 or $500 to have your show on the air, that's

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:49.460
to you that you're lively.

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:50.460
One time.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:51.460
Yeah.

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:52.460
That's no big deal.

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:53.460
Right.

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:54.460
So now you're saved.

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:55.460
If you average it over the two years.

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.460
Yeah.

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.460
Now you save 25% less and you still save 75% of your money.

01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:58.460
Yeah.

01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:59.460
Yeah.

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:00.460
And actually, this might go away, because Ting is awesome.

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:01.740
Ting is changing up mobile.

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:05.580
They're hopefully going to break up the duopolies over time, but they're not stopping there.

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.380
And this is kind of exciting.

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:12.300
Ting is rolling out fiber internet too, and they have it now in some locations.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.540
And I think a lot of you have heard me talk about this, you're probably wondering what's

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:19.860
going on next for Ting's fiber internet service, because man would I not just freaking love

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:22.980
to have the Ting model come to my wired internet connection and have it be fiber.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:25.580
So yeah, I'm interested to see what's coming up next and they're going to tell us.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:29.060
They have a little video about it.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:33.660
Nicholas K asks, for internet, are you more likely to expand outward from Charlottesville

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:36.620
or step into cities in different parts of the country?

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:41.460
I think that we're more likely in Charlottesville just to focus on the existing city area for

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.460
the time being.

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:47.540
You know, we think there's so much opportunity inside the city itself and there's a lot of

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:51.740
different places we can go with the network and that's what we're really focusing on there

01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:54.140
for the time being in Charlottesville.

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:58.660
At the same time, we want to really expand into new markets in the U.S.

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:02.720
So while we're doing that in Charlottesville, you'll see us looking to get into new cities

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.740
across the U.S. as well.

01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:06.740
Man that's going to be crazy.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:07.740
Seattle, Seattle, Seattle, Seattle.

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:08.740
Come on Ting.

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:09.740
Seattle, please.

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:10.740
Grand Forks, North Dakota.

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:13.820
I can send you a map so you can figure out where it is.

01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:17.460
Go to linux.ting.com, get our $25 discount that'll go off your first device.

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:21.020
If you don't have one, if you have a Ting compatible device and they have CDMA and GSM

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:24.700
networks, they'll give you a $25 service credit, which paid for more than my first month.

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:28.940
So go to linux.ting.com and change up your mobile service and start saving money right

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:29.940
now.

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:33.340
Tons of great devices unlocked from like $60 feature phones all the way up to the latest

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:34.340
and greatest Android devices.

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:35.340
They got the OnePlus there too.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:36.340
Do you mind if I check out?

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.340
Yeah.

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.340
I've been watching it.

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:39.340
Yep, yep, yep.

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:40.340
I know, yeah.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.340
That's why I mentioned it.

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.340
Keep thinking about it.

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.340
All right.

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:45.500
So your good buddies, your friends over at Dell, have suspended the XPS 13 developer

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:46.500
edition.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.500
Which computer?

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.500
That's not what you're talking about.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.500
Oh, I'm talking about that.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.500
No, I know.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.500
But that wasn't the one.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.500
Oh, which computer were you talking about?

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:53.500
I was talking about that cheap 340.

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.500
Oh, yeah.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.500
Yeah.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.500
That is nice.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.500
Well, that actually might be on suspend too.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.500
Hold on.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.500
Okay.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.980
So those of you who know, the XPS 13 developer edition ships with Ubuntu 14.04 from Dell

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.340
and they're currently putting it on suspend.

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.300
Once again, we want to thank our entire community, they say, for your posts containing feedback

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:12.420
and questions to the Dell Tech Center forum and this blog regarding the Ubuntu-based XPS

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:15.980
13 and the M3800.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:16.980
Is that it?

01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:17.980
No, no, no.

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:18.980
The M3800.

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:19.980
That's the decision series.

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:20.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:21.980
Okay.

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:22.980
Yeah.

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:23.980
So that cheaper $300 one is not being stopped.

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:27.780
But the M3800 and the XPS 13 are being suspended.

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:32.140
Last month, they posted four knowledge base articles addressing wireless drivers, keyboard

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:35.140
repeats, suspend and resume, and cursor freezes.

01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:38.620
And they feel that they need to temporarily pull the plug on this laptop while they work

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:42.460
these issues out and try to resolve the problem.

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:44.540
So here's my initial thoughts on that.

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:48.620
One is, if there is a problem and they're actively going to work on it, then it's a

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:49.620
great thing.

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:52.420
Now personally, I kind of see through that and I kind of get the impression that you

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.220
do too, that that's not really what this is.

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:56.900
Well, I own one and I don't have those problems.

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.800
So here's the other side.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:04.040
If Dell decided to pull the plug on that particular model, I would say that that is a totally

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.660
justifiable decision in that a lot of times we say that they didn't really commit to it,

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.180
they didn't really push it, they didn't really – you can't really say that about the XPS.

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:16.740
The XPS – because I had the older version of the XPS and I thought they completely contributed

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.820
– I mean, they totally dove in on Linux.

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.900
I mean, that was a Linux laptop.

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.860
It was a good Linux laptop.

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:26.220
And if the market doesn't respond, if people don't buy those computers, then yeah, Dell

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:27.220
is going to pull the plug.

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.340
Yeah, I don't necessarily disagree with any of that.

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.700
Where I feel like Dell went wrong and why I'm a little upset about it – not all that

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:38.900
upset, but I had this impression when I got the XPS too, but – and it's undeniable.

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.660
It was first and foremost designed as a Windows laptop.

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:44.660
They looked at the specs and went, well, I think we could also make Linux run on this,

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:47.500
but we have to – you know, you had that Broadcom thing, we have to accommodate for

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.940
this, we have to accommodate for that.

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:51.940
It was first and foremost built to run Windows 8.

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:55.500
And then they later retrofitted – I mean, that's why it has a touch screen, right?

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:59.140
I mean, why ship a Linux laptop today with a touch screen, right?

01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:03.500
It has all of these things that – like the 4K screen resolution didn't really work very

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.780
well except for now it's a lot better since the time I've owned it, but at the beginning

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:10.780
of this year, 4K support under Linux was really shitty.

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.540
And now it's gotten to a point where it's actually usable, and thank God Chrome's high

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:18.140
DPI and things like that, but they shipped a product where the applications on it didn't

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:19.580
even look right on the display.

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.500
The touch screen didn't really have a use.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.700
The mouse requires a special driver.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.300
The wireless card requires a special driver.

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.780
They didn't – I don't feel like – if they really wanted to go all in on building

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:31.500
– I think with that first Sputnik, that was better.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:35.060
Like they – it felt like that was maybe from the original drawing board, this is going

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.140
to run Linux.

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:39.260
This one felt like, hey, it's been a long time since we updated the Sputnik.

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:42.100
This laptop's pretty close that we're building with Windows 8, so let's make that

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:43.100
our Linux one.

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:49.020
So, but at the time that they actually released the Linux version, did it – were those problems

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:50.620
still persistent?

01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.380
Because remember when you – okay, all right.

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:55.820
I mean the first – for the first few weeks, they had some issues, but they had some updates

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:58.020
that fixed – that resolved pretty much everything.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:02.400
And then Dell released two BIOS updates, and then after they released those two BIOS updates,

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:06.060
they also released it for the original XPS 13 that was shipped with Windows.

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:09.260
After between – after they did those BIOS updates and the latest Linux kernel, I've

01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:11.420
never had a problem anymore.

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:12.420
Wireless works fine.

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:13.420
Sleep and suspend works fine.

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:14.420
Key repeat issue's gone.

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:15.420
Mouse issues are all gone.

01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:16.900
All that stuff is cleared up.

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:18.660
So there were problems.

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:19.660
And they fixed them.

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:21.420
Through BIOS updates and stuff and kernel updates.

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:26.380
But I feel like if they had gone at the approach where everything in this component needs to

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:29.380
be – every component in this machine needs to be Linux compatible, they wouldn't have

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:31.360
ended up where they're at right now.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.260
And the reason what I – the reason I don't like it is because, I mean, I'm super glad

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:36.260
they're testing it.

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:40.660
But I just wish – I wish if you're going to pull back on it, like, they're sort of

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:43.180
playing to all these stereotypes about Linux on the desktop.

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:44.780
Oh, you got weird issues here.

01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:45.780
We got weird issues here.

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.940
In fact, they're so bad, we have to stop selling the product.

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:52.180
And it just puts this message out there to other OEMs that this is a train wreck that

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.780
you are going to get – it's a quagmire you're going to get pulled into if you try

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:55.780
to ship this product.

01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:56.780
Boy, that's the truth.

01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:01.060
And the thing is, I believe, and I have believed for quite some time, that there is a market

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:04.060
for a high-end, well-built Linux laptop.

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:05.060
Oh, yeah.

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.060
You can find the XPS.

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:07.060
You and I –

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:08.220
I actually think it's still a pretty great laptop.

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:09.220
No, I agree.

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:11.860
But I guess what I'm saying is I think that there's a lot of people that would say, well,

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.900
Chris and Noah, you guys are the exception.

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:14.900
Most people don't want that.

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:21.700
Where Linux fits in is the crappy Celeron with 1366 by 768 and 120 gig SSD and 4 gigs

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:22.700
of RAM.

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:23.700
And you can sell that for –

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:24.700
Or a spinning 5400.

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:25.700
Yeah, right, right.

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.500
And you can sell that for $300 or $200 at Best Buy.

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.500
That's where Linux fits.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:29.500
And I don't agree with that.

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:30.500
I think that that is one market.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.500
There's a range.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:32.500
I think there is a market for that.

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.660
I also think there's – I think there's a big market for those Chromebook users that

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:36.660
you were talking about.

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:39.500
I think that there is a subset of those, and I think it's a fairly large subset, that

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:42.780
would spend three or four times the amount of money on a laptop if they could keep it

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.380
for the next seven or eight years, and it would work flawlessly.

01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:46.380
Yeah.

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:48.920
Popey, have you looked at the XPS 13, and what do you think?

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:52.140
Is this sort of bad PR in a roundabout way?

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:53.140
Oh, no.

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:54.140
He's lit up.

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.140
Sorry, Popey.

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:56.140
Go ahead.

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:57.140
Oh, yeah.

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.140
On my device.

01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.140
What?

01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:00.140
I'm sorry.

01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:01.140
I cut off the first few words you said.

01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:02.140
Oh, okay.

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:08.140
It's a shame the quality assurance wasn't higher on the Linux shipping devices, because

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:11.820
I know a bunch of people who bought them, both canonical and non-canonical, people who

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:18.520
bought them and experienced the same kind of issues as everyone else and were just as

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.540
frustrated as everyone else.

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:28.260
And yeah, I agree that probably if it had been a Linux machine from the get-go and everything

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:33.860
was made to work on Linux on day one, maybe things would be different.

01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:39.340
But the problem with that is you have such a small market for, you know, really relative

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:42.080
to the Windows market, a very small market.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:47.740
So making a one-off specific machine, given the low profit margin that Dell make on every

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:53.460
machine anyway, on any machine, that's a huge amount of engineering investment in order

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:57.900
to make a one-off machine that you know will work well with Linux.

01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:04.580
So what generally happens with OEMs is from our perspective at Canonical, we work with

01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:06.020
them to build the image.

01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:13.460
So that image that went on the Dell XPS 13 that was shipping was a collaboration between

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:14.840
Dell and Canonical.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:20.220
So we take some of the blame for that not being as shiny as it could have been as it

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.220
went out the door.

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:26.100
And, you know, we talked to Dell a lot about these kind of issues, and there's a lot of

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:32.060
feedback that goes back to them, and clearly they've decided that they need to stop selling

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:37.380
the thing temporarily just so that they can integrate all these fixes so the ones that

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:40.340
go out the door are the best that they can possibly be.

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:45.820
But Popey, I mean, so I can accept that to a certain extent, but the reality is like

01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:48.960
that you're shipped with a Broadcom card, right?

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:53.620
If you are building a computer to run Linux, that's almost the worst possible card you

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:56.540
could put in there, save the ones that Dell themselves make.

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.540
Here's I guess so...

01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:58.540
Sure.

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:00.500
Like name a wireless card that's fantastic on Linux and Windows.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:01.500
Intel.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.500
Well, the Intel's are pretty good.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.500
Intel's.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.500
No, that's bullshit.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.500
No, no, no, no.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:06.500
I've never had an Intel card.

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:09.180
Popey, I've never ever had an Intel card that didn't work right out of the box with Linux,

01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:10.180
ever.

01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:11.180
Well, well done you.

01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:12.180
But I have.

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:13.700
Can you give me a model?

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:18.880
For the last two years, for the last two years, the IWL Wi-Fi driver, you've had to blacklist

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.760
N to even stay on a wireless network.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:22.860
It's ridiculous.

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:28.620
So making out like one wireless wireless card is somehow blessed by the gods and is way

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:32.740
better than all the others is just bull because they are all shit.

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:34.340
I respectfully disagree with you.

01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:39.660
I in like and I don't mean like the one or two or three laptops had I've had over the

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:40.660
year.

01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:44.900
I mean like 50, 60 different computers, all of that Intel cards, and I've never had an

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:45.900
issue.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:46.900
So I am.

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.320
Well, that's nice for you, but you're not you're not alone.

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:55.540
And I get people PMing me saying, hey, what's that thing I put in etc modules dot D or whatever

01:10:55.540 --> 01:11:00.420
that disables wireless N on Intel cards because I'm at a customer site and I can't get on

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:01.740
their Wi-Fi.

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.500
And this is a common problem.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.980
Can you give me a model that I can put in my computer?

01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:10.700
Whatever's in my whatever's in my X220.

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:14.260
I have one Intel card I had I have had issues with, but for the most part, they've been

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:15.260
pretty good for me.

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.260
I have an X220.

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:17.260
Right.

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:18.260
And I don't have a problem with my wireless card.

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:21.060
I love I love Intel as much as the next guy, right?

01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:27.260
But you you can't put them up as hold them up as being the panacea of perfection because

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:30.740
there are issues with it with their wireless drivers and there are issues with their X

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:37.260
drivers and to make out like they're somehow way more perfect than ATI or Nvidia is just

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.260
missing the point.

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:39.260
I can't speak.

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:40.260
I can't speak to graphics.

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:41.260
But I'll tell you this.

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:45.940
If you order 10 Intel Wi-Fi cards off of Amazon different models and you order 10 Broadcom

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:50.060
cards, I'll make a bet right now that 10 of the Intel ones will work on Linux right out

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:53.220
of the box and nine out of the 10 of the Broadcom ones won't work out of the box.

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.340
I wonder five of those.

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.340
You'll never get to work.

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:58.860
I wonder if the differences you guys are talking about is Noah's talking about actually turning

01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:01.180
the card on and connecting like the driver seeing it.

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:03.980
And I think he's talking about like reliability of connection of the wireless network.

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:09.060
Oh, that might be actually, you know, that might be here's the thing I will deal with.

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:10.500
So to that here would be my answer.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:13.900
My answer would be I'll take the card that is less reliable than the card that gives

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:14.900
me no Wi-Fi whatsoever.

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:17.020
Well, I think Wi-Fi is unreliable.

01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:21.300
I wanted to address that so that I think probably made a pretty fair point in that, you know,

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:28.580
Dell doesn't really have the time, resources or motivations to make that XPS laptop Linux

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:33.860
first because really they're selling way, you know, probably 99 percent more Windows

01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:37.080
laptops than they are going to sell the Linux version of that laptop.

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:42.020
So from an entire company orientation standpoint, it makes a lot more sense, a lot more practical

01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:46.620
sense to put your resources behind the product that's going to go to all of your profit.

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:51.500
However, I think you could apply that same logic model and say that's why it's critical

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.220
that they make this machine their focus.

01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:57.060
They make it so important to get it right because they're coming into a new market hat

01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.760
in hand, humble, saying this is our entrance into the space.

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.060
We want this to be the developer edition.

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:06.460
People that are developing software for Linux, this is a machine for you.

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:09.540
And if you want to come into a new market and you want to bring a new group of people

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:12.740
into your product and you want to show them that when you launch a product for them, you

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:16.860
can do it right, it's absolutely important that you get all of the small details right.

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:21.300
And I hate doing this, but let's be honest, if Apple made this machine, they wouldn't

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:22.300
care about that.

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.740
They would say if we're going to build a machine for these people, then we have to build it

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:25.740
with all of these components.

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.500
Just like, and of course for us, it wouldn't match, it would have one port and it would

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:29.500
be horrible.

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:30.500
We wouldn't like it.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:31.500
That's how they get the MacBook One.

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:34.180
But they start at that spot and they say what does this group need?

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:35.180
What do these people need?

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:38.620
And they build the entire machine, even if it's going to be a tiny, tiny fraction of

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:41.780
their business because it's actually more important, right?

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:45.420
Because you're introducing yourself to a new set of people, a new set of potential buyers

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:48.780
and you're trying to carve out a new space in the marketplace that potentially in the

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:52.920
future as this market grows, they will come to you as one of the people that builds the

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.700
best product for that.

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:58.220
And I think if you don't come at that with that perspective, you will never break into

01:13:58.220 --> 01:13:59.220
that market.

01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:04.200
You always end up with what Dell has, a pretty solid attempt, but the end execution just

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.200
isn't right.

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:08.300
And then what unfortunately happens, even though they worked so hard and you know, there's

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:11.180
people in the Dell Linux team that they just work with the best that they've been given.

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:15.940
I've talked to them and they're good people, but the reality is the product ends up not

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:16.940
being good enough.

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:20.980
And over and over and over again, despite their hard efforts, Dell under delivers.

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:24.500
And then when they have to retract, they do it publicly in a way that is embarrassing

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:25.760
to Linux.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.660
And that's super unfortunate.

01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:30.580
So if you have three options, given the state that they're in right now, right?

01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:35.620
They've got one part of the company, the significant part that's making these, manufacturing these

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:40.520
laptops designed for Windows 8.1 or 10 or whatever the latest thing is.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:46.900
And a tiny, tiny Sputnik team who are doing their best to get Linux working on these machines

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:53.020
and shipping from a global company like Dell and trying to get all the divisions of Dell

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:56.220
around the world shipping those things because not every division sells it.

01:14:56.220 --> 01:15:03.500
You know, as you've seen, you can find it on dell.co.uk, but not on dell.com, for example.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:06.460
And they're doing their absolute best and they get to a situation where, where they

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:11.340
are now is a laptop that is not good enough to have the Dell brand name on it, right?

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:12.340
So what do you do?

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:16.300
Do you completely scrap that project and just forget it?

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:21.140
Or do you carry on shipping those devices knowing that they're crap and that they shouldn't

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:22.700
have the Dell name on them?

01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:28.420
Or do you stop shipping them, stop the line, fix it at the factory and make sure that every

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:31.460
machine that goes out from that point onwards is right?

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:33.580
And I think that is the right option.

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:37.060
Yes, they could have made different decisions in the past, but they are where they are and

01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:39.580
where they are right now, I think they've made the right decision.

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:40.580
And I agree with you.

01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:44.240
If that's what actually ends up happening, I guess what I'm afraid of is that they're

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.940
not going to keep shipping them, that they're just pulling the plug and that's a polite

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:50.140
way of them doing that.

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:52.540
And if that's not the, I hope to God, I'm wrong about that.

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:55.340
I think that part almost doesn't matter because it just feels like it's been fist-hammed so

01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:56.340
far.

01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:57.340
I don't know.

01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:00.980
Barton George is the head of the Sputnik team and he tweeted, it's on pause.

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:01.980
Yeah.

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:02.980
They say pause.

01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:03.980
They say pause.

01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:04.980
I believe it's a pause.

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:05.980
I believe it is.

01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:06.980
That's not what I have issue with.

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:10.580
I have issue with, the damage is done.

01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.580
That's what I have issue with.

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:12.580
I don't know.

01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:13.580
Here's the thing.

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:18.460
I think that exactly what Poppy just said, I mean given the environmental variables that

01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:21.300
they're put into, I think they did the best job possible.

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:25.720
I don't think it's cost-effective to build a 1200 – when you're a company that makes

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.540
all of your money off of selling Windows laptops, I don't know that it makes a business

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:29.540
…

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:31.100
How much money is selling Windows laptops?

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:32.100
Servers?

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.100
No.

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:34.100
Do you have another guess?

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:35.100
Sand storage?

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:36.100
It's not a piece of hardware.

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:37.100
Oh.

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:38.100
Dell doesn't … no.

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:40.060
Then I have no idea.

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:43.060
Now this was 2014 and this is 2015, I don't know if you knew that, so I don't know if

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:46.100
this is still true or not, but I'm actually looking at the financial analysis of Dell

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:51.100
and HP right now as we record this show and Dell makes primary the bulk of its income

01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:53.140
from financing.

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:54.140
I guess that's not surprising.

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:55.140
But financing what?

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:56.140
Computers?

01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:57.140
Yeah.

01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:58.140
And servers.

01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:59.140
But that's actually what they make their money from is off the interest rates that

01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:00.140
people are paying when they finance Dell computers.

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.140
Yeah.

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:02.140
But they have to buy those computers to begin with.

01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:03.140
So the argument is …

01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:05.700
It's just something to kind of think about when you think about it, like what they actually

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:06.700
make money from is being a bank.

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:07.700
It's kind of fun.

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:08.700
Yeah.

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:09.700
It's funny.

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:12.700
But they have to make computers compelling enough for people to want to finance them.

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:13.700
Yeah.

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:18.820
But given those variables, then I agree – I'm inclined to agree with Popey that the best

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:24.100
possible solution is to halt production, fix the problems, and then pick it back up.

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:26.980
That's the responsible thing to do.

01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:28.460
And giving the available options?

01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.460
Yes.

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:30.460
Right.

01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.580
And I think – and it's hard for me to kind of convey this perspective.

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:36.140
But the perspective that I'm worried about isn't what you think or I think or consumers

01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:37.140
think.

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:39.540
I'm thinking Lenovo and HP are watching this and they're thinking, boy, look at that

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:40.540
shit show.

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:41.540
I'm not going to do that.

01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:42.540
Yeah.

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:43.540
Maybe.

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:44.540
That's what I'm worried about.

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:45.540
Maybe.

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:49.300
But then you look at the way that Samsung has rolled out Chromebooks and really other

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.300
than the …

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:51.880
That just validates that statement.

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.420
In order for Linux to be successful, it has to be wrapped up in Chrome.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.420
It has to be Chrome OS.

01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:57.100
If you try to ship actual Linux, you get this.

01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:58.620
You get a product, you have to pull off the market.

01:17:58.620 --> 01:17:59.620
Yeah, but here's the thing.

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:02.900
Samsung – and maybe this is just because – you really don't think that Lenovo sees

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:03.900
that though?

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:07.460
I mean, Samsung built a computer specifically to run Chrome OS.

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:08.460
You know what I mean?

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:10.540
And so did Acer and so did HP and whoever else …

01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:13.260
I think they very closely watch their competitors and see how their different products do in

01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:14.260
the marketplace.

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:15.260
Yeah, but …

01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:20.260
Well, I think HP shipped Chrome first but they subsequently shipped them with Windows

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:22.300
like cut down Windows and Linux as well.

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:25.820
I guess my point was that I don't think that Lenovo is going to look over and say,

01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:26.820
oh, that laptop failed.

01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:28.940
I don't think that the people at Lenovo are that dumb.

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:29.940
They won't be able to figure it out.

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:30.940
Maybe.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:31.940
Oh, you know …

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:32.940
I don't.

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:35.540
I think they do watch their competitors and they see what products do really well and

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.500
then they execute based on what other markets are doing.

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:38.500
Oh, right.

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:40.900
So Lenovo probably won't take an existing Windows product and put Linux on it and try

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:41.900
and sell it.

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:42.900
Or maybe they'll spend a little more time on Q&A.

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:46.460
I mean, because really Dell could have avoided a lot of this with some proper QA.

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:47.460
I mean, not that they didn't.

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:48.460
I know they QA'd it.

01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:49.460
Yeah.

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:50.460
But they could have avoided a lot more.

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:51.460
Yeah, that's true.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:52.460
Harm.

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:55.740
I mean, they are potentially poisoning the well for their own future products too, a

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:56.740
little bit.

01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:57.740
Yeah.

01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:58.740
No, I think there's a market.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:01.780
But don't forget, this is just one of the Sputniks.

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:05.780
This is like, I don't know, the third or fourth generation of the Sputniks and this

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:09.780
is the only one that's had these kind of significant issues.

01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:10.780
Yeah, that's true.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:11.780
The first two.

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:13.980
There have been multiple Sputnik devices that have been shipped to many people.

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:16.220
I have no idea what the sales numbers are, but it's quite a lot of people.

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:18.260
I would love them to tell us.

01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:19.260
Yeah.

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:20.260
Yeah, I don't know.

01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:21.260
It's commercial data.

01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.260
I guess they probably won't.

01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.260
Yeah.

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:24.660
Yeah, they probably will never will.

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:25.660
But yeah.

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:26.660
So here's why.

01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:27.660
This is true.

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:28.660
I think this is, you know, you've got Chromebooks.

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:33.300
Now, I'm surprised we haven't really seen this, but this is an Android PC that is actually

01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:34.780
doing pretty well on Kickstarter.

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:36.900
It's got 8,161 backers.

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:38.260
It's tiny.

01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:41.340
It's got, it's made $533,000 in 39 days.

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:42.340
I'm just going to play a little bit of it.

01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:44.960
We'll just play a little bit of it, just because it's sort of a good capper to this

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:48.100
conversation where we keep going back between Chrome OS and getting Linux right.

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:51.580
The way we think reflects the world we live in.

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:54.960
Ideologies change with the times.

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:59.580
In the past few decades, a thought evolution has happened.

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:06.820
We've gone from expecting excessively more to embracing sustainably less.

01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:11.980
At Jai Technology, we're innovating the next evolutionary leap in personal computing that

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:21.020
embodies less can be more.

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:29.220
Less cost, more value, less design, more functionality, less wasteful, more sustainable, less waiting,

01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:39.180
more doing, less power, more performance, less Windows, more apps.

01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:44.900
Introducing the Remix Mini.

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:48.660
The world's first true Android PC.

01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:55.180
Finally, less can be more.

01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:56.180
Starting at $20.

01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:59.020
I fundamentally disagree with everything that video just said.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.340
Also, could it get any more pretentious?

01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:02.340
I know, right?

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:04.940
Like, okay, so let's start with this.

01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:11.220
I cannot believe that somebody would make a video to talk about how you should expect

01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:12.220
your computer to do less.

01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:13.220
Oh yeah, you can.

01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:14.220
No, okay.

01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:15.220
That's where I'm starting there.

01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:16.220
Okay, all right.

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:17.220
All right, go ahead.

01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.220
Keep going.

01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:19.220
You know what?

01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:22.860
For any of the advantages that that stupid piece of junk offers, my Linux box has done

01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:25.540
for the last 20 years.

01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:26.900
So why do I care again?

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:30.220
So because finally, less is more.

01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:31.860
It's what they're selling is the subtext.

01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:33.580
The subtext is it's simplified.

01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:34.580
It's easier.

01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:38.140
Because if you tell an end user, look at computers, it's complicated.

01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:39.140
Too much going on.

01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:40.140
There's too much.

01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:42.740
Like, remember I was telling you about that user who's like, why do I keep getting notifications

01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:43.740
about updates?

01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:44.740
I don't care about updates.

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:45.740
These apps I never use.

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:46.740
Why do I keep getting them?

01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.120
To them, it's too much.

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:52.060
So if you tell them it's simple and you can do more with less, the subtext is this is

01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:54.500
a computer that's just going to do the bare what you need it to do.

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:55.500
That's the subtext.

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:56.500
Here's what I hear.

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:59.980
What I hear is here's a computer that you can spend less money on and it'll do less

01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:06.900
because the application environment is just so spread up and we can't decide if we want

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:07.900
to write for Windows.

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:08.900
But everybody knows Android.

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:09.900
Who knows what Windows is happening?

01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:10.900
No, dude.

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:11.900
Android has apps, man.

01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:12.900
You can get apps now.

01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:13.900
Yeah, Android has apps.

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:17.700
Some of them are crappy apps and even the ones that people use in business are so bad

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:20.300
and we just shoehorn them into fits.

01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:24.260
I watched a guy, Chris, I watched a guy, this is like three weeks ago, and he's going to

01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:25.260
do his go-to meeting.

01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:30.460
Okay, so he has a stupid Android tablet and he sets it up and the thing falls over.

01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:31.460
Of course.

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:33.980
Okay, so then he picks it back up and sets and then he's trying to edit.

01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:34.980
He's tapping it.

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:35.980
He's tapping it.

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:36.980
Knocking it over.

01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:37.980
They're going to edit this Excel sheet, right?

01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:42.460
So he's trying to maximize the thing and he's in the middle of explaining this.

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:43.460
He's in there painting and zooming while he's talking.

01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:44.460
Yes, yes.

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:48.740
He's giving this business presentation on selling a $500,000 hotel and I'm like, you've

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:49.740
got to be kidding me.

01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:50.740
You look like a dog.

01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:51.740
Get a desktop.

01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:52.740
A laptop.

01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:53.740
Get a laptop.

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:54.740
Like, why are you doing this on your tablet?

01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:58.580
And then he gets done and this is what he says to me, he goes, man, isn't technology

01:22:58.580 --> 01:22:59.580
amazing?

01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:00.580
I can do all that from my tablet.

01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:02.140
And I'm like, you're kidding me right now.

01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:03.140
That was horrible.

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:04.140
That was horrible.

01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:05.140
That was a mess.

01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:06.340
That was a disaster.

01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:08.380
How can you say, I can't believe we can do that right now?

01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.900
I needed to brag about it afterwards.

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:10.900
That's classic.

01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:12.220
That's what this commercial embodies to me.

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:16.020
Is this idea that we're okay just not caring about our computers.

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:19.900
You know what I was thinking about the other day on the flight over here?

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:23.100
The way that ham radio works, in order to actually use the ham radio, you can go buy

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:24.100
one.

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:25.820
You have to get licensed before you can do that, right?

01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:30.340
Now imagine this, what would happen if we required a license before you could purchase

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.340
a personal computer?

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:35.240
You had to understand the basics of memory management, of hard drives, of how the file

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.240
system works.

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:37.240
Nobody would use them, dude.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:40.220
You'd have as many, just like you'd have as many computers as you have hams.

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:41.220
That's right.

01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:46.540
You'd have two people that used it, but the people that used it wouldn't be so stupid.

01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:50.460
You would have people, users would understand the technology they're working with.

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:52.380
I'm not actually advocating for that.

01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:57.900
It's kind of an interesting thing to think about, but the reality is that this just embodies

01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:59.420
how silly users have become.

01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:02.780
Well, Daredevil, don't you think it's a matter of just the systems are honestly too complex

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:04.780
for the jobs they want to get done?

01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:05.780
No.

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:09.260
Look, Android, people have the perspective that it just works.

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:10.260
Yeah, it's easy.

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:11.260
They get their phone, that it works.

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.260
Sure, it's easy.

01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:17.340
But it's not just the easy part, it's the not set up part.

01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:23.260
It's no virus issues, it's the update, it's the one button press, when it happens, it's

01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:26.020
like you're talking an app, it's an app store.

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:28.020
Yeah, all your apps are updated.

01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:29.820
It's a much easier paradigm for users.

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.460
That has been sitting in my pocket.

01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:32.460
It's burning up.

01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:33.500
Why is that so hot?

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:34.500
Your phone's on fire, dude.

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:35.500
My phone's on fire.

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.100
So what do you mean it just works?

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:38.620
I pulled it right out of my pocket.

01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:41.140
I have not touched that phone in the last 40 minutes.

01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:42.900
And now you just charge it and your battery's down to 30%.

01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:43.900
That's right.

01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:47.780
30%, down from 100 when we started the show, not 60.

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:50.380
What the heck is this thing doing?

01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:53.020
So don't tell me Android just works.

01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:54.020
Come on.

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:57.940
I mean, you're forgetting all the sensors and all the NSA probing the data.

01:24:57.940 --> 01:24:58.940
Right, right.

01:24:58.940 --> 01:24:59.940
Come on.

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:00.940
You have to discount that information.

01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:03.060
What I love about it, and I don't know if it has to be a simple computer, I love the

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:07.300
idea of a cheap computer that's functional, that gets people online, because that opens

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:11.260
the door up to a whole lot of people, opens up to kids, schools, libraries, third world.

01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:12.260
How much is that thing?

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:13.260
What?

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:16.820
Well, they say they'll eventually be able to sell it for $20.

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:21.220
So assuming that's right, how is that more advantageous than the Raspberry Pi?

01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:22.220
Because it's all set up.

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:23.220
Yeah, that's true.

01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:24.220
That's true.

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:25.220
You get it out of a box.

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:26.220
I don't know.

01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:27.220
This isn't the solution.

01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:29.020
I think what we're seeing here is there's something here.

01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.020
This isn't it.

01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:31.460
Raspberry Pi isn't it because it's too manual.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.920
But there's something in this area that I think some... And in order to get the price

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:38.780
down here, it's going to have to be Linux based, I think, for the world's first true

01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:39.780
Android PC.

01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:41.340
I don't actually think that's true either.

01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:45.980
Yeah, Nate points out you can make it a $20 Plex client.

01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:49.020
So I tried using both Raspberry Pis.

01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:54.020
I've tried using Chromeboxes and flashing different... Yeah, and so here's what I found.

01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:58.460
Eventually what I found was the drawbacks to doing that, it just makes more sense to

01:25:58.460 --> 01:25:59.940
buy the Celeron Note for $140.

01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:03.300
And I'll tell you what, this is not, like Popeys pointed out to him, this is not the

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:06.300
first Android PC and I think the reason is they're not taking off.

01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:08.900
I joke about me predicting this because I actually thought somebody would get it.

01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:09.980
I thought somebody could nail it.

01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:13.020
It seemed like you have a great base OS, you've got some great apps, you just tweak it a little

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:18.620
bit, everybody likes to put a custom UI on there.

01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:22.500
Here's the other part of that too is that if I take a small ARM computer that's going

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:24.780
to run Android, why would I bother putting that into a tower?

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:26.060
I'll just build that into an all-in-one.

01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:28.100
And there are Android all-in-ones.

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:33.340
And really if you think about it, the desktop, the mobile operating system that just basically

01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:37.580
gets you online that is built into a desktop or a tower, that is Chrome OS.

01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:39.620
I mean that is the market that Chrome OS is, right?

01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:40.620
And it's got the brand.

01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:41.620
Yeah.

01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:42.620
Yep.

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:43.620
There you go.

01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:45.420
And of course that does, I think that means there may be room for conversions one day

01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:46.420
though.

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:47.420
Could be.

01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:50.100
I think if you don't want something like this but you want also something mobile, I don't

01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:51.100
know, what you say?

01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:53.100
We'll save that debate for a future episode.

01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:55.620
You can make that prediction, maybe in three years that won't come true.

01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:56.620
Yeah.

01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:57.620
Thanks man, thanks.

01:26:57.620 --> 01:26:58.620
All right.

01:26:58.620 --> 01:26:59.620
So that's going to wrap it up.

01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:00.620
We are going to be at OSCON.

01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:02.580
If you're listening to this and you're going to be in the Portland area, meetup.com slash

01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:03.900

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:08.620
For more information, we're going to be there Wednesday, July 22nd hanging out and we'd

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.360
love to see you guys there.

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.380

01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:25.300
We usually do the show on Tuesdays, but this week, this week to make room for OSCON we

01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:27.700
recorded on a Monday right after Coda Radio.

01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:29.420
It was a back-to-back edition.

01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:32.420
So I'm really thankful that you guys in the Bumble Room were able to show up on the Monday.

01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:33.620
I really appreciate it.

01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:34.620
Good turnout.

01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:35.620
Noah, thanks for coming in studio.

01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:36.620
Hey, anytime.

01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:40.580
And you know, have a great time at OSCON.

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:41.580
Maybe I'll see you there.

01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:42.580
Yeah, maybe.

01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:43.580
Maybe we'll bump into each other.

01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:44.580
All right.

01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:45.580
Cool.

01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:46.580
Also, you can follow Noah.

01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:47.580
He's on Twitter.

01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:48.580
Noah, give him your Twitter handle.

01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:49.580
My Twitter handle is at Colonel Linux.

01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:50.580
Yep, yep.

01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:51.580
This guy over here is at ChrisAlias.

01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:52.580
That's that.

01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:53.580
You know what?

01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:54.580
You changed it.

01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:55.580
All right.

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:56.580
Let's see what you're up to now.

01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:57.580
It's like not that much.

01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:58.580
It makes me feel bad.

01:27:58.580 --> 01:27:59.580
Okay.

01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:00.580
I don't know.

01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:01.580
It's like a thousand.

01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:02.580
All right, everybody.

01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:03.580
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode.

01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:25.580
I hope you have a great day, and I'll see you next week.

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:26.580
All right, did you look?

01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:27.580
What is it?

01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:28.580
Is it a thousand?

01:28:28.580 --> 01:28:29.580
Twelve hundred.

01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:30.580
Twelve hundred?

01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:31.580
All right.

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:32.580
Not bad.

01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:38.260
I think so, especially because I've had the same Twitter account for seven years, and

01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:39.260
I'm up to 835.

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:40.260
All right.

01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:41.260
JBtitles.com.

01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:45.260
Let's pick our title for this week's episode of the Unplugged Show.

01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:47.820
I was watching those little airport, you know, they have the little videos that play over

01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:50.580
and over again that want to make you kill yourself because you hear them so much.

01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:52.980
There's one about Twitter, and it was saying the way to get more Twitter followers is to

01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:53.980
tweet, and I'm like, wow.

01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:54.980
What a revolutionary concept.

01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:55.980
I never thought of that.

01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:59.580
Actually, it is true, and reply, and it really does, because I don't tweet very much.

01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:00.580
I just do not.

01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:03.580
Like, when I have a free moment, my first thought is, ooh, let's update Twitter.

01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:05.780
Yeah, actually, so here's been my thought on Twitter.

01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:08.780
Twitter's concept has always been, what are you doing right now?

01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:09.780
Here's my answer.

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:10.780
I don't care.

01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:14.060
I mean, most people, let's face it, I don't care what you're doing right now.

01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:19.540
All right, JBtitles.com, a lot to pick from, a lot to pick from, GPU hacks, the canonical

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:26.660
Dell and AMD games, that's not bad, GPL gets trumped, that's not, CDL gets trumped, Noah's

01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:34.300
Home Ting Shop, Doo-Wop, Doo-Wop, Doo-Wop, JBtitles.com, JBtitles.com.

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.820
Any post-show topics for the Mumble Room you guys want to talk about before we get out

01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:37.820
of here for the day?

01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:42.500
We didn't have a mumble unplugged, but what happened to a tight show?

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:51.500
Not sure if you guys saw the biofuel, new thing that they discovered, like they can

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:55.860
use some energy from your sweat and also from your organ.

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.420
Well, I could power the shit out of some stuff in the studio right now.

01:29:58.420 --> 01:29:59.420
It is hot in here.

01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:00.420
It's getting warm, right?

01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:03.100
Hey, maybe you could power an air conditioner with your sweat.

01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:04.100
That'd be amazing.

01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:05.100
Oh, man.

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:11.540
Well, you could at least charge your watch that is always discharging.

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:12.540
Yeah.

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:13.540
So what do you guys think?

01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:16.300
Do you think we'll have sweat-powered watches one day?

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:17.300
No?

01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.300
Okay.

01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:21.020
I think you're going to have, I think there's a lot more longevity in either.

01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:23.020
I think there's more longevity.

01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:24.020
Good.

01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:33.100
I think there's going to be a lot more, I think there's going to be a lot more longevity

01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:39.460
in either solar-powered watches or, I forget the name, but the thing that, yeah, right.

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:40.460
There's a name for that though.

01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:41.460
Yeah.

01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:42.460
Kinetic.

01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:43.460
Yeah.

01:30:43.460 --> 01:30:44.460
Yeah.

01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:45.460
What do you guys think?

01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:46.460
Canonical Dell and AMD games.

01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:47.460
You like that title?

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:48.460
Love it.

01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:49.460
It's not too bad, really.

01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:50.460
The best one ever.

01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:51.460
Yeah.

01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:52.460
Sure.

01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:57.420
On the whole Dell XPS thing though, I got the 2015 developer edition and one of the

01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:02.300
things I want to highlight is currently in the Linux world, there aren't too many laptops,

01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:03.300
high-end laptops.

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:07.820
Well, not even that, it's the appliance, it's the laptop that just works.

01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:13.220
Oh, you just mean like, yeah, like I was able to get a tiny laptop with an i7 processor,

01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:16.820
an SSD drive, an Intel Iris graphics and a 4K screen.

01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:19.860
Like there's not a lot of Linux laptops that check all those boxes.

01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:24.620
Yeah, and that have the support from someone like Canonical and Dell behind it that are

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:25.620
managing the update process.

01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:26.620
Hey, man.

01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:27.620
And you just use it.

01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:28.620
Hey, man.

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:29.620
That's why I bought it.

01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:30.620
Dude, that was like right up.

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:31.620
Yeah.

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:36.540
And so that's why, but I don't, I run Arch, probably not too surprising.

01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:40.180
And I literally don't have any of the problems that they were talking about in that article.

01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:45.380
I ran Arch online for a period of time and I switched back to Ubuntu.

01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:50.460
Now I had to do that too until a kernel update and I got the latest version of the BIOS.

01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:52.860
And then after that, I went back to Arch and I've had no problems.

01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:53.860
Oh, that's right.

01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:54.860
Yeah.

01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:55.860
Yeah.

01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:56.860
It worked a lot better for me.

01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:57.860
That was, yeah.

01:31:57.860 --> 01:31:58.860
Hey, Chris.

01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:00.620
When do you arrive at OSCON?

01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:02.180
We'll be down there Wednesday morning.

01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:04.180
We're going to be in the area Tuesday evening.

01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:07.180
Are you going to be doing any interviews or anything?

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:08.180
Oh yes.

01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:09.180
Oh yes.

01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:10.180
You have somebody we should talk to?

01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:11.180
Yes.

01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:12.180
Oh, tell us.

01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:13.180
Yeah.

01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:19.180
Hey, can you, you have me on Telegram, right?

01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.180
Unfortunately you do.

01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:21.180
Yes.

01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:22.180
Well, you loser.

01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:23.180
When do you have a chance?

01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:28.820
If you could send me the contact info, I actually, we have a, I have a, I have a tentative schedule.

01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:32.740
I think we're going to be doing the interviews on Wednesday and I have a tentative schedule

01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:35.220
of people that have asked to speak with us and tentative times.

01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:36.620
If you could get me his contact information.

01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:37.620
Totally Adam.

01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:38.620
That'd be great.

01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:39.620
Yeah.

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:40.620
Yeah, sure.

01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:41.620
Thank you.

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:42.620
We'll set something up and we'll make it happen.

01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:43.620
Okay.
