1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
All right, well this has forced my hand.

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,180
I have no option at this point.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,640
I'm going with the emergency pre-show topic.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,160
Initiating emergency pre-show topic sequence.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,340
Ladies and gentlemen, Microsoft is delighted to announce

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,660
Windows Server 2019 is going into full preview mode

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,580
and one of its headlining features is more Linux.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,500
What?

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,600
Yeah, the improved and ready to go Windows subsystem

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,500
for Linux will be moved up to the server series

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,280
and they're introducing a new type of virtual machine

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,680
designed specifically to run Linux instances.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,920
They'll also be shipping it with OpenSSH, Curl, TAR

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,140
and other common Unix and Linux commands

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,800
all pre-built into the shiny new Windows Server 2019.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,640
Wow.

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,240
There you go, Wes.

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,520
I don't know how I feel about that.

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,920
So how long do you have to wait

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,940
before you can spin one of these bad boys up, Chris?

21
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,600
We'll just go grab the latest Ubuntu ISO

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,720
and get started now, Wes.

23
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,560
Oh!

24
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,520
Hmm, this is Linux Unplugged, episode 241.

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged,

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,340
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly Linux talk show

27
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,720
that's now recording in four individual stereo tracks.

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,560
My name is Chris.

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,380
My name is Wes.

30
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,580
Hello, Wes.

31
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,640
Boy, do we have a heck of a show coming up today.

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,640
So not only do I have a couple of select moments from scale,

33
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,180
I went down and got 170 individual clips

34
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,880
and I'm playing one interview.

35
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,400
That is choice.

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,760
Hand-selected, hand-crafted,

37
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,600
my favorite moment from my trip to scale,

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,840
it's my first episode back.

39
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,440
But before we get there,

40
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,520
we have a huge batch of community news,

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,020
open source projects that are coming back,

42
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,880
big desktop releases,

43
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,680
some plumbing that's getting some major updates

44
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,440
and a cool trick to make Firefox, Firefox?

45
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,280
Firefox!

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,100
Do you have Firefox?

47
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,940
Yeah, I sure do.

48
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,780
It's all my facts.

49
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,960
I'm checking the service that checks Firefox facts.

50
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,840
I don't, everything is ruined.

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,680
I don't know.

52
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,560
Actually, no, it's a trick to get more performance

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,760
out of Firefox.

54
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,600
That's all.

55
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,420
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,260
It's nothing more than that.

57
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,440
Also, a pretty well-known company

58
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,560
is open sourcing all of the things.

59
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,000
They just announced it today and they're rolling it out.

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,080
A handy firewall utility for the Linux desktop,

61
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,000
a better way to stream Spotify on Linux,

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,520
and then we'll wrap it all up

63
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,200
with a couple of choice choice app picks.

64
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,040
That's solid, right?

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,880
Wow, I'm excited.

66
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,700
That's a lot of show.

67
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,540
Stop wasting our time.

68
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,800
Let's get to it, Chris, but there's a couple of things.

69
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,640
You're right.

70
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,720
First of all, we gotta say

71
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,440
time-appropriate greetings to that mumble room.

72
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,920
Hello, mumble!

73
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,760
What's up?

74
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,600
Hello.

75
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,420
Good afternoon.

76
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,880
Hello, it's good to be with you guys.

77
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,320
I missed you last week,

78
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,160
so thank you for hanging out with Noah and Wes

79
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,980
while they did the show

80
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,480
and thank you to Noah for hosting.

81
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,320
No kidding.

82
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,660
Of course, Ask Noah is coming up in just a little bit.

83
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,600
But did you see this story

84
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,460
that we're gonna start with this week?

85
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,300
I mean, it just had to start with this story.

86
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,360
LG has announced that they're re-open sourcing webOS.

87
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,880
Let's go back in time a little bit.

88
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,920
You remember this HP acquired Palm in 2010,

89
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,480
and then there was this whole webOS

90
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,760
on the touchpad thing that was short-lived,

91
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,320
and then around 2012 is when HP announced

92
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,760
that they would publish the webOS source code

93
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,120
as open webOS.

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,240
webOS was then acquired a little bit later on

95
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,840
by LG Electronics,

96
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,100
where they've actually been using it

97
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,400
for at least a few years now

98
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,680
on smartphone TVs, IoT devices,

99
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,240
and other LG devices.

100
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,040
I actually saw it, I think, on like a CES fridge.

101
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,720
And LG has announced that they're gonna work

102
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,560
in cooperation with South Korean's government agency

103
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,880
that's involved with technology

104
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,480
to make webOS a sustainable open platform

105
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,080
that is available for an open connectivity architecture.

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,320
They're looking to commercialize it as an open source

107
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,160
platform.

108
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,480
This is part of LG's announcement this morning.

109
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,080
And it's up, it's up on GitHub,

110
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,080
and I think it's sort of a semi-quasi-Android competitor.

111
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,880
It's part of this play to just have a company

112
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,920
offering a solution that isn't US-based,

113
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,080
that isn't Google.

114
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,320
Right, that seems like the main thing.

115
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,520
Otherwise, it's all still very veiled and enterprise-y.

116
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,380
It doesn't seem really like,

117
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,120
it's good that they're open sourced,

118
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,600
that part is great, but it doesn't feel like

119
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,640
it's really, you know, there's not a great README,

120
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,320
there's a whole bunch of components.

121
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,680
Really, it's not something we would use,

122
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,360
but maybe you're right, like there'll be some vendors

123
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,940
that think, okay.

124
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,360
Yeah, it just won't die.

125
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,320
It just won't go, and great, you know what?

126
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,080
God bless it, I think that's wonderful.

127
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,920
Good on them.

128
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,740
Can't kill Linux.

129
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,840
Just keep going.

130
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,200
And you know, we all have said,

131
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,080
I mean, it's cliche to say,

132
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,560
ah, webOS is one of the good ones.

133
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,760
But it's, maybe this bears that out,

134
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,960
because it just simply won't go away.

135
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,680
And I tried to get one of those touchpads.

136
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,040
I tried to do this whole thing.

137
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,480
It was a total waste of money.

138
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,640
But I have heard that their implementation on LG TVs

139
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
is one of the better smart TV OSes out there.

140
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,080
It is interesting going and looking through here,

141
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,640
like PulseAudio integrations,

142
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,440
Wayland extensions for webOS.

143
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,080
Yeah, yeah, isn't that something?

144
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,940
WebOS won't die, Wes.

145
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,760
It just won't die.

146
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,160
GNOME 3.28, also another big news item this week,

147
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,720
incorporating 25,000 changes.

148
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,200
Don't know how many of those are translations,

149
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,400
but a lot of changes.

150
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,280
And 838 contributions, or individual contributors,

151
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,720
make up the 3.28 release.

152
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,560
And it's got a couple of features that I'm a huge fan of.

153
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,440
First feature, it seems simple,

154
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,280
but if you think about it,

155
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,740
it's actually gonna make working day-to-day really fast.

156
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,960
The version of files in GNOME 3.28

157
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,400
now has a starred feature, where you can star files.

158
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,720
And then on the left-hand places area, you go to starred,

159
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,160
and it's just the files that you've starred.

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,280
This is great, because they've taken away desktop icons,

161
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,040
so it sort of comes at just the right time,

162
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,680
where you still have a kind of a workflow

163
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,120
for quick access to files,

164
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,080
and then when you're done with them,

165
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,200
you just pop that star off.

166
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,260
But that's not the big feature.

167
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,780
The one that I really like to see,

168
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,960
and I can't wait to see where they're gonna go next,

169
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,560
is Boxes, the VM front-end

170
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,800
that is one of my favorites on Linux,

171
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,440
now has the ability, using the new Box Assistant,

172
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,720
to download ISOs that you want right off the web.

173
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,960
So you wanna try out Tumbleweed to try out GNOME 3.28,

174
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,120
you just click the thing, it'll pull it down right there.

175
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,320
Wow, that's slick.

176
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, Debian testing's in there,

177
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,400
NetBSD's in there, it's awesome.

178
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,360
Kind of makes it, changes the feel of it

179
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,400
from somewhat of a, not quite power tool,

180
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,080
but helper tool when you already understand

181
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,220
how the virtualization works

182
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,080
to something a little more user-friendly.

183
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,240
Totally, totally.

184
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,400
So that's the new Boxes feature,

185
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,800
and the Photos app has gotten some updates.

186
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,080
So new version of GNOME, I'm not running it,

187
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,000
I did try it for a bit.

188
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,200
You are, what are you running,

189
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,080
some sort of quasi-hybrid Plasma GNOME setup over there?

190
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,480
I do have both on here, yes I do.

191
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,440
Which one are you in right now?

192
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,000
Right now it's GNOME, I needed to test out on this side,

193
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
but normally it's been Plasma for the past couple weeks.

194
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,960
The reason why I even knew that

195
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,080
is because your machine's been running crazy hot all day

196
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,920
as the Evolution Data Server's been losing its crap, so.

197
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes it has.

198
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,840
Woo!

199
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,760
Yeah, yeah, there's only a really, at this point in time,

200
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,560
that we're recording a couple of choice ways

201
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,840
to get GNOME 3.2.8.

202
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,240
Anybody in the Mumble Room by any chance

203
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,680
actually on the new version of GNOME, GNOME 3.2.8?

204
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,040
Like a Tumbleweed user in there by chance?

205
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,640
I didn't think so.

206
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,880
I bet you if Gabriel was in there, he'd say yes.

207
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,400
But I've been pretty happy with Plasma,

208
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,480
just got a whole batch of updates installed today.

209
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,600
So the Plasma adventure for me continues on

210
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,220
and I'm pretty happy with it.

211
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,400
Levi too, Levi the dog is pretty happy with it.

212
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,200
There's also a feature in GNOME 3.2.8 that Levi really likes.

213
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,880
It's support for Thunderbolt 3 security models.

214
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,760
And this is the accumulation of work

215
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,980
that's been done by Red Hat now for quite a while.

216
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,700
I first saw Joey over at OMG Ubuntu report about it

217
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,120
on December 14th, 2017.

218
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,880
And it was a project called Bolt.

219
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,780
And what it does is it adds some security protections

220
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,840
around Thunderbolt devices.

221
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,040
So unlike USB, Thunderbolt 3 allows a wide access

222
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,160
to devices on your memory bus, on your PCI bus,

223
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,760
just like Firewire did.

224
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,480
So it's speculated that you could hook up

225
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,920
a malicious Thunderbolt device.

226
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,160
It actually, I don't know if it's been proven

227
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,200
with Thunderbolt.

228
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,240
I know it has with Firewire.

229
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,400
But in theory, because it's the same essential technologies

230
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,600
the way it's on the PCI bus, you, as you know,

231
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,920
probably could hook up a device to Thunderbolt

232
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,760
and you could read what's on the PCI bus lane,

233
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,700
the PCI lanes, which is contents of memory,

234
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,440
the things that are being sent to the CPU.

235
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,800
It's like you're an IO port right on the PCI bus.

236
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,960
And so to mitigate against malicious uses of this,

237
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,480
there are Thunderbolt 3 security levels,

238
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,360
which has been supported at the kernel level

239
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,200
for quite a while.

240
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,180
But as you're probably guessing right now,

241
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,440
hasn't been implemented in user space.

242
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,480
This is where Red Hat's project Bolt stepped up.

243
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Their developers were working on this project Bolt

244
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,980
to clearly handle Thunderbolt security levels

245
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,880
at the Linux desktop while keeping it user-friendly.

246
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,920
So what they've essentially done here

247
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,840
is they've provided a D-Bus API to list

248
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,400
all of the Thunderbolt devices, enroll them,

249
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,140
which means authorize and then store

250
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,160
which ones have been authorized in a local database,

251
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,000
and then forget them when they've been removed,

252
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,440
so that way there's not like an error message all the time,

253
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,400
and emit an alert to the user if a new device

254
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,960
has been connected or when that device

255
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,920
has been removed as well.

256
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,760
And during the enrollment, devices can be set

257
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,720
to automatically be authorized as soon as they're connected.

258
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,500
And so there needed to be a way to communicate this

259
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,800
that was at least somewhat agnostic, so they used D-Bus.

260
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,960
And now with GNOME 3.2.8, they've built in the front end

261
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,820
to display all this information to the end user.

262
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,880
So in GNOME 3.2.8, you'll click down on your status menu

263
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,200
and you'll actually see a Bolt message.

264
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,920
It'll say something like scanning peripheral,

265
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,880
and you'll see peripheral secure.

266
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,240
You'll see messages now in the status menu

267
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,920
when you hook up Thunderbolt 3 devices,

268
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,480
and that's because of this work to create this D-Bus API.

269
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,960
And this is more and more important now,

270
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,860
the devices like laptops have these USB-C ports,

271
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,340
which are also Thunderbolt devices,

272
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,740
so it's a little gray now to the end user

273
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,000
what they're actually plugging in.

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,780
Yeah, this seems like a surprising case

275
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,280
where a Linux desktop is actually

276
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,600
kind of ahead of the curve.

277
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,480
These devices are only now sort of picking up steam,

278
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,280
so it's great that we'll have this at least in one desktop

279
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,180
integrated right away.

280
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,760
Yep, yep, yep, I agree.

281
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,160
And that means it's gonna land in the next version

282
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,320
of Fedora, and it's already in Tumbleweed,

283
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,420
and it means it's gonna be in Ubuntu 18.04.

284
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,260
Wow.

285
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,600
So that takes care of a large,

286
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,560
low-hanging amount of GNOME fruit.

287
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,160
So pretty happy to see that.

288
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,960
And it's an example of kind of a behind-the-scenes project

289
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,880
that Red Hat sort of is famously known

290
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,180
for working on on the desktop,

291
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,560
even though they don't make a ton of money on the desktop.

292
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,600
You know what I mean?

293
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,680
This Bolt stuff and baking into GNOME

294
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,080
is specifically to benefit the desktop.

295
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,480
Right, I wonder, I mean, is that just enough?

296
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,280
There's enough people at Red Hat

297
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,560
who use GNOME on the desktop?

298
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,260
And I mean, if you're using USB

299
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,920
or Thunderbolt 3 peripherals on your work laptop,

300
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,360
you probably want them to be secure.

301
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,880
Or it's possible that multibillion-dollar corporations

302
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,000
play super long games,

303
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,640
and maybe they are seeding a garden

304
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,840
that they hope in another five years or so

305
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,980
is gonna bear a kind of fruit

306
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,080
that they can package up and start selling.

307
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,160
I like that idea. Possibly, who knows?

308
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,440
I mean, you just look at some of the stuff like Bolt,

309
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,040
which is a significant development,

310
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,000
and PipeWire, which you guys talked about again last week,

311
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,820
which is a significant amount of development,

312
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,400
and again, specifically for the desktop.

313
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,260
Perhaps all these people at Red Hat,

314
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,160
and maybe this is the case, actually,

315
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,560
perhaps they're all doing it on their free time.

316
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,040
Perhaps it's not Red Hat-financed.

317
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,960
I don't know, maybe somebody involved could let me know.

318
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,440
But it leaves us on the outside scratching our heads,

319
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,040
going, well, why is this company

320
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,480
that doesn't generate revenue from the desktop

321
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,920
expending quite a bit of development time?

322
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,640
Right, I mean, obviously we're happy

323
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,480
about a lot of these things,

324
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,600
but it does make you wonder, how sustainable is it?

325
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,320
Will it keep happening? I hope so.

326
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,740
It must be sustainable because they're doing more of it.

327
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,420
It feels like it's not declining, it's increasing.

328
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,760
So I would really like, where is it all going?

329
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,860
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

330
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,280
Geek Dad signing off right there in the chat room.

331
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,400
So we're back on the IRC for this show.

332
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,240
Yes, we are.

333
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,040
And I met Geek Dad, I hope he doesn't mind

334
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,120
me sharing his story a little bit,

335
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,460
but he gets to come to scale, he's a full-time dad,

336
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,040
and he's one of those dads that works really hard at it,

337
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,240
and he gets to come out to go to scale once a year,

338
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,200
and he's been going for quite a while.

339
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,660
And he was pretty fired up, he tracked me on the way down.

340
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,640
We were gonna try to meet up,

341
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,840
but I was driving like a maniac, so it didn't work out.

342
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,600
But when we got to scale, he created the Telegram group,

343
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,960
got everybody organized, he went over

344
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,240
and made the reservations at the Brazilian Meat restaurant

345
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,480
for our nice evening meetup.

346
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,320
I mean, just a super great guy.

347
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,720
And so, yeah, that's Geek Dad going on there.

348
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,920
He's gotta go pick up the kiddos.

349
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,600
So if you wanna join us live, we do this show on Tuesdays,

350
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,160
go to jblive.tv on a Tuesday, and you can get

351
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,240
the specific time at jupitabroadcasting.com

352
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,000
slash calendar, whoop, whoop.

353
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
I got my squeaky.

354
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,840
We gotta name the chair.

355
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,000
Chat room, name, bank suggest titles,

356
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,600
because I don't think you've given us a single title yet,

357
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,660
and name my chair.

358
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,000
What do we call it, the squeaky chair?

359
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,400
Yeah, this is where you really make the difference

360
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,240
in the show.

361
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,060
Because it really does, you know,

362
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,420
it makes a guest appearance in all the shows.

363
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,520
It's the third host, it is the third host.

364
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,960
And it's the best of them all, too.

365
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,520
I know, and it knows it.

366
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,360
So eloquent.

367
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,320
It knows it, too.

368
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,520
It makes us do things, but we'll leave it at that.

369
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,940
Let's take a moment and thank Ting

370
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,760
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

371
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,600
Go to linux.ting.com, that's what my chair did,

372
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,720
and that's how my chair pays just what it uses

373
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,560
for mobile.

374
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,280
It's $6 a month for your individual line,

375
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,040
and then your usage on top of that.

376
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,760
So for example, if you're on Telegram

377
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,360
or another messaging platform,

378
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,080
you may not ever use or hardly use any text messages.

379
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,920
I think legitimately now.

380
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,920
The last text message I used was when Twitter

381
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,000
wanted to give me one of their crappy two-factors

382
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,080
and made me sign in and they sent me a text message first.

383
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,060
One text message last month.

384
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,880
Totally not worth paying for hundreds of text messages.

385
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,680
I didn't make a phone call last month.

386
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,120
I mean, I did make a couple of FaceTime calls,

387
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,040
and I did use Telegram and Slack calling,

388
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,000
but that's what I love about Ting,

389
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,700
is that's how I prefer to communicate,

390
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,560
so I pay for that stuff.

391
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,400
Now why?

392
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,520
That's how I can have three phones and pay 40 bucks a month.

393
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,680
It's $6 for the line, and then you just pay

394
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,600
for what you use, however many minutes,

395
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,120
messages, and megabytes.

396
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,760
Nationwide coverage, no contracts, Ting's got you covered.

397
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,680
They have CDMA and GSM, and if you wanna just pick up

398
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,560
a Ting SIM, it's $9.

399
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,280
If you go to linux.ting.com, they'll take $25 off a device,

400
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,480
and if you have a CDMA device or a GSM device

401
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,760
that is compatible, just check their BYOD page,

402
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,280
they'll give you $25 in service credit.

403
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,240
It's so nice, it's so nice.

404
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,360
My favorite combo when I'm running Android

405
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,720
is a Nexus or Pixel phone on the Ting network.

406
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,920
It's this completely clean, nobody in between me

407
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,960
and my phone, I get stock updates from Android,

408
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,580
Ting has zero incentive to get involved

409
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,400
in reflashing my phone with a Ting experience

410
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,600
so they have no reason to slow down the updates.

411
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,580
Yeah, but how will I get all my custom music

412
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,080
from the Ting music store, Chris?

413
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,640
Right, and of course, the Ting video streaming service

414
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,480
that has exclusive Ting content.

415
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,960
Oh man, I hate that stuff.

416
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,840
It's like you get to live in a parallel world

417
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,280
where it all just makes sense and you don't hate yourself.

418
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,840
Yeah, where they had to do it right.

419
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
That's what I love about it.

420
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,320
Linux.ting.com, support the show and get $25 in credit.

421
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,480
Linux.ting.com.

422
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,760
What do you guys say we take a moment

423
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,040
and my chair really wants to share a story

424
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,280
about the plumbing of our desktops.

425
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,160
GStreamer is the framework that really

426
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,020
just kept on chugging.

427
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,940
I don't know, I mean, I first started talking

428
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,680
about GStreamer back in the Lunduke days

429
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,800
of Linux Action Show.

430
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,680
I mean, it's been a really, really long time

431
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,440
that it came about and I have not seen

432
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,680
many multimedia frameworks that have stayed relevant

433
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,320
and continue to get additional usage.

434
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,100
So we just were talking about PipeWire.

435
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,620
PipeWire is plugging into GStreamer.

436
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,520
Like it's something that they're actively developing

437
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,200
for our Wayland future and GStreamer is a big part of that.

438
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,940
And so I thought, well, it's obviously

439
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,400
still a relevant technology.

440
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,860
Even as plasma users use it, what's coming up?

441
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,080
So the new version, a new major release came out this week

442
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,620
and it adds some pretty fundamental features

443
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,100
that, holy crap, is gonna make live streaming

444
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,720
JB shows a lot easier.

445
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,440
But first of all is WebRTC support.

446
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,280
Nice.

447
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,880
Uh-huh, baked in to fricking GStreamer

448
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,640
will be real time audio and video streaming

449
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,400
in and to and from web browsers.

450
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,200
The whole pipeline now, from your browser

451
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,000
down to your multimedia framework

452
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,520
is gonna be WebRTC aware.

453
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,340
I think that's a big deal.

454
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,440
That's huge.

455
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,780
Video for Linux support, including encoding support,

456
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,360
stable element names and faster device probing,

457
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,720
which means things like OBS may be able to bring

458
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,840
certain GStreamer devices in now.

459
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,320
I think that's gonna be really nice.

460
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,720
I'm skipping a few other ones, RTSP 2.0 support,

461
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,520
QuickTime Muxer support, a new pre-fill recording mode

462
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,520
that allows editors to import into Adobe Premiere

463
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,680
and Final Cut Pro QuickTime files

464
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,280
while they're still being written to,

465
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,220
which think about that.

466
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,500
Think about how fast those editors have to work

467
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,920
if they're editing files that are still being written to.

468
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,920
And then for you binary NVIDIA users,

469
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,800
a new plugin for hardware accelerated video decoding

470
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,240
using the NVIDIA API.

471
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,200
And back to live streaming,

472
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,960
Adaptive Dash Trick Play support,

473
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,920
which is also a big deal.

474
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,040
There's also some GStreamer C sharp bindings

475
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,800
that have made their way in there

476
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,680
and some Rust bindings that are now being baked in.

477
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,040
The chair approves.

478
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,880
It sure does.

479
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,840
This is fancy and I mean, there's like a lot,

480
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,080
I feel like a lot of people don't necessarily

481
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,440
use GStreamer directly unless they are doing

482
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,120
some of this plumbing or maybe involved

483
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,000
in video production, audio production work.

484
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,160
Yeah, you're watching a video or listening to an MP3,

485
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,680
you don't have any thought about the backend

486
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,000
of decoding that audio that's happening in GStreamer.

487
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,440
But it really is, it's got its fingers everywhere.

488
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,520
So these improvements can just be benefited,

489
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,360
anything that uses it and then uses the new release, boom.

490
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,840
And having a common API like this makes developing

491
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,440
good multimedia applications on the Linux desktop possible

492
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,560
because you have an API to develop against

493
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,400
and they're also releasing binaries for Android,

494
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,360
iOS, Mac 10 and Windows in the next few days.

495
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,200
Wow.

496
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,520
Yeah, it makes it an actual viable API to write against.

497
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
iOS binaries, fancy.

498
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,920
I wonder what that means.

499
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,720
I wonder if that means you bundle it in

500
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,560
with your application.

501
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,720
I would assume so, yeah.

502
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,320
So in the backend you're using GStreamer

503
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,860
and the user is none the wiser on an iPhone.

504
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,760
That's awesome.

505
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,080
We talked about Firefox 59 on Linux Action News this week.

506
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,840
There's a few things that I really like about it.

507
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,400
Their screenshot tool is actually getting pretty useful.

508
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,200
Let's you like mark it up now

509
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,320
and copy it right to the clipboard,

510
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,620
which is great for when you just wanna drop it in Telegram.

511
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,480
And they have some new blocking features,

512
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,800
but none of that matters, none of that matters

513
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,560
because it's not about making it much faster.

514
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,400
Windows and Mac users got something

515
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,360
that us Linux users didn't get this time around.

516
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,440
And I can't have that.

517
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,280
What?

518
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
So we gotta write that wrong.

519
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,920
We have got to write that wrong, right?

520
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,600
There is this cool new feature called

521
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,280
off main thread painting.

522
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,680
You can just tell by the name you want that.

523
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,520
I want it right now.

524
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,000
It's not on the main thread and it involves painting,

525
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,440
which probably means drawing my thing.

526
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,320
Slow.

527
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,360
Yeah.

528
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,120
And on Linux, unfortunately,

529
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,600
it has to be turned on manually.

530
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,320
You go to, what is it?

531
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,840
It's about colon config

532
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,920
and then search for layers.omtp.enabled

533
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
and set that to true,

534
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,040
which I did that about a day ago

535
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,580
and haven't really had any problems.

536
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,800
I don't know if I noticed any massive performance changes

537
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,640
either.

538
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,080
So you're not getting the Linux unplugged certified.

539
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,460
This is your hack to make kind of thing.

540
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,220
This is just, you've been warned.

541
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,360
You may or may not want to turn it on,

542
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,760
but I seem to feel like it is worth it

543
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,240
because so far I haven't had any noticeable downsides

544
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,280
and there is documented benchmarks that show

545
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,000
it is significantly faster

546
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,240
when you draw the webpage off the main thread.

547
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,600
It leaves the UI more responsive and other things like that.

548
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,440
So it seems like a no-brainer.

549
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,360
My chair approves.

550
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,200
I think Levi approves.

551
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,400
I think he approves, yeah.

552
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,480
We have a special in guest dog this week

553
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,400
who has made Wes his friend.

554
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,120
Levi just decided this week that this was the episode

555
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,800
he wants to sit in Wes's lap.

556
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,080
And Wes thought he had a choice in the matter.

557
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
I assumed I did, but nope.

558
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,960
Nope, I am just a chair today.

559
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,800
Studio dog.

560
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,240
Levi is actually the co-host.

561
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,080
Yeah.

562
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,220
You know, he missed you.

563
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,060
Oh, I missed him too.

564
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,840
You know, we were in California and he missed you.

565
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,040
So there's a company that I've bumped into a few times

566
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,720
and you hear about them every now and then

567
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,420
when it comes to funding.

568
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,500
It's Private Internet Access.

569
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,440
And they've been sponsoring several open source projects.

570
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,960
And of course they run Linux for their VPN infrastructure.

571
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,440
And they're self-labeled longtime supporters

572
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,240
of free and open source software.

573
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,120
Well today, they've started the process

574
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,280
of open sourcing their software.

575
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,840
And over the next six months,

576
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,660
they're gonna release all of the code

577
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,600
for their client-side applications,

578
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,560
as well as libraries and extensions as open source.

579
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,300
They go on to say they're extremely grateful

580
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,240
to the free and open source software community

581
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,160
for creating the foundations of the internet as we know it.

582
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,640
And while we may be late to the party,

583
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,060
we are looking forward to furthering our work

584
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,840
with a movement that aligns with our own passions

585
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,260
on our own personal and professional levels.

586
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,040
That resonates with me, actually.

587
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,880
Absolutely.

588
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,480
I feel a lot of the same feels there.

589
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,640
They say we believe that the shift to open source

590
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,240
is a right move for a privacy-focused business.

591
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
Completely agree with that.

592
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,320
And recognize that code transparency is key.

593
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,400
We appreciate that our code may not be perfect,

594
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,520
coming at it with a little bit of a humble attitude.

595
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,720
And we hope that the wider FOSS community

596
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,840
will get involved, provide feedback,

597
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,120
feature requests, bug fixes,

598
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,340
and generally help provide a greater service

599
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,260
to the wider privacy movement.

600
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,120
Today, we're opening up the first of many repositories,

601
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,320
the Chrome extension that allows our users

602
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,600
to access our network of proxies from their web browser.

603
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,120
The Chrome extension also boasts

604
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,240
additional privacy and security features,

605
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,680
such as disabling your microphone and camera,

606
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,920
blocking flash and IP discovery through WebRTC,

607
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,240
and it also can automatically block ads.

608
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,080
Fancy.

609
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,040
So they're opening that up.

610
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,720
They also have a private internet access chat room

611
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,000
on Freenode, if you want to go to chat.freenode.net

612
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,520
and go into private internet access for there.

613
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,400
And they say, yeah, our long-term goal

614
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,600
is to release all of our code into the open.

615
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,440
That's fantastic.

616
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,920
I mean, especially as a company that sells a service

617
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,280
that's really just backend infrastructure to run VPNs,

618
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,640
it makes complete sense to be able to do this.

619
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,640
And so, of course their code's not perfect.

620
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,940
It's always just been proprietary before.

621
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,780
This is fantastic.

622
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,280
And I'm sure it will get them more open source

623
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,560
advocates and users.

624
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,760
I'm definitely gonna take another look.

625
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,040
JJ, you've looked at private internet access before.

626
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,320
I've heard about it on various podcasts and stuff.

627
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,120
My question would be, how would this spec up

628
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,000
versus ProtonVPN?

629
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,600
I don't know.

630
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,920
I was thinking about, I wonder how it compares to AirVPN,

631
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,200
which has been my VPN provider of choice for quite a while

632
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,640
now, for a couple of years, which I was able to sign up

633
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,280
anonymously using Bitcoin.

634
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,560
And I've never provided them with a username or location.

635
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
And they have a ton of servers to choose from.

636
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,680
And they will generate open VPN profiles and all those things

637
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,440
that I really like.

638
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,000
But they're not open source.

639
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,880
And I kind of think that that really

640
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,680
is sort of a nice differentiator.

641
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,000
And they're smart to identify that.

642
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,680
It's very savvy to identify that as a differentiator

643
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,400
for their market.

644
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,360
And Duck Who in the chat room says

645
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,080
he just subscribed yesterday.

646
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,480
Either way, it's a good move.

647
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,960
It's smart of them.

648
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,520
Wes and I in the, well, before the hire,

649
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,160
it's our pre-pre-pre-show, I guess, technically,

650
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,720
because we weren't on the air yet.

651
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,960
But Wes and I were just recently kind of discussing WireGuard,

652
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,480
going back to Tink VPNs.

653
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
What do we want to do?

654
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,060
We both kind of have a need for a VPN service.

655
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,120
But we more like want to bridge lands together.

656
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,520
So we're both kind of on the fence.

657
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,640
I've been leaning more towards Tink myself.

658
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,520
What about you?

659
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,040
Where did you fall down on that?

660
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,520
I've actually still have Tink deployed pretty successfully,

661
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,400
bridging some lands and that.

662
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,640
Oh, you are still using it.

663
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,140
I am.

664
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,720
It's not as pervasive on my network as it once was.

665
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,480
So now it's kind of just using that and not

666
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
as much for the mesh functionality, which

667
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,920
is why, really, I was thinking about replacing it.

668
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,840
I've been thinking about giving WireGuard a more real try.

669
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,640
I've used it for some point-to-point stuff.

670
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,240
But I thought it'd be fun to try to get a larger installation.

671
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,960
Yeah.

672
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,560
Anybody in the Mumba room got an active VPN account

673
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,280
that they're pretty happy with, a service

674
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,120
that they like that works well with Linux?

675
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
And there's different needs, right?

676
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,240
Very much so.

677
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,480
There's rerouting to get around, say, region blocks.

678
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,920
And then there is just trying to bridge land.

679
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,840
So there's different uses, which I kind of have the former.

680
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,120
That's what mine is.

681
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,620
Right.

682
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,120
Yeah, sometimes you need to go on.

683
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,920
But you have the most experience with OpenVPN,

684
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,440
which is still working for me.

685
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,200
I have it set up on a VPS.

686
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,120
Yeah.

687
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,280
Yeah, I know a lot of people in the audience do that, too.

688
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,400
Levi prefers that.

689
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,800
Levi likes to just set it up on a DigitalOcean droplet

690
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,280
in the London data center.

691
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,440
And then he VPNs into that.

692
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,360
That's Levi the dog's trick.

693
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,240
Isn't that, Levi?

694
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,640
Yeah, that's a good point.

695
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,240
All right, Wes.

696
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,160
Well, speaking of VPSs, let's talk about this really quick.

697
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,400
DigitalOcean.

698
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,000
Oh.

699
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,640
Well, how perfect was that?

700
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,360
It's almost like I didn't actually plan that.

701
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,840
I wish we were that savvy.

702
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,680
I wish we planned the show to that level of a fine detail.

703
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,760
First, we'll talk about VPSs.

704
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,640
And then we'll get Mitt Free to say that he runs his own VPS.

705
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,600
And then we'll segue.

706
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,680
Nope.

707
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,520
It's just because these things are very useful.

708
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,720
That's why it comes up.

709
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,600
DigitalOcean.

710
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,120
It's simplicity at scale.

711
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,560
And they have a very special offer for limited time,

712
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,720
hot off the presses.

713
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
That's the presses when people make those noises.

714
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:32,960
Don't worry.

715
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,000
They're open source presses.

716
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,520
That's right.

717
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,360
Absolutely.

718
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,560
do.co slash unplugged.

719
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,760
If you have a new account and you go to that URL,

720
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,720
if you sign up for a new account and go to that URL,

721
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,480
you can get a limited time $100 credit for 60 days.

722
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,280
Oh, this is a great way to play around with DigitalOcean

723
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,640
because everything on DigitalOcean is wicked fast.

724
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,360
So you can go build a crazy, super powerful system

725
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,680
or build something and just get that $100

726
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,320
like for the full 60 days.

727
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,120
I mean, you could really just fine tune it.

728
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,400
They also have new flexible droplets, mix and match,

729
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,960
depending on what your application needs.

730
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,360
So yeah, you could also play around with that.

731
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,680
And I go to this all the time.

732
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,600
Like when I want to experiment with something,

733
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,520
what I love about DigitalOcean is

734
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,040
I'm able to think about who is the audience?

735
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,720
Is it me?

736
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,200
Is it the audience themselves?

737
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,280
Is it somebody in an area where I could spin up

738
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,320
the server in their location?

739
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
That's what I love.

740
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,040
Then there's this ability to transfer ownership.

741
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,560
So after I've created it, I can give it off to somebody.

742
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,520
We use that between Noah and I all the freaking time.

743
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,800
It's really useful, especially when we just

744
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,000
spin up infrastructure for an on-location gig.

745
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,480
We use it for one weekend.

746
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
And he has the image.

747
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,880
You can send it over here.

748
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,080
It's a super powerful system.

749
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,520
And they have team accounts.

750
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,360
So you have all of this great functionality.

751
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,920
And they manage to deliver it all in a really easy

752
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,200
to use dashboard.

753
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,960
It's super straightforward for pros or beginners.

754
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,560
A documented API.

755
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,440
And then SSDs for everything.

756
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,840
40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors.

757
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,720
Eight data centers all over the world.

758
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,360
And for a limited time, a $100 credit

759
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,400
when you go to dio.co slash unplugged.

760
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,440
I just waved the paper around, basically saying,

761
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,840
enough said right there.

762
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Enough said right there.

763
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,840
I'll mention this, because this is boss level stuff.

764
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,920
You may have heard of Cloudflare.

765
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,440
You may have heard of NGINX.

766
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,320
And there's a possibility, a remote chance

767
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,480
you've heard of Ubuntu.

768
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,400
What about putting all those things together?

769
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,520
They have a guide on how to host a website using Cloudflare

770
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,640
and NGINX on Ubuntu 16.04.

771
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,080
So Cloudflare is a service that sits

772
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,800
between the visitor and the website.

773
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,480
And it's a CDN, as well as DDoS mitigation.

774
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,560
It's also a great way to do SSL acceleration

775
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,160
if you have a whole bunch of domains

776
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,320
and you want to put an SSL cert in front of all of it.

777
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,840
It's a really handy service.

778
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,400
NGINX is a very popular web server

779
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,680
for a lot of good reasons.

780
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,140
You combine all that stuff together,

781
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,680
and they've got an awesome guide on how to do it.

782
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,280
They've got really good stuff over there, dio.co slash

783
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,360
unplugged.

784
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,640
They also do a great job of supporting open source projects.

785
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,280
Yeah, they do.

786
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,980
Boom.

787
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,240
In fact, if I could give them any recommendations,

788
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,040
it would be maybe promote that a little more.

789
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,280
I know they do it just because they want to give back.

790
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,200
But there is some entire projects

791
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,540
where their entire infrastructure runs on D.O.

792
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,280
And they don't pay a cent, and it's pretty cool.

793
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,680
So are you familiar with the application for Mac OS

794
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,440
called Little Snitch?

795
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,200
Oh, yeah.

796
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,700
I think I've seen some people using that.

797
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,200
Yeah.

798
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,780
It's a handy little application that runs in the background,

799
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,560
and it creates an outbound firewall.

800
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:30,380
And it then gives the user some kind of notification,

801
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,320
either through the native notification system

802
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,800
or a custom notification dialogue,

803
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,640
that X, Y, Z application, Chrome,

804
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,200
is trying to connect outbound on this port to this address.

805
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,640
Do you want to allow it?

806
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,440
And one of the things that's interesting

807
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,840
is, say, you have software that checks

808
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,960
into some sort of remote server every time you launch it.

809
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,160
You will discover it very quickly with applications

810
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,200
like Little Snitch, and you'll discover, oh,

811
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,760
every time I run Lightworks, it's checking in

812
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,240
with edit share servers, for better or for worse.

813
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,740
But it's nice to know it's happening.

814
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,320
And you can also make the decision

815
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,960
to allow it or block it with Little Snitch.

816
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,000
And I've probably gotten, over the years,

817
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,320
a handful of questions.

818
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,360
Hey, is there anything like that for GNU slash Linux?

819
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,660
Anybody got something like that?

820
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,840
Because I would love to have something

821
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,380
like that for GNU slash Linux.

822
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,240
And I always say, get it out of here.

823
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,840
Get it out of here.

824
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,320
Right.

825
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,740
You'll have to roll it yourself, get some IP tables,

826
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,520
commands, and a whole bunch of scripting.

827
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,160
Yeah, yeah.

828
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,760
But you know what?

829
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,140
We have an app pick for you this week.

830
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,560
People have been saying, Chris, more app picks.

831
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,160
Missed the app picks from Linux Action Show.

832
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,920
Well, guess what?

833
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,800
We've been slipping them in here.

834
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,280
We just haven't been calling them app picks.

835
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,360
But this week, we got two of them for you.

836
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,960
And the first one is called OpenSnitch.

837
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,520
OpenSnitch is a GNU slash Linux port of the Little Snitch

838
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,160
application firewall.

839
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,680
And just like its Mac cousin, it gives you

840
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,960
a graphical notification saying, hey,

841
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,280
Telnet is trying to connect out on ports blah, blah, blah

842
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,880
to destination IP blah, blah, blah.

843
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,840
Would you like to block this temporarily?

844
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,440
Would you like to block this forever?

845
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,960
Would you like to allow it?

846
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,200
And the thing that's wonderful about this

847
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,760
is you can just run it for short periods of time

848
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,120
and get an idea of what your system is doing.

849
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,880
And it's incredibly insightful.

850
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,600
It, in my personal opinion, gets really obnoxious

851
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,480
after a while because everything is going outbound these days.

852
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,100
When Little Snitch was first conceived,

853
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,400
not nearly as many things connected out to the internet.

854
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,960
But it's still very useful.

855
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,160
It's called OpenSnitch, OpenSnitch.io.

856
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,760
And you're going to have to build it

857
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,760
if you're on one of the more common distros except for Arch.

858
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,640
Arch, there is an AUR entry.

859
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
Surprise, surprise.

860
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,400
But we're not talking anything major.

861
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:46,040
They have the commands you can run to sudo apt install or DNF

862
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,320
install the dependencies.

863
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,160
And then it's really just a Python setup install.

864
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,600
It's really not a big deal.

865
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,600
So it's not like you're going to be spending all day getting

866
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
the software built. And it is in the AUR

867
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,400
if you want to just install OpenSnitch dash git.

868
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,640
Anyways, OpenSnitch.d gets installed.

869
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,760
And then there's a cute front end that talks to OpenSnitch.d.

870
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,720
And then there's like a rule process.

871
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,780
And it's kind of a nice system.

872
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,240
It's an application level firewall,

873
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,120
meaning it works while it's running.

874
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,440
And it will detect and alert the user for every single outgoing

875
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,800
connection that gets created, which is very nice.

876
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,200
It can be extremely effective to detect and block

877
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,960
unwanted connections, which is also really helpful when you're

878
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,920
just in certain situations and scenarios.

879
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,280
Maybe you're on a certain unknown network.

880
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,480
Right, not trusted. Or you're just trying

881
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,160
to evaluate some new software.

882
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,840
And it's using underlying good standard Linux firewall stuff,

883
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,620
like AP tables extensions or NFs or whatever

884
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,960
you have on your system.

885
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,680
It's not like it's some crazy homebrew firewall.

886
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
Right, yeah, exactly.

887
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,600
It's just using the stuff in the Linux kernel.

888
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,180
And once a connection is detected,

889
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,760
the software relies on ftrace kernel extensions

890
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,640
to track which PID is causing the connection.

891
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,800
So it can actually tell you which particular process

892
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,360
on your Linux box is trying to make that outbound connection.

893
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:01,860
Nice.

894
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,680
Which is really great when something comes like,

895
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,040
I didn't even know that was running in the background.

896
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,680
So that's open snitch.

897
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,200
And we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

898
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,780
And then, Wes, you found this one.

899
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,780
And I figured, why would you want this?

900
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,920
But then I remembered that Spotify actually

901
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,160
has this feature where any Spotify client can control

902
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,880
any other Spotify client on your account.

903
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,200
And that's when this next app pick really clicked for me.

904
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,720
It's Spotify D.

905
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,640
An open source Spotify client that runs as a Unix demon.

906
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,760
So just like regular Spotify, it's headless freaking Spotify.

907
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,560
It streams music, just like the official client.

908
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,640
But it's lightweight.

909
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,240
Doesn't have that whole web UI wrapper around it.

910
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,960
It supports the Spotify Connect protocol,

911
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,120
which makes it just show up as any other Spotify

912
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,400
device that you can control.

913
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,960
The only downside is it does require a Spotify premium

914
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,840
account, which I happen to have because we use it

915
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,640
in the family quite a bit.

916
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm not a proud Spotify user.

917
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,360
I actually hem and haw a little bit about putting this here

918
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,720
because I know a lot of people are like, Spotify?

919
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,920
You know what I like about Spotify, though?

920
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,600
I always tell myself, they're streaming

921
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,840
the music using Augworbus.

922
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,440
So at least you can play it on Linux.

923
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,440
And we're in kind of an awkward situation, right?

924
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,360
We talk about Slack.

925
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,760
We talk about other things.

926
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,320
As much as we love and want to support open source software,

927
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,600
we all get in our lives done.

928
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,200
And sometimes that means running whatever

929
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,120
you happen to already have.

930
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,720
Or maybe you're sharing an account with your spouse

931
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,800
or whatever else.

932
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,320
I mean, the thing is not only do we

933
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,440
have shared playlists, which is great,

934
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,880
but I just don't care enough about music.

935
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:45,120
Like when I first got a computer and CDs were still a thing,

936
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,800
I curated a collection.

937
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,160
And I was really OCD about all of my tag information.

938
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,540
And I would rip complete albums and make sure all of the stuff

939
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,920
and I'd run it through like, Music Brains Picard

940
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,920
and all that kind of stuff to try to make it.

941
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,340
Yeah, and then a couple of machine migrations,

942
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,440
everything gets ruined.

943
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,920
Or I'd try out, I'd install the new version of Rhythmbox,

944
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,160
and it blanked out all of my ID3 tags one time.

945
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,520
And I'm like, well, I'm never going to do that again.

946
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,120
And I just sort of had to just divorce myself

947
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,040
from caring about my music collection.

948
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,920
And now I just embrace the streaming service.

949
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,320
And honestly, if Spotify went out of business tomorrow,

950
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,840
I would give zero shits.

951
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,320
I would just sign up for something else.

952
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,320
A different one.

953
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,540
So it's with that kind of pragmatist mindset

954
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,780
that I use Spotify.

955
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,580
And so when you come at me with an open source Spotify

956
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,240
headless client that I could potentially

957
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,040
run here in the studio, I'm all about it.

958
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,000
I think this is great.

959
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,680
Yeah, especially if you already have like a media center

960
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,080
machine that's hooked up to a sound system or otherwise,

961
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,040
this would be perfect.

962
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,280
Totally.

963
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,040
Yeah, that's great.

964
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,320
It does require the also packages get installed,

965
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,440
which then talks to Pulse.

966
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,240
But that's the typical shit show of Linux audio,

967
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,680
not too surprising there.

968
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,240
It also supports D-Bus, which means

969
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,440
it can be controlled by some generic media playback

970
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,000
controllers like Player CTL or your desktop environments

971
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,640
that have like the playback controls in the volume slider,

972
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,080
like modern desktops, still can control this sucker too.

973
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,620
So you don't really need the Spotify.

974
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,280
Wow.

975
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,440
See, this is awesome.

976
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,880
So this might be just the way I get Spotify from now on.

977
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,080
And you may want to as well.

978
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,440
You can find a link to that in the show notes.

979
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,280
Yeah, that's true.

980
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,720
Vera Tundis says in the chat room,

981
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,400
she says, but Chris, that's what media servers are for, like MB.

982
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,840
So I got an excuse for that too.

983
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,160
I got all in on Sub Zero, I think it was, or Subsonic.

984
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,200
Subsonic, yeah.

985
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,600
And there was a whole bunch of shenanigans

986
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,840
about them going commercial.

987
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,480
And the project had a bunch of bad blood.

988
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,040
And I paid for it on two separate occasions

989
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,000
and got screwed.

990
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,280
And so it's not a good enough reason, but I just gave up.

991
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,120
I still manage my video collection

992
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,000
like I used to manage my TV, or my music collection.

993
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,600
I still manage my TV and my movies like that.

994
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,840
I gave up on the music a long time ago.

995
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,960
It's just a shame.

996
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,280
It's especially hard with discovery and other things too.

997
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,960
And the streaming services just make it so simple.

998
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,840
Yeah, yeah.

999
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,160
That's just, you sit down, especially with Android TV

1000
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,240
and stuff like that.

1001
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,760
I know.

1002
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,400
Anybody in the Mumble Room, the exact opposite,

1003
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,680
where you're super meticulous about your music library,

1004
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,520
you only listen to local audio.

1005
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,000
Angela's like that.

1006
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,560
Angela only listens to local.

1007
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,080
Is that right?

1008
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,560
No streaming.

1009
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,760
She's just local audio.

1010
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,960
She still sings it via the wire to her phone.

1011
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,000
Yeah, it's impressive, normally.

1012
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,680
What's that, Mini?

1013
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,720
I started to back up my whole CD collection, which

1014
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,280
is about 400 or 500 CDs.

1015
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:46,520
I have to flag a copy and then normally have 192 OGD copies

1016
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,080
for my phone and for my router.

1017
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,080
So when I'm at home, I stream via router.

1018
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,600
So that works great.

1019
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,520
What client are you using on Android to play Hogs?

1020
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,440
On Android, I don't have an Android phone.

1021
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,200
I use the Yola Sailfish phone.

1022
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,120
So there is no problem.

1023
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,680
OK, OK, all right.

1024
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,480
Nice.

1025
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,560
Nice answer, dude.

1026
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,760
Yeah.

1027
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,800
Shut Chris up right there.

1028
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,160
And I knew that too, when I think about it.

1029
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,640
I knew it.

1030
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,240
I never had that question.

1031
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,240
Is that true?

1032
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,840
Does Android don't have Android in OGD?

1033
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,640
No, I mean, there's like VLC and whatnot.

1034
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,880
That should be default now.

1035
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,200
I don't know.

1036
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,240
The open source music media player, I don't think,

1037
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,680
is even the default anymore.

1038
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,560
But I have a dozen different apps that will play Hogs.

1039
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,080
But I don't like any of them enough

1040
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,040
to listen to all my music that way.

1041
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,240
Isn't it interesting that it's hard to find

1042
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,160
a really good music player?

1043
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,700
I mean, there are thousands for Linux boxes,

1044
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,040
but a really good one?

1045
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,520
I found Lollipop for GDK Gno, which is cool.

1046
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,080
CMOS on the terminal is great.

1047
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,280
But otherwise, it's really hard to find

1048
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,360
really cool, good music players.

1049
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,360
I mean, most of us are satisfied with the results of VLC,

1050
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,080
I guess.

1051
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,760
But what if you have a large collection?

1052
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,320
See, that's one of the other reasons I end up using Spotify,

1053
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:05,360
is because it's also a jukebox, like of the old style jukebox.

1054
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,760
You know, you guys all know Arm Rock.

1055
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,160
Just like after years, just after years,

1056
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,160
just released a new version recently.

1057
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,200
I didn't, I missed that.

1058
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,320
Yeah, I don't know if it's a beta or what, but yeah.

1059
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,680
So it's still a thing.

1060
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,880
But I think with SSDs too, and a lot of my main machines

1061
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,640
are laptops these days, I just don't

1062
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,200
have a lot of room for gigabytes and gigabytes of music.

1063
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,640
If I had unlimited budget, unlimited time,

1064
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,680
I would prefer to have everything in Flax.

1065
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,200
And I would prefer to have it all local.

1066
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,200
Anyway, Spotify D, we'll have a link up on the show notes.

1067
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,540
You know, if you want to give us an app, or a story,

1068
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,600
or a project that you think we should know about,

1069
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,720
hit us up on the subreddit.

1070
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,800
It's still going, linuxunplugged.reddit.com,

1071
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,640
linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

1072
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,160
And in the next, I'm not sure what the scheduling is,

1073
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,480
but it's very soon there's going to be back end

1074
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,880
changes for the RSS feeds and stuff like that

1075
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,760
coming to this show, because we're doing a whole project.

1076
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,840
We've got a whole project coming up.

1077
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,880
And this show is going to be rolled up into all of that.

1078
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,800
I don't think you'll have to do anything.

1079
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,880
I guess the one thing I would say is if, by accident,

1080
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,440
when we forward the RSS feed, if we trigger an extra download

1081
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,120
or something like that, I apologize.

1082
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,880
We're sorry.

1083
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,120
Here's what I do expect to have happen.

1084
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,520
This is why I'm giving you the heads up.

1085
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,760
There will be a cleaning of the feeds

1086
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,000
simply because we're switching feed services.

1087
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,960
That's one of the things we're doing,

1088
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,760
is we're migrating off a feed burner, which

1089
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,280
is sort of like this zombie Google service.

1090
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,360
And we're moving to a small shop that

1091
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:42,040
is dedicated to hosting podcast RSS feeds called FeedPress.

1092
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,560
And we're going to have a cool new URLs, too.

1093
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
So check this out.

1094
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,360
If you go to, they're not all set up,

1095
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,200
but this one is feed.jupiter.zone

1096
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,560
slash allshows.

1097
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,000
That is the allshows RSS feed.

1098
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,400
So we're going to have a new domain for all of our feeds,

1099
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,400
feed.jupiter.zone and then slash feed name.

1100
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,320
So it'll be like allshows, lup, super easy stuff.

1101
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:15,120
And the issue with that is that migration process

1102
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,840
is not super clean.

1103
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,860
I can forward, I can do like a redirect.

1104
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,520
I can redirect people to the new feed,

1105
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,080
but I can't import the old items.

1106
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,920
Incompatible.

1107
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:33,400
So if you are an archivist, you got a few days, maybe,

1108
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,120
to try to pull everything down in the feed.

1109
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,880
That's your warning, because it'll be a reset clean feed,

1110
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,340
then they'll be updated from there,

1111
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,760
but there's going to be a clean break when

1112
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,080
we move to the new feed service.

1113
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,440
You won't have to resub, because I'll do a redirect at the URL

1114
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,880
level, but the actual items in the RSS feed will be reset.

1115
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,280
And that also will prevent triggering redownloads, too.

1116
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,240
So it's also a good thing.

1117
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,480
So yeah, that's your public.

1118
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,240
But be prepared for changes.

1119
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,880
Yeah, be prepared.

1120
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,000
Also, just keep an eye out for that kind of stuff.

1121
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,640
Just a general Linux Unplugged service

1122
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,560
announcement for your better podcast experience.

1123
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,240
Now, I did just get back from scale.

1124
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,160
And like I said in the intro, I got a lot of clips, over 170,

1125
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,440
and talked to a lot of people.

1126
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,960
But I knew when I came back from scale this year

1127
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,760
that I really wanted to just do the best job possible,

1128
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,080
just giving you what you need to know about the event,

1129
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,880
and not overdoing it with 15 interviews,

1130
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,600
and multiple episodes, and all of that,

1131
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,920
like not bogging down the show with it.

1132
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,120
It's harder to do than it sounds like,

1133
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,080
because there's so much going on at scale.

1134
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,280
And so I got there on Thursday.

1135
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,600
I got there Wednesday, but the scale starts Thursday,

1136
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,520
and it goes till Sunday.

1137
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,920
And there's stuff going on all day, every day.

1138
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,440
And you're learning and meeting people every single day.

1139
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,280
Plus, it's a multi-thousand dollar investment for us,

1140
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,400
cost-wise, as a company, to go down there.

1141
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,240
Noah's down there, and he's taking time off of AltaSpeed,

1142
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,400
so it's a personal investment for him, too.

1143
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:09,880
And so you have this drive to come back and just make

1144
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,960
it all scale all the time.

1145
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,040
Because we've spent a lot of energy and time in this.

1146
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,980
But this trip was really the trip

1147
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:23,120
where I internalized why I go to these things.

1148
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,360
And it wasn't about the pressure of making a show out of it.

1149
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,720
It was about going there, talking to people,

1150
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,640
learning, getting insights from the audience,

1151
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,720
figuring out new things to look into, meeting new companies.

1152
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,800
That's why I went, not to come back

1153
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,040
with all of these interviews about the latest, craziest

1154
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,800
things that I saw on the expo floor.

1155
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,920
But I did pick one.

1156
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,480
I did pick one interview that I wanted to play for you guys,

1157
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:55,880
because it's from someone who has been doing this

1158
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,040
for quite a while.

1159
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,960
He is one of the co-founders.

1160
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,040
He's the Scale Conference chair.

1161
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,480
Elon is a longtime member of this community.

1162
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,320
And he works at Datadog.

1163
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,780
He is, as he puts it, a recovering sys admin.

1164
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:14,200
And he had some interesting things to say.

1165
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,160
So I did pull that interview.

1166
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,320
I sat down with him at the expo floor

1167
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,840
while he was in the thick of things

1168
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,520
and just did a brain dump with him.

1169
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,320
And I wanted to play a little bit of that, a little bit

1170
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,480
of the expo floor for you, just to sort of cap off

1171
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,480
my trip to scale.

1172
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,720
So before we get there, I want to thank Linux Academy

1173
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,920
for sponsoring the show and making what we do possible

1174
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,920
and for creating a platform to help Linux users learn more

1175
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,440
about Linux.

1176
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,800
It's a way to get access to advanced training tools

1177
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,200
that increase your skills and encourage critical thinking

1178
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,440
around everything related to Linux, a full-featured training

1179
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,680
library with everything you need to know,

1180
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,240
with full-time human beings that are available to help.

1181
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,880
And one of my favorite features is real, hands-on labs

1182
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,800
and exercises.

1183
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,920
They deploy real environments, and then you

1184
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,160
take scenario-based labs on them, hands-ons,

1185
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,560
from anywheres at any times.

1186
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,160
Hands-on scenario-based labs give you

1187
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,480
experience on real environments that Linux Academy has

1188
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,760
curated for you.

1189
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,280
And that is huge for me because I genuinely learn by doing.

1190
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,600
Yeah, sometimes you can't supplant that.

1191
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,760
You can answer all the multiple choice questions you want,

1192
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,360
but if you haven't been on that server.

1193
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,760
And I can't test.

1194
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,160
I can't test unless I've done it and I've seen it.

1195
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,240
I cannot test.

1196
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,200
There's no exam I'm passing.

1197
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,840
And I say that having learned that the really hard and

1198
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,160
expensive way a couple of times.

1199
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,160
And that was just something I learned about myself.

1200
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,040
And that's one of the things I really

1201
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,400
appreciate about Linux Academy is it's built around that.

1202
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,440
But even more importantly, it's built for your busy, busy life.

1203
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,560
You can pick a course and set a time frame,

1204
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,120
and it'll fit your schedule and your learning goals.

1205
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,600
They have practice exams and quizzes

1206
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,080
to help you prep for when you're going to go take that test.

1207
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,600
And they have a community that's full of Jupyter broadcasting

1208
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,800
that are forking, customizing, and randomizing study flash

1209
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,760
cards to help you up your game.

1210
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,240
And then they have study tools that you can download offline

1211
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:58,760
and listen to.

1212
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,480
So if you're like Eric and I and you're

1213
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,240
in a bandwidth limited environment,

1214
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,640
they can accommodate that too.

1215
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,560
And if you're on the go, maybe you're in the tube

1216
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,640
and you got some downtime while you're commuting,

1217
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,480
they got iOS and Android apps as well.

1218
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,680
It's pretty great.

1219
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,680
In fact, you might say it's the best.

1220
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,440
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1221
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,000
Go there, support the show, and sign up

1222
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,760

1223
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,680
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1224
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,600
Dooblaloo, dooblaloo, dooblaloo.

1225
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,560
So yeah, let's go to scale.

1226
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,800
You want to go back to California about a week ago?

1227
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,320
Let's teleport, get right there.

1228
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,560
Much faster than going by RV, right?

1229
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,960
Can we still take Levi?

1230
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,200
We're definitely taking Levi.

1231
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,200
You have to take Levi.

1232
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,840
He's the tour guide.

1233
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,880
There was something that Scale has done,

1234
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,420
and they really refined it this year.

1235
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,760
It's not their first crack at it.

1236
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,320
But if you're going to scale, I think

1237
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,520
it's one of the things you might really like

1238
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,000
is they have these track sessions.

1239
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,960
So Ubicon, for example, was a track.

1240
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,680
It's all Ubuntu all the time.

1241
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,360
And then there was several other tracks.

1242
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,600
Like one of the more popular ones was the Postgres track

1243
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,280
for people that just wanted to implement and deploy Postgres

1244
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,520
in their day-to-day work lives.

1245
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,120
And so the goal here with partitioning

1246
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,440
is sort of without having to do a lot of changes,

1247
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,600
you can implement this within Postgres on the same system,

1248
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,960
and then get a lot of benefits.

1249
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,120
One of the tracks that was going on all day yesterday

1250
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,840
and appears to be going on all day today

1251
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,720
is people that are trying to get work done with PostSQL,

1252
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,800
Postgres.

1253
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,600
And so this one is like a performance track.

1254
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,160
And this room, room 106, will be about Postgres all day long.

1255
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,040
The other one that really blew my mind,

1256
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,240
Noah and I specifically wanted to go out and see

1257
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,480
how deep can we go into the under-workings of Linux.

1258
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,920
And so we set out to find the USB subsystems track.

1259
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,440
So the question is, is there a one-to-one core session?

1260
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,360
That's like a hardcore session in there.

1261
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,200
People are following along on their laptops with the slides.

1262
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,320
It's like down to details.

1263
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,880
Yeah, it's, yeah.

1264
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,840
Like, I started to get a little overwhelmed

1265
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,000
within a couple of minutes.

1266
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,760
But it's fascinating, too, like the kind of stuff

1267
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,880
they have to worry about.

1268
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,000
It's a room full of people trying

1269
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,200
to figure out how to make accessories on Linux.

1270
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,360
And I'm glad there's people doing that so that people

1271
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,600
like you and me don't have to.

1272
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,120
No kidding.

1273
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,160
And you heard in the background, there's babies there.

1274
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,160
There's families there.

1275
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,480
There's even dogs there.

1276
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,640
They said, you know, we could probably get Levi a pass.

1277
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,440
That's amazing.

1278
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,360
It really was pretty great.

1279
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,720
But Levi had other things to do that day.

1280
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,800
And you get the sense that you could go there and really

1281
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,480
sort of walk away with knowledge to ship something.

1282
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,240
Like, that USB subsystem one really went deep into like,

1283
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,780
here's how you troubleshoot when you're

1284
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,960
trying to build a product and you need it to identify itself

1285
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,920
to the Linux subsystem.

1286
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,760
Like, here's some of the things you can look into

1287
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,920
if this isn't working for you.

1288
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,080
Like, really like stuff you walk away with.

1289
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,160
Actual practical tips that you're going to need.

1290
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,480
Quote unquote, actionable items, if you will.

1291
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,760
But of course, one of my favorite things

1292
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,320
of any conference we ever go to, because the energy's always

1293
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,680
high and people always have their best foot forward,

1294
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,480
is the Expo Hall.

1295
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,960
And Noah and I are walking around with our media badges.

1296
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,880
So we got to go in a little early.

1297
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,520
You can hear them vacuuming the carpet now.

1298
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,400
They're still getting everything ready.

1299
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,360
We were able to sneak in as media a little early

1300
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,640
before the crowds in here.

1301
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,920
And it's still this noisy in here.

1302
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,800
Yeah.

1303
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,760
Yeah, there's the Ubuntu booth next to Chef.

1304
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,040
Howdy, howdy.

1305
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,640
Now, this is more my speed.

1306
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,640
We got a Videoland booth, Datadog.

1307
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,000
I've been wanting to talk to Datadog.

1308
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,680
This is nice.

1309
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,800
The Expo Hall at scale is always really fantastic.

1310
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,560
And it looks like they've spread it back out again a little bit

1311
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,720
from what it was last year.

1312
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,280
There's Fedora.

1313
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,240
Hey, Fedora.

1314
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,760
Fedora's looking good.

1315
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,880
Fedora has a booth.

1316
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,160
Adobe has a booth.

1317
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,640
Ubuntu has a booth.

1318
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,640
Yeah, really nice.

1319
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,200
Microsoft had a hell of a booth with Surface tablets there

1320
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,120
and lights everywhere and nice chairs.

1321
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,560
Git had a booth, like lots of folks have booths.

1322
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:49,400
And then lots of companies that I didn't even recognize

1323
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,280
had booths.

1324
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,120
It's interesting how many of these company names

1325
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,120
I don't even recognize.

1326
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,680
I think a handful of these companies

1327
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,960
did not exist two years ago at scale.

1328
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,680
Oh, yeah?

1329
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:06,320
I mean, do you recognize some of these, like TwitSlock,

1330
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,080
Skilly Dab, Tindy?

1331
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,040
I recognize GumGum.

1332
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,080
GoBot, Uncoded.

1333
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,720
I don't recognize these companies.

1334
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,120
I cover this stuff every day and I don't recognize

1335
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,560
these companies.

1336
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,520
It's like they've just come up out of nowhere

1337
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:20,640
based on some of the technology that's in Linux now.

1338
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,440
Yeah, I think there's a lot of startup companies

1339
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,680
and a lot of venture capitalist money that's coming around,

1340
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,160
people trying to get off the ground.

1341
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,720
Well, you just put it in a container

1342
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,200
and you can get funded.

1343
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,760
You know, we're joking about it, but that's kind of the reality

1344
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,600
is that some of the recent advancements

1345
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,080
that we've covered just as just topics of conversation

1346
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,400
in this show are now fundamental building blocks

1347
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,200
for entire businesses that are like getting VC funding

1348
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,600
and have a business model.

1349
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,280
And they're using namespaces in the Linux kernel, right?

1350
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,960
And it's not to say they're not legitimate

1351
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,760
because they are solving, in some cases,

1352
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,480
real business needs.

1353
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,280
It's just crazy walking around and seeing

1354
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,920
all these companies that don't even recognize the name

1355
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,360
because traditionally, going to these conferences

1356
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,160
for many years now, I've been going to these things

1357
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,720
even before JB when I was in high school, I started going.

1358
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,640
And that was an unfortunate long time ago.

1359
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,200
That was a while ago.

1360
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,200
And back in the day, it was a much more limited spread.

1361
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,240
You had some big names.

1362
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,840
You had the people you expected to see.

1363
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,320
Well, that's just it.

1364
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,360
So that was 18, 19 years ago.

1365
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:26,360
And through that time, really until just the last few years,

1366
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,920
it was company names you already knew.

1367
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,720
Every single company name you already knew.

1368
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,360
Now it's a whole bunch of new companies

1369
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,600
that are even possible.

1370
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,920
They're like micro companies because of the technology

1371
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,120
that they're based on.

1372
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,200
So we were walking around the floor

1373
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,360
and we bumped into Elon,

1374
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,760
who is one of the co-chairs of Scale.

1375
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,080
Elon Rubinovich.

1376
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,680
So I'm the conference chair for Scale

1377
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,600
and one of the co-founders.

1378
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,680
And I had a lot of things to talk to him about.

1379
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,440
We had a long-ranging conversation

1380
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,920
from where he thinks Linux is going in 2018.

1381
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,720
And I got the sense, he said something to me that struck me

1382
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,320
and that's what led to my next question.

1383
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,600
And he said, the core team of us here at Scale,

1384
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,240
we take vacation at work so that way we can go to work

1385
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,320
and work harder than we even work.

1386
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,160
Right.

1387
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,440
And I'm watching him run around

1388
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,680
and I'm looking at his schedule

1389
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,800
and in one hour from our conversation,

1390
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,240
the Expo Hall opens up.

1391
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,640
One hour immediately after that,

1392
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,680
they need to be out there taking the wrap off of the food

1393
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,020
that's in the middle of the Expo Hall.

1394
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,720
One hour after that, he needs to make sure

1395
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,240
that the event in the D room is so,

1396
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:30,120
like he just has like all of this stuff he's doing.

1397
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,840
Plus he was emailing back and forth

1398
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,200
with all of these companies, including Jupiter Broadcasting

1399
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,300
months before the event even kicks off,

1400
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,200
which he's doing on his own personal time.

1401
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,360
And he doesn't take a profit from any of this.

1402
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,920
He doesn't make a buck off this thing.

1403
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,520
I mean, he gets community stature

1404
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,440
and he gets connections and networking.

1405
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,880
But at the end of the day, he's doing it

1406
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,360
because he wants to and he loves it.

1407
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,280
Like that's very impressive.

1408
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,120
I'm like, is it that?

1409
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:51,960
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1410
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,780
Like, so what is it?

1411
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:53,620
What drives you?

1412
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:57,040
Is this your contribution to open source instead of code?

1413
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,200
So yeah, a lot of us are where we are in our careers

1414
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,160
because of where open source,

1415
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,640
because of how we were involved in open source

1416
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,480
in the early days.

1417
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,560
You know, my first time I needed Linux,

1418
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,120
we needed to share a home internet connection.

1419
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,400
And I was like, oh, somebody told me

1420
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,960
about this IP tables thing and IP chains, sorry,

1421
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,820
at the time and went to a local lug

1422
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,320
and got help from some, made a bunch of friends

1423
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,640
and they helped me at an install fest

1424
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,200
to like getting started in open source and Linux, right?

1425
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,000
And that was amazing.

1426
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,180
And then over the years I thought, well, how do I,

1427
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,120
you know, how do I give back?

1428
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,240
That like really kicked off my career

1429
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,280
and the career of a lot of folks here.

1430
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,620
And so being involved in community activities like this

1431
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,960
is one way of giving back.

1432
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,740
So whether it's the kids track that we run on Saturdays

1433
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,680
where we have folks from six all the way up to 18

1434
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,640
giving talks about how they use Linux at open source

1435
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,800
and start to get the next generation excited about STEM.

1436
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:52,120
Or it's the install, like we have a Linux new user,

1437
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,160
Linux training that's a full day session

1438
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,120
where you come in at the start of the day with a,

1439
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,320
basically it's a more organized install fest

1440
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,960
and we take you through, get your systems installed,

1441
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,940
train you all the way up,

1442
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,560
or even just the regular talks that we have.

1443
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,880
Like all of these are ways that people can get

1444
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,400
trained up on Linux and open source

1445
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,900
and further their own career.

1446
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,240
We have a very popular jobs board and jobs bop

1447
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,580
and you look around the room and most of the companies

1448
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,240
are recruiting in some way or another.

1449
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,040
So yeah, I think this is definitely a way to give back.

1450
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,680
I would say, I would also say that participation

1451
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,880
in open source is done, whether it's with scale

1452
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,840
or with other things has been very, very kind to me.

1453
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,240
Maybe I don't, you know, I don't take a salary

1454
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,400
from anything we do around scale or Texas Linux Fest

1455
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,980
or the other groups I'm involved with.

1456
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,500
But I would say, I don't think I would have,

1457
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,600
I've had any of my last two jobs if it wasn't for,

1458
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,040
you know, having done, having built the skills

1459
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,820
and the connections that I get to make

1460
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,120
as part of running something like this, so.

1461
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,880
And they really do hustle.

1462
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,820
That he mentioned in there really briefly,

1463
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,260
the birds of a feather session.

1464
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:57,440
These boffs are also something that has become

1465
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,800
a more and more common element of these events.

1466
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,840
I really started seeing them become a common element

1467
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,500
in the BSD meetups.

1468
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,340
The BSD community started doing these

1469
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,300
and I saw it kind of quickly spread from there

1470
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,200
to the Linux community and one of the places I saw it

1471
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,240
actually come from BSD to the Linux community

1472
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,720
was at Linux Fest Northwest, surprisingly enough.

1473
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,520
And now almost all of these events

1474
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,680
are doing these boff sessions.

1475
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,920
And it's, the idea is, I'll give you an example.

1476
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,960
So you might know Randall Schwartz from Floss Weekly

1477
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,860
on the Twit network.

1478
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,000
He's there and he and I were chatting

1479
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
and we were talking about what else but Perl and Dart.

1480
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,720
And so we started going back and forth about Perl and Dart

1481
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,800
and he started saying, yeah, you know what I'm doing

1482
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,040
is I'm doing a birds of feather session on Dart.

1483
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,440
So if you want to learn more, just come here

1484
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,920
and we're just other people that are working on Dart.

1485
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,360
We're just getting together and we're just hanging out

1486
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,200
and talking about Dart.

1487
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,440
And they sit around for two hours and they build stuff

1488
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,420
and they fix stuff and they debate stuff

1489
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:49,040
and these are becoming more and more common.

1490
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,160
And they're kind of a cool unplanned aspect

1491
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,320
that's sort of organically grown up in these conferences

1492
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,320
that don't require like somebody to put together

1493
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,820
a whole stack of presentations and propose a letter

1494
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,380
where they recommend what they want to talk,

1495
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,800
where they suggest what they want to talk about

1496
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,800
and get accepted.

1497
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,640
It's just simple.

1498
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,720
Low maintenance, easy going.

1499
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,640
And you probably find people who are actually

1500
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,480
just as passionate.

1501
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,040
There's so much to like at these conferences.

1502
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,620
You can find zero in on some people

1503
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,680
who are excited about what you are.

1504
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,680
Yeah, so it was nice to go.

1505
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,520
I'm glad we went.

1506
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,000
It also makes me look forward to Linux Fest Northwest

1507
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,840
where we'll be there.

1508
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,620
We're thinking about maybe trying to do a live show

1509
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,460
from there.

1510
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:26,020
We're kind of getting all that kind of worked out still.

1511
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,380
But yeah, I really had a great time

1512
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,480
and it did seem like they were definitely

1513
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,440
trying to make a contribution back to open source

1514
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,600
doing that.

1515
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,880
So many things, so many events to go to every year.

1516
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,360
And I understand not everybody can go

1517
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,080
and not everybody has an excuse to go like I do.

1518
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,920
But if you can make it, it will sort of change,

1519
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,760
it'll change you a little bit.

1520
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,280
It really reifies what the community is.

1521
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,880
We spend so much time on all these open source apps

1522
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,640
around IRC and all of that's awesome.

1523
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,320
But seeing people face to face

1524
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,920
and getting the sense of just how excited they are

1525
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,880
and how nice everyone is, it's totally different.

1526
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,720
Yeah, yeah.

1527
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,660
Putting a face to the disembodied voice.

1528
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,500
There we go.

1529
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,320
Yeah, it is.

1530
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,420
You know, it is like you get to check in with people.

1531
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,380
Like, you know, William's often in the mumble room

1532
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:07,220
and William was there.

1533
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:08,300
So we got to hang out with William.

1534
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,920
He got to hang out with Levi.

1535
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,080
William got to hang out with Levi as well.

1536
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:11,920
That's awesome.

1537
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,160
Yeah, he was Levi approved as a matter of fact.

1538
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,320
So that's always pretty good, you know,

1539
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,960
put names to faces like Geek Dad in the chat room.

1540
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,720
And yeah, and it just is, it's a rare chance

1541
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,320
to get to talk to a bunch of like-minded folks

1542
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,400
about stuff that everybody's really excited about.

1543
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,440
And you get to do it without the internet drama

1544
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,600
or the internet angst that all conversations

1545
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,520
seem to have now online.

1546
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,040
Now all of that's gone when you meet somebody in person.

1547
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,400
You know, like my favorite story I've shared it before

1548
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,600
is Ryan who, tech helper, he's known as tech helper.

1549
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:46,600
And he was not my biggest fan initially.

1550
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,840
And we met up in person and we became friends.

1551
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,040
And two years ago, he let me borrow his Cadillac

1552
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,240
when we went to scale.

1553
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,520
So that way I had transportation

1554
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,760
because I brought Lady Joops

1555
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,080
and I had to park it away from the conference.

1556
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,760
And this year, just without even asking him,

1557
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,280
because I was just crazy busy.

1558
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,120
I was doing all this stuff without even saying a word.

1559
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,800
The guy sends me a telegram out of the blue and says,

1560
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,400
hey, would you like to borrow my car again?

1561
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,240
That's wild.

1562
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,120
And it's like, you know, go from somebody who's like,

1563
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,680
yeah, kind of a troll to now like,

1564
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:17,760
hey, would you like to borrow my car?

1565
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,920
Because we meet in person.

1566
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,800
And I guess I just, I can't put enough emphasis

1567
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,280
on this one really kind of cliche point.

1568
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,680
And that is meeting people in person

1569
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,080
is completely, totally different than meeting them online.

1570
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,880
Online, we have these two-dimensional personas

1571
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,960
that we put out there.

1572
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,000
And then we interact with these two-dimensional personas.

1573
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,200
When I first started getting on the internet

1574
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,940
and you had to dial up and connect to it,

1575
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,800
you connected with a handle, a name,

1576
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,680
a screen name or a nickname.

1577
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,280
And so nothing had my name attached to it

1578
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,760
and nothing had your name attached to it.

1579
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,300
And so things just weren't quite as serious

1580
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,200
because it wasn't coming from a real person

1581
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,480
with their name and identity attached to it.

1582
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,760
It was from some anonymous douchebag on the internet.

1583
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,360
And so it didn't quite matter as much.

1584
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,400
But now with social networking

1585
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,640
and all these other platforms,

1586
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,440
we're all using our real names.

1587
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,200
We all have our real faces on there.

1588
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,760
And so now it's Chris Fisher and Donald Trump.

1589
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,900
It's like these real people

1590
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,360
that are making these statements on these.

1591
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,280
And so we take these statements so much more seriously.

1592
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,320
But there's still these two-dimensional, low context,

1593
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:33,320
low information statements that we interpret so much

1594
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,020
and trigger our own emotional baggage.

1595
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:37,880
And it creates this total hostile dialogue online.

1596
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,280
And then you add in the total dumpster fuel fire

1597
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:46,160
that is clickbait journalism and ad-based clicks

1598
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,000
that just really make

1599
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,040
for a horrible, horrible hostile discussion online.

1600
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,600
And you just bypass all of that

1601
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,600
when you meet up with people in person.

1602
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,000
All that baggage is gone.

1603
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,840
And it's just-

1604
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,660
Wait, are you saying

1605
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:02,280
you don't take seriously Captain Snorlax?

1606
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,160
That's one person you always take seriously.

1607
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,300
Okay, cool.

1608
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,400
Says the guy with the handle called Rotten.

1609
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,120
Or my nickname?

1610
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,320
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

1611
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,580
Although one person I always take quite seriously is Popey.

1612
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:16,420
Hello, Popey.

1613
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,240
Hello.

1614
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,080
It's good to see you.

1615
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:18,900
How are you?

1616
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:19,740
Good, good.

1617
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:20,560
We've missed you.

1618
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,400
We've missed you.

1619
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,520
I missed you at scale, but I'm glad you're here.

1620
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,760
Yeah, sorry I couldn't make that.

1621
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,800
I may be hanging out with your better half soon though.

1622
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,640
So that'll be good.

1623
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,460
That'll be fun.

1624
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,560
Yeah, I'm tracking his flight.

1625
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,400
He's nearly landed.

1626
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,320
He's gonna be there soon.

1627
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,320
So that's not confidential.

1628
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,640
We can say that he's-

1629
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,480
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1630
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,080
Yeah, Wimpy's landing in Seattle

1631
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,120
probably in the next few minutes, actually.

1632
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:41,960
That's so exciting.

1633
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,780
Yeah, yeah.

1634
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,840
I don't think, he's gonna be too busy to come on the show,

1635
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,960
but I'm gonna try to run down there

1636
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,440
and buy him a beer at least, or 10,

1637
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,680
because how often does Popey or Wimpy

1638
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:52,760
actually make it to our area?

1639
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,600
Well, it turns out more often than you'd expect.

1640
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,280
Twice in the last month, weirdly.

1641
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,120
Wow.

1642
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:03,680
But, and that's probably just a limited time thing,

1643
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,800
so I gotta take advantage of it while we can.

1644
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,200
Yeah, well, Popey, you have anything to share

1645
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,360
at the class before we get out of here today?

1646
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,200
I was just about to wrap this thing up.

1647
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,700
Michael Sunnell Rotten is a lovely person.

1648
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:15,880
That's all I've got to share.

1649
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,960
Okay, I agree.

1650
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,000
Yeah. I agree.

1651
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,600
Oh, hey, actually, Ubuntu Podcast is back.

1652
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,360
Could share that, do a little plug skis.

1653
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,480
Ubuntu Podcast returned and just had Will Cook on the show.

1654
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,320
Yes, we did.

1655
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,280
That's something.

1656
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:32,280
We discussed the things that are happening for 1804,

1657
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,360
some of the decisions that were made,

1658
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,760
and some of the controversial things

1659
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,600
that people have been talking about on the internet.

1660
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,800
We would discuss that in episode two,

1661
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,640
and turns out, episode three and four,

1662
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,240
we just had Michael Sunnell on.

1663
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,080
Oh.

1664
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:44,920
Whoa.

1665
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,040
See, it's a circle of plugs there.

1666
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,760
A circle of podcasts.

1667
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,600
Yeah, right?

1668
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,420
Yeah.

1669
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,320
Well, good, that's awesome.

1670
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,520
I look forward to hearing that.

1671
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,520
And the nice thing is, you know,

1672
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,880
there's a pretty good chance then

1673
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,000
when producer Michael goes on,

1674
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,920
he's gonna have good audio.

1675
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,080
So that's nice too.

1676
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:00,920
I always appreciate that.

1677
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,240
I typically do, yes.

1678
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,080
Yeah, you do.

1679
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,320
You do.

1680
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,520
I don't have a soundboard with a ding in it,

1681
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,360
but I would, if I did, I would.

1682
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,200
There we go.

1683
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,040
You just gotta get a bell.

1684
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:10,860
There it is.

1685
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:11,700
I'll just get you a bell.

1686
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,540
I should just get you a bell.

1687
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:13,360
Nothing beats the hard copy.

1688
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,200
Yeah.

1689
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,960
I do like having the physical bell right here,

1690
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:16,960
and so do the kids.

1691
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,840
It's a hit with the kids when they come into the studio.

1692
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,020
They always gotta play with dad's bell.

1693
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:21,860
Wait a minute.

1694
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,760
All right, well, let's get out of here while we still can,

1695
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,600
because I just think that just went in a bad direction.

1696
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,080
You guys, thank you very much for being here.

1697
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,680
We'd love to have you join us in the Mamba Room.

1698
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,920
Go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

1699
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,140
for when we do this here show live,

1700
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,800
because it's true, it's a live production.

1701
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,640
It's one of the few, so why not get in while it's still live?

1702
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,480
Yeah, savor it.

1703
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,960
Yeah.

1704
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,000
And you can get more Mumble information

1705
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,240
if you go on irc.geekshed.net.

1706
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,720
Do bang Mumble, and it'll give you the server information

1707
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,720
so you can hang out in our virtual lug.

1708
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,880
You can submit content ideas to linuxunplug.reddit.com,

1709
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,640
and of course, go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact,

1710
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,320
and keep an eye out for those feed changes.

1711
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,920
Maybe new things coming.

1712
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,280
Lots happening.

1713
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,160
And just a few more episodes of Tech Talk Today

1714
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,920
for season one, techtalk.today,

1715
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,220
and go get more Wes and Chris, techsnap.systems.

1716
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,200
See you next week.

1717
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,040
Bye.

1718
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:45,960
And we'll see you next week.

1719
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:50,080
Wimpy is currently traveling 536 miles per hour

1720
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,560
with a Wi-Fi connection.

1721
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,200
Isn't that amazing?

1722
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,600
He's had a decent-ish connection this whole flight,

1723
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,440
because I've seen him in Telegram the whole time.

1724
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,160
So I know he's got at least some Wi-Fi.

1725
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,600
What a time to live.

1726
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,800
Yeah, it really is.

1727
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,640
This is pretty great.

1728
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,440
Look at this.

1729
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,760
And I wonder how expensive that Wi-Fi is, too.

1730
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,600
Look at this, you can retrace the whole flight.

1731
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,480
Oh, that is neat.

1732
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,160
This is great.

1733
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,080
That is really cool.

1734
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,080
There's a little bit where they estimated where the flight was,

1735
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,280
where apparently Wimpy went offline for a bit.

1736
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:24,200
And then he reconnects as he comes in over Canada.

1737
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,400
Hey, how's my audio now?

1738
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:25,840
Much better.

1739
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,640
So what were you trying to tell us earlier?

1740
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:30,640
Well, I was trying to tell you what I ended up doing,

1741
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,400
because I have bookshelves full of CDs.

1742
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,200
When I downsized to the trailer, I

1743
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,280
had to put all of that in storage.

1744
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:41,600
So I put it all in a tub, basically a tote.

1745
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,760
But before I did, I ripped everything onto a one terabyte

1746
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,080
hard drive, which is being straight from Plex.

1747
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,520
Yeah, I was thinking about Plex.

1748
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:54,480
So that's the direction I went, but I hardly ever use it

1749
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,360
because I use Spotify all the time.

1750
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:56,840
Sure.

1751
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,440
Oh, that old story.

1752
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,720
Oh, no, if there's a reason to repair all of your CDs

1753
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,120
and stuff, it's legitimately to try

1754
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,920
to get software to do gender recognition

1755
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:12,520
and actually try to make some choices for you.

1756
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:16,920
There's actually a piece of open source software,

1757
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,800
which I've been using for you, and trying

1758
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,000
to make it so that it can become a recommendation

1759
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,320
system for new music.

1760
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:28,240
So I'll let the bot go to YouTube.

1761
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,880
Yeah, you know, I won't lie.

1762
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,800
You've honed in on one of the things

1763
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,680
that I do kind of use these services for

1764
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,680
is to find me new music, because I don't really

1765
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,400
put a very high priority on music.

1766
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,960
I also am not actively discovering new music

1767
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,400
like I used to.

1768
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,400
And so the fact that these things have some kind

1769
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,200
of algorithm to try to surface music is nice.

1770
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,840
JBtitles.com.

1771
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,520
Last FM does that pretty well.

1772
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,360
Yeah, yeah.

1773
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,520
So does Pandora.

1774
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:57,920
If you start to put your music list on Last FM,

1775
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,840
you normally get good recommendations.

1776
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,680
You just have to squabble your music.

1777
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,800
I wish it was back in a few.

1778
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,080
Import a list or something.

1779
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,520
That would be great, because I don't

1780
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,320
like listening to the streaming services.

1781
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,160
I'd rather have it on.

1782
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,760
I'd rather have local media.

1783
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:14,160
And then give me some suggestions off of this list

1784
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,000
of artists.

1785
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,080
Wouldn't it be great?

1786
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,200
And here's the thing.

1787
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,000
If you really enjoy listening to music

1788
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,920
and really hate when you get interrupted,

1789
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,280
at least keep some of them locally,

1790
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,960
because there's always going to be that one moment where

1791
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,400
you're going to be absolutely bored of not having local stuff.

1792
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,840
If you'd like to have 30 minutes of no ads,

1793
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,080
just watch this video.

1794
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,600
Seriously.

1795
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,520
It's a 30-second ad to get you to watch another ad.

1796
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,520
The other thing about the streaming services

1797
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:48,000
that's sort of like a sucky, secondary, first-world problem

1798
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,680
is it's kind of like a shit show,

1799
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,080
like how they all integrate with different devices

1800
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:57,480
and like TV set-top boxes, lady tubes,

1801
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,960
all these different things.

1802
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,480
Some of them work with Spotify if you

1803
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,160
use this particular incantation.

1804
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,640
Some of them work with Google Music.

1805
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,880
Some of them work with Pandora.

1806
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,320
Some of them work with Amazon streaming music

1807
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,520
if you use a different incantation.

1808
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,360
It's really kind of all over the place.

1809
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:12,840
It really is.

1810
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,520
Yeah, right.

1811
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,280
By the way, Chris, I'm not sure if you'll want this.

1812
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,000
I can link it to the project I was talking

1813
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,480
about, the general recognition project.

1814
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,320
Sure, yeah.

1815
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,320
Yeah, if that's a thing, I'd like to see it.

1816
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,360
Put it in there if you don't mind, toss it in the IRC

1817
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:27,120
so that other guys can see it, too.

1818
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:30,600
By the way, related topic in regards to Linux,

1819
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,840
well, Linux on mobile being Android at the moment,

1820
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:36,360
what do you think Android P is going to be?

1821
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:39,640
Well, it sounds like it's so far a UI overhaul, a lot

1822
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,680
of small UI overhauls.

1823
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:41,640
No, I mean the name.

1824
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,000
Did you guys notice that all the UI elements

1825
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,480
are basically Fuchsia OS?

1826
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,160
Yes.

1827
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,000
Yeah.

1828
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:47,960
Yeah.

1829
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,080
I thought that I had that same thought.

1830
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:51,960
Oh, name?

1831
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,960
Stratum.

1832
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,040
What's something that P?

1833
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,660
I bet it's going to be not a sweetie.

1834
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,120
I think it's going to be like a healthy thing.

1835
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,480
I think they're going to be the laziest thing ever.

1836
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:00,960
Pancreas.

1837
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:06,720
Because all of their stuff has been desserts or pastries.

1838
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,160
It's just going to be pastry.

1839
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,680
Oh, they're just going to call it Android pastry?

1840
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,400
No, no, that's too generic.

1841
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,080
That wouldn't be Google.

1842
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,000
I think they're going to drop the sweets parfait.

1843
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,280
Parfait is also really good.

1844
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,200
I like parfait.

1845
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,160
That's good.

1846
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,240
That's good.

1847
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:28,480
I'm going to say pudding because I hope it's Android pudding.

1848
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,640
I hope it's Android pudding.
