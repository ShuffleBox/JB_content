WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
No, Ike's laughing at it. Well, why are you laughing, Ike? Why are you laughing?

00:04.800 --> 00:05.800
Why am I laughing?

00:05.800 --> 00:06.800
Yeah, you're laughing at us about-

00:06.800 --> 00:07.800
Upgrade conflict.

00:07.800 --> 00:08.800
Yeah, upgrade conflict.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.800
You have package conflicts.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.600
Yeah, yeah. Why is that funny?

00:11.600 --> 00:17.000
I'm the whole PC Master Race peasant laugh now because I don't have package conflicts.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
So for me, this is hilarious. This is all the reasons why Solus exists.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.600
How can Solus never have a package conflict? How is that possible? How can you never have

00:25.600 --> 00:26.600
a package-

00:26.600 --> 00:29.660
Because nothing is allowed to conflict with another package in the Solus. You have a single

00:29.660 --> 00:36.200
provider of a thing that does a thing. You don't have 15 different JPEG turbos or alternate

00:36.200 --> 00:43.360
versions of them. You pick one and you build to use that. So to me, I find this hilarious.

00:43.360 --> 00:45.480
These are the problems that Solus set out to solve.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.480
You bastard.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.480
So-

00:47.480 --> 00:48.480
How dare you?

00:48.480 --> 00:49.480
How dare you?

00:49.480 --> 00:50.480
I'm enjoying this so much.

00:50.480 --> 00:58.880
The audacity there. All right, so you're telling me that I never- How can that be? How can

00:58.880 --> 01:06.160
you have a diverse package? How can you have all the kinds of applications I want and never

01:06.160 --> 01:11.680
run into conflicts? Simply the reason, it just seems simply because at a certain point

01:11.680 --> 01:15.240
at scale, you have so many different software developers that are targeting so many different

01:15.240 --> 01:19.300
libraries or certain dependencies that it's just unavoidable.

01:19.300 --> 01:25.260
We don't let them in. You know how for RPM packages you have package conflict build dependencies.

01:25.260 --> 01:29.940
We have that in Solus as well. We only allow a single provider of a package conflict name

01:29.940 --> 01:35.380
in the repos. Like when we set out, this has been since day one. You may only have a single

01:35.380 --> 01:40.640
provider of a given sole name, a given provider of a package conflict name. It does not enter

01:40.640 --> 01:45.640
the repo. If your file conflicts or any one of those issues, it's just not allowed to

01:45.640 --> 01:46.640
do it.

01:46.640 --> 01:51.320
For when we're renaming packages on an update, which we've done before, we have a mechanism

01:51.320 --> 01:55.480
called obsolete. The first thing that happens when you update is the obsolete package is

01:55.480 --> 02:00.120
automatically removed. If there's one that replaces it, that's set to replace it. It's

02:00.120 --> 02:05.640
allowed to path conflict during that update. It's already configured to handle that. During

02:05.640 --> 02:09.480
that, it knows the other package is being removed. It knows this one is coming in. It

02:09.480 --> 02:13.560
automatically ignores certain files while it's letting that happen because only one

02:13.560 --> 02:18.960
package is allowed to provide those set of files and it's set to replace it.

02:18.960 --> 02:27.320
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 172 for November 22nd, 2016.

02:27.320 --> 02:40.640
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that might be slightly inebriated

02:40.640 --> 02:44.920
from some prerecordings that were happening earlier today. My name is Chris.

02:44.920 --> 02:45.920
My name is Wes.

02:45.920 --> 02:49.720
And I cannot confirm or deny these baseless claims by the chat room.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.880
Baseless. Come on, guys. No faith in us.

02:51.880 --> 02:52.880
Either way, we're here.

02:52.880 --> 02:53.880
We know us too well.

02:53.880 --> 02:57.480
We've got a great episode lined up for you coming up on this week's episode of the show,

02:57.480 --> 03:02.600
Our Fresh Impressions of Fedora 25 and the man steering that project, Mr. Matt, will

03:02.600 --> 03:06.400
join us to discuss the new release. And later on in the show, we'll get an update from

03:06.400 --> 03:11.980
Ubicon. We'll talk about a new potential Linux appliance that could save the day. Then later

03:11.980 --> 03:19.880
on, not only will we get the inside dope on how System76 got the Ubuntu desktop tweaked

03:19.880 --> 03:25.440
to support 4K, but let's discuss the modification. I'm using that.

03:25.440 --> 03:26.440
Strong word.

03:26.440 --> 03:31.680
I'm coining that. But let's talk about the world where we have Surface Books, Surface

03:31.680 --> 03:38.760
Studios, MacBook Touch Bars, mobile, tablets, the hardware, the software, the platform.

03:38.760 --> 03:45.880
It's all created by one vendor, and it's getting harder and harder to get Linux on these systems.

03:45.880 --> 03:51.040
What is the solution here? And is there a long term problem as general X86 vendors become

03:51.040 --> 03:56.800
less and less incentivized to participate in the PC business? Is there going to be less

03:56.800 --> 04:01.440
and less hardware that Linux can run on out of the box? We'll discuss that and what some

04:01.440 --> 04:06.280
of the potential solutions could be for that. And then towards the end of the show, I want

04:06.280 --> 04:11.840
to talk about benchmarking the feel of it. I'm talking about that feel when you drag

04:11.840 --> 04:16.720
the window across the screen, that feel when you're accessing files on your hard drive

04:16.720 --> 04:20.640
and loading programs and you're still using your system and opening menus, the way it

04:20.640 --> 04:25.240
feels when a program launches and snaps up. How do you benchmark that feel? Well, Aiki

04:25.240 --> 04:29.680
is joining us from the Solus Project, and I get a good sense that you think about the

04:29.680 --> 04:30.680
way things feel a lot.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.380
I get that feeling too.

04:32.380 --> 04:37.380
And so we'll get a little input from him and the rest of our virtual lug on how you benchmark

04:37.380 --> 04:41.360
the feel of something. Because I'll tell you what, Wes. In the back of my mind, I'm working

04:41.360 --> 04:46.200
on a project. I'm working on a long term project. So before we go any further, we got to do

04:46.200 --> 04:50.360
our duty. We got to bring in that mumble room. Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug. Hello,

04:50.360 --> 04:51.360
guys.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.360
Hello.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.360
Hello.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.360
Hello.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.360
I love that.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.360
Whoa!

04:56.360 --> 05:00.220
Jeez, that was a lot. Hello, guys. Jeez, I get back and that it is good. It is good

05:00.220 --> 05:01.220
to be.

05:01.220 --> 05:02.220
I think they missed you too.

05:02.220 --> 05:05.040
I think they missed me too, because when I was listening on the road, I wanted to constantly

05:05.040 --> 05:10.880
jump in. I was like, let me, I got to, oh, wait, no, I can't. And I actually, I apologize.

05:10.880 --> 05:17.200
I did try to remote in, only I was double-natted. And I did what I never want people to do.

05:17.200 --> 05:23.000
And I connected in over a double-nat, and it sounded like crap. So I apologize to everybody

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
for that.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
But you tried.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.600
I did want to give my input so badly. It was painful. But it was also fun to listen to,

05:28.600 --> 05:33.140
even though Noah sounded like death warmed over. It was pretty bad. But we have so much

05:33.140 --> 05:37.680
to get into. And I'm going to give a little plugsy. I digged, I was just telling Wes before

05:37.680 --> 05:42.760
the show started that I went down to meet BSD, because I've gone to a lot of, just,

05:42.760 --> 05:47.240
I don't know, all of the big Linux events that I kind of ever wanted to go to, except

05:47.240 --> 05:48.800
You've been there, seen that.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.640
Except for the ones that are outside the US. That's still on my bucket list. But the ones

05:51.640 --> 05:56.200
inside the US, I've pretty much checked off all of those boxes. And I've really gotten

05:56.200 --> 06:01.400
a feel for what it's like for community-run events and big commercial events and everything

06:01.400 --> 06:08.120
in between. So I wanted to see what it was like when the BSD cousins got together.

06:08.120 --> 06:13.840
What is the other side like? And so, during last week, I was off in Berkeley, California,

06:13.840 --> 06:19.020
the home of BSD. I figured, like, if this was ever the time, go back to where BSD lives,

06:19.020 --> 06:23.760
see where BSD was born, see how the other side lives, get experience in that. And I

06:23.760 --> 06:29.680
thought I'd go down there, and I thought I'd create two videos. I thought I'd come back

06:29.680 --> 06:34.620
and in 172, you and I would be listening to a couple of BSD keynotes, and we'd be discussing

06:34.620 --> 06:39.560
the things that the speaker said, and just a couple clips. Yeah. So I got down there,

06:39.560 --> 06:46.520
and I thought, wow, turns out I've got four videos. And then I got back, and I said, wow,

06:46.520 --> 06:51.920
it turns out I have got six videos. I think on Sunday, even, on the Linux Action Show,

06:51.920 --> 06:58.400
I said, six videos are going to be released, one a day next, starting the week after Thanksgiving.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.280
And then now I'm sitting here on Tuesday. So just two days later, I'm like, actually,

07:01.280 --> 07:05.960
I've got eight videos, eight videos, that I'll be releasing on my personal channel,

07:05.960 --> 07:10.120
because they're not all technical in nature. Sure. They're more like behind the scenes

07:10.120 --> 07:15.800
Jupiter broadcasting stuff, the experience, yeah. YouTube.com slash C slash Chris Fisher,

07:15.800 --> 07:20.880
that's my name. And starting next Monday, I'll release one a day for, so far, eight

07:20.880 --> 07:23.920
days. I think I'm, I don't know. I'm going to see how far I can get. See when it stops.

07:23.920 --> 07:27.440
I got a lot more stuff shot, because Noah was here in town, and we were doing a bunch

07:27.440 --> 07:31.880
of stuff, so I just kept the cameras rolling when I got back. So we'll see how far I get

07:31.880 --> 07:35.560
before I just get totally overwhelmed with all the other work. But that'll start coming

07:35.560 --> 07:41.360
out next week. YouTube.com slash C slash Chris Fisher, that's my name, if you want to see

07:41.360 --> 07:45.880
the videos from that. So it was a good experience. It was a lot of fun. But let's talk about

07:45.880 --> 07:49.000
Linux. You want to talk about Linux, Wes? Yeah, always. Do you like talking about Linux?

07:49.000 --> 07:55.920
Because I thought maybe we could talk about Linux. Let's do it. This is CNN Breaking News.

07:55.920 --> 08:01.720
As we record today's episode of the Unplugged program, Fedora 25 has been released. The

08:01.720 --> 08:07.040
latest and greatest from the Fedora project. And the guy that runs that Fedora project

08:07.040 --> 08:12.920
is joining us. Matt, welcome back to Linux Unplugged. It's great to have you here. Thanks.

08:12.920 --> 08:17.200
It's great to be back. So first of all, before we go any further, congratulations on the

08:17.200 --> 08:24.440
new release. Always awesome to see a new Fedora released. And I know when I think of Fedora

08:24.440 --> 08:29.360
25, what I think of is Wayland by default. Is that really what I should be thinking of?

08:29.360 --> 08:32.320
And what else are you thinking of when you think of specifically like the workstation

08:32.320 --> 08:37.080
release and some of the other versions? Yeah, so I think Wayland by default is definitely

08:37.080 --> 08:41.440
the big story on the workstation release. That's something that the graphics and desktop

08:41.440 --> 08:47.400
teams have been working to for a long time. So it's very cool to finally have that. You

08:47.400 --> 08:52.600
know, GNOME 3.22 is a nice release as well. And I think there's kind of an understated

08:52.600 --> 08:58.120
story there as well, because in the beginning of GNOME 3, each update was kind of rough

08:58.120 --> 09:04.720
as sort of the initial ideas of GNOME 3 got kind of polished and they hit the real world

09:04.720 --> 09:10.280
and kind of responded to feedback. But it's kind of gotten to where it's really gotten

09:10.280 --> 09:15.420
into its groove. And so one of the things that we kind of identified as a feature here

09:15.420 --> 09:20.240
is that your shell extensions are probably expected to just keep working now if you have

09:20.240 --> 09:27.800
anything that like puts the top icons up on the bar. Because basically, the shell is not

09:27.800 --> 09:33.320
expected to change so much that it's likely to break those things. I'm excited about that

09:33.320 --> 09:38.600
as well. Yeah, and I feel like that has been getting better over the last few releases.

09:38.600 --> 09:44.280
So as a project, you know, I noticed that immediately now, there is a post by Justin

09:44.280 --> 09:51.880
on upgrading from Fedora 24 to Fedora 25. How official is this as a process as a project

09:51.880 --> 09:57.840
upgrading from one release to another now? Oh, yeah, absolutely official. So it's definitely

09:57.840 --> 10:02.840
especially, it's been something I've been working on for over the last couple releases.

10:02.840 --> 10:10.080
So actually, I noticed somebody in your channel asking for Fedora LTS. And I've heard other

10:10.080 --> 10:14.560
people talking about a rolling release. And sometimes it's the same person that says

10:14.560 --> 10:19.560
Fedora should either be an LTS or a rolling release, which is weird, because those are

10:19.560 --> 10:28.120
very different in what you get from that. And so when I when I ask, 90% of the time,

10:28.120 --> 10:34.600
what people mean is, upgrades suck, they're painful, and things break, and it takes a

10:34.600 --> 10:39.960
long time after basically give up three days to upgrade. And so I can't run Fedora because

10:39.960 --> 10:45.600
I can't afford to block out three days every six months. Right. And as much as we tell

10:45.600 --> 10:50.240
people, really, you've got 13 months, just once a year, it still doesn't doesn't resonate

10:50.240 --> 10:56.360
very well. So we really worked on making the upgrades go more smoothly. So first, we had

10:56.360 --> 11:02.240
FedUp, which is a name that I really loved, you know, Fedora upgrade FedUp. And you can

11:02.240 --> 11:07.560
actually still run the new DNF system upgrade as FedUp, which I do myself, because it's

11:07.560 --> 11:13.320
the best. But yeah, so this new DNF based system upgrade uses basically the same system

11:13.320 --> 11:19.940
D based offline updates that the GNOME software updates do. And so the nice thing about it,

11:19.940 --> 11:25.040
it's really fast, like I was shocked, I upgraded my system in under half an hour when I went

11:25.040 --> 11:29.280
to do the upgrade. And some of that was just like waiting for it to download, I could still

11:29.280 --> 11:33.440
do things. So really, like, click the button, go out for coffee, come back and you have

11:33.440 --> 11:39.120
the new release. So are you delaying or doing some sort of rollout for the notification

11:39.120 --> 11:42.840
for those that are going to use the GNOME software? Or is it just when their distro

11:42.840 --> 11:49.200
checks in on the repo? It's when it checks in. And I think someone on Reddit, we figured

11:49.200 --> 11:53.240
out that it does that daily. I wasn't actually quite sure what the thing was. So it should

11:53.240 --> 11:58.200
basically hit all at once. We've got a pretty extensive mirror network. So I think that

11:58.200 --> 12:00.920
should be okay.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.440
So I'm looking forward to it. I've got it in. Well, I actually I attempted to install

12:04.440 --> 12:09.520
it, I was going to throw down a challenge to Wes, are you? Wes, are you ready for a

12:09.520 --> 12:10.520
challenge?

12:10.520 --> 12:12.520
Oh, there we go. Much better.

12:12.520 --> 12:21.760
So contained on this red 16 gigabyte Toshiba USB 3.0 flash drive is Fedora 25 workstation.

12:21.760 --> 12:26.160
I was gonna say no, but since it's USB 3.0, yes. Those are fair terms, Chris. Those are

12:26.160 --> 12:27.360
fair terms. I'll do it.

12:27.360 --> 12:31.360
Wes, behind you is the Entryware Apollo.

12:31.360 --> 12:34.040
A fine rig, if ever there was one.

12:34.040 --> 12:39.800
It was just recently running Ubuntu Mate 16.10 perfectly. So why not replace that with Fedora

12:39.800 --> 12:46.440
25? However, I attempted to install earlier today in preparation of this very show, Wes.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.080
I take it it did not go well.

12:48.080 --> 12:59.600
After reboot, nothing happened. Dead. Now you are clear and free to wipe all hard drives.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.600
Okay, okay.

13:00.600 --> 13:01.600
Redo all the loads.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.160
To purge all the mistakes Chris has made here.

13:03.160 --> 13:07.880
Your challenge, if you choose to accept it, is before the end of the show have a working

13:07.880 --> 13:13.720
Fedora 25 installation on the Apollo Entryware behind you plugged in currently.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.280
Do you accept the challenge, sir?

13:15.280 --> 13:16.280
Yes, I do.

13:16.280 --> 13:19.520
Oh, all right. Then here you go. I issue you your thumb drive.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.000
Last drive accepted.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Awesome.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.840
Good luck. All right. That'll be my review machine right there if I get it working. Because

13:28.840 --> 13:33.520
it's got the Intel graphics, so I should be able to do Gnome 3 and Wayland out of the

13:33.520 --> 13:34.520
box, right?

13:34.520 --> 13:35.520
Yeah, absolutely.

13:35.520 --> 13:40.200
I'm looking forward to that. So that'll be my test machine. One of my test machines at

13:40.200 --> 13:41.200
least.

13:41.200 --> 13:46.320
Well, the other big thing I wanted to talk about, so we've had this Fedora Next thing

13:46.320 --> 13:51.400
for the last couple of years, which is basically thinking about what we're doing on purpose

13:51.400 --> 13:55.560
rather than just continuing to keep doing what we've always done just because we do

13:55.560 --> 13:56.560
it.

13:56.560 --> 13:57.560
Well said.

13:57.560 --> 14:01.760
And one of the things we cited as part of that is to have these basically separate additions

14:01.760 --> 14:07.800
to address different use cases. So we've got the workstation, which is basically a technical

14:07.800 --> 14:13.920
user desktop with the caveat that technical users are people too, and so we wanted to

14:13.920 --> 14:20.200
be easy use. And then a server as well. And then the third thing we had was Fedora Cloud,

14:20.200 --> 14:25.620
which was kind of envisioned to be a platform for doing scale out cloud computing things.

14:25.620 --> 14:30.440
And I was hoping we would do SCL software collections on top of that. And for various

14:30.440 --> 14:36.560
reasons that didn't pan out very well. But meanwhile, containers came along and we had

14:36.560 --> 14:43.160
this ongoing revolution in how operating systems are put together. And so with Fedora 25, we've

14:43.160 --> 14:49.360
replaced Fedora Cloud with Fedora Atomic as one of our top level additions. And so Fedora

14:49.360 --> 14:50.360
Atomic is...

14:50.360 --> 14:55.000
Ah, okay. So I thought I was just getting confused. That makes a lot of sense. See,

14:55.000 --> 14:59.960
I thought I was just being silly. So now Fedora Atomic is one of the... Is it an addition

14:59.960 --> 15:01.960
or a flavor? What's the right vernacular?

15:01.960 --> 15:07.240
Yeah, addition is our official term. Flavors is more broad, so I include the additions

15:07.240 --> 15:08.640
and the spins and everything in the flavors.

15:08.640 --> 15:16.040
So is Fedora Atomic... When I think of a Project Atomic transactional update, so what is Fedora

15:16.040 --> 15:17.040
Atomic?

15:17.040 --> 15:22.520
Yeah, so Fedora Atomic is an implementation of Project Atomic, basically. So Project Atomic

15:22.520 --> 15:28.240
is kind of the theoretical umbrella. So there's RHEL Atomic and CentOS Atomic and Fedora Atomic.

15:28.240 --> 15:34.520
And so this is just like Fedora in general, a fast-moving upstream version of Atomic.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.520
A two-week release cycle?

15:36.520 --> 15:41.840
Absolutely. So it's based on the Fedora 25 base, but then there are updates every two

15:41.840 --> 15:45.360
weeks with new package sets and everything.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.900
Wow.

15:46.900 --> 15:53.560
And unlike most of Fedora, like you were talking about, you know, the 13-month life cycle...

15:53.560 --> 15:58.960
Sorry, I'm getting so excited I can't talk. Basically, we're only supporting the latest

15:58.960 --> 16:03.840
version of Atomic. So if there's a problem, it's update to the latest two-week thing.

16:03.840 --> 16:08.400
And now that Fedora 25 is out, we're not supporting the Fedora 24 Atomic at all.

16:08.400 --> 16:12.480
And just so I'm clear, the deal with Atomic is if I do an update in something borks, I

16:12.480 --> 16:17.160
can transactionally roll back, right? So it's lower risk, in a sense.

16:17.160 --> 16:23.560
Absolutely, yeah. So basically, it's kind of like Git for your operating system in a

16:23.560 --> 16:29.400
lot of the concepts. So basically, you can check out a certain point, and then that's

16:29.400 --> 16:31.240
what you have as your operating system.

16:31.240 --> 16:38.120
Slick. I like that. And then what do you mean when you say that Fedora will also offer a

16:38.120 --> 16:41.200
Docker-formatted base image? Is this...

16:41.200 --> 16:47.440
Yes. So we have... That basically means there's a Fedora Docker image that will be...

16:47.440 --> 16:49.440
That I can start with to create some... Ah, okay.

16:49.440 --> 16:53.960
It's what you get when you say, you know, Docker run Fedora, that's what you'll get.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.240
Neat. That sounds kind of fun to be with.

16:56.240 --> 17:00.880
And so we're actually also working on, and should be in production like literally any

17:00.880 --> 17:06.760
moment now, a thing where Fedora contributors can, using basically the same workflow that

17:06.760 --> 17:12.200
we use to create RPMs, create Docker images that are layered on top of that base using

17:12.200 --> 17:14.720
RPMs in the Fedora distro.

17:14.720 --> 17:21.180
Wow. Matt, that is some super great stuff. And it's interesting because it's sort of

17:21.180 --> 17:26.760
treating the Docker hub and all of that as just another distribution platform for Fedora.

17:26.760 --> 17:27.760
It's...

17:27.760 --> 17:32.240
Yeah, basically. And then, of course, people, you know, users can build on top of that to,

17:32.240 --> 17:36.360
you know, build their own applications and things they need. So that will be... Because

17:36.360 --> 17:44.080
with Atomic, you can, using basically a debug mode, install different RPMs directly onto

17:44.080 --> 17:50.000
your system. But basically, part of the trade off you get for having the Atomic updates

17:50.000 --> 17:56.160
is you get a system that is like, you know, the same image everywhere, which is also good

17:56.160 --> 18:00.200
for QA, but hard for like, how do I get my application onto here and actually do things?

18:00.200 --> 18:01.200
Right.

18:01.200 --> 18:04.360
And the answer is you do that in containers. Like the idea is the base should be small

18:04.360 --> 18:09.320
and minimal and not a bunch of custom stuff on it. And everything you do goes in a container.

18:09.320 --> 18:14.820
So the next step, obviously, is where do my containers come from? So that's the...

18:14.820 --> 18:20.280
That is exactly where it seems to be that the puck is going. I had... When I was gone

18:20.280 --> 18:28.060
last week, I met the gentleman that is in charge of all of the network storage for LinkedIn

18:28.060 --> 18:32.380
and also for one of the gentlemen that's in charge of all of the network infrastructure

18:32.380 --> 18:40.360
and services for Groupon, as well as one of the network engineers at Intel, and one of

18:40.360 --> 18:46.420
the guys that works at Level 3. And all of them, all of them were talking about using

18:46.420 --> 18:51.000
containers to host services that they use now. All of them. Even the ones that were

18:51.000 --> 18:55.320
there to talk about BSD and talk about... They were talking about using Jails, and when

18:55.320 --> 18:59.520
they weren't talking about their BSD systems, they're using containers on Linux. Not all

18:59.520 --> 19:01.440
of them are necessarily using Docker.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.440
Interesting.

19:02.440 --> 19:11.200
Yeah, but that is definitely where they're going. So I often think about, well, it seems

19:11.200 --> 19:15.760
like Canonical has a super strong presence here with Ubuntu. They've really been benefiting

19:15.760 --> 19:22.120
well here. I don't know how well SUSE is doing here, but it sounds like Fedora, with 25 especially,

19:22.120 --> 19:24.600
has a really solid answer here.

19:24.600 --> 19:29.780
We like to think so, yeah. And I think as we're going forward, I talked about Atomic

19:29.780 --> 19:34.480
and Workstation, but not very much about Server in this release. I think Fedora Server, this

19:34.480 --> 19:39.520
is kind of an incremental release here for Fedora Server. New versions of stuff, et cetera,

19:39.520 --> 19:44.320
et cetera. Some of the things highlighted in the release notes. But next release, we're

19:44.320 --> 19:50.880
actually going to put together a version of Server that is hopefully composed of different

19:50.880 --> 19:56.000
containers running a lot of the base services as an experimental version of it. So more

19:56.000 --> 20:00.640
of the stuff in containers. I think it's definitely the future of the operating system.

20:00.640 --> 20:07.960
Wow. Well, so Noah and I will be reviewing the Fedora 25 Workstation edition this Sunday.

20:07.960 --> 20:11.920
And Wes will get it installed here on the Apollo, I'm sure. I'm going to load it on

20:11.920 --> 20:16.080
a couple other machines. I'm really looking forward to trying it, especially because a

20:16.080 --> 20:22.400
few of my machines, I think, are Intel graphics. So the Wayland, just getting to try that out.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.480
And just even if it's not perfect, it's going to be exciting.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.480
So you want that smooth desktop.

20:26.480 --> 20:31.120
I do. I do. We'll talk about that more. But Wimpy, I was looking at the different features

20:31.120 --> 20:39.400
of Fedora 25. And one of the features that jumped out at me is in Fedora 25, Mate 1.16

20:39.400 --> 20:46.480
is available, which is the switch to GTK 3. What do you think about that? And what are

20:46.480 --> 20:50.960
your thoughts about how awesome it is right now that a current version of Fedora is able

20:50.960 --> 20:56.160
to ship Mate 1.16, and it's based on GTK 3. This seems like a big step forward just for

20:56.160 --> 20:58.600
the Mate platform in general. Do you agree?

20:58.600 --> 21:06.600
Yeah. So Wolfgang Albrecht is the Fedora maintainer for Mate, and he has done that work. And it

21:06.600 --> 21:12.880
was he and I and Mike Gabriel who got together earlier this year. So Mike Gabriel is a Debian

21:12.880 --> 21:19.760
developer. And the three of us got together and agreed we would land the GTK 3 version,

21:19.760 --> 21:26.320
solely the GTK 3 version in those three distros for the 1.16 release. So yeah, there's been

21:26.320 --> 21:32.040
several distros working towards that. And yeah, it's only because the Fedora release

21:32.040 --> 21:37.440
schedule was offset slightly from the Ubuntu release schedule that Ubuntu got there first.

21:37.440 --> 21:43.880
But we actually arrived with Mate 1.6 or GTK 3 at the same time. And then it was just as

21:43.880 --> 21:52.920
the release is landed. So when Debian 9 lands next year, that will be 1.16 as well, GTK

21:52.920 --> 21:54.920
3 only.

21:54.920 --> 22:01.040
That is so awesome for Mate, because once Debian 9 ships, everything major being on

22:01.040 --> 22:05.760
that release version, GTK 3 being available for all of them, is big for things. Because

22:05.760 --> 22:11.360
it's like GTK 3.20 too, right? So that means flat pack supports in there, but also like

22:11.360 --> 22:15.480
high DPI supports in there and all these other things, right?

22:15.480 --> 22:24.120
Yeah. And now the job at hand is to sort of polish that 1.16 release. So we've got Debian

22:24.120 --> 22:34.120
coming up with their release, and it will be an intensive bug squishing season now as

22:34.120 --> 22:37.200
that approaches to try and really shine it up.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.280
Do you have a cold wimpy?

22:39.280 --> 22:43.000
No, I have an empty bottle of wine in front of me.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Oh.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Much better.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.880
I was actually hoping you were going to say yes, because I mean not that I want you to

22:48.880 --> 22:55.920
be sick at all, but that was going to be my super smooth transition to Ubicon. And I thought

22:55.920 --> 22:58.960
you weren't going to be here this week. Both you and wimpy are here, I thought for sure.

22:58.960 --> 23:03.120
I thought you were traveling, I've been watching your Twitter feed this week, and I thought

23:03.120 --> 23:09.120
you were at Ubicon, which apparently I had totally missed the date on. So guys, I'm glad

23:09.120 --> 23:12.680
you were able to make it. Poppy, let's start with you. Welcome back. Did you manage to

23:12.680 --> 23:17.840
get the Concrud, or did you avoid any of the Concrud, meeting with all your fellow Ubuntuers?

23:17.840 --> 23:23.520
Yeah, it was great. It was really nice to meet up with friends and watch a bunch of

23:23.520 --> 23:29.100
talks and have beer in the evening and cool conversations in corridors and meet new people

23:29.100 --> 23:33.720
and record interviews for our podcast and all kinds of good stuff. It's really nice,

23:33.720 --> 23:38.120
like because we're all distributed around the world, we don't often bump into each other.

23:38.120 --> 23:43.720
I mean, I see Martin fairly often, but I don't get to see many other people I work with and

23:43.720 --> 23:47.800
certainly not many of the community people from around the world. So it's really good.

23:47.800 --> 23:53.100
Just with every other distro, it's nice to get together and see the people who help make

23:53.100 --> 23:54.440
your distro rock.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.400
Where was it, Poppy?

23:56.400 --> 24:02.580
It was in a town called Essen in Germany, and the community guys in Germany organized

24:02.580 --> 24:08.520
the whole thing. We gave them help and there was some community funding from Ubuntu users

24:08.520 --> 24:14.360
who've donated money to the project. We used some of that money to help fund the project

24:14.360 --> 24:20.440
and they also had some sponsors. And yeah, it was in a place called Unperfect House,

24:20.440 --> 24:26.040
which is a bizarre building, which is excellent. Lots of little tiny rooms and a couple of

24:26.040 --> 24:32.320
big rooms and loads of art spaces and creative types.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.200
It's just in a bar, a couple of bars.

24:34.200 --> 24:41.000
I would imagine if this is a community-driven event, it's not like policies not being set,

24:41.000 --> 24:47.280
future project directions aren't being set. So what is – is it a get-together just of

24:47.280 --> 24:51.360
people where they trade stories or is there any kind of community action that develops

24:51.360 --> 24:53.000
here? What happens here?

24:53.000 --> 24:59.400
So the structure is there's a bunch of talks, one-hour slot talks, and anyone could submit

24:59.400 --> 25:07.000
a talk and there's – Jane Silber, our CEO, did a keynote and one of the guys from

25:07.000 --> 25:12.600
the IoT team gave a talk about Ubuntu IoT. There was someone from Microsoft there talking

25:12.600 --> 25:16.840
about Bash on Ubuntu on Windows.

25:16.840 --> 25:22.720
There were people talking about how to contribute in the community, talking about how to improve

25:22.720 --> 25:28.000
the desktop. It was all kinds of stuff, like a diverse range of subjects. You pick a subject

25:28.000 --> 25:33.180
and you submit it as a talk and it got on the track. We had like two or three tracks

25:33.180 --> 25:36.720
and so sometimes there were clashes and you couldn't go to everything and other times

25:36.720 --> 25:41.120
there was only one talk on so you get a good attendance at those kind of talks.

25:41.120 --> 25:47.440
So it was really like a pure community bunch of talks but then there was also corridor

25:47.440 --> 25:52.640
communication – corridor conversations like you get at any kind of event and conversations

25:52.640 --> 25:58.760
over beer in the evening and why don't we do this and kind of brainstorming ideas of

25:58.760 --> 26:03.520
how we can improve things and then towards the end there were discussions of what the

26:03.520 --> 26:07.480
next Dubicon would be, where that might be in the world and which part of the community

26:07.480 --> 26:08.920
is going to organize that.

26:08.920 --> 26:15.120
Yeah, it was really great. I massively enjoyed it. It far exceeded my expectations for a

26:15.120 --> 26:16.120
community event.

26:16.120 --> 26:23.360
Hmm. So Wimpy, I wanted to ask you what it was like to go because you have, I would imagine,

26:23.360 --> 26:27.520
a now newer, fresher perspective but is this the first kind of event like this you've

26:27.520 --> 26:31.120
gone to Wimpy or have you gone to a few of these?

26:31.120 --> 26:38.000
This is the first Ubicon Europe that's ever taken place but there have been other regional

26:38.000 --> 26:40.680
Ubicons but this is the first one that I've attended.

26:40.680 --> 26:46.480
Does it feel different going now as a canonical employee, somebody who now is kind of more

26:46.480 --> 26:49.280
well known in the community?

26:49.280 --> 26:55.920
Well not really. So obviously it was good that I knew – there was probably over the

26:55.920 --> 27:00.960
course of the weekend about six or eight canonical people who were employees who were at the

27:00.960 --> 27:05.200
event and it was good that I knew who all of those people were because I've now met

27:05.200 --> 27:12.000
them at a couple of events earlier in the year but by and large the people in the community

27:12.000 --> 27:18.840
who knew me or knew of me knew me because of Ubuntu Mate, not because of the fact that

27:18.840 --> 27:20.240
I'm a canonical employee.

27:20.240 --> 27:23.280
I thought for sure you were going to say Linux Unplugged.

27:23.280 --> 27:28.800
Well actually, no. I did. When I sat down for dinner on Saturday night –

27:28.800 --> 27:30.280
And they heard your voice.

27:30.280 --> 27:35.000
Yeah, exactly. I joined a table of people I didn't know and joined in the conversation

27:35.000 --> 27:40.480
and then somebody said, I know your voice and it was from Linux Unplugged. So I quickly

27:40.480 --> 27:44.680
pointed them Ubuntu podcast to set them in the right direction.

27:44.680 --> 27:45.680
Good man.

27:45.680 --> 27:52.600
Yeah, isn't that funny? It's funny how many people I meet, once they hear me speak,

27:52.600 --> 27:58.280
and then they realize, oh I know that voice. And it is very – so that's always how it

27:58.280 --> 28:04.600
goes down. So what did you think? What did you take away from UbuCon Wimpy and what did

28:04.600 --> 28:09.680
you take away, not only as an employee of Canonical, but as somebody who might be looking

28:09.680 --> 28:14.560
at what users want and how you could tweak your project?

28:14.560 --> 28:25.080
So it was one of the best sort of floss, open-sourcy conferences I've ever attended. As Papi said,

28:25.080 --> 28:31.760
the quality of the talks was high, it was extremely well organized, the venue was excellent,

28:31.760 --> 28:35.240
and the social events that happened on the Friday and Saturday were also really good

28:35.240 --> 28:41.080
fun. So there was a lot to like about it. Made loads of new friends, people who I've

28:41.080 --> 28:47.760
had sort of passing online acquaintances with over several years, actually getting to meet

28:47.760 --> 28:52.000
those people in person and shake their hand. And in some cases, I tried to buy people beer,

28:52.000 --> 28:55.080
but I had more beers bought for me than I got to buy for other people.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.080
That's true sometimes.

28:56.080 --> 29:00.360
So it was a very friendly – that was the other thing, it was a very friendly group

29:00.360 --> 29:06.520
of people, it was really good fun. There was no awkwardness at all, it was terrific. And

29:06.520 --> 29:13.960
we recorded a mashup podcast whilst we were there, from a few of the European Ubuntu podcasts,

29:13.960 --> 29:21.360
got together and did a mashup recording. So I thoroughly enjoyed it. And one of the guys

29:21.360 --> 29:28.160
there even made a – took a bottle of Club Marte and adapted it into the official Ubuntu

29:28.160 --> 29:33.480
Marte beverage, which was very good of him. So there was all sorts of silliness and good

29:33.480 --> 29:34.480
fun.

29:34.480 --> 29:38.960
Very good. Very good. First of all, I feel like we should do some mashup podcasting,

29:38.960 --> 29:44.160
but you guys got to make the long trek over here. So I know it's like asking a lot.

29:44.160 --> 29:49.160
Or you could come over here, because there's one of you and there's several of us.

29:49.160 --> 29:53.280
One of the conversations that's kicked off immediately after that Ubicon was the next

29:53.280 --> 29:58.800
Ubicon at scale next year. So that could happen.

29:58.800 --> 30:03.240
See I'm still on the fence about scale and now you're making me want to go. I mean,

30:03.240 --> 30:07.120
that would be a thing if I knew for sure you guys – if I knew for sure you were going

30:07.120 --> 30:11.240
to be there, then maybe that might be a game changer.

30:11.240 --> 30:15.800
I'll try and bring my nice smell.

30:15.800 --> 30:19.440
I happen to know why his poppy smells so good at these conventions, because when he arrives

30:19.440 --> 30:30.800
at the airport, before he boards the aircraft, he goes into the men's smellies department

30:30.800 --> 30:34.000
and gets himself all new nice smelling things.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.240
It's the freebies, dude. It's all the freebies you get in there.

30:37.240 --> 30:45.480
Wimpy, you'll be happy to know that I was literally crawling all over MeetBSD. I should

30:45.480 --> 30:52.360
send you this photo. Maybe I will later after the show. I crawled up onto a speaker that

30:52.360 --> 30:58.240
was set up to rebroadcast what the person at the booth was saying, and I mounted my

30:58.240 --> 31:02.360
camera to the top of the speaker because I wanted a shot of the person giving the presentation.

31:02.360 --> 31:07.960
I'm like, I'm stretched all the way out reaching to the speaker and right there in

31:07.960 --> 31:12.880
front of the entire BSD crowd is me wearing my Ubuntu Mate jacket.

31:12.880 --> 31:16.080
Nicely done. Nicely done.

31:16.080 --> 31:20.680
So I was repping while I was down there, and it was fun.

31:20.680 --> 31:26.360
So I did some brand promotion whilst I was there as well. So when I arrived on the Friday,

31:26.360 --> 31:33.480
I had all of my Ubuntu Mate stuff on. And then on the Saturday, I wore the System AU

31:33.480 --> 31:38.280
podcast shirt that I won recently from a competition on their podcast.

31:38.280 --> 31:47.120
Nice. Oh, well, that sounds like a good time. Now I've got to think seriously about – Wes,

31:47.120 --> 31:51.160
what do you think about scale? How would that work? Could you get like the work –

31:51.160 --> 31:52.160
Yeah, sure.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.160
Could they?

31:53.160 --> 31:57.560
I mean, if – well, I don't know. I'd have to ask. But I could investigate.

31:57.560 --> 31:58.560
Well, you could totally –

31:58.560 --> 31:59.560
But I might even just go if it's –

31:59.560 --> 32:03.440
You could totally, if you wanted to, you could ride down in Lady Joops with us.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.440
Oh.

32:04.440 --> 32:05.440
If I go.

32:05.440 --> 32:08.400
See, this sounds like a lot of fun.

32:08.400 --> 32:13.920
See, I got really lucky on this last trip because I got to camp in the campus parking

32:13.920 --> 32:14.920
lot.

32:14.920 --> 32:15.920
That is slick.

32:15.920 --> 32:19.800
So that made it much more doable. I don't know if I could be that lucky with scale,

32:19.800 --> 32:22.840
but that was – so you could ride down with us if you go.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.840
Okay. Well, then we've got to start thinking about this.

32:24.840 --> 32:25.840
You think about that.

32:25.840 --> 32:28.680
I assume you're planning on doing Linux Fest Northwest next year as well.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.560
Yeah, of course. Are you?

32:30.560 --> 32:36.760
No. Well, I was hoping to make it this year, but events escalated so that didn't happen.

32:36.760 --> 32:40.280
But yeah, I would like to come out. I think it's May. I was looking at the dates the

32:40.280 --> 32:41.280
other day.

32:41.280 --> 32:44.600
Yeah, it is. They just changed it, actually. I mean, they changed it from what it has been

32:44.600 --> 32:52.280
previously. Yeah. So Linux Fest Northwest 2017 is going to be May 6th and the 7th.

32:52.280 --> 32:56.080
And you know, I think this thing gets nearly now 2,200 participants.

32:56.080 --> 32:57.080
Yeah.

32:57.080 --> 32:58.080
Isn't that awesome?

32:58.080 --> 32:59.680
I mean, that's a serious scale. I mean, that is –

32:59.680 --> 33:00.680
That's quite something, isn't it?

33:00.680 --> 33:01.680
That's a real –

33:01.680 --> 33:02.680
A real wordplay.

33:02.680 --> 33:03.680
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

33:03.680 --> 33:07.000
And it's a serious event. So I do think it is worth more and more time for people that

33:07.000 --> 33:08.640
maybe haven't gone in the past. Is it –

33:08.640 --> 33:13.560
Yeah. So yeah, I'm considering going to Linux Fest Northwest. And you know, that main

33:13.560 --> 33:19.000
C mod, you know, fly all that way to go to a weekend event from Europe. But there were

33:19.000 --> 33:25.400
people at UbuCon Europe from the US who traveled there. So Elizabeth Joseph come back was there

33:25.400 --> 33:30.440
for the weekend. And Nathan Haynes, one of the community contributors, was there as well.

33:30.440 --> 33:35.440
But there's another guy in the community called Jose. He lives in Lima in Peru. And

33:35.440 --> 33:41.480
he traveled all the way from Peru to Germany for the weekend and was flying back to get

33:41.480 --> 33:48.160
back to university in time for class on the Tuesday. It's just like mental. So there's

33:48.160 --> 33:50.120
some really committed fans out there.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.120
Dedication.

33:51.120 --> 33:54.560
If you're able to make it out here for Linux Fest Northwest, schedule an extra day.

33:54.560 --> 33:55.560
Yeah.

33:55.560 --> 33:59.560
And I'll take you to just a couple of spots in the Pacific Northwest that I would – I

33:59.560 --> 34:04.480
will promise you are some of the most beautiful sights you will see in the world as long as

34:04.480 --> 34:08.960
the weather is cooperating. I mean, they are truly gorgeous. If you have an extra day,

34:08.960 --> 34:10.960
I'll take you on a personal tour.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.320
Lovely. I'll see what I can do.

34:13.320 --> 34:16.560
So let's talk about really quickly before we move on because there's so much stuff

34:16.560 --> 34:20.960
to talk about this week. We should probably pick it up. I want to talk about GM Vault,

34:20.960 --> 34:24.400
both a tool that Wes and I found this week that allows you to back up and restore your

34:24.400 --> 34:29.080
Gmail account. Yeah, your Gmail account. It's a tool for backing up your Gmail account and

34:29.080 --> 34:33.160
never lose any email correspondence. What a nice thing to have, a little piece of mind

34:33.160 --> 34:39.120
when you're using Gmail. And just as Wes likes it, just as Mr. Richard Stallman likes

34:39.120 --> 34:40.120
it.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.120
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

34:41.120 --> 34:49.880
It is GNU AGPL 3.0 license. You can find it at gmvault.org. And it's super easy to set

34:49.880 --> 34:53.600
up and it backs up your entire freaking Google account. So what were you thinking when you

34:53.600 --> 34:54.600
found this one?

34:54.600 --> 35:01.080
Well, I just got myself a pixel. So I'm more involved than ever in the Google ecosystem.

35:01.080 --> 35:03.780
You know, I heard about them. I think they reversed that decision, but there's some issues

35:03.780 --> 35:06.800
with people pre-ordering pixels and then selling them.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.520
Let's talk about it. Let's talk about that. And do you have your pixel here?

35:09.520 --> 35:10.520
I do.

35:10.520 --> 35:15.520
Hold it. Hold it. Don't let me see it yet. Oh, my God. I have been looking forward to

35:15.520 --> 35:20.080
trying a pixel. I cannot wait. This is going to be my first hands-on with a pixel. And

35:20.080 --> 35:21.560
Wes, how long have you had it, Wes?

35:21.560 --> 35:23.760
I got it last Wednesday.

35:23.760 --> 35:27.800
Oh, we're going to... Basically, you've had it for six days. We're going to hear your

35:27.800 --> 35:33.440
thoughts about it and all of it. So we'll have a link to gmvault. But let's take a moment

35:33.440 --> 35:36.960
and let's thank Ting because, geez, this is pretty time-appropriate, right?

35:36.960 --> 35:37.960
It sure is.

35:37.960 --> 35:44.720
Linux.ting.com, Linux.ting.com, Linux.ting.com is where you go to get $25 off your first

35:44.720 --> 35:49.560
device or $25 in service credit if you bring a device.

35:49.560 --> 35:54.560
Yeah, they got CDMA and GSM Networks, so check their BYOD page and you just might be able

35:54.560 --> 36:01.080
to bring a device. Ting is mobile that makes sense. They take your minutes, your messages,

36:01.080 --> 36:04.640
and your megabytes. They add them all up and whatever you use, that's what you pay. It's

36:04.640 --> 36:10.800
$6 just for the line itself. Think about that for a second. One line is six bucks a month

36:10.800 --> 36:15.480
than your usage. Two lines is another $6. Three lines, another $6. If you're a small

36:15.480 --> 36:21.160
business like me, that is so economical. Plus, if you got Wi-Fi at your office, that means

36:21.160 --> 36:26.840
if you're doing Ting for your business and you have Wi-Fi at your office, when your staff

36:26.840 --> 36:33.200
are at the office, they're not using Ting because they're on Wi-Fi. Just use a messenger,

36:33.200 --> 36:37.800
use some VoIP and you're done. And you're not paying for anything but the line except

36:37.800 --> 36:43.040
for when they're on the road because when they got home, they got Wi-Fi too. Also, obviously

36:43.040 --> 36:47.200
if you're an individual, this works for you as well. I love this. They got all these great

36:47.200 --> 36:51.360
devices you can choose from, from the bare SIM to feature phones all the way up to the

36:51.360 --> 36:57.320
latest and greatest. So check them out at linux.ting.com and a big thanks to Ting for

36:57.320 --> 37:05.280
sponsoring the Unplugged program. linux.ting.com. Okay, I'm going to have to, you know what?

37:05.280 --> 37:11.080
Hold on really quick. Oracle bought DYN. That's what we were going to talk about. Instead,

37:11.080 --> 37:13.880
let's talk about, can I see it? Yeah, sure. Can I see it? Alright, I'm going to turn the

37:13.880 --> 37:18.240
camera on because this is super special. This is very important to Chris. So if you're watching

37:18.240 --> 37:23.200
the video version, this is Chris' first. Ignore all the Jupiter broadcasting presence right

37:23.200 --> 37:26.620
there. That's for another thing I'm recording at another time. Just ignore it. Oh, let me

37:26.620 --> 37:33.480
see it. Oh, okay. Oh yeah. That's nice. Yeah, it has a very pleasant hand feel. It's much

37:33.480 --> 37:39.120
lighter than I expected. It's much lighter than I expected. I definitely think that weird

37:39.120 --> 37:42.600
two-tone, that's weird. It even feels weird. The two differences there. Oh yeah, like the

37:42.600 --> 37:47.160
glass and then the metal. So this backside, it has that weird angle. Alright, alright.

37:47.160 --> 37:53.840
So it's kind of wedge shaped in general, if you notice. This is nice though. Yeah, I like

37:53.840 --> 37:57.320
it. I like it. It feels good on the table like I expected. One thing I noticed is the

37:57.320 --> 38:01.800
power button has like a ribbing cross hatch on it, which is helpful when you're pressing

38:01.800 --> 38:05.800
it. Yeah, kind of like the 6P had that. The 6P had that too. Yeah, these buttons feel

38:05.800 --> 38:11.560
very much like the 6P, only this feels, this feels in the hand a lot like the 6P but half

38:11.560 --> 38:17.560
the size, width-wise. Yeah, right. It feels exactly like the 6P with those buttons there.

38:17.560 --> 38:21.920
And I got the Pixel, not the XL, just to be clear, audience. Good size. Yeah, I love it.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.440
It's perfect. So how's the camera? How are you liking all that kind of stuff? I haven't

38:24.440 --> 38:29.680
taken too many pictures yet, but it's fast. It's way faster than any other Android camera

38:29.680 --> 38:33.240
that I've seen. I mean, the app still takes like a second to start up, but here, if you

38:33.240 --> 38:38.240
want to play with it. Oh, you unlock it for me. There you go. Have at it, sir. The new

38:38.240 --> 38:41.920
launcher looks exactly like the old launcher, but that, except for the search thing smaller.

38:41.920 --> 38:45.840
Is there anything else? The search thing smaller, you can like swipe up to get all of your apps.

38:45.840 --> 38:48.840
It has Google's Assistant down at the bottom if you'd like to play with it. Have you used

38:48.840 --> 38:53.180
that much, the Assistant? A few things, like I mean, I've had it set alarms or tell me

38:53.180 --> 38:57.720
the hours of a restaurant. Feels fast. Yeah, no, it does feel fast. It's probably the fastest

38:57.720 --> 39:02.480
Android phone I've had or used personally for very long, so I'm pretty pleased with

39:02.480 --> 39:09.280
the performance so far. So, yeah, gosh, the screen looks great, man. I know. The camera

39:09.280 --> 39:13.760
feels very fast. I would say it feels as fast as the iPhone. Yeah, you know, I haven't used

39:13.760 --> 39:18.360
the iPhone that much, but my wife switched to this phone as well from an iPhone 6, and

39:18.360 --> 39:21.820
so far I think she likes it a lot. I'll have to get more reviews. How's the battery? Battery

39:21.820 --> 39:26.400
life has been great. I'm charging it like once a day-ish, but kind of randomly whenever,

39:26.400 --> 39:30.560
and it does charge as fast as advertised, so I don't really worry about charging anymore,

39:30.560 --> 39:34.480
which has been very pleasant. I don't yet have a lot of the USB gadgets in my life,

39:34.480 --> 39:37.660
but I do have some coworkers with USB phones, so it's nice knowing, too, like we can charge

39:37.660 --> 39:42.240
each other's phones. Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure. USB-C does seem like the way to feature. And

39:42.240 --> 39:46.800
I've already fallen in love with not having to, you know, find which way my damn USB cord

39:46.800 --> 39:51.560
is oriented. Yeah. That's just worth it all by itself. It looks like you get about 12,

39:51.560 --> 39:55.000
13 hours looking at your battery stats. It looks like you get about 12, 13 hours of battery

39:55.000 --> 40:01.440
life, which is pretty solid. How's the audio quality? Like listening to podcasts on the

40:01.440 --> 40:05.720
speakers built in, how's that? Pretty good, actually, and loud, surprisingly loud. For

40:05.720 --> 40:10.160
a while I was having a Bluetooth issue, which is no longer the case, so I was just listening

40:10.160 --> 40:12.760
to it with a speaker. With your 5X, you mean, or what do you mean when you were having a

40:12.760 --> 40:15.560
Bluetooth issue? No, when I first installed this phone, before I updated or anything,

40:15.560 --> 40:20.280
it was more just like it wasn't connecting to my Bose wireless speaker. Oh, I love the

40:20.280 --> 40:23.520
Bose wireless speaker. That's a great speaker. So for a little bit, just for that day, while

40:23.520 --> 40:27.160
it was like, that was the first day I had it, I was just listening to the speaker, and

40:27.160 --> 40:32.320
it was like I could shower and listen to a podcast from the phone, so it was pretty loud.

40:32.320 --> 40:37.000
So have you used like the voice dictation, like the, I don't want to say it, but like

40:37.000 --> 40:42.240
the, where you can say, okay, Googs, have you been using that? Yeah, a little bit. I

40:42.240 --> 40:46.460
mean, it works pretty well. Have you tried it like across the room? No, I have not. Okay,

40:46.460 --> 40:50.320
let's do it right now. Let's do it. Okay, so I've just turned off your screen. I've

40:50.320 --> 40:55.800
turned off your screen. Now you, you attempt to invoke it. Okay, Google. Oh, yeah, it lit

40:55.800 --> 41:00.160
up. You got it. You got it. You got it. Good. Okay. Now let me try it. It knows me. Let

41:00.160 --> 41:07.960
me try it. Okay. Okay, Google. It didn't do it. Now let's mumble try, mumble try. No,

41:07.960 --> 41:12.360
I can't hear. Okay, now let's try it on the iPhone. Okay. Oh, yeah. There you go. So I'll

41:12.360 --> 41:21.200
unmute it just for this. Hey, Siri. Okay, so now you try doing a Hey, Siri. Hey, Siri.

41:21.200 --> 41:30.400
Ah, okay. So I found it. It works. That little bit of security is nice. So what do you think

41:30.400 --> 41:33.520
overall? You really happy with the purchase? You regret it? I mean, obviously you saw the

41:33.520 --> 41:37.440
state of my old five. Yeah, it was terrible. I needed a phone. I was waiting for Google's

41:37.440 --> 41:41.320
next phone. Just, I mean, I like stock Android. I like that I'm getting updates now. It feels

41:41.320 --> 41:44.800
good in the hand. Yeah, it feels really nice. It's nice on the table. I need to get a case

41:44.800 --> 41:48.760
or at least a screen protector. I'm kind of running dangerous right now. But it's beautiful.

41:48.760 --> 41:54.120
I love feeling it. I also went with right now I'm using Google's five the wireless service.

41:54.120 --> 41:58.440
Oh, yeah. Yeah. How's five? That was it was crazy easy to set up. Like it was I already

41:58.440 --> 42:03.520
had the number I wanted on Google Voice. And so you really just like you did the no going

42:03.520 --> 42:07.440
back switch. Yeah, there's no they warn you there's no going back once you do this. You

42:07.440 --> 42:12.480
can in some cases and you can port away your number. How can that be? But you have to no

42:12.480 --> 42:15.960
longer you can either use one or the other. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And that's fine. Because

42:15.960 --> 42:20.520
I was mostly using Google Voice to forward to my carrier. So if I can just have that

42:20.520 --> 42:24.760
number on my carrier, then yeah, and I get all the features and it has visual voicemail

42:24.760 --> 42:30.200
and such. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm actually an active five subscriber. Oh, there we go. Yeah.

42:30.200 --> 42:35.440
I find it to be totally underwhelming and not that compelling at all and a big disappointment.

42:35.440 --> 42:38.760
But that's my personal experience. I've only just started. I just thought it was a because

42:38.760 --> 42:42.560
I had it on Google Voice. It was so simple to get started. I was very like I clicked

42:42.560 --> 42:46.920
a few things and then suddenly my phone worked. You know, so I might have broken you accidentally

42:46.920 --> 42:51.800
because just if you want to subscribe to Google Fi and I bet a lot of I bet they're getting

42:51.800 --> 42:56.060
a lot of subscribers with the pixel. Don't install the apps from the Play Store that

42:56.060 --> 43:02.080
tell you how it's using the networks because what you will discover is that Google is calculating

43:02.080 --> 43:06.640
their cost as well when they choose which networks you go on. I believe that it's not

43:06.640 --> 43:11.140
just your pure which one's going to be better for speed and signal. And once you realize

43:11.140 --> 43:15.360
that they're making that calculation and they sometimes put you on a slower network just

43:15.360 --> 43:19.600
because it saves them money. It's super frustrating. I can totally see you being frustrated with

43:19.600 --> 43:23.680
that. Yeah. Well, I'll have to I'll have to test this out and see you home. I see what

43:23.680 --> 43:29.620
I see how it works. Yeah. The idea is nice. And it's one of the other things is nice about

43:29.620 --> 43:35.680
Fi. If you're OK with giving Google all of the things every last thing. One of the nice

43:35.680 --> 43:40.800
things about Fi is like glass for a short period of time and other things. It's a part

43:40.800 --> 43:45.200
of Google's hyper focus right now where they actually give a share a little. Yeah. Yeah.

43:45.200 --> 43:49.480
And so they actually help you and they have good customer service. And so if you're ever

43:49.480 --> 43:54.640
going to use a Google product where they take all of the things it's the one to use. That's

43:54.640 --> 43:57.120
what I figured. I mean, I don't know that I'll stay long term right. I already have

43:57.120 --> 44:01.360
seen a Ting SIM cards laying around. I just thought, you know, this is the first phone

44:01.360 --> 44:05.600
eligible. I'll give it a shot. See what it is. And it's an interesting idea. And also

44:05.600 --> 44:09.560
it's another way to give the middle finger to the carriers. Yeah. Right. Totally. I like

44:09.560 --> 44:12.840
it from there. But you'll have to hear more. I'll I'll use it. You know, give it a couple

44:12.840 --> 44:18.020
of months use and check back in. There is a do you hear that there's a check going being

44:18.020 --> 44:25.560
bombed right now. I am not joking when I say there is an extremely high probability that

44:25.560 --> 44:33.480
it is Paul Allen. So Paul Allen, I had a client that shares warehouse space with Paul Allen

44:33.480 --> 44:38.640
here at the Arlington Airport. Oh, interesting. So the studio is a stone's throw away from

44:38.640 --> 44:45.200
the Arlington Airport. And Paul Allen has a jet from like the Vietnam War era that he

44:45.200 --> 44:49.240
just bought to just like, you know, I feel like, you know, like how some of us might

44:49.240 --> 44:56.280
buy like a go kart or a or I don't know something like a bike, like a mountain bike. You just,

44:56.280 --> 45:01.000
you know, pick up a jet. Paul Allen buys like a World War Two or Vietnam era jet and he

45:01.000 --> 45:07.920
stores it. And this is this is all 100 percent true. He stores it here at the Arlington Airport.

45:07.920 --> 45:11.320
And I don't even know if I'm supposed to tell you this because my client had to sign an

45:11.320 --> 45:18.040
NDA. However, I did not sign an NDA. But so a section of my client's warehouse was fenced

45:18.040 --> 45:22.800
off with a chain link fence with a door in it and a bolt. And in this chain link fence

45:22.800 --> 45:28.440
section was Paul Allen's personal toy fighter jet. Wow. That he takes here at the Arlington

45:28.440 --> 45:33.360
Airport and flies around like a maniac. So we may be being bombed by Paul Allen. OK.

45:33.360 --> 45:36.760
Yeah. No. Thank you, Chris. So that's that it could be who we're hearing right now. That

45:36.760 --> 45:42.720
is actually legitimately true. Also, you know what else is ops? Absolutely 100 percent true.

45:42.720 --> 45:47.680
Those crazy Russians over at Kaspersky apparently have their own operating system. Did you know

45:47.680 --> 45:51.800
this? Yeah. Isn't this nuts? Kaspersky OS is very excited. They say it's designed for

45:51.800 --> 45:56.040
networks with extreme requirements for data security for like layer three switches. They

45:56.040 --> 46:00.760
say it's got a microkernel architecture and they give the middle finger to Linux. They

46:00.760 --> 46:07.180
say, yeah, I know what you're thinking. It's not even the slightest quote unquote smell

46:07.180 --> 46:11.840
of Linux. All the popular operating systems are not designed with security in mind. We

46:11.840 --> 46:16.680
could do better. So it's simpler and safer to just start from the ground up. This sounds

46:16.680 --> 46:21.600
like Ikey. Doesn't that sound like Ikey? It sure does. Yeah. And that was just exactly

46:21.600 --> 46:28.680
what they did. I tease. I tease. But really, yes. So Kaspersky has their own OS because

46:28.680 --> 46:32.000
nobody else could do it better, they say. Is the source available or are they keeping

46:32.000 --> 46:36.280
it closed and you have to buy it? Oh, that's the first comment on the story, by the way.

46:36.280 --> 46:41.600
The very first comment. Good job, Wes. Look at that. Look, are you going to put the source

46:41.600 --> 46:46.480
on GitHub? It's right there. Oh, OK. No, it's not the first comment anymore. OK. It was

46:46.480 --> 46:53.960
when I read it. Full disclosure, it was when I read it. But yeah, that is Kaspersky OS.

46:53.960 --> 46:58.920
What a pile of horse shit. I'm so sick of people creating their own encryption telegram.

46:58.920 --> 47:03.440
I am so sick of people creating their own operating systems. Kaspersky, just give me

47:03.440 --> 47:10.200
a break. Yeah, wait till they have to update it. Exactly. I just. Yeah, I wonder if we'll

47:10.200 --> 47:15.600
see any. Would you have any confidence deploying this at your business? No. You would not do

47:15.600 --> 47:19.280
it. It's just it's so ridiculous. I mean, there would need to be some at least some

47:19.280 --> 47:25.600
really good reviews. And then I mean, I don't have to be wanting to buy a proprietary replacement

47:25.600 --> 47:31.180
for these types of things anyway. I don't see it happening. You hear that yet? That's

47:31.180 --> 47:35.280
Paul Allen. I tell you. Get out of here. You know how you know? You know how you know?

47:35.280 --> 47:40.240
Because if it was an actual jet with a purpose that was here to do something, they'd be flying

47:40.240 --> 47:45.880
it. The fact that that son of a bitch is circling, hanging out, having a nice day. This is Paul

47:45.880 --> 47:48.520
Allen. It is beautiful here in the Pacific Northwest. The mountains are out. Yeah, you

47:48.520 --> 47:54.880
know, Allen Jude on TechSnap totally destroyed LastPass for me. I was pretty fired up about

47:54.880 --> 48:00.360
LastPass. No synchronization required, open source. And then he's like, well, this, this

48:00.360 --> 48:04.120
and that. And he had a he made a lot of good points. So now, now I'm getting all fired

48:04.120 --> 48:09.400
up about Bitwarden. You're back on. Well, this is really Mr. Tennell here. He produced

48:09.400 --> 48:16.200
the last week's Linux Unplugged. Oh, yeah. All right. Oh, all right. Let's talk about

48:16.200 --> 48:20.960
Mr. Tennell right now. Mr. Producer Michael Tennell, a.k.a. Rotten Corpse, last week produced

48:20.960 --> 48:29.300
Linux Unplugged for Noah and he did a damn good job. Damn good job. So as a as a as sort

48:29.300 --> 48:34.280
of a nod and a thank you to both him and Noah for filling into last week's episode, I wanted

48:34.280 --> 48:38.720
to cover something that he's kind of excited about. And that's Bitwarden. And Bitwarden

48:38.720 --> 48:43.360
is an open source, cross-platform password manager. And it's on Kickstarter. Hundreds

48:43.360 --> 48:49.200
of accounts online, websites, apps, email, work. Yeah. You keep up with all those passwords.

48:49.200 --> 48:55.000
I don't know. Most of us just end up reusing the same passwords everywhere. Because you

48:55.000 --> 48:59.480
tried to be smart. You're constantly battling with forgot password resets. Yeah, because

48:59.480 --> 49:04.480
LastPass isn't a thing. Security breaches happen online every day. Right. Your usernames

49:04.480 --> 49:09.280
and passwords are stolen by hackers that can end up ruining your life. I trust this guy

49:09.280 --> 49:13.280
because he has a Sammy beard. He has a gray shirt and three monitors. They are nicely

49:13.280 --> 49:17.560
set up there. Yeah, I would like the desk. Yeah, although he does seem to be running

49:17.560 --> 49:25.040
Windows. Whenever you reuse the same passwords everywhere, you're inviting those hackers

49:25.040 --> 49:30.800
into all your accounts. That's right. Using strong, unique passwords for every service

49:30.800 --> 49:38.760
you use online is essential, but seemingly impossible. That's why we created Bitwarden.

49:38.760 --> 49:45.280
Bitwarden is a password management application that keeps you safe online. Bitwarden automatically

49:45.280 --> 49:53.720
generates unique, secure passwords for all of your accounts. Next time you go to log

49:53.720 --> 49:59.640
in, Bitwarden will automatically fill in your login information for you. It's that simple.

49:59.640 --> 50:05.880
That did not look automatic. It looked like he clicked that. Okay, so 155 backers, they've

50:05.880 --> 50:15.960
raised $3,000 of $49,000 goal. Forty days left to go. Michael, how is this even interesting

50:15.960 --> 50:22.920
at all to you? What is interesting about this? I mean, I put it in here, but I mean, really,

50:22.920 --> 50:30.200
what is it? Because this sounds super generic to me. Going once. Uh-oh, did he leave? Wes,

50:30.200 --> 50:35.520
is he in there? That bastard, you know. Ladies and gentlemen. Running away. Ladies and gentlemen,

50:35.520 --> 50:40.000
I would like to introduce you to Linux Unplugged, the only weekly Linux podcast with as many

50:40.000 --> 50:45.920
listeners where we just toss it to people that don't even exist. So we're just. It's

50:45.920 --> 50:51.960
unplugged people. That's why we call it that. Now you know. So since he's not here to defend

50:51.960 --> 50:56.600
it, I'm going to assume what he was going to say is, well, Chris, I just don't like

50:56.600 --> 51:01.760
log me in and I don't like LastPass because log me in. So therefore I'm willing to throw

51:01.760 --> 51:06.320
my money at anything. I think that's probably what he was going to say. That's probably.

51:06.320 --> 51:12.440
It does seem to be open source. Rekai just cut all of that from the show. Let's just

51:12.440 --> 51:16.640
cut all of that. We tried. No, leave it in Rekai, leave it in. That's the kind of thing

51:16.640 --> 51:21.560
that people that podcast five years ago did. That's not what we do now. You got between

51:21.560 --> 51:27.720
Chris has standards now between Paul Allen and Rotten Corps. I just this whole episode

51:27.720 --> 51:31.920
is ruined. It's whole, it's whole rune. Let's talk about $15 production. Kubernetes clusters

51:31.920 --> 51:36.580
on digital ocean. That's kind of interesting. Wes, can you explain to me what Kubernetes

51:36.580 --> 51:40.800
are? Because it sounds like they're delicious, tasty morsels that does. It does look like

51:40.800 --> 51:46.520
that, right? Kubernetes is an orchestration layer for running containers. It provides

51:46.520 --> 51:50.880
you like a bunch of abstractions so you can have pods and sets of things so that you can

51:50.880 --> 51:56.080
be like, I need this number of containers running this service that usually microservices

51:56.080 --> 51:59.480
that you're putting in containers. And then you can kind of abstract away your hardware.

51:59.480 --> 52:05.160
You install a bunch of these on different hardware right now, usually on cloud boxes,

52:05.160 --> 52:08.200
but you can have it on bare metal as well. And then this provides you a bunch of ways

52:08.200 --> 52:11.060
you can kind of schedule things. You can make sure services are running. It'll automatically

52:11.060 --> 52:15.280
restart things or auto scale as needed with traffic. It's kind of provides you a whole

52:15.280 --> 52:20.340
production environment. So they handle secret management as well and provide key value stores

52:20.340 --> 52:26.000
for different configurations per environment, that sort of stuff. So it's one of those,

52:26.000 --> 52:29.680
you only need this stuff when you're really running something big, but that makes it kind

52:29.680 --> 52:34.480
of hard to learn. So if you're installing a big infrastructure, there's a lot of things

52:34.480 --> 52:38.040
you might not do if you had a small infrastructure. But if you work in a big environment, you

52:38.040 --> 52:41.160
probably need to learn those things anyway. So they have something called Minikube where

52:41.160 --> 52:44.680
you can run it in a VM on your desktop. But I just thought this was kind of neat. It's

52:44.680 --> 52:47.680
not something to ever do for production or run it. He didn't need to do this for his

52:47.680 --> 52:52.320
end goal. It was just kind of an example of like, here's if you wanted to mock up what

52:52.320 --> 52:57.000
you might do at real scale on cheap digital ocean hardware, which is really easy to get.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
Using $5. Yeah, you can spin it up, use it, test it, play with it, spin it down, practice

53:01.000 --> 53:03.080
your configuration management. So I just thought that was cool.

53:03.080 --> 53:07.920
Poby, can you help me with official pronunciation before we move on?

53:07.920 --> 53:11.160
I don't care how you say it, but everyone else says it Kubernetes.

53:11.160 --> 53:12.160
Kubernetes.

53:12.160 --> 53:13.160
Yeah.

53:13.160 --> 53:14.160
Kubernetes.

53:14.160 --> 53:18.960
I feel like it doesn't sound as delicious when you add the Netties part. Now it sounds

53:18.960 --> 53:23.640
like something I put in my nose, not something I put in my mouth. But Kubernetes.

53:23.640 --> 53:27.960
How would you say it in a way that you don't want to eat it?

53:27.960 --> 53:28.960
Kubernetes.

53:28.960 --> 53:29.960
Kubernetes.

53:29.960 --> 53:32.840
Yeah, that sounds like a cookie. Yeah, Kubernetes sounds like a delicious cookie with cream

53:32.840 --> 53:33.840
in the middle.

53:33.840 --> 53:34.840
Right.

53:34.840 --> 53:38.820
I think this header image has biased everyone for the whole thing. Chris will never think

53:38.820 --> 53:41.440
of this as related to cookies.

53:41.440 --> 53:45.560
Well, why don't we take a moment right now, since we just mentioned DigitalOcean, let's

53:45.560 --> 53:51.000
talk about DigitalOcean. They are our next sponsor here on the Unplugged program. DigitalOcean.com

53:51.000 --> 53:57.640
and use our promo code DOUNPLUGED, that's one word, and get a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean.com.

53:57.640 --> 54:01.880
It's interesting, at $5 a month for a droplet, you can play with things like Kubernetes.

54:01.880 --> 54:04.800
It makes it really easy to do things. You can spin up a whole bunch if you're only going

54:04.800 --> 54:07.920
to use them for an hour. I like that flexibility.

54:07.920 --> 54:12.120
Also, if you're maybe doing a new release of a project and you want to spin up a little

54:12.120 --> 54:17.480
additional capacity, DigitalOcean is some of the infrastructure behind some of our favorite

54:17.480 --> 54:21.840
open source projects out there, and it makes sense. At $5 a month, you can get a pretty

54:21.840 --> 54:26.380
great machine, or at just a few cents an hour, you can get a fantastic machine. It really

54:26.380 --> 54:30.420
just depends on how you want to set it up. They have a fantastic interface to wrap it

54:30.420 --> 54:34.260
all up and put it together, and they have an API that's so simple and so straightforward

54:34.260 --> 54:38.020
that there's been tons of great open source code written to take advantage of it.

54:38.020 --> 54:42.720
Go to DigitalOcean.com and just start working. Use our promo code DOUNPLUGED, get a $10 credit,

54:42.720 --> 54:47.720
and run it for a while. $5 a droplet gets you two months for free. Woo-hoo. DigitalOcean.com,

54:47.720 --> 54:54.720
use our promo code DOUNPLUGED, Ubuntu, Fedora, FreeBSD, Debian, CoreOS. They got data centers

54:55.400 --> 55:00.840
all over the world. Just give it a try. DigitalOcean.com. In fact, speaking of the Fedora 25 release

55:00.840 --> 55:07.360
anyway, I think I went from Fedora 23 to 24 on DigitalOcean Droplet, running MB, using

55:07.360 --> 55:12.280
Fedora Cloud, and then using... I can't remember what the name of the web interface was, but

55:12.280 --> 55:13.880
I managed to deploy an MB...

55:13.880 --> 55:14.880
Cockpit?

55:14.880 --> 55:15.880
What?

55:15.880 --> 55:16.880
Cockpit? Is that the one?

55:16.880 --> 55:20.220
Yep. Cockpit. Yep. Thank you, Wes. I used Cockpit to deploy an MB image, and then that

55:20.220 --> 55:24.680
was on a DigitalOcean Droplet, and then I upgraded that from 23 to 24 without a problem.

55:24.680 --> 55:26.680
Look at you in the cloud, Chris.

55:26.680 --> 55:30.680
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGED, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for

55:30.680 --> 55:31.680
sponsoring.

55:31.680 --> 55:32.680
DOUNPLUGED.

55:32.680 --> 55:40.600
I want to talk about something that's really bothering me, and I want to get there via

55:40.600 --> 55:48.840
the Oryx Pro. Wes, I feel like what's happened in the phone industry is happening in the

55:48.840 --> 55:55.160
personal computer industry. The single vendor, single platform, single... I design the software.

55:55.160 --> 55:57.880
I design the hardware, and I put it all together.

55:57.880 --> 55:58.880
Spoke.

55:58.880 --> 56:03.280
Yeah. Microsoft is doing this now with the Surface Studio, the Surface Book, the Surface

56:03.280 --> 56:07.920
Pro. Apple is doing this now with the Mac OS in a way they never have before with the

56:07.920 --> 56:12.520
Touch Bar. It's becoming less and less Linux compatible, more so than ever. Every single

56:12.520 --> 56:19.200
vendor that has a major stake in this is often... Even if it's Android, it's their own variant,

56:19.200 --> 56:20.200
like Samsung.

56:20.200 --> 56:22.680
Yep, running custom software. Yep.

56:22.680 --> 56:30.120
They're creating these bespoke, siloed, monolithic platforms that are less and less general computing

56:30.120 --> 56:39.560
platforms and less and less Linux compatible. You can often get it to work, but like with

56:39.560 --> 56:44.160
the Surface, it only works great on a couple of versions of them. There's a couple of hurdles

56:44.160 --> 56:48.080
you have to go through, or like on the MacBook, it works pretty good, especially if you do

56:48.080 --> 56:51.680
this and you install this patch set against your Linux kernel, then you're really in a

56:51.680 --> 56:57.080
pretty good position. We have these stories, even for Chromebooks. Yeah, you can get it

56:57.080 --> 57:01.160
to work pretty good, especially if you buy this Chromebook and you do this thing to the

57:01.160 --> 57:02.160
bootloader or you remove this screw.

57:02.160 --> 57:06.080
Just make sure you don't forget to push the thing or you delete your thing.

57:06.080 --> 57:10.920
This is becoming more and more commonplace, especially as general purpose vendors have

57:10.920 --> 57:16.320
less and less incentive to be in the PC business. As the x86 platform is making less and less

57:16.320 --> 57:21.640
money for people, they're just going off and making their own products, these narrow, siloed

57:21.640 --> 57:23.080
products.

57:23.080 --> 57:27.560
So I want to talk about that and how I feel like that's a particular bad, bad, bad precedence

57:27.560 --> 57:29.880
for Linux. First, I want to let Paul Allen buzz the studio.

57:29.880 --> 57:30.880
He's having a great time.

57:30.880 --> 57:34.160
Paul Allen's having a good time. I'm good. I'm really glad.

57:34.160 --> 57:36.520
As long as one of us is.

57:36.520 --> 57:42.960
But en route to get there, I wanted to first talk about System76. They have the Oryx Pro.

57:42.960 --> 57:48.920
They've recently revved to 4K. Now, I've experimented a bit. I've got one of the Dell machines.

57:48.920 --> 57:53.280
It's like a Sputnik edition that has a 4K monitor. And I found that there's some rough

57:53.280 --> 57:55.400
edges, but overall not too bad.

57:55.400 --> 58:00.640
And so when System76 announced the Oryx Pro with a 4K screen, they did it in a way that

58:00.640 --> 58:05.000
was sort of more intriguing than average, because they said, we also made some tweaks.

58:05.000 --> 58:11.640
We made some changes. We made some patches. We've sent these upstream to make 4K Linux

58:11.640 --> 58:13.360
even better.

58:13.360 --> 58:16.840
And I thought this would be an interesting way to discuss this, because System76 is one

58:16.840 --> 58:22.320
of the few vendors in the general x86 platform space that is all in on Linux.

58:22.320 --> 58:26.120
Now, there's others. I just mentioned earlier, like you're working on my Apollo Entraware

58:26.120 --> 58:30.640
right there. There's Zarr Reason. There's Dell, like I said, just a second ago, ships

58:30.640 --> 58:31.640
a Linux machine.

58:31.640 --> 58:34.960
There's other vendors in the space. So it's not like the oxygen has been sucked out of

58:34.960 --> 58:38.720
the room, but it definitely feels like when I climb up a hill, I'm starting to hyperventilate

58:38.720 --> 58:39.720
a bit.

58:39.720 --> 58:45.120
And so I thought maybe we could segue into this discussion, because Ryan, Mr. Ryan Sipes,

58:45.120 --> 58:49.600
has joined us from System76. And I think he has a few insights in the new Oryx Pro. So

58:49.600 --> 58:52.440
Ryan, welcome back to the Unplugged program, sir.

58:52.440 --> 58:55.200
Hey, I'm happy to be back.

58:55.200 --> 59:01.200
So Mr. Sipes, what's the lowdown on this new Oryx Pro? Rumor has it there may have been

59:01.200 --> 59:07.360
a few tweaks. And I'm wondering, when System76 started to go 4K, did they find like everything

59:07.360 --> 59:11.200
just worked great out of the box? Or is this one of those things where you kind of have

59:11.200 --> 59:15.480
to ship a custom image to make everything work? And what led you from point A to point

59:15.480 --> 59:18.120
B? Go for it.

59:18.120 --> 59:26.720
So we are really, really focused on producing a good product that feels good from the ground

59:26.720 --> 59:34.200
up. And one thing that prevented us from shipping 4K earlier was we just didn't feel like it

59:34.200 --> 59:40.600
was a very solid experience. Some people have not had a bad experience, but I've heard a

59:40.600 --> 59:45.840
lot of folks who, you know, purchase like the Sputnik and they're like, well, if you

59:45.840 --> 59:53.120
just run stock Ubuntu, there are a lot of problems and it's not really the best experience.

59:53.120 --> 01:00:06.240
And so we were kind of waiting for Ubuntu and Unity to really have excellent 4K support

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:14.240
before we shipped. And ultimately, we kept testing it, you know, once every week or every

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:20.600
other week. And then finally, we realized, hey, this isn't so bad. We could probably

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:29.000
send some patches upstream and work with some developers over at Canonical and Ubuntu in

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:36.360
the Ubuntu community and really make it a very nice experience. And so we started working

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:45.680
on that. And yeah, I've got a list of things that we did and I'd like to share that with

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.680
your group here.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:52.960
Yeah, because I'm curious, Ryan, you know, my experience with Ubuntu out of the box is

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.680
it's not aware that I'm on a high DPI display, but I can go in there, I can drag that little

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:03.000
scaling slider up a bit and the launcher looks better and, you know, stuff generally looks

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.860
like it renders better. So I'm assuming what you guys did was more than just by default

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.680
set that DPI scaler to higher.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:16.840
Yeah, that's one of the changes that we made. And we do that through our driver that ships

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:23.120
with every machine. But we also have been working with Unity developers and I have to

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:32.640
give a shout out to our engineers, both Jason Drozd and really David Jordan, who I think

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:38.440
you may have shared a video of him once when talking about System76 on one of your podcasts,

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:45.840
but he's been doing the lion's share of the work on making adjustments and making patches

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:52.400
to make this all really a great experience. And then Cassidy, who is part of the elementary

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.760
team, he's our web developer. He's actually the guy who's been pushing really hard for

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.680
4K, for us to ship a 4K machine for a while now.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.680
Good man.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.480
Shout out to Cassidy.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:12.840
And he has done a ton of testing as well. And him and David have both filed lots of

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:21.520
bug reports as well as sent patches where they could. So I know David's been working

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:28.920
with some of the Unity developers to get proper high DPI scaling support into Unity and the

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:38.600
Unity settings daemon. And he also went ahead and set the scaling in our driver. So if somebody

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:43.000
gets one of our machines, it's all out of the box. It's already got the proper scaling.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:50.960
We also set the console fonts on the virtual terminal so that it's the proper size out

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.960
of the box.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.800
Yeah, for sure. Nice touch.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:59.760
We also have been filing bugs against applications that are used on Ubuntu but aren't quite

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:05.780
perfect because of the toolkit that they use. And so, for instance, GIMP with the scaling

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:13.680
settings looks OK. But really, a lot of these applications, not just GIMP, could use, like

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:19.320
if they're GTK2 apps, if they're ported to GTK3, they have much better support for high

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:26.800
DPI displays. And so we've been trying to work with those projects and file bug reports

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:32.560
to say, like, hey, this is something that you guys should be thinking about.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:39.480
And then we've also been identifying the issues and documenting them along with known solutions

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:45.320
or workarounds. So one of those things we documented was where to get a high DPI theme

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:51.120
for GIMP. And we're going to be releasing that in a blog post and then also a support

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:58.240
doc for anybody out there who's using a high DPI display to take advantage of. And it will

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.260
just have a ton of resources for how to change settings so that they better support high

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:07.820
DPI or, in the case of things like GIMP and other projects, like where maybe to download

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:12.240
a high DPI theme or something like that.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:21.160
And then finally, we're talking about back porting the default theme in 16.10 to 16.04

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:29.240
because it's a little bit crisper and it just looks better in high DPI. And we still ship

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.440
machines with the LTS. So we think that people would appreciate that.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:41.440
Ryan, what's your sense of the conflict between creating a product that is unique and stands

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:46.440
out? So in this case, high resolution display, maybe better battery life, things that you

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:51.600
want – you guys want to ship as a company, as a product. How much discussion happens

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:57.520
internally from – well, what can we break off as our own driver, PPA and package? And

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:01.360
we're just going to say this is what we're going to deviate from the norm, from the Ubuntu

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:07.520
base. And how much does trying to stick to the Ubuntu base weigh on you when System76

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:12.040
is making a decision? Because what I'm hearing a little bit and I think this is perfectly

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:17.400
understandable is in order to make a standout competitive product, System76 is having to

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:22.520
go more off into the weeds a bit and do some of their own engineering, do some of their

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:29.320
own presets, configure some of these things out of the box that are forking a bit from

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:33.000
the Ubuntu defaults and probably forking in a way – not forking is the right way, but

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:40.560
deviating in a way that makes for a better product. How much of a line is that to walk

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.120
internally? Do you have a sense of that?

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:52.680
So we always do that to some extent. And also, unlike other vendors that are shipping computers,

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:58.160
we are shipping an open source operating system. So there's some onus on us to contribute

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:19.360
where we can. The thing is, it would be nice to see maybe more on the part of people reaching

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:28.680
out to vendors like us and maybe helping to plan around a release. And this goes for Sputnik

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:35.760
as well. I'm not sure how often the Dell team over there talks to Canonical or the

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:43.540
Ubuntu community. But when working on this release, it would be nice to have maybe some

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:55.520
more communication. But I guess that could be achieved via the community route. And often

01:06:55.520 --> 01:07:00.880
times with this, we didn't want to be really loud about it in the community and raise a

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:09.840
bunch of issues on behalf of System76 for the 4K high DPI product because we were worried

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:15.880
about running into serious issues and not being able to ship it, but having gotten people's

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:26.920
hopes up. But at the same time, I guess to answer your question, there's a lot of onus

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:34.120
that fell on us with this product. But we couldn't have shipped anything else because

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:43.080
of our dedication to not shipping a substandard product. And we wanted to make sure that high

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:46.880
DPI support was really solid before we shipped it out.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:54.340
I have heard from probably 50 different listeners that said, yeah, a system that I can put five

01:07:54.340 --> 01:08:02.320
terabytes of storage in and get 4K display. I'm going to buy that. I look at that and

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:07.480
I go, as long as all of the applications you need are available under Linux, there's really

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:16.840
no reason that that wouldn't work as a serious workhorse. That's a nice machine.

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:23.040
I think for myself, I don't want to classify myself or label myself as a particular thing,

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:30.360
but when I look at buying a laptop to run Linux, I could really give two shits about

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:35.800
the out-of-the-box experience of the installed OS because if it's going to be Ubuntu Unity,

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:40.880
I'm likely going to be reloading anyways to Arch and Gnome 3.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:47.400
And so I really want fantastic hardware for me to get my work done. And I really think

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:51.960
that this is probably one of the best machines out there. I haven't tried the 4K orcs. I

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:58.120
would love to get my hands on it and try it because I am a high DPI Linux skeptic. I believe

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:03.440
it on some platforms, on some desktops, and on others, I'm a total skeptic.

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:09.520
So I think that's one of the things that's really tricky about 4K under Linux is it absolutely

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:13.440
depends on your implementation. If you think you're going to go run XFCE under 4K, screw

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:16.920
you. Don't talk to me. I don't want to hear it. You're off on your own. I know it can

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:21.680
be done your own. Yeah. Fine. You know what? Put your glasses on and squint. Fine. But

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.880
it really is going to depend on your implementation. So that's why I'm curious about some of the

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:32.400
tweaks System76 has made. I'm curious about people that end up with a 4K orcs and load

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:40.400
GNOME 3 on there, something GTK 3.22 with beautiful high DPI support. I got an email

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:46.200
a couple of days ago from somebody that said Linux high DPI support is a disaster. It is

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:51.960
just totally unbaked. It is unusable. And I was reading it on a machine that's high

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:59.160
DPI that I've literally had zero high DPI issues. I have a MacBook Retina 15-inch that

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:07.960
you set up right here live on this show, running Arch with GNOME 3.22 right now, all high DPI

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:16.560
and no problems. Really, anything that's GTK just looks great. It just looks better than

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:22.160
Mac OS looks on the same hardware. It really honestly does. And I just absolutely just

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:27.800
looks better. It looks so good. And I'm reading this guy's email where he tells me how high

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:35.000
DPI support totally doesn't work under Linux. Well, yeah, you're using XFCE. Yeah, exactly.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.640
That's what you should expect right now. I'm sorry. So the implementation really, really

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:40.640
matters.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:46.040
And sometimes even the programs you end up using and what tool could they use.

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:49.800
I think the majority of our audience just needs access to very powerful hardware with

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:54.920
great resolution screens. And they will figure out if they want to run Unity with the System

01:10:54.920 --> 01:11:01.080
76 package installed, or if they want to run GNOME 3, or if they want to run Plasma 5 or

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:04.360
Unity. It's just a great machine, I suspect.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:08.040
And I mean, it's something to think if more people have access to 4K hardware, can start

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:12.400
figuring things out, helping the community figure out what we need to do better.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.360
And like I said, we're going to release a blog post that has some of the things that

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:23.880
we've noticed still kind of suck under 4K. And I'm hoping that the hive mind here can

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:29.840
help out those people working on those projects, or at least file bugs when they get their

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:37.040
hands on, for instance, the 4K orcs.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:42.480
There are some things about the orcs that I want to share because I work for the company

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.480
and it's...

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:54.760
I would love to take this time to use my 10 minutes of fame to put a bug in their ear.

01:11:54.760 --> 01:12:02.600
So one thing that we heard a lot during the MacBook Pro blow up was, why aren't you shipping

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:10.920
a 4K device? And we are now shipping a 4K device. And it has 3.1 million more pixels

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.560
than the MacBook Pro Retina.

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.560
Whoa.

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:22.600
The Oryx Pro, a lot of people talk about its size. Well, that's what you get when you put

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:32.960
a desktop grade GPU in a laptop. And I would love to see somebody use some of the same

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:37.520
applications side by side on a MacBook Pro and the Oryx and tell me which one they want

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:44.200
to use for their day-to-day work on accomplishing big boy stuff.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:48.440
Ryan, how many times do you guys get questions asking if they can be hackintoshed? Because

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.920
I've probably gotten about 35 emails asking if the Oryx Pro can be hackintoshed. You guys

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:59.680
get that? You know? I get that a lot. And they're not going to not run Linux.

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:02.680
They just want all three of that triple-boot goodness.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:08.320
I would tell you my semi-educated guess would be, ain't going to work because the GTX 10

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:14.360
graphics card... There's no Mac that ships with good graphics, so you're kind of in luck

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.360
there.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:22.120
Yeah, I get that question quite a lot. But one thing I will say that I'm hoping that

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:30.040
all of Linux will benefit from is recently we started working pretty closely with a couple

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:38.360
guys over at Nvidia. And we have a direct line to them now, and we've used that relationship

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:48.720
to improve people's experience on using Nvidia and say, like, hey, this is a problem, and

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:55.080
talk about things that need to be patched.

01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:02.960
I say that to encourage people to, if you can, don't throw Mac OS on this beautiful

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:10.160
machine. Run Linux on it, and we're making sure that the hardware just works out of the

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:16.760
box and is a great experience. And there's other stuff coming down the pike that I think

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:27.600
people using these machines will really appreciate. And so give us a shot. We put a lot of blood,

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:35.880
sweat and tears into this release specifically, and we'd love to have this set the standard

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:43.240
for what a 4K device can be with Linux preloaded. And to your earlier point, and I think you're

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:48.600
going to talk about this more, as far as we know, we are the largest Linux-only vendor

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:54.680
in the world at this point. So just want to put that out there. So I would encourage folks

01:14:54.680 --> 01:15:02.280
to give us a try. We have a 30-day guarantee, so if you don't love the machine, we'll

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.280
refund you.

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:07.200
Aaron Ross Powell You know what, Ryan? You should get a bonus

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.920
stipend as a natural salesman. You are great at that. And I think that was pretty well

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:19.080
said. It is – I think System76 has really gotten a lot of people's attention just

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:24.660
based on the emails I've gotten from CoderRadio. So just a side note, Michael Dominic has

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:29.020
recently gotten the Lemur and I would encourage you, if you're curious, to hear about a

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:34.640
Mac OS primary – he's a developer and he just really cares about shipping apps.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:41.320
And he has been switching from an app store, creating phone apps for Android and iOS to

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:47.160
server-side apps. And when he started looking at doing more and more server-side stuff,

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:50.320
he kind of started looking at developing for Ubuntu.

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:54.380
And he needed a new machine. It all kind of lined up and he got a Lemur. And the first

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:58.120
couple of weeks – the first couple of weeks went really good. A couple of weeks in, he

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:03.000
hit some road bumps. And now he's like five weeks in and he's like sprinted past them.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.680
And they're all kind of documented like the last four or five weeks of CoderRadio

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:10.440
if you're curious at all and want to go check that out. Just to hear – you know,

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.120
somebody who's switching for completely practical reasons …

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.400
Matthew Feeney Has real work to get done.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:17.240
Aaron Ross Powell Not for advocacy reasons. And yeah, it's

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:22.460
fascinating because like in the latest episode, he goes on his trip for – a family trip

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:27.320
and he can only take one machine with him and he brings the Lemur.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:33.280
And that was interesting. So, anyways, I want to now talk about a little bit, Wes, just

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:45.960
your thoughts on 2020. The year 2020. Microsoft's making like the Studio 3, Apple's still

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:49.640
shipping the same exact MacBook they ship today, but it's got this touch bar on it

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:50.640
still, right?

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.640
It's like twice as big.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:58.800
Don't do anything. It's the same exact Mac. And more PC vendors are falling by the

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.240
wayside. Is this a legitimate scenario in your mind? Is this something that we should

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.660
actually worry about? Are we heading towards this monolithic vendor platform where the

01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:14.120
general PC that you throw together is going to be extinct? And one last thing before I

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:20.320
completely throw it to you is, I'll tell you what, hand on heart, it seems like it

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:25.360
is getting shittier and shittier to build your own PC. Like you order – say you're

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:29.240
going to build like four or five PCs at once. You order the parts off – oh, I don't

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:34.760
know, those jerks over at Newegg. And they all show up and two out of the three parts

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:39.880
don't work. And now when you build a PC, it's constantly, well, do I have to RMA

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:45.540
this part? Is this not the right thing? It's the worst. It has gotten – if you do one

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:50.200
PC and all your parts show up and everything works, good for you. Congratulations. You

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:53.840
win the internet for the day. But for those of us that might try to build multiple machines

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:58.520
at once and you get all of the same effing parts, it's not like you get all the weird

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:02.560
parts. Three of the same motherboards, three of the same video cards, three of the same

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.200
sticks of RAM, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.560
I think you'll forever be burned by this.

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.240
Well, it just recently happened to the beard too.

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.240
Oh no.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.880
Yeah, I'm sure he'll tell you all about it on user error coming up. Anyways, my point

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:18.960
is it's getting to be shitty out there. For those of us that want a general PC platform

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:23.320
based on the x86 chip that I can just throw Linux on there. Thank God there's still

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:27.120
vendors out there shipping Linux-specific machines. But I am worried about the year

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:33.840
2020, Wes. And do you share my chicken little outlook or do you think things are just going

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:40.200
to be fine and dandy? For those of us who want a non-secure boot, non-lockdown, non-ARM

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:46.880
licensed platform that we can just install Linux and get work done.

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:53.360
I think it's plausible. I think there's still a large inertia in the enterprise sector.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:58.520
I think Dell has that pretty well done and their competitors in that arena in terms of

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:02.720
business workstations just for right now. I don't know how long that will take. But

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:08.400
I do think what you're saying is very plausible in the consumer space, the mobile phonification

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:12.400
of these. And then it's a couple of large vendors. It starts getting blurred between

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.440
like, what do they make? It's a tablet, it's a tablet and a computer. Oh, your computer

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:19.280
is just a big touch screen. Where does this draw? So I could definitely see that people

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:25.120
will get used to buying in that model, a normal computer where you just have an LCD monitor

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.400
that isn't a touch screen. We have a keyboard and a mouse unless you're doing a lot of work

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:33.360
at home or you can't get a nice little keyboard. I could see a lot of people doing that especially.

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:38.440
And then maybe they still have their Dell OEM thing at work for their engineering job

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:43.760
or something. But I don't know where that puts a consumer person who just wants to buy

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:47.960
a thousand doesn't need to buy a thousand. It probably will mean that market shrinks.

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:51.900
It may mean that building your own computer is no longer less expensive or even competitive

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:55.800
with buying something that you could get. And you may just need to start doing things

01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:01.320
like maybe the people like System76 still competing or IX systems that get yourself

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:06.520
built a custom system. But I definitely see it could be bleak. We'll see just how bad

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:07.520
it gets though.

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.680
Anybody in the Mamba Room want to jump in on the topic before we move on? If you have

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:14.280
any thoughts on the year 2020 and how it's going to look for the general PC platform

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:19.240
and loading Linux. I know it's kind of out there. But it's something I've been thinking

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:22.960
about when I look at like the response to the Surface Studio and people like oh my god

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:29.320
Microsoft is innovating. Oh man this is incredible. Look at them. Oh the touch bar. Like anyway

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:32.360
anybody in the Mamba Room have any thoughts on that?

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:39.920
I still think that going second. Let me see going second hand would be better or I still

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:45.160
believe in building your own. I know you've had issue and maybe Rekai has issue but that

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:51.480
doesn't necessarily mean everybody's going to. And most people that I know who still

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:57.840
build know that's going to be a thing that they watch out for that. So unfortunately

01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:03.560
it's a thing that you have to watch out for. So keep in mind and it'll always be there.

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:09.840
I feel like building your own is the ultimate. And me personally I still try to build my

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:16.080
own. But also if someone's asking me or a family member or a friend I still try to suggest

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:23.420
something that will be Linux friendly. Like Dell still does XPS with Linux. You know System

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:33.760
D6 is definitely up there. Introware. Even Purism. I mean you know I try to just do that.

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:40.480
I'll say this too just in defense of build your own. The systems that we successfully

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:45.720
where the hardware works and all of those. Those systems are so unbelievably rock solid.

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:50.400
They're like the best computers ever. In fact that computer right there is a system we built

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:56.940
years ago that was first built as a hackintosh. Then it was the main presentation machine

01:21:56.940 --> 01:22:02.500
that I used for visuals on the stream. Then it was my primary workstation. Then it was

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:08.280
a temporary editing system for Linux Fest Northwest. And now it's our mumble slash Skype

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:12.640
system. And it's got to be six years old. And it is a custom build system that has just

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:18.520
been a rock solid totally great performer. But Bitmux I want to give you a chance to

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:24.280
jump in on why you're not really so worried about the commodity market drying up. Go ahead.

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:29.880
I think it's definitely going to shift. I think we'll see perhaps a reduction in number

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:34.300
of individual parts available or number of manufacturers available making motherboards

01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:39.600
and individual parts and pieces. But NVIDIA is not going away and ASUS and Intel they're

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:45.000
not going to go away. And they're always going to be building hardware that's going to work

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:51.520
in the server market because obviously that's not going away either. So I think x86 I mean

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:56.920
as a platform is going to be competed with by other platforms. ARM is already competing

01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:01.440
and yes it's closed. Yes that's not good. However I don't think it's going to disappear

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:06.480
on us until you get something like quantum computing or some completely generational

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:11.080
leap in which case I'm not too worried that the Linux community is not going to jump on

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.160
board there if it's at all possible.

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:18.520
I like that. That's a fair take. I think that sounds pretty rational. And Mr. Sipes I'll

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.240
give you the closing thought on the topic. Go ahead Ryan.

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:28.720
So the only thing about building your own and I have a machine beside me that I built

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:35.840
a couple of years back that I still love and it works great is that when you build your

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:44.880
own they have no idea. The vendors of like for instance Nvidia and Intel and the motherboard

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:51.760
have no idea what operating system that you're running on that machine. And so versus like

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:59.160
buying something from system 76 or another Linux vendor those people are actively saying

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:09.160
to the folks the vendors like hey we're running Linux on this. All these purchases that we

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:15.800
purchase from you are for Linux machines and that equals voting with your wallet. And so

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:23.160
you see better Linux support as a result of that. There's a reason why Nvidia is now we're

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:28.040
now able to talk to Nvidia directly and that's because we've managed to buy enough of their

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:33.720
products that it's worth their time to have a conversation with us. And so there is an

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:38.840
element when you buy a machine of voting with your voting with your wallet and that's why

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:45.200
I discourage people from buying Windows machines with Windows licenses because that's being

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:50.140
chalked up to another Windows sale which means more more time and resources going into making

01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:57.480
sure that that hardware supports Windows well and not into making it support Linux well.

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:05.240
And this was one of the reasons that I joined system 76 so that we could have you know so

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:10.480
that I could help a company that's going to make Linux a better experience on hardware

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:17.240
period. And so I would just ask that everybody take that into account before you before you

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:22.920
buy a machine from like Lenovo that's got Windows pre-installed throw Linux on it. You

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:28.480
know think about what that is what you're voting for. You're going for a secure boot.

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:30.360
Oh get it out of here.

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:35.960
Gollum has been thrown down Mr. Sykes I like it and I tend I tend to agree. In fact I often

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:40.080
you know I talk about I talk about voting with your wallet in a big sense because I

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:46.760
think it just being able to represent that market is is pretty important. And I don't

01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:50.740
know if until you really think about it you know you know it might not cross your mind

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:54.180
you know you look at how I look for this kind of thing I want this keyboard or I want the

01:25:54.180 --> 01:26:00.880
nipple here or I want the this this functionality that does this and that's sort of what predominantly

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:05.120
might drive your decision. But as you sort of look at this from an advocacy standpoint

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:11.040
you do have to think well what is in my best long term interest as the platform that I

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:16.440
want to use to get my work done. You know for me I not only do I use Linux because I

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:23.080
love it. Right I love it Wes. I love it. But I use Linux because it's the best platform

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:28.920
for me to get my work done. My work. Wes the work stuff the stuff that I use that pays

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:34.360
the bills that puts the cereal in my children's mouth. The work. Well unfortunately the work

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:40.560
I do depends on Linux. And so when you think about a platform that makes you money it's

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:43.920
a whole it's a whole different way of thinking about it. It's a whole different perspective

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:51.960
it's a whole different lens to look at Linux and your investment in this long term success.

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:55.440
The reason you want to use Linux as a general computing platform is because it doesn't have

01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.740
that strategy tax and and the way to make it a successful long term platform on desktop

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:07.320
hardware is by voting with your wallet and buying from companies that support Linux out

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:15.440
of the box. And I mean I am I'm often tempted you know because myself I have a workflow

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:19.560
that works best with Final Cut. So I'm tempted like gosh it would be nice to have a faster

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:26.680
laptop that I do will boot Final Cut. I mean Mac Mac Mac OS whatever they call it. Essentially

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:32.160
Final Cut OS and Arch Desktop. Right. That's what I would like to be able to do. And so

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:36.760
it's tempting from just like I can get more work done faster standpoint. Very practical.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.900
That's very like right now. You know what it means is if this if I can get this done

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:44.800
faster that means I get to go sit on the couch and snuggle sooner. And that is what it's

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:51.520
really about. It's about being able to YouTube and chill. I don't want to have to work extra

01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.960
when I can have a machine that does a job faster. And so when I look at that orcs and

01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:01.080
I look at other systems like that are just super ass fast. I just I oh man I hope more

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:05.520
and more professionals go that way so that way one day my workflow is available on there.

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:11.440
I can do like 98 percent of my job closer every year but it's like not quite. And now

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.480
I am so close. I'm like I'm like I'm like on the boat and I'm starving and I can see

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:22.640
the coast but I can't yet get to land. It's torturous. So Mr. West you have the Apollo

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:28.440
there running Fedora 25. I mean I don't know yet. I just noticed that you have given me

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:33.920
back the gauntlet here the red Toshiba 16 gigabyte drive. The flag has been laid down.

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:37.880
So let's find out if you went into legacy boot mode if you had to if you used EUFI and

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:46.120
if Fedora 25 is booting. But first Linux Academy Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged is where

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:50.040
you go to support the show. It's a platform created by Linux enthusiast. For those of

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:57.080
you who want to learn more about Linux make some money improve your career or your skill

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:01.320
set or even just challenge yourself. Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged. That's where

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:06.880
you go to support the show and sign up for a seven day free trial. I like this because

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:10.560
it doesn't matter sort of what your bent is on training. If you want to go after certs

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:14.200
they have course tracks for you. If you want to just actually improve your skill set they

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:19.080
have hands on scenario based labs to give you real world experience on real servers.

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:22.320
If you're interested in like certain types of content they have learning paths that give

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.240
you highlights on those particular tracks. And the other thing that's really nice is

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:29.560
if you're a company they have team accounts so a bunch of you can work together. So you're

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:33.280
going to implement something new at your business and you want to train everybody on it. Linux

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:37.640
Academy has courseware on that. They just recently closed another round of funding and

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:41.920
every time they do that they invest back into the courseware. It just gets better and better.

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:46.840
Improve on the existing courseware and then create new stuff that I mean like at first

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:50.640
when they launched the I'll be honest when they launched the Azure courseware I was like

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:55.280
really Azure. But now like months months and months later it's like oh yeah obviously of

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:59.480
course because it's not just the essentials like how you build a Linux system or how it

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:03.120
works or how you fundamentally interact with Linux or how you do some of the basic networking

01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:06.640
essentials but it's all of this stuff around Linux too as a platform.

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.280
And I think that shows that they're not you know they're not playing catch up. They're

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:13.520
giving you things like when they're hot you know and before when they're when Linux Academy

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:16.560
sees that people are really using them works getting done they are professionals in the

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:17.560
industry so they know.

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:20.540
It's kind of nice too if you're a listener of this show you're going to love the community

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:23.520
it's stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members because they've been a sponsor with

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:27.760
us since the very beginning Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged and a big thank you

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:34.800
to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:42.200
So I want to ask Ike Mr. Solace on Twitter Mr. at Solace project on Twitter the heart

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:46.360
behind Solace a distribution that puts the middle finger to everybody else's face and

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:52.640
does it its own way and and I really got to respect it because it's it really is a desktop

01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:57.240
operating systems designed for modern computing we were talking about on the pre show which

01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:01.960
maybe will be in the post show of this show that sort of makes a list stand out from a

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:07.320
woe that I was suffering under arch and we've kind of been checking with Ike over the year

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:12.080
as he's been doing major improvements and of course Josh is a longtime community member

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:18.240
as well he stopped by and so I've been thinking about something recently that seems impossible

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:23.640
and it's only going to get me trolled so I thought Ike would be the best person to consult

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.920
obviously so Ike welcome back to the Linux Unplugged show.

01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:28.240
Thanks for having me.

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:37.280
So I wanted to genuinely and I really truly mean this I wanted to test the usability feel

01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:45.060
of different desktop environments and distributions like comparing KDE Plasma and KWin to say

01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:50.960
gnome clutter mutter gnome shell and just the feel of all like how do you measure the

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:56.680
feel of something and the reason why I thought of you Ike is because Solace feels like it's

01:31:56.680 --> 01:32:03.220
one of those distributions where how the desktop feels how fast it feels how it all goes together

01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:07.040
how softwares install how all of that feels is part of the consideration it's one of

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:12.680
those unquantifiable things that almost just comes down to taste and perception and so

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:17.200
I feel like maybe this is an impossible goal of mine but I wanted to pick your brain as

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:20.840
not just a distro maintainer but as somebody who's thinking about the feel of it all

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:21.840
the time.

01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:22.840
How do you measure it?

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:27.200
How do I how do I review and benchmark it?

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:32.680
Well I mean it's kind of a case of benchmarking real performance versus perceived performance

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:39.480
which is how fast the user thinks something is and the the changes we've had in operating

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:44.040
systems in the last few years especially with the advent of system D with having things

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:50.920
start later in the boot process we've kind of moved towards perceived performance as

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:55.240
an example when you log into a desktop your networking isn't actually ready yet it's

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:59.860
starting up and then it's ready after you've logged in so I think that's more of the question

01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:04.960
isn't it like how do users think things are fast even if they're not?

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:10.800
I mean the best example of that really is with material design it's completely focused

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:15.360
on the perceived performance of something which is why you have short snappy animations

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:20.720
that can't be beyond say 300 milliseconds and they've got to use circular tweening so

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:25.160
it doesn't look like there's any delay in the start and end of any animation and I think

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:28.720
that's what it all really comes down to is how fast does it really look does it feel

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:33.900
like it's responding immediately to a click and as an example of that one of the quite

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:39.440
clever tricks I've seen in Unity 8 is even if an application is not launched yet there

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:44.720
is a window there and that window is a placeholder until that application is ready you see something

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:48.960
similar in Endless OS as well where they have a placeholder window waiting for the application

01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:54.460
to load you have a spinner and then the application is there so it feels like the system is responding

01:33:54.460 --> 01:34:00.220
immediately the alternative would be something like LibreOffice where it doesn't show up

01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:05.640
for a couple of seconds and then you see that window so you're thinking okay it's slower

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:10.920
on this distro I don't know why it just seems like this distro is slower and we've had that

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:16.600
said about solos as well LibreOffice feels slower on solos it actually takes the same

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:22.160
amount of time to start up it's just that splash window doesn't show at the same time

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:26.840
so it's not really a case of real performance is being measured anymore it's how long did

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:32.360
the user wait for a reaction to an input event.

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:36.080
That's kind of what I was thinking like and measuring like how the windows move across

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:39.640
the screen as you drag them and things like that like what's that what's that impact like

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:43.600
when you when you move something when you interact with an object on the screen.

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:47.360
Right and there's probably an element too of you know like where's the user's focus

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:50.920
in this event so as long as that that part is snappy and responsive you can have other

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.800
things in the background that they're not paying attention to.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:55.960
Yeah and they have to feel like they've got absolute control so the example of the window

01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:00.000
something I remember from Compass a couple of years ago dragging the window across the

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:05.000
screen it felt like the window was slightly drifting it wasn't quite stuck to the mouse

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.720
and it's like okay is this just slower it just wasn't slow that was at the time that

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:15.760
was the cool thing to do because it was gliding across had an inertia yeah yeah but nowadays

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:19.480
it's like no it's got to be exactly where I am it's got to be the immediate second I

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:26.320
do something it's reacting but that also has the downside of nowadays it let's have spinny

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:32.000
bars and progress bars and radial progresses everywhere instead of actually making the

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.840
thing itself faster or asynchronous.

01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:45.440
All right so just between between us I don't so you have I understand pretty clearly on

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:49.240
the plasma desktop you got Kaywin which is responsible for throwing all the shit up on

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:55.080
the screen and under Gnome 3 you've got Mudder right I think so far I'm on track and under

01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:57.280
Unity you have Compiz.

01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:02.600
What do I have on Solus that is throwing the shit up on the screen you know and maybe theoretically

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.800
talking to my GPU?

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:11.000
So at the moment with well with a Budgie desktop we make use of Mudder as well now to make

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:17.880
a distinction because people often get the impression that Budgie is a gnome shell that's

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:24.680
not gnome shell we use some of the same libraries but basically I don't like Mudder anymore

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:28.520
and I know I'll get flack for that but it's for gnome shell it should be for gnome shell

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:33.080
I shouldn't be using it anymore so basically the way it works with Mudder and that particular

01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:38.680
pipeline is actually quite heavy so instead of just having a window as to rendering directly

01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:43.500
to this bit of memory and it's shown on your display because you're using compositing that's

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:48.000
actually shown that's actually rendered to a buffer first and then the compositor basically

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.640
does them all you know it's compositing them so you've got all these different windows

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:55.560
and it's making a new texture out of them before it shows them to the GPU.

01:36:55.560 --> 01:37:00.800
In Mudder itself you've got several layers for that you've got Coggle you've got Clutter

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:06.480
itself and now they have private forks inside that so Clutter is basically the scene graph

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:13.200
on top of Coggle which is a GL abstraction layer on top of OpenGL so yeah so there's

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:18.920
quite a few layers now in terms of gnome shell and one of the questions people asked before

01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:22.940
about Mudder and they ask it for us in Budgie as well is why don't you implement better

01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:29.480
effects the chief among them that everybody wants is from compass right it's blurs everybody

01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:34.980
wants a blur behind the window or a panel because iOS made it sexy so investigated the

01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:41.000
same thing for Budgie myself but the way in which Mudder is set up with the pipeline and

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.840
process I can't apply say like you would in a game you just apply a shader right and you've

01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:50.120
got that bit of transparency there well you know obviously to blur that bit behind it

01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:54.920
you have your Z index that's all fine the way that things are done in Mudder is completely

01:37:54.920 --> 01:38:01.280
different each one of them is a sec is a separate object on the frame buffer right so you would

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:06.600
then have to apply behind that object you'd have to read the pixels behind for every time

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:11.520
you did a render yeah which would make something like a blur effect incredibly expensive on

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:16.960
Mudder but if you was to say I don't know write a new compositor then perhaps it wouldn't

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:22.320
be so if oh so you hit if a new compositor were to come along that would be a bigger

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:27.540
undertaking for some yeah like say I don't know if it was a goal for Budgie 12 to drop

01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:32.680
the last of the normal components because Budgie 11 were departing from Budgie from

01:38:32.680 --> 01:38:39.840
Nome basically Budgie 12 will see as completely disconnected from the the underpinnings of

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:45.440
Nome itself so we still want to be compatible in all applications don't get me wrong no

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:50.560
maps are kind of cool but the way that we went about it is a lot of the time Budgie

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:55.960
pretends to be Nome shell to make things work like keyboard shortcuts yeah because that's

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:59.840
the way the Nome stack has gone in the way it's not really as reusable as it once was

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:07.360
Nome settings demon when you take a screenshot it tries to talk to org.nome.shell.dbus so

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:12.400
things like that we have to pretend so Budgie 11 starting to remove all that Budgie 12 it'll

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:18.840
be completely removed i.e. not even Mudder will be left hin hin.

01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:24.600
So I what I'm hearing is I mean sort of indirectly is if I want the absolute smoothest desktop

01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:28.600
I should probably use Kwin still I mean I like that's what I should is there a way to

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:34.080
use Kwin as my compositor because I don't know I want to test super smooth desktops

01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:38.120
and I'm worried I'm honestly worried that Mudder is gonna fail this test is what I'm

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:43.260
thinking and all of the desktops that use Mudder will probably fail as well.

01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:49.200
Basically yeah I mean Mudder itself I mean it works for Nome shell it does what they

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:54.380
want to do and I don't want to knock that but for what we want out like the other guys

01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:59.000
who are thinking beyond Nome shell what we want from the desktop which is you know super

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.040
fluid and a genuine open GL compositor and hopefully Vulkan in the future but I know

01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:08.800
they're not receptive to that at the moment then yeah Kwin is probably your best option

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:14.680
because Compiz is basically you've got two versions of Compiz you've got Unity and you've

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:20.760
got Mate and yeah you could probably make your own custom desktop session using Kwin.

01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:24.880
Okay all right all right Whitby do you have any thoughts as far as this stuff kind of

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:29.720
matters is the end user experience I mean I'm not actually I'm not clear on how this

01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:34.000
works with the Mate desktop I know with Ubuntu Mate I can switch to Compiz I can switch to

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:39.160
software rendering and I generally switch to Compiz if I can and I'm wondering if you

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:42.600
have any kind of closing thoughts on this particular topic.

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:47.440
So in the Mate tweak you can switch between different window managers and compositors

01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:55.080
and if you install Metacity and Mudder they will appear as things that you can switch

01:40:55.080 --> 01:41:02.620
to in Mate tweak and the reason that Mudder has never been you know installed or advocated

01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:08.960
by myself is because it it's completely inappropriate for the Mate desktop just as Aiki described

01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:14.560
it's not not a window manager that I should be using and I'll actually pull that intelligence

01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:18.080
out of Mate tweak that runs with that.

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:26.380
With regards to Compiz I made some changes to Compiz that adds the Mate support so that

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:37.120
it comes pre bundled with a set of plugins sanely configured for the Mate desktop specifically.

01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:41.480
Now I feel like I should go on a Kaywin Bender should I have installed the KDE on here I'm

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:46.120
thinking yeah I'm thinking so so Wes how did it go let's let's tune in here real quick

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:47.120
to find out.

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:48.640
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:50.800
Oh I secretly use Arch Linux.

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:54.980
So how did the Fedora 25 challenge go for you Wes how did it turn out were you able

01:41:54.980 --> 01:42:00.440
to get it to boot yeah I don't know what you mean how you managed to screw that up Chris

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:03.620
but here give it a shot no problem you know what I think it was as I just said like here

01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:09.320
reclaim all the space hit enter and then let it then I let it go so oh look at that Wes

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:16.400
look at that right there right into the right boom boom that's nice Wes that looks good

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:21.040
I will say it's on the Wi-Fi it's on the Wi-Fi ready for your use I will say you have two

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:26.400
hard drives in there it did use both of them so it set up a yeah ext4 on top of LVM yeah

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.280
swap partition as well so hopefully that's what you want that was what I tried to do

01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:33.860
originally so that's perfect wow very nice you know it's what were your you know just

01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:37.740
quick impressions using the Apollo what you think I like that machine yeah I could see

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:41.400
getting a lot of work done on that yeah I feel like it's gonna be nice I feel like it's

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:45.200
a five-year machine yes definitely it's a good size it's a good weight and it looks

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:49.480
premium I feel like that metal look is not going anywhere so yeah and I'm just like I'm

01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:53.600
sitting here holding with one hand just tossing around and it still feels super solid keyboard

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.880
yeah so fedora 25 this will be probably one of my primary drivers but I think I might

01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:04.280
I think I might try the I'm sure there's a KD version right I've never really done that

01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:08.000
during a fedora review so that'll be weird for me I should probably get ISOs downloading

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.000
or something because you know there's no there's no option when you install fedora it's just

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.720
no there's no like you don't choose your desktop environment it's a spin so you're gonna yeah

01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:23.840
all right well so I think that's that's probably all we have I think we're probably done now

01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:28.680
I got a machine I gotta go try I got fedora 25 so much more Linux I got I got a kwin bender

01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:34.180
I gotta go on real quickly I was just gonna mention to that I could just had a new update

01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:39.920
go out they the solace project just shipped a kernel 4.88 support and some junk are you

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:45.440
AMD GPU users which is probably nobody care what what we have 4.8 point 10 where you've

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:50.640
been what I'm reading Twitter right now I'm reading the Twitter right now yeah I mean

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:57.160
we got 4.8 point 10 in since then all right yeah we get all this stuff you were supposed

01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:02.640
to talk about the 80 AMD Radeon GPU junk because I was doing that to troll all of the AMD GPU

01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:06.560
users and and they're gonna hate me now they're gonna get so yeah well I mean it's not as

01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:10.680
impressive as people think because everyone's getting excited about the AMD GPU stuff of

01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:17.680
course we have the XOR drivers and that stuff is all cool yeah however oh the kernel support

01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:24.000
is in there you need 4.9 kernel to make use of the South Island is it whatever name it

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:30.920
is they have anyway the AMD SI stuff you cannot use without the 4.9 kernel and enable an experimental

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:36.640
option so as much as the new AMD GPU drivers out the new Radeon drivers out they're still

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:41.840
not gonna make any difference without the kernel yeah they gotta wait till like December

01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:47.560
the 4th assuming that the 4.9 kernel doesn't slip back a week which it may do so it's like

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:51.600
minimum December the 4th before anyone gets to play with it unless you want to run RC

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:56.760
like a lunatic so it'll be a good Christmas for you my kind of lunacy that is your Christmas

01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:01.000
that is my kind of lunacy right there well thank you guys all for joining us in the mumble

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.840
room stay tuned we'll be doing a little post-show discussion but our mumble room is open to

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:09.880
the public if you'd like to hang out in our virtual lug just go over to jblive.tv we do

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:16.000
this show live on Tuesdays go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to find out when everybody

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.640
always says hey Chris when's unplugged all these guys up in here every day every day

01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:26.120
they all be asking you during the show you know it jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendars

01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:29.600
where you go to get it converted to your local time zone linuxactorshow.reddit.com is where

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:35.160
you go to submit contact info or actually input and contact information is at jupitabroadcasting.com

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:39.520
slash contact it's obvious duh go there duh do it i don't know what your problem is do

01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:45.960
it figure it out god you're so annoying right now i don't know why that's not obvious anyways

01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:53.080
linux unplug the show that does not hold your hand and judges you along the way what that's

01:45:53.080 --> 01:46:20.360
a hell of a pitch thanks for joining us see you back here next week

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:29.600
most of the web runs on servers powered by linux that's true you know what that's a great

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:33.320
point and you know every time he says it it sounds very authoritative most of the web

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:38.840
runs on servers powered by linux it's like that's how reliable it is android phones are

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:43.080
based on linux all android phones run linux that's true that's the operating system that's

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:48.080
a good point you're probably using linux all the time maybe you don't even know it idiot

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:52.520
so you can get a free version of linux there are many as i mentioned ubuntu is a good one

01:46:52.520 --> 01:47:00.600
yeah ubuntu.com that's leo's talking down and install it on your xp machine you wipe

01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:05.400
in fact i would wipe out all the xp just install it there doesn't run windows software very

01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:11.080
well it does in fact run it but not very well but that's okay because it has an entire office

01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:17.020
suite available for it for free libra office it has all the software you know photoshop

01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:21.000
clone called the game impressed you with all the software you want is free and available

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.920
on the linux platform yeah yeah that's all that's all fair that's all a good point but

01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:29.960
then then leo had a few drinks and he took a call and mind you this is all before leo

01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:34.840
tried linux so he's he's a changed man now but before he had switched to linux he was

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:40.680
drinking and somebody called in and they asked they asked leo about switching to linux and

01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:45.480
this was his response after a couple of beers in it's for people who like to mess with computers

01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:51.480
if you're and you know who you are if you're somebody who doesn't want to mess i just want

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:59.440
to surf the i just want to buy something on amazon send an email to my kids look at some

01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:05.480
websites there you go the image of him just frustrated and drunk trying to send pictures

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:09.080
to people on the internet is just you know what i'm a damn i'm damn impressed he's still

01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:14.080
rocking i think he got like did he get an oryx actually speaking of or maybe he might

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:19.000
have he might have and i think he's still like i think it's just might have now gotten

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.680
replaced by the new macbook escape i think it's just maybe now gotten replaced i see

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:29.320
i see but he was rocking the oryx for a while that's pretty cool so uh last one this week

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:34.640
he was rocking the oryx yeah so jbtitles.com mr sypes are you still in there you had a

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:39.320
point you wanted to make about mutter and elementary os which i wanted to pick up on

01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:44.520
yeah i don't know if ike is still in here but it looks like he is yeah you might talk

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:50.080
he is you might talk to the elementary guys because they had a they had quite a few features

01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:56.440
that they actually i guess helped write for mutter and then at first the mutter guy said

01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:04.120
they'd accept them and then they 180'd on that and so they share concerns about mutter

01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:10.760
as well so is gala so i'm curious so elementary os so when i was thinking about this performance

01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:18.880
like the feel benchmark i was thinking i should try compass mutter gala and kaywin that seemed

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:22.960
to be like the way to like as like a as like but is that boring because that's just my

01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:27.760
curiosity and then on top of that like what's the hardware should i use should they all

01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:34.880
be on intel should it be an nvidia gtx 960 or a 10 series like what's the bench what

01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:40.000
should be the benchmark hardware that all of these get compared against that all well

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:46.560
can you win kaywin is is part of the holy trinity in the church of neon whoa whoa whoa

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:54.720
whoa whoa whoa are you trying to get me to use kde neon again all hail neon all hail

01:49:54.720 --> 01:50:04.240
neon all hail neon you know you keep mentioning all these issues that katie completely solves

01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:10.040
so you know oh yeah like what what what issues what issues do i keep mentioning the kde solves

01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:16.840
katie has like a scaling for idpi yeah once you turn it on once you go in there and turn

01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:20.920
it on and still the mouse cursor never looks right come on you're coming at me with high

01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:26.280
dpi support when i'm looking at elementary os and gtk 3.22 you're coming at me with

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:31.640
high dpi support can i make a comment about the high dpi support because there's something

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:37.440
i slightly disagreed there earlier ryan you mentioned about the high dpi support on the

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:41.680
devices and now this is not a driver level thing obviously the drivers have to support

01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:46.040
the resolution we know this to these be 4k native this is something at the toolkit and

01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:50.320
desktop level this is not something you implement at a driver level so i just wanted to correct

01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:57.920
that there our driver is what we call our piece of our software repository that we ship

01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:03.880
with you mean the system 76 driver package right yeah yeah yeah and so no it's not it's

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:08.600
not implemented at the driver level it's it's just something that we we ship in order to

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:13.520
handle those sure i just wanted to clarify in the word in there because you said driver

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:18.920
i got a bit confused to be honest with you yeah it's confusing to me too but it's but

01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:26.000
that's what uh but we haven't yet changed the name of that package okay it's not like

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:32.720
a system 76 defaults kind of thing yeah it needs to be something like defaults or like

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:37.920
i don't know extras or something like that um you can just play this episode for people

01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:43.040
out there now and well you know you'll have no argument one it's not x it's wayland is

01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:49.120
currently our top title this is not bad i also like mixed desktop feelings that's not

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:53.440
bad i like that one as well i really genuinely so okay honest response if i want a great

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:57.400
fedora desktop can i get one with katie with a recent version of the plasma desktop right

01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:01.680
now is that possible on day one of fedora 25 i don't think it is right i see you as

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:08.080
spin iso and oh you did in the slack channel oh so there is today a spin with a modern

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:13.080
plasma desktop and it's probably pretty bare but i think i'm gonna give it a go you can

01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:24.100
get a modern plasma desktop but uh katie neon if you're not convinced yet kwin has the best

01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:31.280
of cube so do you think oh okay do you think i okay so maybe i should do the neon challenge

01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:36.480
in a little bit but i gotta get through the fedora 25 review first i gotta i gotta i gotta

01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:43.280
stay focused hey chris when's the next episode sunday i'm gonna review fedora 25 on sunday

01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:47.960
and then after that i could be up for the neon challenge yeah there you go it depends

01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:55.160
on how it goes with katie hey chris yeah when is tech snap this week uh good question it's

01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:58.680
going to be at 10 a.m our time because of thanksgiving so we're going to do it on thanksgiving

01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:03.520
day we're just going to do it early because i'm a maniac you'll be uh cooking a turkey

01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:07.840
so one o'clock my time yeah i'll be cooking on east coast yeah i'm gonna have a turkey

01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:12.840
fryer going off to my side we'll be frying the turkey i wish oh you could live stream

01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:16.960
i would watch a live stream of chris would you i should i actually think that'd be a

01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:22.400
lot of fun uh so do we like it's not x it's wayland yeah that's not bad i do like the

01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:28.340
mix it's sort of like an inferred uh reference to fedora 25 i also like a mixed desktop feeling

01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:36.440
so jb titles.com why don't we give it uh just a couple of more lawnmower seconds so when

01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:45.560
the lawnmower is done we'll we'll pick our title

01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:54.720
get it out of here i think it's wasted effort yep it's winter now no need for this moan

01:53:54.720 --> 01:54:01.960
then your description is is not accurate now he's questioning me come on snowman what's

01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:09.320
wrong with that all right so uh by the end of the lawnmower man our final victor is it's

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:17.160
not x it's wayland by one boat in back eight nicely done one boat and a and a and a and

01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:22.440
a title with a comma in it yeah that's unusual unusual gonna break everyone's everything

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.280
the internet was never the same
