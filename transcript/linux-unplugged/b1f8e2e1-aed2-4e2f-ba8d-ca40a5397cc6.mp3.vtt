00:00.000 --> 00:15.360
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:15.360 --> 00:16.360
My name is Chris.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.360
My name is Wes.

00:17.360 --> 00:18.360
And my name is Brent.

00:18.360 --> 00:19.360
Hello, gentlemen.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.940
All of us are in studio gathered together for two episodes today.

00:22.940 --> 00:27.520
We're going to record them back to back to get us ready to hit the road for our West

00:27.520 --> 00:28.520
Coast tour.

00:28.520 --> 00:34.720
So coming up on this episode, we dug deep this week to find our perfect Google Photos

00:34.720 --> 00:35.720
replacement.

00:35.720 --> 00:39.880
So this week, we'll share our setups that we think work great, are easy to use, and

00:39.880 --> 00:42.280
are fully backed up.

00:42.280 --> 00:48.080
Get rid of Google plus a new tool that might help do just that for Google Maps and, well,

00:48.080 --> 00:52.440
at least the hopes and dreams I have for it and why it might just be landing at the perfect

00:52.440 --> 00:53.440
time.

00:53.440 --> 00:57.560
Then we'll round out the show with some great boosts and pics and a lot more.

00:57.560 --> 01:01.280
So before we go any further, guys, let's say time appropriate greetings to our virtual

01:01.280 --> 01:02.280
lug.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.280
Hello, Mumble Room.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.280
Oh, hello, guys.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.280
Hello, Chris.

01:05.280 --> 01:06.280
Hello, Wes.

01:06.280 --> 01:07.280
Hello, Brent.

01:07.280 --> 01:08.280
Hello.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.280
Hello.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.240
We also have a whole bunch of people up and quiet listening because, well, they get a

01:11.240 --> 01:14.360
low latency Opus stream when they do it that way.

01:14.360 --> 01:17.220
And of course, there's jblive.fm and jupyter.tube.

01:17.220 --> 01:20.960
We are live on Sundays except for next Sunday.

01:20.960 --> 01:21.960
We're not going to be live.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.840
We're going to be prerecorded.

01:23.840 --> 01:27.840
Then after that, we're doing that just to buy ourselves one easy Sunday on the road.

01:27.840 --> 01:28.840
That's the first Sunday.

01:28.840 --> 01:29.840
Sunday the 25th.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.840
Yeah.

01:30.840 --> 01:31.840
Thank you.

01:31.840 --> 01:35.540
That'll probably be a pretty, either we're going to be napping because we'll have been

01:35.540 --> 01:38.360
exhausted by that point or we're going to be trying to put in miles.

01:38.360 --> 01:42.480
I'm not sure which one, but we needed that flexibility, so we're going to do a prerecord

01:42.480 --> 01:43.480
for one of them.

01:43.480 --> 01:46.840
But then from then on, all the other shows are going to be from the road.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.280
Hey, we better start thinking about that, huh?

01:49.280 --> 01:50.280
Yeah.

01:50.280 --> 01:51.280
Yeah.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.280
We probably, maybe we should chat.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.600
And you know how we're going to stay connected while we do that?

01:54.600 --> 01:55.600
TailScale.

01:55.600 --> 02:00.160
So go over and give a good old good morning to TailScale, TailScale.com.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.680
It's a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

02:03.680 --> 02:08.480
It's really straightforward to use, super secure because it's using WireGuard's tech,

02:08.480 --> 02:12.080
and really, really easy to set up.

02:12.080 --> 02:13.080
Really easy.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.800
Two minutes per device, maybe?

02:14.800 --> 02:15.800
I don't know.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.200
So go say good morning.

02:17.200 --> 02:21.700
Try it up to 20 devices for free at TailScale.com.

02:21.700 --> 02:26.320
You know, I've been using TailScale this week to set up my new dev one, which we'll talk

02:26.320 --> 02:29.760
about in next episode, and it's been amazing.

02:29.760 --> 02:35.080
I've just been using it to shorthand host names because I'm here at the studio and I

02:35.080 --> 02:37.440
don't know what the heck all the IPs are and stuff.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.040
It makes things so easy.

02:39.040 --> 02:40.040
Yeah.

02:40.040 --> 02:43.080
It's a use case I haven't used yet, and I was so thankful for it.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.080
It was just super simple.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.080
So thanks, TailScale.

02:45.080 --> 02:48.400
And you could just set your bookmarks and stuff to use that TailScale IP.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.640
I'm using the magic DNS actually.

02:50.640 --> 02:54.200
And didn't you test that if you're on the same network, they actually do transfer locally

02:54.200 --> 02:56.120
even when you're using the TailScale IPs?

02:56.120 --> 02:57.120
Yeah.

02:57.120 --> 03:00.640
I was doing some R syncing using that, and it was real fast.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.640
Yeah.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.480
It was really a wonderful, beautiful, like transparent operation.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.480
I really loved it.

03:05.480 --> 03:06.760
So you can just always use the TailScale IP.

03:06.760 --> 03:07.760
That's it.

03:07.760 --> 03:08.760
You just memorize that one.

03:08.760 --> 03:09.760
Yeah.

03:09.760 --> 03:10.760
So great.

03:10.760 --> 03:11.760
All right.

03:11.760 --> 03:12.760
Let's talk about Headway.

03:12.760 --> 03:17.520
This is essentially your own Google Maps in a box.

03:17.520 --> 03:18.520
Now let's not oversell.

03:18.520 --> 03:22.480
I'm sure this is a very hard job, and I'm sure it's not complete.

03:22.480 --> 03:27.000
But the idea of this resonates so strongly with me that I wanted to talk about it on

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
the show.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.800
And they write on the GitHub page, quote, with just a few commands, you can bring up

03:31.800 --> 03:34.340
your own fully functional map server.

03:34.340 --> 03:39.960
This includes a front end, a base map, a geocoder, and a routing engine.

03:39.960 --> 03:47.200
Choose one of the 200 plus predefined cities, or provide your own open street map extract

03:47.200 --> 03:52.400
covering any area from the neighborhood to the whole planet.

03:52.400 --> 04:00.880
I have for so, so long wanted to run my own mapping software on my Raspberry Pi server

04:00.880 --> 04:01.880
in Lady Chupes.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.180
I mean, it just makes so much sense.

04:04.180 --> 04:07.960
First of all, it's one of the ultimate tracking tools for Google.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.520
I mean, everywhere you go, right?

04:10.520 --> 04:11.520
Yeah.

04:11.520 --> 04:16.860
But also, there are so many scenarios where I'm offline and I want to do route planning

04:16.860 --> 04:18.960
and I don't have access to anything.

04:18.960 --> 04:23.400
And wouldn't it be great if I started building these routes and all these favorite locations

04:23.400 --> 04:26.760
for camping or great signal or quiet spot to record.

04:26.760 --> 04:31.760
I've always, always wanted a database like that, but I don't want to build it around

04:31.760 --> 04:33.600
Google Maps.

04:33.600 --> 04:39.360
And the idea that maybe I could install Headway and create something like that on my mobile

04:39.360 --> 04:43.000
RV, such a cool idea.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.280
So it sounds like it's maybe the sort of the open source components for maps.earth, which

04:49.280 --> 04:50.280
you can go try.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.440
I assume that gives you a little bit of a somewhat of a preview of what you might get

04:53.440 --> 04:54.640
out of the box.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.520
It could at least route us from the studio to JPL.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.720
So that's promising.

04:58.720 --> 04:59.720
I think we got it.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.240
We absolutely got to play with this after the show.

05:02.240 --> 05:05.440
Headway is working on AMD 64 machines.

05:05.440 --> 05:10.080
I don't know about ARM machines, but you know, for this test, I'd totally do it on a laptop

05:10.080 --> 05:11.080
or something.

05:11.080 --> 05:15.320
As far as the project status, they say Headway is currently capable of showing a map, searching

05:15.320 --> 05:19.980
for points of interest and addresses within OpenStreetMap extracts, and providing directions

05:19.980 --> 05:24.000
between two places within that extract.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.320
Supported modes include driving, cycling, and walking.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.320
Transit is a work in progress.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.320
Oh, exciting.

05:29.320 --> 05:34.240
Now, obviously, for something like we do, you also need another form of routing, which

05:34.240 --> 05:36.640
is basically like commercial truck routing.

05:36.640 --> 05:41.260
You need large vehicle routing and extra tall vehicle routing because there's overpasses

05:41.260 --> 05:43.960
that are under a dozen feet or something like that.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.880
What are you saying about Jubes?

05:45.880 --> 05:46.880
She's tall.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.880
She's proud and tall.

05:47.880 --> 05:53.160
And so you have to use special routing software that takes her dimensions into consideration.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.160
That sounds expensive.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.160
It does.

05:55.160 --> 05:59.320
But in theory, someone could build something like that for a tool like this.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.480
Yeah, that's what's so neat about it.

06:01.480 --> 06:06.480
And some folks in our matrix are making just this point that OpenStreetMaps is a great

06:06.480 --> 06:10.760
project, because now you can get this data and sort of a common language and place for

06:10.760 --> 06:14.120
all of this to collaborate around, and then you can build your own ideas into this stuff.

06:14.120 --> 06:20.000
You know, I've been using OpenStreetMaps as a back end for my navigation apps for years

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
and years now, actually.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.820
And it's gotten a lot better.

06:22.820 --> 06:27.120
So I would imagine the more stuff like this gets out there and the easier it is to use

06:27.120 --> 06:31.600
and the easier it is to sort of update all the maps as well from a user standpoint, the

06:31.600 --> 06:32.740
better and better it'll get.

06:32.740 --> 06:35.720
So it's like open source, long game, always wins.

06:35.720 --> 06:36.840
Yeah, that's a fair point.

06:36.840 --> 06:41.480
You're sitting in that seat right now, having used an OpenStreetMap powered app.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.680
Do you want to mention what it is and maybe make some disclaimers about it?

06:44.680 --> 06:46.360
I mean, it's not perfect.

06:46.360 --> 06:50.980
And that's probably the caveat with all this is how could anything be as good as Google

06:50.980 --> 06:56.500
Maps when you have so many users constantly providing data and you have the financial

06:56.500 --> 07:02.080
budget that Google does to actually invest in routing it, taking pictures, getting satellite

07:02.080 --> 07:03.080
imagery.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.040
So clearly it's going to have its limitations.

07:05.040 --> 07:09.640
But Brent, you're relatively an authority on this, having just driven from Canada to

07:09.640 --> 07:11.080
Seattle using this.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.320
And I know you used it in our Denver trip as well.

07:13.320 --> 07:16.880
With only a small, you know, few small incidents here and there.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.960
Only three extra mountain passes, it was fine.

07:19.960 --> 07:23.560
Wes, you'll probably find this while I'm chatting about it.

07:23.560 --> 07:28.760
Almost exactly a year ago, Chris, if you remember on Self-Hosted, we sort of explored using

07:28.760 --> 07:30.960
some of these open mapping applications.

07:30.960 --> 07:34.760
And I know some of us suffered a little and some of us had some more experience.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.480
You were fresh at it, I think.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.480
I think you had a hard time with it in Denver.

07:38.480 --> 07:44.420
It really, yeah, it struggled with the complexity of that city, we've got to say.

07:44.420 --> 07:50.320
So the application I'm using primarily is OSM and it's an Android application.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.040
And there are a few others.

07:52.040 --> 07:56.160
Some of them are more simplistic or more user friendly, perhaps I'll put it that way.

07:56.160 --> 08:01.440
I'm not quite remembering them to mind in memory.

08:01.440 --> 08:08.760
But I generally really think it's great for going between large places.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.800
So between cities, things like that.

08:11.800 --> 08:15.660
That has worked out fabulously for me and I find it quite accurate.

08:15.660 --> 08:20.320
What I appreciate about it is the customizability of the interface itself.

08:20.320 --> 08:25.080
So you can add different layers and, you know, I have mine in dark mode all the time because

08:25.080 --> 08:26.500
I like it that way.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.840
And those are some things you can't do with some of the other, you know, bigger proprietary

08:29.840 --> 08:30.840
apps.

08:30.840 --> 08:35.880
And you've also, one of the things I like about your UI that I wish I could do is you've

08:35.880 --> 08:39.760
configured it to show not just the next turn, but the turn after that.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.760
So you can start doing some of the math ahead of time and only some nav units do that and

08:43.760 --> 08:45.360
you can just turn that on in yours.

08:45.360 --> 08:49.280
Yeah, actually, I wonder if that's a symptom now, but I found it really super useful to

08:49.280 --> 08:54.300
know, you know, as a driver, whenever I have time, I could just look down and just have

08:54.300 --> 08:56.280
an idea of what's coming up next, next.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.840
Yeah, get an idea of which lane to be in.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.080
It's helpful for just you for quick turns, right?

09:01.080 --> 09:05.160
Yeah, because sometimes, especially when you're downtown and four lanes to get across.

09:05.160 --> 09:09.320
Although now that we're talking about it, I wonder if it's a symptom of the fact that

09:09.320 --> 09:14.240
I've noticed that this map mapping application has a bit more of a delay.

09:14.240 --> 09:19.400
So I find sometimes the turn, you know, I'm right up on the turn and then it sort of suggests

09:19.400 --> 09:23.620
that I'm there so that I have found the interface legs a little bit from reality compared to

09:23.620 --> 09:25.000
some of the other alternatives.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.600
So I wonder if that's just my way of trying to solve that is to get ahead of the turn.

09:29.600 --> 09:30.680
Still seems useful to me.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.360
I wish I could turn it on.

09:32.360 --> 09:36.800
It is kind of somewhat common sometimes in some open source things like, all right, there's

09:36.800 --> 09:40.880
some deficiencies, but you can customize it so you could probably work around and no one's

09:40.880 --> 09:41.880
spying on you.

09:41.880 --> 09:45.440
I mean, there's that now and that's becoming more important to me as time goes on.

09:45.440 --> 09:49.520
The other thing I appreciate is that I can bring up, you know, on the heads up display,

09:49.520 --> 09:51.760
whatever I want, really, there's tons of options.

09:51.760 --> 09:57.720
And so some of them that I like is, you know, navigational directions, like compass directions

09:57.720 --> 09:59.320
a certain way.

09:59.320 --> 10:03.760
But also like total distance that I have to go, what time I'm going to arrive there, things

10:03.760 --> 10:04.760
like that.

10:04.760 --> 10:09.840
But I find the layout, I guess, more predictable, like all that information is in the same place.

10:09.840 --> 10:14.640
I was using Google Maps a little bit recently and I found it difficult because that information

10:14.640 --> 10:18.080
kept moving around and I found that kind of tricky.

10:18.080 --> 10:24.600
So I tend to go to it first, but I will say if you're trying to get to like a business

10:24.600 --> 10:33.320
address, especially in a city that businesses change quite often, the search is tricky.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.480
You can search by like address, but you kind of have to do it backwards.

10:36.480 --> 10:42.620
You have to search by, you know, province or state first and then city and then street

10:42.620 --> 10:43.960
name and then number.

10:43.960 --> 10:47.400
So it's a little bit backwards from like human readability in that sense.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.560
That's a little annoying, but understandable.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.400
I understand like it's a hierarchy, so that makes sense once you get used to it.

10:52.400 --> 10:56.500
But as a first time user, you're like, I've seen that in some of the built in navigation

10:56.500 --> 10:57.500
systems as well.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.600
Yes, I was thinking the same.

10:59.600 --> 11:03.200
I like, though, that OpenStreetMaps, first of all, makes apps like that possible.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.440
I think it's such an important project.

11:05.440 --> 11:09.880
The other thing, too, is if you had a tool like Headway, which is what we started talking

11:09.880 --> 11:12.260
about, the self-hosted solution.

11:12.260 --> 11:16.680
In theory, Brent, you could kind of plan ahead and then just supply the needed information

11:16.680 --> 11:18.240
to the nav unit, right?

11:18.240 --> 11:19.240
Yeah, that's a great idea.

11:19.240 --> 11:22.200
And then you could plan on your larger screen on your laptop or whatever, which I think

11:22.200 --> 11:23.200
would be preferable, too.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.240
Yeah, get it all sketched out in advance.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.760
Yeah, that's how I like to do it.

11:26.760 --> 11:29.200
And I like to like look for parking spots and all that kind of stuff.

11:29.200 --> 11:34.080
You could even like print it out if you need it.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.080
Do you remember?

11:35.080 --> 11:36.480
Did you ever drive when that was a thing?

11:36.480 --> 11:37.480
MapQuest.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.480
Oh, yeah.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.480
Yeah, totally MapQuest printouts and stuff.

11:39.480 --> 11:40.480
And they sucked.

11:40.480 --> 11:44.400
And of course, you had to have like the get to the interstate on ramp, all that stuff.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.400
Oh, yeah.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.080
And towards the end, some of them will let you, like Microsoft had one, they'll let you

11:48.080 --> 11:50.160
like drop off some of the first steps.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.680
I know how to get to the freeway.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.680
I'm good.

11:52.680 --> 11:56.800
You know, and the big innovation with on your phone is you could start the nav once you're

11:56.800 --> 12:00.080
on the freeway and you didn't have to get all the, I want to just mention because I

12:00.080 --> 12:04.200
know people are going to ask me what I do use for the RV navigation right now.

12:04.200 --> 12:09.760
If you have a large vehicle, I think the Garmin RV 780 is a really good device and it'll take

12:09.760 --> 12:10.760
into all that.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.720
I like having a dedicated device, too.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.280
I could see replacing it one day.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.040
I think that'd be pretty cool.

12:16.040 --> 12:20.200
Replace with like a Raspberry Pi with an LCD screen running headway and some open street

12:20.200 --> 12:23.600
maps all take into account how big JOOPS is.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.400
Well, a boy can dream.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.400
Chris, I'm curious.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.240
You mentioned you want to eventually put this on a Raspberry Pi.

12:29.240 --> 12:31.040
Do you think the Pi can handle it?

12:31.040 --> 12:35.000
Well, I don't know.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Have to find out.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.760
By the time Chris gets around to that, the Pi will have like 32 gigs of RAM.

12:38.760 --> 12:42.080
I'm already planning projects for the Pi 5 boys.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.080
I'm already waiting.

12:43.080 --> 12:49.160
Soon as they announce, I'm ready to go.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.080
Linode.com slash unplugged.

12:51.080 --> 12:55.320
That's where you go to get $100 in 60-day credit and you can go there to support the

12:55.320 --> 12:56.320
show.

12:56.320 --> 13:02.120
Linode is easy, accessible, affordable cloud hosting and you get that $100, you can really

13:02.120 --> 13:06.080
try it out and see why we rave about Linode, why we have for years.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.880
Linode is how we run everything including our new website that we've built recently

13:09.880 --> 13:12.320
and it's in part because of the great performance.

13:12.320 --> 13:15.360
I mean, that's an absolute minimum line for me.

13:15.360 --> 13:20.120
It's got to meet Linode's level of performance now if I'm ever going to switch away which

13:20.120 --> 13:22.480
just honestly nobody does.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.660
They got 11 data centers around the world.

13:24.660 --> 13:29.080
They're constantly investing in their infrastructure, improving the hardware instead of just like,

13:29.080 --> 13:34.960
you know, coasting like some companies do and then milking that hardware for like 10

13:34.960 --> 13:37.360
years and charging you the same thing.

13:37.360 --> 13:41.480
They're charging you the same great price which is 30% to 50% cheaper than the major

13:41.480 --> 13:46.160
hyperscalers out there and just behind the scenes, they're constantly upgrading things,

13:46.160 --> 13:50.920
making things better both on the hardware side but on the UI interface side too.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.660
They just introduced a brand new marketplace interface.

13:53.660 --> 13:57.360
That's what they call their one-click application deployment screen, their marketplace.

13:57.360 --> 13:58.560
You don't really buy these things.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.840
I mean, they're open source free software.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.600
In fact, sometimes I go there and I just look at some of the different projects and see

14:04.600 --> 14:08.360
what I want to play around with for the evening and they've made that even easier now because

14:08.360 --> 14:11.340
they now highlight the new applications that have been added to the marketplace and they're

14:11.340 --> 14:12.520
adding more than ever now.

14:12.520 --> 14:16.040
So that's a really cool tool and honestly, it's all really cool.

14:16.040 --> 14:20.120
That's what I love about Linode's interface and not only are they always upgrading the

14:20.120 --> 14:24.680
hardware and the infrastructure but they're also upgrading the user interface, the front

14:24.680 --> 14:29.080
end and they've just recently introduced their new Linode marketplace interface which is

14:29.080 --> 14:32.400
what they call their front end to let you see the different projects that you can just

14:32.400 --> 14:35.840
one-click deploy on the Linode infrastructure.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.960
They're always adding new stuff but they made it even easier now.

14:38.960 --> 14:43.080
They have a filter on just the new apps and I go there and I look at that and I think,

14:43.080 --> 14:44.720
all right, let's check it out.

14:44.720 --> 14:51.000
And I found myself just discovering and tinkering around with new cool free software projects.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
It's the best.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.960
I love it when they add features like that.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.700
Just incrementally making it better all the time.

14:56.700 --> 15:00.640
That's why they've survived nearly 19 years in this business without VC funding, without

15:00.640 --> 15:05.140
raising crazy loans but just by making a great product and selling it.

15:05.140 --> 15:08.100
And on top of that, you get some of the best support in the business.

15:08.100 --> 15:13.840
You get full Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible support and you also get something that's

15:13.840 --> 15:16.880
30% to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.840
That's a big deal when you combine that with the support and it's a great way to support

15:19.840 --> 15:21.140
the show.

15:21.140 --> 15:22.140
Go try it out.

15:22.140 --> 15:25.720
See why we've been building our future infrastructure on Linode and why I think you will too for

15:25.720 --> 15:30.220
yourself or for your business, linode.com slash unplugged.

15:30.220 --> 15:34.320
One more time to support the show, it's linode.com slash unplugged.

15:34.320 --> 15:40.920
All right, Wes brought the vacuum so it's time to clean up a little bit around here.

15:40.920 --> 15:44.800
So thanks to our generous audience, Brent's tank was fueled with sats.

15:44.800 --> 15:45.800
Thank you.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.800
And he took a really cool route out here.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.080
Yeah, I think we should share that route actually.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.080
Yeah.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.080
Yeah.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.320
I just wouldn't take it at night or when it's raining.

15:55.320 --> 16:00.480
Well it was only partly at night and only partly raining in the mountains.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.180
But the most treacherous part was at night.

16:03.180 --> 16:08.520
We do tell a little story in Office Hours 12 of that adventure that I think is probably

16:08.520 --> 16:09.520
worth hearing.

16:09.520 --> 16:10.520
I don't know if you caught it, Wes.

16:10.520 --> 16:11.520
I did.

16:11.520 --> 16:12.520
All right.

16:12.520 --> 16:13.520
If you had, we'd have to tell you.

16:13.520 --> 16:14.520
Yeah.

16:14.520 --> 16:18.700
Also, we had a little surprise outage that left Wes and I scrambling after we launched

16:18.700 --> 16:22.280
the website and we talk about that in Office Hours 12 as well.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.280
Yep.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.280
All good though.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.340
All fixed up now.

16:25.340 --> 16:26.760
Those West Coast meetups are coming up.

16:26.760 --> 16:30.960
Our first one is on the 20th, which is two days from now as we record.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.120
How is that going to work?

16:32.120 --> 16:36.760
I'm going to be in Southern Oregon in two days.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.280
Wrap your mind around that.

16:38.280 --> 16:41.360
Especially that's tricky considering I'm going to be recording Coder right here in the studio

16:41.360 --> 16:42.360
on Monday.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.520
At this point, two shows to go.

16:44.520 --> 16:45.520
Yeah.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.520
Yeah.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.520
But the meetups are logged in.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.840
Details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.480
Turned out we're doing a West Coast brewery tour.

16:52.480 --> 16:56.440
All of the meetups are at really great brewery locations that can accommodate us and feed

16:56.440 --> 16:58.700
us and supply us with beverage.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.400
We'd love to have you there, but do sign up so we know.

17:01.400 --> 17:05.680
And it's getting down to the final moment, meetup.com slash Uber broadcasting.

17:05.680 --> 17:10.520
If you need any deets, you want to figure out like carpool and stuff like that, bit.ly

17:10.520 --> 17:14.040
slash West Coast crew is the chat room for that.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.720
And we'll spin up other regions we have.

17:16.720 --> 17:19.840
There's actually a whole bunch of regions already, but we'll spin up more regions as

17:19.840 --> 17:21.880
the meetups extend out.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.960
So do get yourself a Matrix client.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.960
It'll be coming up soon.

17:26.960 --> 17:35.760
Hey, we do have a couple of baller boosts this week.

17:35.760 --> 17:41.000
The biggest boost that come into the show we read early and John A comes in for a third

17:41.000 --> 17:44.640
week in a row with 50 sats, gentlemen.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.640
How about that?

17:45.640 --> 17:46.640
That is amazing.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.640
You filthy animal.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.440
I guess we better start dancing.

17:49.440 --> 17:50.440
Yeah.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.240
Can you keep the streak up?

17:52.240 --> 17:53.440
Because here's the tricky thing.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.240
We're prerecorded next week.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.240
Oh.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.320
We're on a really solid streak right now.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.680
Four episodes in a row.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.440
Nobody's ever done that before.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.520
So we'll see if he can pull it off.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.040
I don't know how he possibly could, but we'll see.

18:05.040 --> 18:09.440
He says in his boost, thank you for doing a show dedicated to all the reasons I love

18:09.440 --> 18:13.240
Gnome and for validating my preferences.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.240
Did I do that?

18:14.240 --> 18:15.240
I thought I did the opposite.

18:15.240 --> 18:17.040
You know, we have to say Nate reached out to us.

18:17.040 --> 18:21.440
Nate writes the This Week in KDE blog, and he offered to come on and chat about some

18:21.440 --> 18:22.440
of those problems.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.680
Not so much as like an argument, but just kind of a back and forth to get an understanding

18:24.680 --> 18:27.520
where the project's out and that stuff, and I think we're going to probably take him up

18:27.520 --> 18:28.520
on that.

18:28.520 --> 18:32.080
It's just the travel schedule and all of that, but I think that'd be a great conversation.

18:32.080 --> 18:36.040
We figured we'd give a little more time for Brent to find additional bugs just to stock

18:36.040 --> 18:37.040
up.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.040
Well, I've got a list.

18:38.040 --> 18:41.520
Oh, Brent Lee, of course you do.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.520
It's to help.

18:42.520 --> 18:46.160
Like I think that's in the name of progress, right?

18:46.160 --> 18:47.160
Sure.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.160
Awesome.

18:48.160 --> 18:58.760
I'm going to show you generously one of our baller boosts this episode with 30,000 sats.

18:58.760 --> 18:59.760
He clipped that.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.520
He says, also, I think part of the problem with the baller clip in general is that it's

19:02.520 --> 19:04.240
just been one clip.

19:04.240 --> 19:06.520
All the other boosts get some variety.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.600
They don't get old because they largely have some variety.

19:08.600 --> 19:12.680
I think there should be a small pool of baller boosts that you can pull from depending on

19:12.680 --> 19:14.280
the mood and ambiance.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.320
Yeah, I think we're getting that.

19:16.320 --> 19:20.360
We have some really great submissions on a GitHub link that we'll put in the notes.

19:20.360 --> 19:25.600
We'd like some more and the community is coming together and really, I think, coming up with

19:25.600 --> 19:26.600
some great ones.

19:26.600 --> 19:30.520
So thank you, everybody, who's contributed to that GitHub thread and thank you, Awesome

19:30.520 --> 19:31.520
Matt, for that.

19:31.520 --> 19:35.060
And our last baller boost, we're very privileged.

19:35.060 --> 19:39.760
We've actually gotten three baller boosts and that one came from Gene Bean with 25,000

19:39.760 --> 19:40.760
sats.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.120
I hoard that which your kind covet.

19:43.120 --> 19:48.720
Brent, I'd love to see you dig into this KDE topic in a brunch with Brent, maybe that includes

19:48.720 --> 19:54.120
Michael Tonnell from Tux Digital and maybe whoever hosts the KDE Corner on Late Night

19:54.120 --> 19:55.120
Linux.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.120
Ah, Phelan.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.120
Yeah.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.120
Phelan.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.560
Maybe the cross section of y'all's experiences would be really interesting to hear.

20:00.560 --> 20:01.900
That's a great idea.

20:01.900 --> 20:02.900
Thank you.

20:02.900 --> 20:03.900
Yeah, we can get that cooking.

20:03.900 --> 20:04.900
We can at least get it cooking.

20:04.900 --> 20:07.320
I don't know if we can get it pulled off while we're on the road.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.400
That would be tricky, but we can at least get that ball rolling.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.040
Nice to have projects to come home to.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.040
True.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.400
I just want to say thank you to Gene Bean.

20:13.400 --> 20:17.840
He sends in a lot of high signal boosts just under like the 2K level so we have the option

20:17.840 --> 20:19.680
of reading them or not.

20:19.680 --> 20:20.840
And that works great for us.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.340
We read them all.

20:22.340 --> 20:25.680
We bring some of them to the show and I just want to say thank you to Gene Bean because

20:25.680 --> 20:26.680
just a ton of great support.

20:26.680 --> 20:27.680
Yep.

20:27.680 --> 20:28.680
Thank you.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.840
We really appreciate it.

20:31.840 --> 20:36.760
So let's talk about how we are finally divorcing from Google Photos, a topic that has come

20:36.760 --> 20:41.200
up on the show before, something we are following closely on Self Hosted.

20:41.200 --> 20:46.680
There's several projects in the works like Image, something that really was finally motivated

20:46.680 --> 20:52.080
by that story that involved Google sending over a dad's entire Google account history

20:52.080 --> 20:58.320
to the police when they incorrectly identified a C-SAM flag on his Google Photos account.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.600
And that was really just the, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.600
I've got kids.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.440
I use telemedicine.

21:03.440 --> 21:07.400
I've got Google Photos turned on on one of my devices.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.680
Really just was the line that was too far for me.

21:09.680 --> 21:14.400
And since then, I have been actively looking at ways of just getting myself off of Google

21:14.400 --> 21:16.400
because these models only increase.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.320
What they're looking for only increases.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.240
The accuracy is so-so.

21:20.240 --> 21:24.640
And the automatic nature and how they transferred all of that guy's information to the authorities

21:24.640 --> 21:30.360
for him to review every chat, every email, every purchase.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.360
It's gross.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.680
It's also like Google Photos is less of a good deal than it once was.

21:34.680 --> 21:39.040
You know, they kind of try to sucker everyone in and then change the terms, which is fair.

21:39.040 --> 21:42.600
That's part of the risk of I'm going to put all my photos with you, and then you've got

21:42.600 --> 21:44.760
them and can have me pay whatever you'd like.

21:44.760 --> 21:49.680
It feels like the trade-off cost has shifted more and more to the negative.

21:49.680 --> 21:54.000
And now the trade-offs of having a system that isn't fully managed, that doesn't essentially

21:54.000 --> 21:59.040
have infinite storage, that doesn't have maybe the best machine learning discovery, the trade-offs

21:59.040 --> 22:03.040
of that are worth it now, I think.

22:03.040 --> 22:07.920
So we wanted to build something that pretty much anyone listening could deploy, something

22:07.920 --> 22:13.120
that would run for years, that wouldn't be super expensive and would be fully backed

22:13.120 --> 22:14.480
up.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.680
And I'm on iOS.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.000
You gentlemen are on Android.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.720
We wanted something that accomplishes both.

22:18.720 --> 22:19.720
I know.

22:19.720 --> 22:22.600
You still won't text with me.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.840
They're green, Wes.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.040
They're green.

22:26.040 --> 22:31.520
And if I was on Android, I have to admit this may have been slightly easier because on iOS,

22:31.520 --> 22:36.240
you have the challenge of background tasks are heavily throttled, better or worse.

22:36.240 --> 22:39.920
Hard to compete with the built-in, you know, Apple Photos magic, right?

22:39.920 --> 22:41.400
Yeah, exactly.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.680
And you don't have all of the tools.

22:43.680 --> 22:46.080
Like you Android users can use SyncThing.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.640
I love SyncThing.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.760
SyncThing doesn't like iOS.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.640
They don't want to release SyncThing for iOS.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.320
Now Mobius Sync has come along.

22:55.320 --> 22:59.280
I think it might have been Gamma that told me about this, which is a third-party app

22:59.280 --> 23:05.680
for SyncThing that allows you to use SyncThing on iOS and other devices.

23:05.680 --> 23:10.200
Wes, it is a full SyncThing instance.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.200
I couldn't believe it.

23:11.200 --> 23:16.800
Like when you install it and you run the app, it just brings up the whole SyncThing UI.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.080
That's just SyncThing right there.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.880
Isn't that funny?

23:19.880 --> 23:25.600
And it's pretty limited in what it can get access to because iOS.

23:25.600 --> 23:31.000
And there are some hacky ways you could possibly get it to look at your photos and back your

23:31.000 --> 23:34.160
photos up, but it's not ideal.

23:34.160 --> 23:38.880
But it would work for like, can you get access to various documents or some other, what can

23:38.880 --> 23:39.880
it see?

23:39.880 --> 23:43.200
It can see like its own folders, so you could put stuff in its own folders.

23:43.200 --> 23:46.840
So if you wanted to sync stuff to have handy on your phone, that could work for that.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.080
Yeah, that would work.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.080
Yeah, exactly.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.840
But not a great solution for what I'm looking at.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.440
And so if I was on Android, maybe I would use just SyncThing.

23:54.440 --> 23:55.440
I don't know.

23:55.440 --> 23:56.440
I can't say.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.460
But that wasn't an option for me.

23:58.460 --> 24:01.360
And we got a bunch of different solutions.

24:01.360 --> 24:05.240
And I tried most of them that seemed reasonable.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.360
And the one that stuck, and I think Brent saw my kind of, because he's been here at

24:08.360 --> 24:12.080
the studio for a few days, he saw my kind of evolution of going through these different

24:12.080 --> 24:16.640
apps and finding the one that really seems stable and reliable and ran in the background

24:16.640 --> 24:18.160
and supported everything I needed.

24:18.160 --> 24:23.360
And that absolutely, hands down, was Photosync.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.880
Photosync-app.com.

24:25.880 --> 24:28.640
This is a really good piece of engineering.

24:28.640 --> 24:32.280
How often have you heard me come on here and say how good an app is engineered?

24:32.280 --> 24:34.360
This thing is beautiful.

24:34.360 --> 24:40.080
Photosync will transfer to just about darn near any network protocol.

24:40.080 --> 24:44.200
Whatever you got, Samba, SFTP, WebDAV, it'll work with that.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.200
You got Nextcloud.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.660
You got a Western Digital My Cloud.

24:46.660 --> 24:49.640
You got TrueNAS, Open Media Vault, Seagate.

24:49.640 --> 24:50.640
What do you got?

24:50.640 --> 24:52.280
It'll support that, right?

24:52.280 --> 24:56.800
It'll do just straight up file protocols that you got, or it'll work with specific services

24:56.800 --> 25:01.280
that have APIs, including Photoprism.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.120
It has direct support for Photoprism.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.760
We'll get to that in a moment.

25:05.760 --> 25:09.320
But I want to stick just for a little bit longer with Photosync because this is a really

25:09.320 --> 25:10.720
impressive app.

25:10.720 --> 25:16.040
This is a critical component for me, getting the photos off of my phone because that's

25:16.040 --> 25:18.100
my primary device.

25:18.100 --> 25:24.480
And Photosync has really intelligent syncing abilities, really easy to select what you

25:24.480 --> 25:29.880
want and what you don't want sent up to the server, crazy easy to manage that happen automatically.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.440
It works with so many different services.

25:32.440 --> 25:36.600
And on top of that, and I think this is just a great feature because I actually was doing

25:36.600 --> 25:44.340
this already, if you plug in a SD card reader to your phone and transfer your photos off

25:44.340 --> 25:49.160
of your digital camera, Photosync will read those and it can sync them up to your service.

25:49.160 --> 25:50.160
See, that's nice.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.160
It's super nice, Wes.

25:51.160 --> 25:53.040
It's super, super nice.

25:53.040 --> 25:55.680
So yes, it has camera support, it also do Wi-Fi cameras.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.880
It can connect to your Wi-Fi camera and transfer all the photos off of that.

25:58.880 --> 26:02.080
It also do like a USB flash drive.

26:02.080 --> 26:06.520
It has baked in Amazon S3, Backblaze and Wasabi support.

26:06.520 --> 26:08.920
If you don't want to go to your own server, you just want to send it off to the cloud

26:08.920 --> 26:12.440
as a backup option and you're happy with just having local photos on your phone just backed

26:12.440 --> 26:14.240
up, Photosync will do that.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.240
That's handy.

26:15.240 --> 26:19.960
So Photosync could be basically for some people the entire solution.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.920
Such a simple app is available for iOS and Android.

26:22.920 --> 26:23.920
Really like it.

26:23.920 --> 26:28.280
It does have a premium version which I haven't gone with yet.

26:28.280 --> 26:31.600
Now I was going to ask you about that because it seemed like maybe you needed the premium

26:31.600 --> 26:33.920
if you wanted the automatic in the background.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.920
You got it.

26:34.920 --> 26:35.920
Yeah.

26:35.920 --> 26:36.920
That's the thing.

26:36.920 --> 26:37.920
And then the models are a little different it looks like.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.640
I played a little bit with Photosync and I tried some other software just to mix it

26:40.640 --> 26:41.640
up here.

26:41.640 --> 26:44.860
But you have the premium version on iOS and then on Android there's various sort of extensions

26:44.860 --> 26:45.860
you can get.

26:45.860 --> 26:49.000
You can get a pack if you just need a little bit more protocols or you can get like a sort

26:49.000 --> 26:51.800
of premium equivalent pack that has all the standard extensions built in.

26:51.800 --> 26:52.800
Yeah.

26:52.800 --> 26:55.200
It's a little confusing.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.240
Maybe a little bit better of a deal on the Android side.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.240
It does seem that way.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.240
Yeah.

26:59.240 --> 27:04.320
But I'm cool with the premium version because that automatic backup is big for me.

27:04.320 --> 27:10.600
And it also feels like the kind of project you want to support and keep it around because

27:10.600 --> 27:11.920
you want to just use it for years.

27:11.920 --> 27:12.920
Right.

27:12.920 --> 27:13.920
You want to keep them.

27:13.920 --> 27:14.920
I'm not going to stop taking photos.

27:14.920 --> 27:15.920
If anything it goes the opposite.

27:15.920 --> 27:16.920
Yeah.

27:16.920 --> 27:17.920
Only more.

27:17.920 --> 27:18.920
Right.

27:18.920 --> 27:23.200
So it's like a large ProRes video and 4K video and stuff like that.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.480
And it handles all of that.

27:25.480 --> 27:27.680
I also simulated like I crashed the app.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.600
I forced closed the app mid-transfer.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.040
I put the phone to sleep.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.040
Yeah.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.040
You got a phone call during one of your transfers.

27:33.040 --> 27:38.600
I got a phone call which canceled the transfer and made sure that every time I opened it

27:38.600 --> 27:42.560
up it just figured out what it needed to do, finished it up and it didn't have any weird

27:42.560 --> 27:45.600
like orphan files on the server or anything like that.

27:45.600 --> 27:51.480
So really got the solid confidence in Photosync to use it as my daily backup solution to get

27:51.480 --> 27:53.600
the photos off of my phone.

27:53.600 --> 27:57.320
There is like a companion app for the commercial OSs.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.400
I don't know what that does.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.400
Maybe it backs up the photos.

27:59.400 --> 28:00.400
Yeah.

28:00.400 --> 28:04.440
I think it does allow you if you put the SD card on your Mac desktop or whatever.

28:04.440 --> 28:05.440
Okay.

28:05.440 --> 28:06.440
All right.

28:06.440 --> 28:07.440
Yeah.

28:07.440 --> 28:08.440
That'd be really nice too I suppose.

28:08.440 --> 28:11.400
So then you have the whole matter of how do you display your photos?

28:11.400 --> 28:13.160
How do you search your photos?

28:13.160 --> 28:14.640
How do you collect them?

28:14.640 --> 28:18.880
Yeah, because right now you could just go to photos.google.com and everything's there.

28:18.880 --> 28:19.880
Search for RV.

28:19.880 --> 28:20.880
The RV shows up.

28:20.880 --> 28:23.600
I do that kind of crap on the stream all the time.

28:23.600 --> 28:27.200
Or when I'm making like a home video, Dylan Christmas tree and boom, it shows up Dylan

28:27.200 --> 28:29.080
with a Christmas tree.

28:29.080 --> 28:32.560
And because you've had those features available, you're not necessarily, I mean sure you build

28:32.560 --> 28:37.180
some albums, but you can kind of rely on just if I need to find something by theme, it's

28:37.180 --> 28:38.880
auto done that for me.

28:38.880 --> 28:39.880
Totally.

28:39.880 --> 28:40.880
That is so true.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.440
It's a little lazy, but I just don't have time to sit there and go through all the photos.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.160
The amount of photos and stuff, I don't, right?

28:46.160 --> 28:47.600
You take it and you forget it.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.880
So PhotoPrism comes in and we've talked about PhotoPrism before and I'm going to talk about

28:50.880 --> 28:54.240
it now because it's gotten a lot better since we've talked about it.

28:54.240 --> 28:58.640
It is an AI powered photos app, which they say is for the decentralized web.

28:58.640 --> 28:59.640
All right.

28:59.640 --> 29:00.640
Talking my language.

29:00.640 --> 29:06.160
It makes use of the latest technologies to tag and find your pictures automatically in

29:06.160 --> 29:07.980
the background.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.480
You could even run it on a Raspberry Pi.

29:09.480 --> 29:12.640
It's going to be a little slow, but you could run it on a Raspberry Pi and it will do face

29:12.640 --> 29:13.640
detection.

29:13.640 --> 29:18.920
It'll classify pictures based on their content and location.

29:18.920 --> 29:25.600
It can identify animals, but one of the things that I really want in an app like this is

29:25.600 --> 29:28.840
I want to discover old memories.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.720
I want to be reminded about things.

29:30.720 --> 29:37.960
I want to see things and I really enjoy just the process of browsing through PhotoPrism

29:37.960 --> 29:40.980
and remembering moments.

29:40.980 --> 29:47.320
One of the ways they do that is they have the map interface and they'll show you where

29:47.320 --> 29:52.480
you've taken various photos in different places and I can go in and I can look at some of

29:52.480 --> 29:57.240
our favorite Montana moments and be like, oh yeah, that was great when we went there.

29:57.240 --> 30:02.720
Or Brent and I were planning to take a little bit of the coast on the road trip and we'll

30:02.720 --> 30:07.600
look, here's the first photo of JOOPS on my very first road trip when we took the coast.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.720
I was like, oh yeah, boy, how much have we learned?

30:09.720 --> 30:13.640
It's just re-experiencing those photos because otherwise they just sit there and they do

30:13.640 --> 30:14.640
nothing.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.120
Last of time.

30:16.120 --> 30:17.340
And PhotoPrism is really good.

30:17.340 --> 30:22.280
The other thing it does at helping you discover them is it has this thing called labels and

30:22.280 --> 30:24.720
it automatically categorizes the pictures.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.660
Like here's an aircraft.

30:26.660 --> 30:31.440
These are the pictures when Listener Mike took us up for a ride in Denver when we went

30:31.440 --> 30:36.400
on the Denver road trip and here's a video because it also works on video, right?

30:36.400 --> 30:41.320
There's a video of that moment of us walking out on the tarmac to go ride in Listener Mike's

30:41.320 --> 30:42.320
airplane.

30:42.320 --> 30:46.120
And what an incredible memory that was and it just automatically tagged that.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.680
I didn't have to do that.

30:47.680 --> 30:51.880
There's a tag for Levi, I think, as well, I spent a lot of time in that one.

30:51.880 --> 30:54.160
Yeah, there's a tag for Beach.

30:54.160 --> 30:57.240
There's a tag for Camper or something, whatever they call JOOPS.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.400
Isn't that the European term for it?

30:59.400 --> 31:00.400
Yeah.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.840
Levi tag automatically just finds all these great photos.

31:02.840 --> 31:07.880
When you hover over the photos, if they're a live photo, it'll automatically animate

31:07.880 --> 31:08.880
them.

31:08.880 --> 31:14.760
I kind of witnessed you going through this memory palace, let's call it, when you were

31:14.760 --> 31:19.320
first setting this up and not everything was loaded yet because it was just really fresh.

31:19.320 --> 31:20.520
Yeah, still classifying.

31:20.520 --> 31:28.640
I can say confidently that, yes, this photo prism did it for you because we sat there

31:28.640 --> 31:32.280
for maybe, what was it, like 15 minutes just going through a bunch of memories and like,

31:32.280 --> 31:36.280
oh yeah, check out when we were at the coast and this is one of our favorite camp spots

31:36.280 --> 31:40.720
and we spent that quality time, just you and I going through those memories.

31:40.720 --> 31:44.720
I can imagine when you sit down with your family and do the same thing, how really great

31:44.720 --> 31:45.720
that will be.

31:45.720 --> 31:46.720
Yeah.

31:46.720 --> 31:49.960
Photoprism just makes it easy to have that experience, to casually do it because the

31:49.960 --> 31:56.400
Photosync software is sending them up via web dev, really, in the backend to Photoprism,

31:56.400 --> 32:01.840
but it's pinging its API, so somehow, maybe it's file system events, maybe it's an API

32:01.840 --> 32:02.840
event.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.280
The Photoprism is immediately aware of the moment a photo lands.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.800
See, that's a nice little test, right?

32:06.800 --> 32:10.520
How long is it from, take it on your app, take it on your phone and it actually makes

32:10.520 --> 32:11.520
it all the way into here.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.440
Right, because you want to look at it sometimes right away.

32:13.440 --> 32:17.400
I ran it in verbose mode, the server in verbose mode for a couple of days just so I could

32:17.400 --> 32:21.560
see what it was doing on the backend and it'll go through everything, it'll process everything

32:21.560 --> 32:25.520
and then the last thing it does when it's all done is then it does the face analysis

32:25.520 --> 32:31.000
and you can see it light the cores up, man, it really does.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.240
It cooks that thing for a bit, but it rips through it much faster.

32:34.240 --> 32:37.280
I don't have like a coral accelerator or anything like that.

32:37.280 --> 32:41.720
I'm just doing it right on the old CPU and it's working pretty quick.

32:41.720 --> 32:46.720
So it's a great experience in just using it day to day and it's just staying on top of

32:46.720 --> 32:51.560
your photos and I've been checking it throughout the weeks to make sure that it's captured

32:51.560 --> 32:54.520
everything that I've taken and they're all in there.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.720
It's all working just as expected.

32:56.720 --> 33:01.200
One thing I noticed, Chris, that you may not have is I noticed that there were some raw

33:01.200 --> 33:05.220
photos from, I believe it was your phone, I think they were Apple Raw format and those

33:05.220 --> 33:07.240
just came out as white, just white squares.

33:07.240 --> 33:08.240
Did you notice that?

33:08.240 --> 33:12.640
Yeah, that is actually Alex's Canon R6.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.700
And I don't know why.

33:14.700 --> 33:19.820
There is a premium version, a membership version of Photo Prism, but it doesn't give you any

33:19.820 --> 33:20.820
more formats.

33:20.820 --> 33:24.800
Well, I know from my work in professional photography stuff that sometimes those raw

33:24.800 --> 33:28.080
formats are really tricky, especially for open source projects.

33:28.080 --> 33:32.480
I mean, there's a lot of work that has gone into that, like dark table and raw therapy

33:32.480 --> 33:33.480
and stuff.

33:33.480 --> 33:38.100
They've kind of reverse engineered a lot of those formats, but it's possible that maybe

33:38.100 --> 33:41.860
either the software hasn't tapped into those resources yet or that it just hasn't been

33:41.860 --> 33:42.860
reverse engineered.

33:42.860 --> 33:46.300
I mean, I don't think Alex would be able to tell us because I think he's still using some

33:46.300 --> 33:50.120
of the big software, let's just call it.

33:50.120 --> 33:53.560
And the truth is Google Photos didn't have that problem.

33:53.560 --> 33:59.620
I didn't even know those were a special format until I imported the originals of everything

33:59.620 --> 34:00.620
when I was doing this.

34:00.620 --> 34:05.360
I went back and got the originals of everything and so I just threw it all up there and discovered

34:05.360 --> 34:08.400
some of that was different formats and it handled everything but those.

34:08.400 --> 34:12.800
Now Chris, I wondered, did you try going through the exercise of exporting from Google Photos

34:12.800 --> 34:14.940
and importing it into here?

34:14.940 --> 34:17.240
Because I would imagine that's a workflow that would be pretty common if you're trying

34:17.240 --> 34:18.640
to switch from one to the other.

34:18.640 --> 34:23.200
No, because I have the originals still and Google Photos was just my backup.

34:23.200 --> 34:24.480
That'd be an interesting experiment.

34:24.480 --> 34:27.640
I have in the past done that with some other apps and it's doable.

34:27.640 --> 34:31.160
It's a big download.

34:31.160 --> 34:35.240
For Photoprism itself, they recommend two cores for your CPU, at least three gigs of

34:35.240 --> 34:41.480
RAM and a 64-bit operating system to get all of the face finding and stuff like that and

34:41.480 --> 34:42.880
the automatic classifications.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.720
And I'll link in the notes a demo they have.

34:45.720 --> 34:50.440
They have a demo app too of their classification support and they give you an idea of the range

34:50.440 --> 34:54.080
from animals to cars to pieces of land.

34:54.080 --> 34:59.680
It has this thing called moments too and I don't know what it's doing but it's a moment

34:59.680 --> 35:03.840
that it thinks is something special to you or something like that and it's actually really

35:03.840 --> 35:08.840
nice and it was a surprising label that I had no idea what it did but then I started

35:08.840 --> 35:10.360
looking and I like all of them.

35:10.360 --> 35:15.040
They have fantastic documentation, really good docs to getting all of this set up.

35:15.040 --> 35:19.960
They support some external sharing, it's hit and miss.

35:19.960 --> 35:23.440
They'll let you share to Twitter and Instagram but Purple Dog using Breeze boosted in with

35:23.440 --> 35:27.240
a row of ducks and I agree, he says, the thing I'm missing is I want to be able to share

35:27.240 --> 35:30.800
an album and it doesn't really support that.

35:30.800 --> 35:35.800
I agree the sharing support is not a big aspect for me but it is not as strong as I would

35:35.800 --> 35:37.960
like it with Photoprism.

35:37.960 --> 35:41.520
But the free version that I am using, the community edition, includes nearly everything

35:41.520 --> 35:45.840
except for vector image support and you get simple maps instead of like fancy, really

35:45.840 --> 35:47.600
accurate maps.

35:47.600 --> 35:52.160
And hardware transcoding for the videos is limited to the paid version, wasn't an issue

35:52.160 --> 35:53.160
for me though.

35:53.160 --> 35:56.780
And private support chat is limited to the membered version.

35:56.780 --> 35:57.780
That's reasonable.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.600
Otherwise, it's pretty much everything.

35:59.600 --> 36:05.640
I did notice, I think as a photographer anyways or someone who has a fancier camera and likes

36:05.640 --> 36:11.640
to do some extra editing on the side, you need to keep in mind that Photoprism is basically

36:11.640 --> 36:13.480
a really nice viewing suite.

36:13.480 --> 36:18.200
It doesn't do any editing capabilities, you know, if you want to crop a photo or anything.

36:18.200 --> 36:22.920
I at least haven't found that yet, I've been poking around, not extensively, but I haven't

36:22.920 --> 36:23.920
found that anywhere.

36:23.920 --> 36:27.920
So I think that is something maybe that'll come in the future.

36:27.920 --> 36:31.320
Some simple editing tools might be nice if you want to, you know, edit something quickly

36:31.320 --> 36:35.000
there and then export it and share it with some family or something, but that's something

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
to keep in mind.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.960
I got an idea for that.

36:37.960 --> 36:42.080
I haven't done this part yet, but this is like my to-do when I get back.

36:42.080 --> 36:43.360
I don't see any reason.

36:43.360 --> 36:47.640
I couldn't point SyncThing at the Photoprism libraries because they're just folders on

36:47.640 --> 36:54.960
my hard drive and use SyncThing in send-only mode from the server if I want and receive-only

36:54.960 --> 36:55.960
mode on the client.

36:55.960 --> 37:00.680
So you could have just a mirrored copy on your workstation using SyncThing or you could

37:00.680 --> 37:05.900
do it in send and receive mode and in theory, it would actually work fine if you made an

37:05.900 --> 37:12.520
edit on your workstation and then use SyncThing to sync that back to the Photoprism directory.

37:12.520 --> 37:17.520
I think since Photoprism is just reading from the file system, I think it'd be fine.

37:17.520 --> 37:21.740
And that might be a really, if as long as you had enough local storage to have a copy

37:21.740 --> 37:26.040
of your entire photo database or maybe a subfolder, then you could essentially just open them

37:26.040 --> 37:30.760
up and whatever editing app you like, it'd be a local file, you'd make the changes you

37:30.760 --> 37:34.680
want, you hit save and then SyncThing would send it back up to Photoprism, Photoprism

37:34.680 --> 37:37.240
would re-index it and it would be available to you.

37:37.240 --> 37:40.520
So I'm going to experiment with that further, but that's how I'm planning to address that.

37:40.520 --> 37:44.520
If anybody out there has tried something like that, please let me know.

37:44.520 --> 37:49.040
It would also be interesting in that vein to know if you have some XMP files or something

37:49.040 --> 37:55.360
for your raw format, if it keeps track of those, that would be actually kind of amazing.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.680
Somebody with some experience out there, let us know.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.360
We'll find out eventually though.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.360
So that's okay.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.280
So we're getting it off our device.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.840
You could use Photosync to get it off your digital camera.

38:03.840 --> 38:06.640
You could use Photosync to get it off of your phone.

38:06.640 --> 38:07.640
There's other tools out there.

38:07.640 --> 38:11.440
I really like Photosync and also Photoprism recommends Photosync as well.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.680
We'll have links to this in the show notes.

38:13.680 --> 38:18.320
We're using Photoprism to view it, search it, categorize it.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.000
How do we back it up?

38:20.000 --> 38:21.640
And I got a lot of photos.

38:21.640 --> 38:27.680
I got a lot of photos and I'm looking to save a buck, but I want them protected.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.160
So I needed an edge.

38:29.160 --> 38:33.580
I needed something a little different because everything out there wasn't going to work

38:33.580 --> 38:34.580
for me.

38:34.580 --> 38:35.640
I mean, I'll consider others.

38:35.640 --> 38:40.140
I'm not completely sold on this, but it sounds pretty amazing.

38:40.140 --> 38:42.160
It's called storage.

38:42.160 --> 38:46.760
They build themselves as fast, secure, decentralized cloud storage.

38:46.760 --> 38:49.800
They also call themselves a web three company.

38:49.800 --> 38:50.800
So red flag.

38:50.800 --> 38:51.800
Danger.

38:51.800 --> 38:52.840
I'm not sold yet.

38:52.840 --> 38:53.840
Go on.

38:53.840 --> 38:58.060
I found out about them through IX Systems, who has announced integration with TrueNAS.

38:58.060 --> 38:59.860
So they seem to think it's legitimate.

38:59.860 --> 39:03.220
So that raised it up a little notch in my book.

39:03.220 --> 39:09.760
They call themselves the first open source decentralized cloud storage layer that's private

39:09.760 --> 39:12.240
by design and secure by default.

39:12.240 --> 39:17.880
They say when an object is uploaded into the storage DCS, it is encrypted, split up into

39:17.880 --> 39:24.280
80 or more pieces and distributed across thousands of diverse nodes and ISPs in nearly a hundred

39:24.280 --> 39:25.280
different countries.

39:25.280 --> 39:29.680
There's no single point of failure or centralized location, so there's no outages, downtime

39:29.680 --> 39:31.320
or bit rot.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.940
Failure doesn't affect you and data breaches are virtually impossible.

39:33.940 --> 39:35.660
The node goes offline for any reason.

39:35.660 --> 39:40.360
Your file can be reconstituted from just 29 of its distributed pieces.

39:40.360 --> 39:45.000
I do have a link that has a video that explains how it all works.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.800
I don't know, guys.

39:46.800 --> 39:50.320
I mean, it sounds almost too good to be true when it comes to storage.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.400
It is usually too good to be true if it sounds like it.

39:52.400 --> 39:56.160
But what they're essentially doing is they have a plan that anybody can participate in.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.440
Maybe this is the web three part.

39:57.440 --> 39:58.500
I don't know.

39:58.500 --> 40:02.120
And you can essentially somehow get into this program and allocate some of your data center

40:02.120 --> 40:06.640
storage to their network or something like that.

40:06.640 --> 40:13.080
I've genuinely tried to get to the bottom of how it can be so cheap and I am still a

40:13.080 --> 40:14.080
little unsure.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.440
But here's the pricing.

40:15.440 --> 40:19.080
The free plan, which I'm currently using, which I'll have to upgrade from, is you get

40:19.080 --> 40:23.200
150 gigs of S3 compatible object storage for free.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.280
It's pretty good.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.880
Then after that, you get a pro plan.

40:26.880 --> 40:30.640
The pro plan still includes 150 gigs for free.

40:30.640 --> 40:36.520
And then it's $4 a terabyte after that, which is a really good price.

40:36.520 --> 40:41.880
And a $7 a terabyte transfer rate.

40:41.880 --> 40:45.000
That is way lower than just about anywhere else I can find.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.360
And it also claims to be fully encrypted and fully distributed.

40:49.360 --> 40:52.240
And it claims to be all open source.

40:52.240 --> 40:57.440
And I can verify this at least, it is fully S3 compatible.

40:57.440 --> 40:58.480
It's just too good not to try.

40:58.480 --> 41:00.040
I don't know anything else about storage.

41:00.040 --> 41:03.540
I always go into low cost storage extremely skeptical.

41:03.540 --> 41:06.720
But if it's true that they really are distributing it like this and they're splitting it up like

41:06.720 --> 41:09.000
this and they're encrypting it by default like this.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.600
And you're going to test it for us on the show with it being the sole backup of all

41:12.600 --> 41:13.600
your photos.

41:13.600 --> 41:14.600
I'm doing it right now.

41:14.600 --> 41:15.600
Here we go, buddy.

41:15.600 --> 41:19.160
Well, I'm also that's why I'm going to sync thing it to my workstation and stuff.

41:19.160 --> 41:21.320
So I mean, I'm not crazy.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.320
But I haven't set that up yet.

41:22.320 --> 41:24.240
So currently it is the way I'm doing it.

41:24.240 --> 41:27.920
And here is the beauty thing about storage.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.680
It's S-T-O-R-J, by the way.

41:30.680 --> 41:32.520
But here's the great thing about it.

41:32.520 --> 41:38.320
My backup app of choice that I've already using to back up all my server configs and

41:38.320 --> 41:44.240
all my Docker composes Duplicati has built in support for storage.

41:44.240 --> 41:45.240
Is that right?

41:45.240 --> 41:46.240
Yeah.

41:46.240 --> 41:48.440
And Duplicati is such a great tool.

41:48.440 --> 41:51.560
If you haven't checked it out, it's really easy to get going.

41:51.560 --> 41:54.480
It supports a ton of cloud storage options.

41:54.480 --> 41:58.000
It'll do local AES encryption first.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.200
So one of the things I do is I save my home assistant databases on Google Drive, but I

42:03.200 --> 42:07.440
encrypt them completely locally with Duplicati.

42:07.440 --> 42:12.320
And then Google just gets this big old encrypted tar file that just sits on Google Drive.

42:12.320 --> 42:16.560
And then Duplicati can download if I ever need to restore, manage all of the encryption.

42:16.560 --> 42:20.880
It is like an old school program where you actually can like browse and restore individual

42:20.880 --> 42:22.480
files if you want.

42:22.480 --> 42:24.760
You can get status of your backups.

42:24.760 --> 42:27.000
It's really a great backup program.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.400
I've been using it for years.

42:29.400 --> 42:34.240
So the fact that storage support was built right in and they have docs on how to set

42:34.240 --> 42:39.760
it up was so killer for me because it meant I didn't have to like learn a new backup application

42:39.760 --> 42:41.880
or implement something entirely new.

42:41.880 --> 42:47.760
I just added one more additional backup config to my existing application, which was brilliant.

42:47.760 --> 42:51.080
And set it up, Duplicati sends all my photos up to storage.

42:51.080 --> 42:52.600
It's been doing it for days.

42:52.600 --> 42:56.640
It's been working great and was really easy to get going.

42:56.640 --> 43:00.260
So if you have never tried Duplicati, even if you don't use storage, this could be a

43:00.260 --> 43:02.720
great tool to backup.

43:02.720 --> 43:06.440
You could go to Amazon S3, you could go to Dropbox, you could go to Linode's S3 object

43:06.440 --> 43:09.400
storage, all kinds of services in there.

43:09.400 --> 43:10.400
Really like that application.

43:10.400 --> 43:15.600
I also noticed when I was investigating storage that they have a canary on their website.

43:15.600 --> 43:21.280
You might have seen this with other like privacy conscious VPNs and such.

43:21.280 --> 43:27.880
And the purpose, as far as I understand, is to just kind of make that canary vanish if

43:27.880 --> 43:31.220
they ever get, Chris, you would understand this better, but if they ever get sort of

43:31.220 --> 43:35.640
subpoenaed to give information that they are typically unwilling to give, but if they're

43:35.640 --> 43:37.680
forced into it, then this canary will just kind of go away.

43:37.680 --> 43:41.360
The situation there with the national security letters and the what nots is such that they're

43:41.360 --> 43:48.160
not allowed to say that they've been given this order and they've disclosed information

43:48.160 --> 43:49.160
to the government.

43:49.160 --> 43:50.160
They can't say that.

43:50.160 --> 43:55.420
They're under an embargo when they get served in NDA.

43:55.420 --> 43:58.040
But when you pull a canary, you're not saying anything.

43:58.040 --> 44:01.120
You're removing a statement that you had previously before.

44:01.120 --> 44:04.060
So you make a statement saying we've never been served this.

44:04.060 --> 44:07.360
And then when that disappears, you know that it's happened without them having to come

44:07.360 --> 44:08.360
out and say it.

44:08.360 --> 44:09.360
That's the canary.

44:09.360 --> 44:12.520
It's kind of wild that that's the world we live in.

44:12.520 --> 44:13.520
Right.

44:13.520 --> 44:14.880
It's a bit of a loophole, I think.

44:14.880 --> 44:15.880
Thanks, George Bush.

44:15.880 --> 44:17.760
Appreciate that Patriot Act.

44:17.760 --> 44:19.600
So there you go.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.600
Storage has a canary.

44:20.600 --> 44:23.600
It has a warrant canary, which is actually really a good thing to see.

44:23.600 --> 44:25.880
And it's actually one of the best I've ever seen.

44:25.880 --> 44:31.040
They include like recent news headlines in the canary just to prove the fact that the

44:31.040 --> 44:32.040
date would be accurate.

44:32.040 --> 44:35.360
So you can kind of do your own homework to make sure that it actually was.

44:35.360 --> 44:40.280
And they do say, oh, we'll send this canary once a month, this warranty canary, and include

44:40.280 --> 44:41.280
headlines and such.

44:41.280 --> 44:46.560
And I thought that was really neat until I noticed that the date is from last.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.020
It's actually from July.

44:48.020 --> 44:50.680
And so I wonder if the canary is out or not.

44:50.680 --> 44:51.680
Someone just forgot to update.

44:51.680 --> 44:53.300
No, because you're supposed to pull it.

44:53.300 --> 44:54.300
That's the idea.

44:54.300 --> 44:55.300
Right.

44:55.300 --> 44:56.300
You pull it when that's happened.

44:56.300 --> 44:57.300
But yeah, I don't know.

44:57.300 --> 44:58.520
If you set the expectation, you're going to update it.

44:58.520 --> 45:00.000
You better keep updating it.

45:00.000 --> 45:04.800
So the pro plan is you pay for what you use, essentially.

45:04.800 --> 45:06.600
I haven't gotten to that tier yet.

45:06.600 --> 45:09.560
I'm so skeptical on this kind of stuff, you guys.

45:09.560 --> 45:12.120
But they're checking all the boxes.

45:12.120 --> 45:15.760
And I felt like I wanted to get my hands on it so I could at least come on the show and

45:15.760 --> 45:17.800
give you my experience in a bit.

45:17.800 --> 45:18.800
So I'm trying it out.

45:18.800 --> 45:19.800
This is what I'm using for my backup.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.520
I really like it so far.

45:21.520 --> 45:23.820
I think the pricing is ridiculous.

45:23.820 --> 45:25.320
And I'm going to embrace it while I can.

45:25.320 --> 45:28.840
And the fact that I can integrate it with duplicati is just a huge win for me.

45:28.840 --> 45:33.120
Yeah, I feel like if you're doing the encryption on your side, that makes me feel a lot better.

45:33.120 --> 45:34.420
Yeah, I agree.

45:34.420 --> 45:35.760
That's the thing I want.

45:35.760 --> 45:37.720
I want to control that encryption on my side.

45:37.720 --> 45:43.240
I want it to require my key on the restoring side to actually decrypt that stuff.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.320
So I know, Wes, that you've been digging into this too.

45:45.320 --> 45:47.440
You've been solving this problem for a while.

45:47.440 --> 45:48.960
Tell me what tools you've strung together.

45:48.960 --> 45:52.160
Well, you know, there are a lot of different options in this space.

45:52.160 --> 45:57.080
One I noticed that I'm not using but I thought was an interesting approach is called Stingle.

45:57.080 --> 46:00.660
And the client is all open source.

46:00.660 --> 46:02.580
But they do the hosting on the back end.

46:02.580 --> 46:04.740
So it doesn't really fit with the whole self-host everything.

46:04.740 --> 46:07.620
But if what you were looking for is, you know, something that is at least partially open

46:07.620 --> 46:13.700
source but isn't sending things to Google in particular, then this might be for you.

46:13.700 --> 46:14.840
The app looks quite nice.

46:14.840 --> 46:15.840
It's simple.

46:15.840 --> 46:18.080
You just pay, you know, for the back end hosting costs.

46:18.080 --> 46:20.960
So right there, you're at least paying for what you're using.

46:20.960 --> 46:21.960
Seems reasonable to me.

46:21.960 --> 46:22.960
Now, I don't know anything about them.

46:22.960 --> 46:23.960
I don't know.

46:23.960 --> 46:25.360
Would I trust that as my sole backup of my photos?

46:25.360 --> 46:26.920
Are they going to disappear at some point?

46:26.920 --> 46:28.360
And can you get your photos out?

46:28.360 --> 46:29.360
I'm not sure.

46:29.360 --> 46:32.100
But you do have some options if you're not quite willing to take on the full load of

46:32.100 --> 46:35.520
like, oh, I got to find storage for these things, and I got to make sure that my server's

46:35.520 --> 46:37.000
up and the sync is going.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
Right.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
That does sound nice.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.280
And it would at least get you off of the Google threat model.

46:41.280 --> 46:42.280
Right.

46:42.280 --> 46:43.280
Yeah, at least there.

46:43.280 --> 46:46.920
I don't think Stingle at least has as many GPUs to mine all of your data from.

46:46.920 --> 46:47.920
Also a great name.

46:47.920 --> 46:48.920
Exactly.

46:48.920 --> 46:49.920
Stingle.

46:49.920 --> 46:50.920
Stingle.

46:50.920 --> 46:51.920
Yeah.

46:51.920 --> 46:52.920
That's great.

46:52.920 --> 46:53.920
I love it.

46:53.920 --> 46:54.920
Now, you're right.

46:54.920 --> 46:58.000
I have been using SyncThing for a long time to do photo sync.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.240
And I mean, what can you say?

46:59.240 --> 47:00.440
SyncThing really just works.

47:00.440 --> 47:03.400
Like it just syncs, it keeps going.

47:03.400 --> 47:07.200
I think for using it for photos can certainly work on Android pretty well.

47:07.200 --> 47:10.720
You do kind of have to know and understand a bit about SyncThing, I think to feel fully

47:10.720 --> 47:11.720
comfortable with it.

47:11.720 --> 47:15.680
So I don't know that I would recommend that maybe for like a grandma type figure in your

47:15.680 --> 47:18.960
life, especially because you might need a couple you might need to think about the model

47:18.960 --> 47:22.080
you can kind of play with like, send or receive only.

47:22.080 --> 47:25.400
But then if you're deleting stuff from your phone, there might there's sometimes like

47:25.400 --> 47:28.280
a notification that's like, hey, just so you know, you're out of sync, you could ignore

47:28.280 --> 47:29.280
that.

47:29.280 --> 47:30.920
SyncThing works fine.

47:30.920 --> 47:35.200
Another approach is you could just imagine it as a sort of bi directional setup all the

47:35.200 --> 47:38.360
time, where you're just imagining that you're making a copy of whatever's on your phone

47:38.360 --> 47:41.960
on a server somewhere, and then you have a separate sync process that sort of copies

47:41.960 --> 47:46.120
from there and syncs whatever's new that shows up to your real back end folder where, you

47:46.120 --> 47:50.560
know, whatever photo viewer your gallery is actually going to pull from.

47:50.560 --> 47:54.560
So if you're comfortable with that, or let's say you already are using SyncThing, you have

47:54.560 --> 47:57.800
a SyncThing network going, you have other stuff on your phone you want to sync to or

47:57.800 --> 48:01.280
from, that seems like a really solid option.

48:01.280 --> 48:05.120
I did look a bit at photosync, it does seem like I mean, I think that is probably what

48:05.120 --> 48:08.440
I would recommend for someone who wasn't super competent, but just wanted to suck photos

48:08.440 --> 48:11.220
off their phone because it's polished around for a long time.

48:11.220 --> 48:12.880
It's like an appliance kind of app.

48:12.880 --> 48:13.880
Yeah, exactly.

48:13.880 --> 48:15.800
But I know you were playing with that.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.680
I want to try something a little bit different.

48:17.680 --> 48:20.080
So yeah, I found low mirage.

48:20.080 --> 48:21.080
Okay.

48:21.080 --> 48:24.640
Oh, you you can give it a shot of pronouncing if you prefer lumarage.

48:24.640 --> 48:26.740
I almost think it's like something to do with lighting.

48:26.740 --> 48:28.120
I don't know.

48:28.120 --> 48:33.200
It is definitely not as polished, but it does have an iOS and Android app as well as actually

48:33.200 --> 48:35.880
a Windows and a Mac desktop version.

48:35.880 --> 48:39.200
I haven't tried those, no version for Linux just yet.

48:39.200 --> 48:43.560
It's pretty bare bones, but it comes with a lot of the features, not all of them as

48:43.560 --> 48:48.760
shiny as say PhotoPrism has, but it has a built in gallery, which also means from your

48:48.760 --> 48:51.720
phone, if you're looking at a photo, you can share it right there from the app on your

48:51.720 --> 48:52.720
phone.

48:52.720 --> 48:55.240
And it just has a little token that embeds, you can send that link.

48:55.240 --> 48:56.240
So that's pretty handy.

48:56.240 --> 48:57.240
That is.

48:57.240 --> 49:03.000
I should mention PhotoPrism has a progressive web app, a PWA that does work pretty good

49:03.000 --> 49:08.640
on mobile, but the sharing is still, I'm not my, I think that's its weakest area.

49:08.640 --> 49:11.960
So far I've been pretty impressed with the actual sync functionality, you know, the Android

49:11.960 --> 49:14.400
app connected right away and it held right up.

49:14.400 --> 49:18.080
I think like the full backlog of however many thousands of photos I had sitting on my phone.

49:18.080 --> 49:22.300
And then over the past week or so, it's been, you know, sucking up new ones as I go on walks

49:22.300 --> 49:24.820
with the dogs and go explore the neighborhood.

49:24.820 --> 49:27.320
It's not the easiest to configure, it's definitely not a pretty app.

49:27.320 --> 49:30.200
It's more of like a, you know, like a technical users app.

49:30.200 --> 49:33.800
But unlike the experience you get with sync thing, it's focused on photos.

49:33.800 --> 49:36.200
So like when you open the app up, it shows you all your photos right there.

49:36.200 --> 49:39.560
You can view them there and it'll tell you like, oh, you've synced this.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.240
You can configure which folders you want to sync.

49:41.240 --> 49:44.200
You could, instead of doing all of them, if you just want to sort of manually pick and

49:44.200 --> 49:47.920
choose, it makes it really easy to sync individual photos that you can just select your group.

49:47.920 --> 49:50.560
I mean, it looks like they got pretty good docs too for the server installation.

49:50.560 --> 49:52.360
I mean, look at this.

49:52.360 --> 49:59.680
They got Docker, they got app, they got Raspbian images, they got Unraid, Synology, OpenWRT.

49:59.680 --> 50:00.680
That's awesome.

50:00.680 --> 50:01.680
I love to see that.

50:01.680 --> 50:02.680
Yeah.

50:02.680 --> 50:03.680
It's pretty lightweight as well.

50:03.680 --> 50:04.680
So you don't need, you know, it's not super heavy.

50:04.680 --> 50:07.640
It doesn't have a ton of functionality, especially the gallery that you get on the web.

50:07.640 --> 50:10.000
Like it's not super fancy, but you can go scroll through them.

50:10.000 --> 50:12.080
You can, as I said, you can link from it.

50:12.080 --> 50:16.080
One downside is it doesn't seem like the client is open source.

50:16.080 --> 50:20.120
Now that doesn't seem, there's no ads, there's no, doesn't seem to be any spine that I could

50:20.120 --> 50:21.120
find.

50:21.120 --> 50:22.440
Yeah, you got to weigh that.

50:22.440 --> 50:26.560
It seems like unfortunately we're, besides anything, there's not a ton of great open

50:26.560 --> 50:30.680
source options, maybe because we do want something that's really polished and reliable.

50:30.680 --> 50:31.680
Yeah.

50:31.680 --> 50:34.600
Maybe that, maybe it just takes a lot of investment of time and so people want to make a buck

50:34.600 --> 50:35.600
off of it.

50:35.600 --> 50:42.280
Again, like you were saying though, it's sort of the threat of a loomerage, how are we going

50:42.280 --> 50:43.280
to say it?

50:43.280 --> 50:44.280
Loom range?

50:44.280 --> 50:45.280
Luma range?

50:45.280 --> 50:46.280
Luma rage?

50:46.280 --> 50:47.280
You got to give a shot, Brent.

50:47.280 --> 50:50.680
Oh, well, I don't know why I want to say it in French.

50:50.680 --> 50:51.680
I'd say loomerage.

50:51.680 --> 50:52.680
Luma range.

50:52.680 --> 50:53.680
Okay.

50:53.680 --> 50:54.680
All right.

50:54.680 --> 50:55.680
Been saying Lomo.

50:55.680 --> 50:58.880
Maybe they're dirty French Canadians, I don't know.

50:58.880 --> 51:04.080
But I don't think they're going to be profiling me, indexing all of my data, analyzing my

51:04.080 --> 51:10.320
photos for CSAM violations, and then sending my entire account history to the police automatically

51:10.320 --> 51:13.600
and then shutting my account down, including disconnecting my phone service.

51:13.600 --> 51:19.600
I doubt there's that risk, you know, so this is better.

51:19.600 --> 51:22.840
And it's not, it doesn't seem to have a huge team of development, but I've seen the developers

51:22.840 --> 51:26.560
active on some subreddits, the GitHub repo does have some recent commits.

51:26.560 --> 51:30.320
So it seems to be, if not the fastest project, at least a project that it's steadily adding

51:30.320 --> 51:33.480
features and continuing to be worked on.

51:33.480 --> 51:37.360
They also had a blog post from earlier in this year talking about how it works just

51:37.360 --> 51:38.720
fine with photo prism.

51:38.720 --> 51:42.360
So you know, it's a good, they sort of promote right out of the gate, like, yeah, you know,

51:42.360 --> 51:46.120
you can use this for sync, you can use it for more mix and match with whatever tools,

51:46.120 --> 51:47.720
other tools you might want to use.

51:47.720 --> 51:48.720
Well, that's a great.

51:48.720 --> 51:51.840
That could have best of both worlds right there.

51:51.840 --> 51:52.840
Very nice.

51:52.840 --> 51:56.040
I did take a look at a couple of different options on the view side, too.

51:56.040 --> 52:00.040
I feel like we should mention Pi Gallery, too, just because it's been around for a while

52:00.040 --> 52:04.840
and just a simple app, if all you're looking for is something that can easily display photos,

52:04.840 --> 52:09.120
no editing capabilities, nothing super fancy, but it has a nice snappy UI and because it's

52:09.120 --> 52:13.160
meant to run on a Pi, you know, it's easy for these things to take more resources than

52:13.160 --> 52:14.160
they should.

52:14.160 --> 52:15.160
Yeah.

52:15.160 --> 52:18.600
But this is like legit snappy, even if you've got thousands of photos or big photos.

52:18.600 --> 52:23.080
And what I like about this, too, is you could still use a tool like Photo Sync or Folder

52:23.080 --> 52:27.680
Sync or Lumrage and, you know, you move it over and you can manage it and organize it

52:27.680 --> 52:30.920
yourself on the file system and then just throw this on top of it.

52:30.920 --> 52:35.760
And it's a really simple, straightforward Raspberry Pi with a big old USB disk hanging

52:35.760 --> 52:37.800
off it problem solved kind of solution.

52:37.800 --> 52:41.880
I also like that it supports both OpenStreetMap and Mapbox.

52:41.880 --> 52:44.720
Some of the ones I checked out, they mostly just had Mapbox support, which is fine, but

52:44.720 --> 52:48.560
you need to go like register for a key and, you know, it's only free up to some amount.

52:48.560 --> 52:52.880
All reasonable, but it is nice to have sort of options there.

52:52.880 --> 52:56.160
The other two I took a look at, Photoprism seems really nice, but again, I knew you've

52:56.160 --> 52:59.240
been playing with it, so I wanted to, you know, go farther afield.

52:59.240 --> 53:03.080
I took a look at Photo View and Libre Photos.

53:03.080 --> 53:04.080
Oh, okay.

53:04.080 --> 53:05.880
I've heard of Libre Photos.

53:05.880 --> 53:08.720
Yeah, Photo View seems to be a little bit newer on the scene.

53:08.720 --> 53:14.420
It has some of the same aims as Photoprism, but at this point, it's just a fair bit simpler.

53:14.420 --> 53:18.920
It does have some autosmarts to try to build albums for you and figure out your timeline.

53:18.920 --> 53:22.000
It does have map support as well, but you do need to go set that up.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.520
That was kind of a theme here is like if you wanted some of the extras like map support,

53:25.520 --> 53:27.080
you kind of had to do that plumbing.

53:27.080 --> 53:31.360
It didn't work right out of the box, but it had no problems identifying all of my dumb

53:31.360 --> 53:32.760
selfies right out of the way.

53:32.760 --> 53:37.480
It found dog pics and it found some, I mean, kind of its own weird set of tags, which was

53:37.480 --> 53:38.480
fun.

53:38.480 --> 53:39.960
I think one it found was shrubbery.

53:39.960 --> 53:40.960
Yes.

53:40.960 --> 53:44.760
Was it pictures of shrubbery, was it accurate?

53:44.760 --> 53:45.760
Yeah.

53:45.760 --> 53:46.760
Well, there you go.

53:46.760 --> 53:47.760
Not a shrubbery.

53:47.760 --> 53:53.160
And then Libre Photos, a little fancier, not quite up to the level of Photoprism, but it's

53:53.160 --> 53:58.000
got things like a place tree, it can do word clouds, it has a timeline, it has a social

53:58.000 --> 54:02.680
graph, and also kind of looks for face clusters in the data.

54:02.680 --> 54:06.560
They've also got a nice little sharing functionality built right in that has a concept of public

54:06.560 --> 54:07.560
photos.

54:07.560 --> 54:10.200
So you can mark some photos as public if you're just like maybe you're trying to, you know,

54:10.200 --> 54:13.240
want to display some of the stuff that you don't mind the public world seeing.

54:13.240 --> 54:15.240
Does it spin up a web server for people to view them?

54:15.240 --> 54:16.240
Yeah.

54:16.240 --> 54:18.440
And you can just link to it from the web server that it's got.

54:18.440 --> 54:20.660
And then you can share stuff between different users.

54:20.660 --> 54:21.660
That's one thing.

54:21.660 --> 54:23.800
Both of these support having different users on the server, which is nice.

54:23.800 --> 54:27.680
So if you did want to have maybe, you know, just a gallery that you didn't share with

54:27.680 --> 54:30.400
the wider world, but you had some friends that you go on trips with, or you have some

54:30.400 --> 54:32.560
family that are all using the same system.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.760
Occasional things like family events and whatnot.

54:34.760 --> 54:35.760
Totally.

54:35.760 --> 54:36.760
Right.

54:36.760 --> 54:38.840
So you can give them a sort of internal access to it without having to worry about the whole

54:38.840 --> 54:39.960
world having access.

54:39.960 --> 54:40.960
That's a really nice feature.

54:40.960 --> 54:42.580
I like that a lot.

54:42.580 --> 54:45.000
That's the kind of sharing stuff I'd love to see come to Photo Prism.

54:45.000 --> 54:49.400
I don't know if I want it in a web server locally.

54:49.400 --> 54:51.180
I know they do offer some cloud stuff.

54:51.180 --> 54:54.280
They may offer some cloud sharing with the membership program, but that sounds like what

54:54.280 --> 54:55.840
you just described there sounds really great.

54:55.840 --> 54:58.040
And that's Libre Photos that does that.

54:58.040 --> 55:01.520
Now one other piece that I'm kind of watching for you, I can't you can't easily try it out

55:01.520 --> 55:08.740
yet is I found a Libre Photos Android client looks pretty modern.

55:08.740 --> 55:12.280
So modern that it's actually in private beta right now.

55:12.280 --> 55:15.020
So I haven't actually tried it, but it looks really nice.

55:15.020 --> 55:18.160
It's trying to add that mobile front component to it.

55:18.160 --> 55:19.160
Right.

55:19.160 --> 55:21.800
So it's trying to compete a little bit more with Google Photos, have a really rich client

55:21.800 --> 55:25.400
right there on the device and then handle the syncing for you if you want a little more

55:25.400 --> 55:28.160
fully baked together platform experience.

55:28.160 --> 55:31.420
Image IMMCH or something like that is doing something similar.

55:31.420 --> 55:33.440
That's when we're watching closely on self-hosted.

55:33.440 --> 55:38.580
This is a category like I mentioned that self-hosted tracks because I think going through this

55:38.580 --> 55:42.280
looking at what you found and looking at the tooling and hearing Brent's thoughts about

55:42.280 --> 55:46.800
Photo Prism where I'm at right now is it's there.

55:46.800 --> 55:47.800
The tooling is there.

55:47.800 --> 55:49.500
The capability is there.

55:49.500 --> 55:53.520
It is absolutely totally possible to replace Google Photos now.

55:53.520 --> 55:55.840
It's just up to people to decide if they want to do it or not.

55:55.840 --> 55:57.200
It's absolutely a doable thing.

55:57.200 --> 56:00.800
It's totally manageable even for people that are really busy because a lot of this is you

56:00.800 --> 56:04.600
set it up, you get the plumbing done once and then it's just going to run.

56:04.600 --> 56:06.240
I really like these selections.

56:06.240 --> 56:10.480
Uhura Photos is what it's called.

56:10.480 --> 56:15.840
Uhura Photos is the Libre Photos client app for Android that's under development and the

56:15.840 --> 56:17.640
UI is very similar to Google Photos.

56:17.640 --> 56:20.920
I think this is one Android user should definitely keep an eye on.

56:20.920 --> 56:22.760
That looks really good Wes.

56:22.760 --> 56:28.960
And with all these you know if you've just got photos in some folders all of these were

56:28.960 --> 56:29.960
friendly with that.

56:29.960 --> 56:32.520
Like they didn't necessarily need to have their own proprietary database.

56:32.520 --> 56:34.020
They would build that on top.

56:34.020 --> 56:37.360
Now you might want a solution down the road to help you organize things but I think that

56:37.360 --> 56:40.820
was nice because I didn't feel locked in to the you know I could I had all of them stand

56:40.820 --> 56:46.860
up on top of my synced data with the low mirage so I didn't have to you know I could try them

56:46.860 --> 56:47.860
all out easily.

56:47.860 --> 56:51.040
I didn't have to like migrate things between them or worry that one of them was going to

56:51.040 --> 56:55.260
muck up the structure and then the other one could no longer read it so that was handy.

56:55.260 --> 57:00.160
As for backing things up, low mirage did have an interesting I think they're kind of imagining

57:00.160 --> 57:01.160
you're doing this at home.

57:01.160 --> 57:02.200
You're syncing things to your house.

57:02.200 --> 57:06.620
So they've got this concept of a backup drive so it's got a primary target that it's going

57:06.620 --> 57:10.920
to stick things to and if that fills up or is unavailable you can configure it with an

57:10.920 --> 57:11.920
automatic backup.

57:11.920 --> 57:14.540
So I thought that could be handy maybe if you want to stick things on some spendier

57:14.540 --> 57:17.800
cloud storage that you've got mounted but you don't always want things so you could

57:17.800 --> 57:21.480
have S3 at home you know you could have it dumped S3 if you've run out of stuff at home

57:21.480 --> 57:25.000
if you're worried about that but not always have things on there.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.160
I was lazy though so I just started with S3 or S3 compatible storage right from the get

57:29.160 --> 57:30.160
go.

57:30.160 --> 57:35.520
You know S3FS has an option you can supply your own key if you want to have things encrypted

57:35.520 --> 57:38.040
on the back end using the key that you provide.

57:38.040 --> 57:41.080
So that's a real low you know you don't have to worry about extra programs if you just

57:41.080 --> 57:45.100
want to use S3FS have it mount that storage and then you know the containers underneath

57:45.100 --> 57:47.000
are none the wiser.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
That's a great idea.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.280
That's sneaky and performance is fine for what you're doing.

57:50.280 --> 57:51.280
Yeah it was totally fine.

57:51.280 --> 57:52.280
That's good.

57:52.280 --> 57:56.120
Now one question I've kind of been having and I haven't totally resolved.

57:56.120 --> 58:02.080
Do I want all of my photos hot forever or am I willing to set some horizon somewhere

58:02.080 --> 58:05.360
where I'm like willing to transfer those to something else.

58:05.360 --> 58:10.320
I don't always you know that could be in something like Amazon's glacier maybe or if you got

58:10.320 --> 58:11.320
your own tape backups.

58:11.320 --> 58:12.320
I don't know.

58:12.320 --> 58:13.320
I could see a work case for that.

58:13.320 --> 58:16.200
That would be one workflow I haven't fully thought through yet is like do I want to put

58:16.200 --> 58:20.320
stuff in longer term storage that I just don't need access to if it's over 10 years old say

58:20.320 --> 58:21.320
or.

58:21.320 --> 58:25.280
I feel like for my use case I want all of them online so that I can use that location

58:25.280 --> 58:28.880
thing that shows all the photos you took in this place or all the faces of the kids.

58:28.880 --> 58:29.880
Right.

58:29.880 --> 58:33.080
So you want the whole history but not everybody has those use cases.

58:33.080 --> 58:40.720
I could definitely see especially if there was a way to do a low res JPEG preview of

58:40.720 --> 58:45.480
the image and then store the really big version like on that glacier that'd be really nice

58:45.480 --> 58:46.480
wouldn't it.

58:46.480 --> 58:47.480
Yeah.

58:47.480 --> 58:49.360
Something you know like OK I can at least check to see if I want to go pull the full

58:49.360 --> 58:51.840
thing without getting in for it to go find it.

58:51.840 --> 58:53.400
Yeah I could see that.

58:53.400 --> 58:55.480
Maybe people out there doing something like that.

58:55.480 --> 58:58.640
For now I think I'm taking your route though I'm just gonna I'm just gonna pay for the

58:58.640 --> 59:00.520
photos I take and so be it.

59:00.520 --> 59:04.280
Well we got a lot of great links in the notes today.

59:04.280 --> 59:08.080
There is some really good resources in there and of course we haven't touched on every

59:08.080 --> 59:09.960
possible permutation or setup.

59:09.960 --> 59:13.420
So yeah you know in the past I'd used I just see Matrix folks talking about this I had

59:13.420 --> 59:17.000
used Nextcloud to do photo sync and that was all right.

59:17.000 --> 59:21.280
I found it to be annoying in some of the particulars of the weird photo formats.

59:21.280 --> 59:28.920
So I would take one of those you know fancy fake bokeh type portrait mode photos and it

59:28.920 --> 59:32.320
worked fine but each one of those would make a little folder on the Android disk on the

59:32.320 --> 59:36.120
file system and then Nextcloud would tell me it discovered a new photo or new folder

59:36.120 --> 59:37.640
oh it's going to sync that for you.

59:37.640 --> 59:38.640
Yeah.

59:38.640 --> 59:39.640
I don't ever need to see it.

59:39.640 --> 59:41.320
So in the particulars I was less pleased.

59:41.320 --> 59:46.040
Yeah I mean if Nextcloud's working for folks then you know you could take out Lumarager

59:46.040 --> 59:51.160
or sync thing or photo sync in my case and you could just use that.

59:51.160 --> 59:54.660
For me Nextcloud's just way more than I want for this whole pipeline.

59:54.660 --> 59:56.720
I don't want this I don't want it involved.

59:56.720 --> 01:00:00.840
I just don't want it and I would still throw a Photo Prism on top of it anyways.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.480
But and it's harder to do because Nextcloud's got you know it's mapped all the files through

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.640
its database most of the time.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:08.960
True but you know if it was working for you it was one that got sent in a lot.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:13.520
We got a ton of great ideas and setups that helped us tinker with different stuff and

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.240
try different tools.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:19.980
So thank you everybody who sent in your emails and gave us ideas and inspirations and we'd

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:23.320
love to keep hearing them and of course the boosts are welcome as well.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.320
I think though for us this is our working setup.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:30.400
I can safely say I'm done with Google Photos and now I just got to actually take the next

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:37.440
step and go on there and tell it to delete all my data.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.720
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:43.600
Go get started with a free trial for a team or an enterprise or yourself as an individual

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.720
at Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.960
Bitwarden is simply the easiest way for yourself or your business to store share and sync your

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.200
sensitive data.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.760
I love that Bitwarden can be customizable you can turn certain features on and off in

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.080
the enterprise that you don't want with policies or as just a user yourself.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.260
And of course Bitwarden being open source and the fact that it's trusted by millions

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.640
in the community gives me confidence.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.540
I know that even way way down the road I'm gonna have access to my passwords.

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:15.120
It's what Wes and I use to manage our passwords and also other sensitive data too like two

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:20.400
factor codes some passphrases for some of my apps like matrix and Bitwarden just keeps

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.800
getting better all the time so they make these reads really easy because it's great to see

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.260
them add fast mail alias generation now.

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:35.120
Picture it Sicily 1984 you're creating your first online service you're logging in for

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:40.200
the very first time you want to make a complicated password you make it like oh this is a good

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:46.200
password you write it down you come up with your clever clever username oh it's a good

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:51.640
one and you write it down and you sign up you fast forward now it's 2022 you're still

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:55.600
using that same username you still using that same password or you have used it in a lot

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.520
of places that's no good.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:02.320
You know it I know it the whole internet knows it everybody knows it has probably been leaked

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.140
more than a dozen times.

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:09.800
Now with Bitwarden you can generate a unique username a unique password and a unique email

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:15.360
address that's only to that site to that service so if anything goes sideways you know exactly

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:21.080
where it came from but also you know you're only compromised just in that one unique set

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:27.080
of credentials everything else is safe nothing feels better than that when that situation

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:31.920
happens nothing feels better than that it is so great and of course Bitwarden is always

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:39.660
adding new features both to the browser extension to the mobile app even to the desktop apps

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:45.780
go check out Bitwarden at bitwarden.com slash Linux see why we like it so much and then

01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:54.200
if you know someone out there who is not practicing safe passwords maybe point them to that URL

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:58.420
get them on board it's probably the number one thing they could do to improve their online

01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:03.120
security if they're not doing that right now come on bitwarden.com slash Linux let's all

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:08.120
go over there help out family or friends or workplace or I don't know a stranger on the

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:15.920
corner everybody could use better passwords bitwarden.com slash Linux

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.540
I did want to say thank you to the listeners for sending in some great feedback we got

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:25.320
a lot of suggestions on which photo applications to try so thank you for sending all of those

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:32.360
in Bob did write in about CASA OS hey guys what do you think about CASA OS looks interesting

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:39.080
to me but I'm just a noob I want something to run on my Pi 3b plus just doing document

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:45.080
mp3 and photo sharing mainly what do you think community-based open source software focused

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:50.280
on delivering simple home cloud experience around a docker ecosystem it's a project that's

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:56.000
focused on like leading with the best dashboard the prettiest dashboard yeah that's clearly

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.960
their focus none of us have used it but it's it's that kind of typical Linux system with

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:09.460
a docker plumbing underneath these seem to be really solid and popular but I think each

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:15.840
has to be evaluated on their own and you know I really like umbral and they've just added

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:21.080
a bunch of really great stuff but there's these projects are all still really early

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:25.960
days and some of them have some security considerations and whatnot hey you know CASA OS has photo

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:31.680
developers I was just gonna say that that was totally unintentional but very very nice

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:36.320
it also works with looks like it makes home assistant easy to deploy you know these can

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.800
be really compelling the thing that's tricky is like home assistant also wants to do this

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.400
job where it wants to be your applications platform everyone wants to manage your apps

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:48.840
so it's getting to the point where there's almost too many of these but I CASA does I

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.120
have to say look like a decent one just going through their website but I definitely have

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.880
to try it to know and it does seem like an area that's that's useful at least if we want

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.200
broader adoption of some of these stuff right we might be comfortable spending a day or

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:03.040
two getting you know figuring out oh this project has docker commands but I gotta put

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.640
that a compose file or they have instructions for the base OS but that's fine I know I can

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.600
just stick it over here or let me go find and vet an image that someone else has built

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:15.480
for this but what are you gonna do if you want you know some of your friends who want

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:18.800
to take over some of their self-control but they have less skills you know I was trying

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:22.600
to figure out if we had talked about this on the network previously and I did a little

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:28.520
search at notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com and I think it's important to note that you shouldn't

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:34.720
get confused between CASA OS and Nooboo CASA which I was like oh yeah we've definitely

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:39.260
talked about that but they're two distinct things yeah Nooboo CASA is the company behind

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:47.560
Home Assistant and CASA OS is a Linux distro based server platform I guess a friend of

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:52.160
the show wrote in as well regarding the conversations we've been having recently about malware on

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:59.080
Linux and how to protect yourself they write I run hundreds of servers many with well-known

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:06.400
public IPs IPs from decades-old running class a networks yeah those class A's oh fun I have

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:11.160
some straightforward suggestions that have kept my public facing bits from getting owned

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:18.240
okay I'd be happy to elaborate but basically number one failed to ban failed to ban everywhere

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:25.680
number two SSH D config with a permit root without password so that means to only allow

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:34.840
root SSH logins when using private keys and number three OS sec and was a or other log

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:40.000
reading aggregators for when you miss things I've been told that many people turn off se

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.160
Linux on their servers during the kickstart installation script I would not know about

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:51.220
that though but it hasn't seemed to hurt them yet wouldn't recommend that's one of those

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:57.480
don't do as I actually do they say things yeah all of us at some point of probably disabled

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:02.080
se Linux a few more times than we should have let's admit it now it's true it's true it's

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:08.580
getting better it's getting better on newer fedora installs but if you can get it working

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:13.560
it is a nice little peace of mind I have to say Jason also wrote in a bit on malware and

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:18.320
security yeah mentioning crowd sec which I hadn't heard about before but I did read the

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:23.080
description here crowd sec is a free modern and collaborative behavior detection engine

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:28.960
coupled with a global IP reputation network it stacks on failed bands philosophy but is

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:36.800
IP v6 compatible and about 60 times faster so it's go versus python uses grok patterns

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:42.360
to parse logs and yaml scenarios to identify behaviors crowd sec is engineered for modern

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:48.480
cloud containers and VM based infrastructures by decoupling detection and remediation once

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:55.180
detected you can remedy the threat with various bouncers firewalls nginx HTTP 403s captures

01:07:55.180 --> 01:08:01.200
it etc while the aggressive IPs can be sent to crowd sec for curation before being shared

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:08.080
among all users to further improve everyone's security you know I believe Westpain has a

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:12.840
global IP reputation network he runs as well yeah I sure do yeah I do have to send you

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.540
the IPs in the mail so it's you know it's not the fastest to get identified but I do

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:20.280
send them you do and it's been it's been a really good system it's just something West

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:24.440
does for free in a spare time don't know why but you know Jason we got a lot of people

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:30.360
that said crowd sec is a must recommend and I'm really glad I don't have to think about

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:36.600
these things anymore very very very glad there was a time and a place that time and places

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:41.960
no more I keep I keep all my systems behind firewalls I no longer have any inbound ports

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:46.040
on any of my firewalls except for one of the ones here at the studio I just realized I'm

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:52.280
saying that but that's the problem with them you forget about them right yeah but you know

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:56.360
it's I feel a lot better I don't really I don't worry about it too much we could probably

01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:02.400
think about this for our cloud instances though I'm impressed recently with how this kind

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:08.840
of crowdsource security is getting pretty common I'm thinking also of crowdsource like

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:15.400
ad blocking and such I think in the last few years these have shown up and it's impressive

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:20.640
what all of us kind of working together can come up with I really like that concept yes

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:26.080
as long as it isn't abused these things are always have that potential like I'm just thinking

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:32.880
of spam blacklists they're mostly good but they also have made it nearly impossible to

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.760
self-host your own email now because of these shared blacklists if you accidentally get

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:42.120
on one for some stupid reason right what are the other processes in place who do you you

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:49.680
know who do you appeal to to remedy things if anyone or at all and now it is time for

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:54.440
the boost we got some great boost into the show this week and I want to mention if you

01:09:54.440 --> 01:10:00.600
don't hear your boosts on here we are recording two shows today so we save some for this episode

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:05.000
and we save some for other episodes and we're curating them now we're picking certain boosts

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.040
we're reading all of them and getting some of them onto the air and hey citizen boosted

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:15.680
in last week with 69 69 sats a citizen and it gives me just an opportunity to talk about

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:22.440
something I love he says he loves Linux and he loves lit now pop quiz for you guys can

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:30.760
any of you guys describe what lit is what does it mean if our show is lit now I should

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.400
I mean I know in the sense of the fire emoji I should I'm on board with that yeah that's

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:41.320
true I see here it's you've spelt it specifically or they've spelt it specifically capital L

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:46.480
small I capital T so maybe that's an indicator West for you I can give you a hint yeah but

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:51.720
it might give it away so I'll just tell you it is the live item tag in the podcasting

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:58.320
tutorial oh that's embarrassing now yeah and so apps like pod verse and others have the

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:03.800
ability to actually stream our live stream in their app and you just looking at your

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:08.200
podcasts you know this your list of shows to listen to and Linux unplugged shows up

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:13.440
with a little live badge next to it and wouldn't click that and what's brilliant about it is

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:17.480
it's just done through the RSS feed and if this is one of the namespaces in there's this

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:22.120
live item tag you put that in there and then the podcast catcher sees that and it just

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:26.400
adds it to the list as a live show and it's one of the beauties of the podcasting tutorial

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:30.880
stuff so much good stuff getting developed over there yep so I just appreciate the opportunity

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:36.480
to actually talk about that because I love it and I think it'll come it'll be it'll be

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:42.080
here one day we first have to get to the stage of completely generating all our own RSS feeds

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:46.880
on our own we'll experiment with office hours and member feeds and then we'll roll it out

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.040
to all the shows someday in the near future yeah stay tuned and hey pro tip to you boosters

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:57.760
out there if you mention podcasting 2.0 you're pretty likely to get on there that's true

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:02.560
Blake Collin boosted in with 10,001 sats coming in hot with the boost I love that one he's

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:09.260
got a pro tip speaking of podcasting 2.0 you can boost from the podcast index web page

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:13.520
our Linux unplugged entry there oh right from the source just have to have the Albee extension

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:18.680
which is top-notch software and we have a link to the Linux unplugged entry at podcast

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:21.680
index org but yeah you don't need it you don't need a mobile app you could actually do it

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:27.120
from your web browser on your fancy laptop or desktop from the podcast index page and

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:32.600
Blake sent in 10,001 sets doing that and then I guess I just picked all the ones I felt

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:38.560
like talking about today Molybdenum boosted in with just 500 sats but I like the message

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:43.600
she says I don't like crypto at all but I love the idea of the lightning network and

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:48.560
the use for stuff like this or maybe a game server you're playing on could see how be

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:53.660
able to boost into a game server would be extremely useful I agree I don't like crypto

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:58.600
either don't like it don't like web 3 so far and hasn't impressed me much maybe one day

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:04.840
it will so far it has not and we get into all of that in office hours episode 9 we hate

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:11.400
crypto too and I try to explain the difference between Bitcoin and crypto the green eagle

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:16.920
boosted in with 2,000 sats I'm still using sync thing to backup photos off mine and my

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:22.160
wife's phone as a bonus it allows me to sync other files like notes unfortunately though

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:28.480
I'm still using Google for sharing organizing searching etc so sync thing is really only

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.720
a secondary backup I always intended to self-host a solution but I'm afraid the effort won't

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:39.840
be worth it because the bar for spouse approval is too high I run into that issue every time

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:44.400
I start down the path of switching something off a Google service yeah that's an important

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:52.280
consideration and I I strongly believe that the setup I described today with photosync

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:58.400
and photoprism and duplicati is a totally spouse approved stack because the UI on photosync

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:02.760
is great the UI on photoprism is great you can have different user accounts on photoprism

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.840
so they can have their own login with their own albums and stuff if you want to do that

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:11.440
really top-notch stuff and then duplicati you know she's never really gonna have to

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:15.240
see that but if I were sick and she needed to check the status of the backup she could

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:20.080
just check the bookmark I have and it's all in a web UI it gives you error messages that

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:25.280
are clear and easy to read for the most part so I think that stack is probably as close

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:30.120
as you can get to a commercial product in terms of polish of UI and it seems like things

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.200
are only getting better right I mean you mentioned image and just more solutions coming along

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:38.640
to try to fit that role more polish over time and more on the whole the whole pipeline in

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:44.760
one place just fewer moving pieces and I'd say this Westpain photoprism has gotten noticeably

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:49.080
better since we talked about it last time on the show so solid yeah continuous improvements

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:54.680
over there too the whole stack also a green eagle if your wife is unhappy I mean you can

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.880
just blame Chris so center yeah that's totally cool man people do it all the time he guaranteed

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:05.680
that's possible approval Belf Winnie Belf in we Chris we do this one I think you'll get

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:13.640
this one Belf in we I like it all right Belf in we well done boosted it with 512 sets they

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:18.080
say love the show and so glad you talked about Linux Mint every now and then as it was my

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:23.560
first distribution and still my favorite also trying boosts for the first time after listening

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:29.840
to this episode and noticed a few days ago my boosts stop accumulating in my wallet oh

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:34.680
probably talking about fountain earn there I'd imagine right yeah probably talking about

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:40.320
fountain earn perhaps yeah perhaps I love when we get the first boosters into the show

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:45.120
so 512 stats good enough for me I love hearing that that's so great and also yeah we try

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.180
to be aware of the fact that there are a decent amount of Mint users out there and even though

01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:53.440
it's not our daily driver as they say we still want to try to be represented from time to

01:15:53.440 --> 01:16:00.080
time as best we can as non-Mint users ourselves you know I started on Mint as well and oh

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:05.280
well actually that's not entirely true I started on XFC but we don't talk about that too often

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:09.960
banned from the show yeah I was on there for a year but then moved to Linux Mint for many

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:14.080
many years and really loved it and still have a few friends that I support who are using

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:19.560
it and still loving it so it's just like the distro that just keeps on ticking I know you've

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:28.440
told me but you were a Cinnamon user at that time too right yeah yeah I think I originally

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:33.200
moved to Cinnamon because it was okay I did a bunch of research because I loved GNOME

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:40.440
2 at the time and I knew yeah I knew at the time moving to GNOME 3 was a hot topic we

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:46.000
all had feels about a brand yeah yeah so I thought Cinnamon being a fork might be a nice

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.760
thing and it was not the most stable thing back then but it seemed to be getting a ton

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:55.900
of development I mean they even had a button to like restart Cinnamon that was just a built-in

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:59.840
feature which was if you remember is that still there Wes I think you might have yeah

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:05.600
I think I think so I say keep it but it actually for the most part was really great and was

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:11.880
just customizable enough and so yeah it was a great experience I had nothing wrong with

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:18.280
that and I'm proud to say that I used Mint for a while T-Kario boosts in with ten thousand

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:25.920
sets boost with all the decentralized and open source software that y'all use at JB I've

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:31.440
been wondering what the heck are you using meetups for there appear to be options like

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:37.420
mobile zone get together and I believe meetups is paid so perhaps some of that funding you're

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:42.960
using on meetups could go towards another open source project instead though I acknowledge

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:48.600
you may lose some of the organic discovery provided by meetup and their network effect

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:52.920
be great to hear what y'all think about it though that's a great question I feel like

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:59.980
we kind of over time move to decentralized or free software tools as that tooling kind

01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:04.520
of meets our needs and in some areas like the hackintoshes were a great example and

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:10.320
Wirecast for a long time we had to just live with a proprietary solution that was just

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:14.360
painful and then because I mean from the business perspective you kind of start with the like

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:17.880
we need to do X because we've determined we need to do X to accomplish the goals we're

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:22.720
doing and then ideally we can do that with open source decentralized software but you

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:26.400
got to get a start from that angle there's definitely that aspect of it and then I mean

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:31.600
not to not to be this guy but there is some truth to this is like sometimes we're just

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:36.680
early and we start using something and there isn't a free software solution available like

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:43.320
that we've been using meetup for ever before it was ridiculously expensive to use right

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:48.360
but meetup is like number one with a bullet on our services list that we use that we want

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:54.480
to replace we've experiment experimented with get together and we haven't been super happy

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:59.640
with it we would love to use something that our community could also use to self organize

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:03.960
their own meetups because we've heard from dozens of people that want to organize meetups

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:08.060
in their area with other JB audience members but we just don't have a platform for them

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:13.040
to use so it seems like whatever we switch to should probably be the same tooling and

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:18.820
then that just like is a huge lift and that's where we're at right now but it is number

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:24.200
one with a bullet and in the meantime it gets sort of a pass because of that network effect

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:29.320
that you mentioned it is valuable to let people know hey we got a new meetup in this area

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.800
that's but we would hope they would come over to whatever new platform we have and we're

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.400
not using it I mean it's it's quite public in one sense but in the other hand it's you

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.840
know we add some entries there and there's a little bit of back and forth we put some

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:43.960
details maybe some comments but it's not otherwise it's sort of tertiary to a lot of the rest

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:53.720
of the systems yeah wise Papa John boosts in with 2674 satoshis b-o-o-s-t I'm a serial

01:19:53.720 --> 01:20:00.060
audiobook listener and I only listen to podcasts between books so I'm usually two or three

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:05.720
episodes behind and I actually enjoy having a handful of episodes to binge all at once

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:11.320
I get that I get that I continue to request people send in your listening habits I've

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:15.880
been doing this for 15 years and I still find it absolutely fascinating oh yeah I want to

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:18.920
know how you find the show I want to know how you listen to the show I want to know

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:22.380
how far behind you are these are all things that we try to factor in when we're planning

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:26.880
content so actually having that information super valuable to use the chapters do you

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:31.120
want do you need us to do stuff that makes it easier the chapters did you know we have

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:36.480
chapters chapters did you know everything is chaptered these features let us know because

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.840
you know as podcasters we don't get a lot of data that's the way this decentralized

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:45.300
system works we don't really know we just put an mp3 for it and I think everybody likes

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:48.720
it that way so let's just keep it that way so just tell us because you know some of these

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:52.640
podcast out there with their dynamic ads they want all this data you guys know what I'm

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:57.920
talking about hey I want to say thank you to a group out there too first of all we don't

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:01.600
read all of the boosts on the air we do have another episode coming up but not everything

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:06.960
makes it on the air we are curating the boosts these days but we read all of them and it

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:11.720
still makes me smile every time it comes in Brent knows it now that he's here yeah yeah

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:17.780
you hear the little pew that pew that we play the helipad interface plays that in real time

01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:21.720
and also does an explosion of confetti and it's a real celebration every time a boost

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:27.960
comes in in this studio it's great it makes us smile so shout out to bond who just caught

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:31.880
up on the show and got current after falling behind great to have you back on board we

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:36.640
got 1500 sats from Prozac who just wanted to toss a little bit to Brent's gas fund thank

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:40.280
you we super appreciate that what an amazing thing that's been we're gonna talk more about

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:44.960
that on the road we have plans to talk about that it's just stuff we're not getting to

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:49.880
today we also got a row of ducks from Elrey Elrey I thought we decided we were just calling

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:56.080
them 741 the old seven yeah lucky number he's thanking us though for trying to get

01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:01.520
the name right still trying and it's I think I think I have like name aphasia or something

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:08.400
like word aphasia okay cuz like um I just it doesn't stick and I've read that is actually

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:13.200
a problem for ADD people so there you go if you if you wanted a symptom here it is I'd

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:20.440
also like to do an extra shout out to Elrey and chance as well and also CG bass player

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:25.060
while I've been traveling this week and just totally wrapped up in all of the studio projects

01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:31.280
we've been doing some may have noticed that I've done a little less appearing on our website

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:37.480
project on GitHub and but the three of them have really taken things up and have been

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:41.720
committing you know there were some merges that I wasn't even aware of Chris and I visited

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:47.640
the website I was like oh look isn't that amazing it's incredible can we just stop for

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:51.320
a second to acknowledge how incredible that is how incredible that is our community is

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:55.280
improving our website while we are heads down preparing for this road trip and planning

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:59.920
multiple shows and Brent and I have been working very diligently on a project that we cannot

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:04.680
tell you about yet that has also been consuming a ton of our time and he's been traveling

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:08.960
and we're gonna be away traveling and so to have our community keep that going and add

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:13.160
new features that we've talked about amazing it's just it's kind of perfect too right because

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:18.040
like I mean I don't really use the website right I mean it's not for me we're behind

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:22.920
the scenes yeah yeah but it's the audience's website that's why we have it it's for them

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:26.240
to make the show accessible and be and so they have way better ideas on how to make

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.500
it awesome than I've ever had this is that this is the true incredible aspect of value

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:34.960
for value right I mean the kind of value they're returning right now it's just amazing so yeah

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:39.680
we absolutely should be thanking them and don't worry I'll be back in time but I think

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:43.400
they should be generous we're like we're gonna be a little slow on matrix and telegram we're

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:48.120
gonna be kind of slow on the github because we're gonna be we're either driving sleeping

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:53.000
or recording for like three weeks straight if we see you and appreciate yeah we will

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000
still be looking as much as we can and all the messages and checking the helipads and

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:07.000
all of that too we got a hello out there to mr I'm gonna say bench nice he just found

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.280
luck for the first time using oh that's awesome the fountain charts so thanks to the boosting

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:16.240
we're getting away we're yeah I'm getting these things I'm getting this message a lot

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:20.280
I'm getting a lot because what happens is people send in their baller boost using the

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:25.400
fountain app we show up on the charts and then people say well this must be a good show

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:31.800
because people are actually totally wrong but they get but anyways bench thanks for

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:35.400
joining us thank you everybody who boosts in we do appreciate it if you'd like to join

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:40.160
the fun you can go to newpodcastapps.com and get a new podcast app or you can actually

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:45.760
just boost from the podcastindex.org website if you got the Albie extension or you can

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:50.620
really be a geek and get boost CLI set up I feel like that's whole there's a whole other

01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:54.120
world of self-hosting you have to wrap your head around so if you manage to get boost

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:58.440
CLI up and running I think that's legitimately one of the more impressive technical tasks

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:02.920
you could pull off right now so boost into the show if you get boost CLI working and

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:06.740
that brings us to the end of this week's episode of the unplug program links to all of the

01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:14.640
