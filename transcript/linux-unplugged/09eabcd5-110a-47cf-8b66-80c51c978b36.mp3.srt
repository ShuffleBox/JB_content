1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,660
It's been a little bit since we've given Vim love, but now we have two excuses.

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,960
First one being, you can now play Mario on Vim.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,140
It's a Vim plugin.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,440
How about that, right?

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,440
It's so great.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,680
It's, it's so great.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,840
It's a little rough, but it is definitely, no doubt about it, Mario and there's Goombas

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,480
in there and you're jumping on them and I mean, why not?

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,000
The real game is an excuse to talk about Vim today, which this week turned 29 years young.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
How about that?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,560
Almost 30 years of Vim.

12
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,560
Happy birthday.

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,560
And you know what?

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,840
They're still going strong.

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,360
The birthday announcement has a lot of good news about where Vim is going, what's happening,

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,460
including a whole bunch of improvements to testing, reliability, and just nice features.

17
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,860
Happy birthday, Vim.

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,880
We talk a lot about Nano, the world's best editor.

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,240
You know, I shoot down every time I try to add a story to the doc.

20
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,240
Slipped one in today though.

21
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,240
I mean, it is the birthday.

22
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:03,840
Hello friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,840
My name is Chris.

24
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
My name is Wes.

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
Hello, Wes.

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,160
Episode 378 of your Linux talk show is brought to you by a cloud guru, the leader in hands

27
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,800
on learning in the cloud for Linux and modern tech skills, hundreds of courses, thousands

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
of hands on labs.

29
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,840
Get certified, get started, get hired.

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,120
Go to a cloud guru.com.

31
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,560
Wes we have a lot to get into today.

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,020
It appears that there may be a whole new way to build and distribute applications on Linux

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,880
and it's not electron, Wes.

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
What?

35
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
That's right.

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,940
They're native applications.

37
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:42,820
And for so many years we have heard the promise of write once, run everywhere.

38
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,560
But it may be that the stars have aligned and just that has actually happened.

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,400
I'm talking native applications for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android from one tool.

40
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
That's everywhere.

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,360
I'll tell you about it more in a little bit, but of course we've also got a bunch of community

42
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
news to get into.

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,480
And I mean, we have some big batch.

44
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,660
This is way too much.

45
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,660
We should have trimmed this a little bit.

46
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,080
It's an irresponsible show, but nevertheless, we persist.

47
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,520
Little batch maintenance is all I'm saying, Wes.

48
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
It's all I'm saying.

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,000
Time appropriate greetings, mobile room.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hello.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Time appropriate greetings.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hello.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hello.

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hello.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's still the election.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, it is election day.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hello, virtual lug.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,720
Good to have you because we do have some big news to get into today, an untrimmed batch

59
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,240
as it were.

60
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,360
And we start with news about the Raspberry Pi and a new version of it, a new faster version

61
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,760
of it that is built into a keyboard.

62
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,880
It's called the Raspberry Pi 400.

63
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:43,020
It is a $70 Linux box that harkens back to the days of my childhood where I had a computer

64
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,080
that was built into the keyboard.

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,520
It was much bigger than this that you could hook directly up to the television.

66
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,920
Inside the Raspberry Pi keyboard, which is a product that has been shipping for a while,

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,800
so if you've seen that, you know what this thing looks like.

68
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,520
Inside that now, and in a slightly larger version, they have built a full-fledged Pi

69
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,000
computer in that plastic keyboard.

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,080
Oh, yeah.

71
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,440
At the heart of the Raspberry Pi 400 is a 1.8 gigahertz ARM Cortex A72.

72
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,080
This quad-core chip is similar to last year's Raspberry Pi 4 that you know and love so well,

73
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,080
Chris, but it is clocked to run slightly faster.

74
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:26,560
It has a slightly revved version of the Raspberry Pi 4 CPU chip, and that's interesting to note.

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,320
Although it's only four gigabytes of RAM, they didn't go to the full eight gigabytes.

76
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,640
Yeah, I would have liked to have seen that.

77
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,480
There's also two micro HDMI ports, so you could actually connect this to two monitors

78
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,840
at once, each up to 4K at a time.

79
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,880
That's nuts.

80
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,960
And it's not like they just put a Pi in this thing.

81
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,640
Yeah, I mean, anyone could do that.

82
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,440
We'll link you to a blog that did a teardown, but the Pi 400 is using a custom mainboard

83
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,520
that is a form factor we've never seen for the Raspberry Pi before that sort of fills

84
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,260
out the back end of this keyboard.

85
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,400
There's also a bit of thermal work that's been done in there.

86
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,080
It looks almost like just a regular Raspberry Pi keyboard until you look at the back of

87
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,840
it and you will see there's still GPIO pins there, which I think is really interesting.

88
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,800
You see the USB, you see Ethernet, you see the micro SD card slot.

89
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,620
It looks like it's going to be pretty easy to get access to that thing, too.

90
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,840
If you want to build something, you just probably will need an adapter that can connect right

91
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,680
into that space for the GPIO pins.

92
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,760
Yeah, you know, I like that because the Pi has always been this sort of, you know, craft

93
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,440
enabling project just because it's crammed into a keyboard here doesn't mean you no longer

94
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
have that.

95
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,600
I think this is a good quote by their founder, Eben Upton, Raspberry Pi has always been a

96
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,720
PC company inspired by the home computers of the 1980s.

97
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,840
Our mission is to put affordable, high performance, programmable computers into the hands of people

98
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
all over the world.

99
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:55,440
A couple of interesting things of note here, I think the name Pi 400 tells us that there

100
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,840
will likely be a Pi 500 and a Pi 600 when there's a Pi 5 and a Pi 6.

101
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
That's a natural evolution.

102
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
Right.

103
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,120
It's not really delayed from the main board.

104
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,940
Like we see, we almost see a bit of a potential release cadence coming up here.

105
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,080
First you release the main Raspberry Pi, so the Raspberry Pi 5, then six to nine months

106
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,300
after that, you release the compute board and maybe you don't do this for every Pi model,

107
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,300
but you know, I don't know.

108
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
Pick standout ones.

109
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Right.

110
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,720
And then a few months after that, the all in one.

111
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,480
The other thing that this strikes me here is this is just the keyboard.

112
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,440
It ships, you can get it with a kit for a hundred dollars that comes with a mouse and

113
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,520
a guy and a pre flashed Raspberry Pi OS.

114
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,240
So basically everything that you need right there.

115
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,000
And I did actually pre-order the kit.

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What?

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,600
It might be, I think make for a really great Christmas gift.

118
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,880
I haven't picked who yet, but maybe it's me.

119
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,560
Worst case, you just always got like an extra little computer ready to go laying around.

120
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Yeah.

121
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,120
Like, you know what's funny about this is often one of the things that, and you know

122
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,600
this is true, one of the things we're looking around the studio for is a keyboard.

123
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
No kidding.

124
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,120
I think we've had to resort to hooking up like an unused Mac keyboard on the server

125
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,920
in this, in the, in the disgraceful.

126
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
It is.

127
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
Yeah.

128
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,080
So there is that advantage to it, but not everybody is like me where they have more

129
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,800
monitors than keyboards.

130
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,040
And so it makes me wonder if we won't see a future all in one kind of like an iMac,

131
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,200
but instead it's a Raspberry Pi.

132
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll be just powering the whole thing and well, and when you get the kit, maybe it comes

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,940
with the Raspberry Pi keyboard that looks like this, but without the computer in it.

134
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,480
I would like to see something like that because that would actually make a more compelling

135
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
gift for my kids.

136
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Yeah.

137
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
And it's simple.

138
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
You don't have to think about it.

139
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,960
There's no other matching or figuring out, you don't know what kind of monitor you need

140
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
or how to hook it up.

141
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Right.

142
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Not a problem.

143
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,760
Maybe that'll be the Pi 800 with eight gigs of RAM.

144
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
Right.

145
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
You're going to pre-order that next.

146
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
Yeah.

147
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:48,560
I just want something nice, like a 1080p decent size screen, you know, putting like a 20 inch

148
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
monitor, 21 inch monitor.

149
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
That'd be just right.

150
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,960
I wonder if they're not going this direction.

151
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,440
We recently talked on Linux Action News about, and we talked about on this show too, about

152
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,320
Ubuntu 2010 focusing their desktop support, the full fledged GNOME Shell desktop version

153
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,880
of Ubuntu on the Raspberry Pi 4.

154
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

155
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,800
Well, guess what now just works out of the box?

156
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Right here.

157
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
It's a natural choice.

158
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Yeah.

159
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,200
I think Canonical has an idea of where the Raspberry Pi Foundation is taking this.

160
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,400
And I think that was part of why with 2004, they got base server support working.

161
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,520
And I can testify that it works well.

162
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,360
I have it running on like four Raspberry Pis.

163
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,320
And then with 2010, they got the desktop side.

164
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,520
And we looked at them and we said, well, this doesn't make a lot of sense.

165
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,840
It seems a little slow.

166
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,040
It seems like a lot when you could just run MATE or XFCE.

167
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Right.

168
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,080
But when you start to see this strategy emerge, and this thing's a little bit faster.

169
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,000
It's going to get faster because it's probably going to keep going.

170
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,020
When the next Ubuntu LTS comes around, something tells me there'll be a Raspberry Pi device

171
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,600
that runs it just fine.

172
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,160
And Canonical will have been there for years in these interim releases, getting that support

173
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
nailed down.

174
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,720
It'll be a standard platform by then.

175
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Yeah.

176
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,480
And it's a safe bet that there's going to be more devices like this.

177
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,560
They're not slowing down.

178
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,360
And I think it's going to sell well.

179
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,480
It was one of those news announcements where I got a lot of people that said, hey, did

180
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
you see this?

181
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,520
And of course, because of the time zone differences, it came out during our nighttime, although

182
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,880
I wasn't able to sleep that night.

183
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,760
So I actually jumped on the pre-order right away.

184
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
I was up and-

185
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
You are a news hound.

186
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
I was.

187
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
I got on it.

188
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,460
And then when I went to bed and I got like a solid hour, 45 minutes of sleep, I woke

189
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,300
up to just tons of messages from people on the east side that had woken up and seen the

190
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,640
news and wanted to make sure-

191
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Chris, have you heard?

192
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Which I appreciate.

193
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
I think that's great.

194
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,920
If that breaks, it gives me an idea of the interest in the audience when I hear from

195
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,640
a bunch of people tell me about it.

196
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,360
And I also am excited about it.

197
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,000
So I jumped on it.

198
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,320
And I'll give you a full review.

199
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,960
I paid for it with my own hard earned money because I don't want to, you know, I don't

200
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
need a review.

201
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
You don't want to own it.

202
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
And I want to give you a full review.

203
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,980
And so whoever gets it's going to get it with the box already being opened once.

204
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,800
But that's the price they have to pay, Wes.

205
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,500
We have some links to the Teardown, which is really interesting.

206
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,240
It's a much wider board.

207
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,320
It runs about 65, 70 percent the length of the keyboard, where a traditional Pi would

208
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,400
just take up a small portion of that.

209
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,180
Sort of squashed and stretched it out.

210
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,760
The technical difference between the Raspberry Pi 4 that you probably already own or have

211
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,280
already heard about and the version that's shipping today in the Pi 400 is just essentially

212
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:36,040
a rev on the chip and it's obvious in this Teardown that the model is just changed by

213
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:44,560
a couple of numbers and it is capable of essentially hitting better performance at better thermals.

214
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,440
And it appears to have a few software level bug fixes that the already shipped version

215
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,360
that's also on the Raspberry Pi Compute have, but are obviously not super issues.

216
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,720
But you know, you get some things in production, you make some tidies, you make a revision

217
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,800
on the chip, you get better thermals, you have less bugs and slightly better performance.

218
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,680
And that all kind of came together here.

219
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,120
There's more information in the show notes, but nice to see it.

220
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
I would love eight gigs.

221
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,200
Yeah, that would be that would be a big one because at that level, I feel like I'd be

222
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,080
I feel pretty comfortable, especially just as another computer.

223
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,360
Maybe it's attached to a TV somewhere in my home or just laying around if I need a backup

224
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,480
or I have a guest.

225
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,360
It also clearly, clearly signals that they are interested in people using the Pi as a

226
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
desktop.

227
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,360
Well, we've kind of been debating over the years, like when is it going to get there

228
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,160
to really make sense, at least not in a I can only afford a Pi, but if you know, when

229
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
is it just usable?

230
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,320
Yeah, when is it no longer a compromise?

231
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,160
And it's just like, why would you pay for anything more?

232
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,100
And when you start to get it out like this, as a bundle for $100, there's a lot of family

233
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,600
members that just need email, they want access to a few websites, that would really work

234
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
for them.

235
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,520
I personally feel like the performance isn't there, I think, to the degree that they seem

236
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,160
to be signaling.

237
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,720
But if they're building these units, they're clearly interested in that they have the Raspberry

238
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,360
Pi OS where they can continue to build and evolve a lower resources desktop that performs

239
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
well.

240
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,040
So we'll see more, I think.

241
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
It's really interesting.

242
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,480
I myself would buy one of these and probably throw Manjaro or Ubuntu on there myself, with

243
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,760
probably a lead towards Manjaro just because the improvements are going to come in quicker

244
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
from upstream.

245
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
You love that Roland.

246
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
I do.

247
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,760
Speaking of Manjaro, Phil from Manjaro joins us to give us a couple of updates on things

248
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,720
including an upcoming Nibia release.

249
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,520
So what is the details here?

250
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
Welcome, Phil.

251
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
Hello, hello.

252
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
Great to be back.

253
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:41,920
So yes, also I got on the Raspberry Pi train and have also ordered two of the 400s.

254
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,240
And yes, we know about Ubuntu, that it's not as best.

255
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,960
So we try to get it faster.

256
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:54,760
We will try it with KDE as we did that with PiBook Pro already.

257
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,920
And maybe we go also even crazier and try Deepin, because that is the real new thing.

258
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,640
I don't know how it works, but maybe I will try that out.

259
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,600
I've had a fascination with Deepin.

260
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,000
It's come up a lot between Wes and I off air recently about talking more or trying it more,

261
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,620
but I just haven't gotten around to it.

262
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,440
But I do like the idea of Plasma too, because in my opinion, it scales surprisingly well

263
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,600
to a range of hardware.

264
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,000
You would think it only works on high end stuff, but surprisingly, they've put a lot

265
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,520
of work into making Kaywin work pretty efficiently on lower powered hardware.

266
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
Thank you.

267
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
I'll keep an eye out for that.

268
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,320
But that's not Nibia.

269
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
What is Nibia?

270
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:36,520
Well, Nibia is the new release we're planning, it's 20.2, which is the successor of Mika.

271
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:45,400
We will update the kernel to 5.9, have the latest Plasma on it, this would be the 5.20.3

272
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
when it's out.

273
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,160
And of course, we have done a lot of work in the GNOME section.

274
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:59,280
So we will have maybe Blymos working again and some setup like OEM, so the user can simply

275
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,760
choose to configure it on the PC when he gets it.

276
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,920
So if you have some old people or friend and you want to install a Manjaro on it, you can

277
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,840
simply partition everything, get everything ready and then give him the complete computer

278
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,720
and he can set up his user and own settings by his own.

279
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,720
So maybe this will boost up also the usage of the GNOME edition.

280
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,440
And maybe if that is good, then we might extend it to other editions like XFC and KDE as well.

281
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,480
That's great to hear.

282
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,160
Over the last few weeks, I've kind of been making a transition back to GNOME Shell.

283
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,640
And so that's really good to hear that.

284
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,480
Now you said something there I got to ask you about, because we've been trying to figure

285
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,800
out what is going on with kernel 5.9 and NVIDIA driver support, because I've seen there's

286
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,160
an NVIDIA driver update, but it's not clear if they've solved the 5.9 GPL condom issue

287
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
or not.

288
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
It sounds like you're shipping 5.9.

289
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,480
So you've probably been looking at this.

290
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,940
Well, we will ship it and we already tested the community gave us feedback.

291
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,640
So CUDA is working again.

292
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,600
You can use Blender again and also Darktable.

293
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,800
So it seems to fix it.

294
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,320
But I wonder myself as well, because they didn't announce it that it's fixed.

295
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,980
So I only see the last message like mid November, you will have a fixed version.

296
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,000
So it seems they made it already early November.

297
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,120
So good for them, but communication is a little bit broken, it seems.

298
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,700
Yeah, that's interesting that they wouldn't have made an announcement about it.

299
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,840
But it there was the update and CUDA does seem to be working with 5.9, which was the

300
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
key problem.

301
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,440
And it would appear they really turned that around.

302
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,620
I mean, I guess they had a heads up about this whole thing.

303
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:45,860
But I guess I go back to the old days of Linux when a younger Chris was running Linux and

304
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,960
I could see myself waiting around six, seven months before a vendor would get off their

305
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,420
duff and fix something.

306
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,520
And here it almost seems like Nvidia not only got it out relatively fast for a large company,

307
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,640
but they are almost, they're almost like not addressing it.

308
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,740
Like they don't even want to talk about the fact that it was an issue.

309
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,340
They don't want there to be any concern.

310
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,040
They don't want anybody to worry about it.

311
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,500
Yeah, the community taught them otherwise and they had to react.

312
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,780
So there was even two announcements, one in the graphics section and one is the customer

313
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,280
section that 5.9 was not working after the community spoke up.

314
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,620
So I don't know what it is.

315
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,940
Yeah, they made a big, they did make it clear it wouldn't work, but now they haven't made

316
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,220
it clear that it would work and maybe something's forthcoming still, but, or maybe they just

317
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,660
don't want to raise a lot of attention to it.

318
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,900
Well, I will keep my eye out for Nibia, especially for the GNOME Shell version.

319
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,900
That sounds pretty good.

320
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,700
I've seen people showing pictures of their Manjaro edition pine phones arriving.

321
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,700
Ooh.

322
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,820
I've seen a lot of that.

323
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,420
So it seems like people are getting them already.

324
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,940
I even got an update from someone.

325
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:55,860
He got a phone, everything branded with Manjaro and he popped it up and he saw a post-market

326
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,180
where, so I don't know what's going on there, but I linked him the factory image, so maybe

327
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,460
he can test it out and get the proper image on it, but things happen.

328
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,480
At least the branding version is out and everything is working.

329
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:16,180
And what I also know is it's now the 1.2.B version, which has also stabilized the screen.

330
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,260
So it's a small fix, but it's visible.

331
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,260
Very good.

332
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,260
Well, congratulations.

333
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,540
I think that's, I mean, it's a big deal to actually get those out there.

334
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,420
XMN in the chat room says that he got his.

335
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,420
I wonder if it had Manjaro on it or post-market, but it looks like they're getting out there.

336
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,820
So if you do get some, put them on, put them up somewhere on Reddit or social media or

337
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,820
something.

338
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,820
We'd love to see it.

339
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
We do.

340
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:43,420
I'll drop it in the Telegram group, jupitabroadcasting.com slash telegram and tag me so I can see it

341
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,500
in there because I love it when people get new hardware and I'd love to hear people's

342
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
impressions of it.

343
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,060
Well, Phil, thanks for joining us and congrats on the updates and join us again soon when

344
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,060
you got some news.

345
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,060
Okay.

346
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,060
Sure.

347
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,060
Sure.

348
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,060
Will do.

349
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,060
And it's great to have me as well.

350
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,060
I bet.

351
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,060
Yeah.

352
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,940
So we have some more kernel news.

353
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,620
This is looking ahead a little bit.

354
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:10,860
Here we're talking about 5.9, which most people don't even have yet and 5.10, which is supposed

355
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,980
to be a pretty great release.

356
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,660
We talked about that recently and we're going to go one even further out.

357
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,980
We're going to talk about 5.11 and the reason why I want to do this is I want to make the

358
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,420
point that there's just a lot of good stuff coming down the pipeline for Linux users.

359
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:29,060
Some fruit company is going to have an announcement next week and actually all kidding aside,

360
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,740
I'm sure Apple is going to have some pretty impressive machines to show.

361
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:38,820
But I want to remind you, the Mac OS is a bit stale as a platform.

362
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,940
Yes, you can put lipstick on Big Sur and make it more touch friendly, but the underlying

363
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,740
pinnings, they haven't really updated the Unix user land really much ever.

364
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,500
They just kind of drag it along to the latest versions that they can consume from the BSD

365
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
projects.

366
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,260
It certainly doesn't feel like it's a priority.

367
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,740
No, I mean, it really doesn't.

368
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,100
It feels like it's funny.

369
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,140
It feels second class now even compared to Windows command line capabilities, right?

370
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,340
Because with WSL and the new Windows Terminal, when you open up the Mac OS Terminal, it's

371
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:16,620
this little white box with bad fonts and a weird shell and it's just really basic and

372
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,420
there's been no effort.

373
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,460
You really on a Mac to make it work, you need to go get iTerm.

374
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,460
And everyone does.

375
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,300
You need to install Brew and I just want to remind everyone that there's still a lot of

376
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,900
really good stuff coming up for us Linux users.

377
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,380
Not only are our desktop environments getting more kick ass than ever, and I can, I feel

378
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,060
like I can say that having watched this for a long time, but the core stuff that's coming

379
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,540
in the kernel, it's never been better for us desktop users.

380
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,140
We are getting taken care of in a way that I honestly didn't expect.

381
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,780
After years of the cloud being the dominant force for Linux and then Android coming along,

382
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:56,140
I really was worried that at a kernel level, us desktop users would just be the lowest

383
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,460
priority.

384
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,980
But there are several projects that are landing in 5.9 that are then landing and also landing

385
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,700
in 5.10 that I'm really looking forward to.

386
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,380
And now we have something in kernel 5.11.

387
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,100
And I'm going to take a guess that the name is pronounced Collabora.

388
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,580
We've talked about them before.

389
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:25,380
And they've been doing work on the Linux kernel recently on behalf of Valve.

390
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,660
So stick with me here.

391
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,300
So we're talking about kernel 5.10, sort of coders for hire over at Collabora have been

392
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:38,580
hired by Valve to improve Linux gaming, particularly around the things like the Proton compatibility

393
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,580
layer.

394
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,180
So that's what they're sponsoring work again for, something around the compatibility layer.

395
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,980
And one of the big missing pieces right now with Proton games on Linux that has, it sort

396
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:54,620
of has curbed some of the enthusiasm, if you will, is anti-cheat and DRM technology that's

397
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,900
in some of these games.

398
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,100
It can just entirely break Windows games in wine and Proton.

399
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,600
And we talked about this once before, Wes, on the show.

400
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:08,700
And we said, unfortunately, it looks like one of the ways to fix this requires modifying

401
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
the kernel.

402
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
And I said, well, that's never going to happen.

403
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,540
Turns out, maybe it will.

404
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,100
This is some good info from a talk over at the Open Source Summit by Gabriel Crisman-Bertazzi

405
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,140
on the state of Linux gaming.

406
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:28,500
And one of the key points that he made was system call emulation and adding that functionality.

407
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,260
Because unfortunately, it's just often required because these DRM and anti-cheat systems are

408
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,520
actually issuing system calls directly from the Windows game code.

409
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,540
And that ends up bypassing wine, wine doesn't capture those system calls and then the games

410
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,540
often crash.

411
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,540
Yeah.

412
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,820
And there's really nothing we can do about that unless there's something answering those

413
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,820
system calls.

414
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,820
Yes.

415
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,540
And you know, they tried a user space solution at first, which would have been simpler and

416
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,540
wouldn't have required changing the kernel.

417
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:03,420
But unfortunately, that was still tripping up DRM and anti-cheat systems and also wasn't

418
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,700
great for performance.

419
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,080
So they've ended up creating the syscall user dispatch, which has been specifically made

420
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,140
in the kernel to deal with these emulated needs.

421
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,140
Isn't that interesting?

422
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:17,180
It is because it could have wider ramifications beyond gaming when it comes to emulating Windows

423
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,300
software here.

424
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,940
But I think it should be clear, it's not about trying to bring the Windows world to Linux.

425
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,620
They address this in the talk.

426
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,580
They're just trying to ease emulation.

427
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:32,380
So where that crossover does happen, it works on Linux as good and rock solid as a Linux

428
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,160
application could.

429
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,340
But what it seems has happened is they've kind of expanded to a wider set of what they

430
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:46,580
call pain points of Linux gaming, including device bring up, solving file system issues,

431
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,260
improving performance in other areas of the system.

432
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:54,640
They have a team looking at some of the scheduling stuff that maybe could be optimized in future

433
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,380
kernel releases as well.

434
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,380
So all of this stuff works better.

435
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,280
And you've got to think, if a game plays a little bit better because of some performance

436
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:09,060
improvements in the system and in the vial system, well, then a lot of other things are

437
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,500
going to work better, too.

438
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,620
Probably even your web browser is going to work better, right?

439
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:19,460
So this could have this could have a lot of nice improvements for Linux users that are

440
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,660
regular desktop users, not even playing video games.

441
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,660
Absolutely.

442
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,620
And, you know, it's just nice sign of this healthy continued collaboration, right?

443
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,260
Like it wasn't just that Proton happened and it was a big dump throw, you know, stuff thrown

444
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,080
over the wall, pushed out there and then kind of left.

445
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
It's been actively developed.

446
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,240
And now we're in that rich stage of more advanced secondary problems and smoothing that can

447
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,980
happen like these changes.

448
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,380
With this, what Valve has decided to invest their resources and money into instead of

449
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,460
Steam boxes, one hundred percent OK with that, right?

450
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,460
Way better decision.

451
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,260
And I wonder if that wasn't the calculation because the Steam boxes seem like they're

452
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,260
gone, right?

453
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,260
They do.

454
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,260
Yeah.

455
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,700
Linux gaming is more exciting than ever.

456
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,520
And some of this could land in 5.11.

457
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,100
So thank you to Collabora.

458
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,340
Thank you to Valve and the kernel developers who help integrate this stuff.

459
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,540
Man, am I stoked about that.

460
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,620
Now, another thing, just a quick one here that we talked about a little while ago is

461
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:20,440
after GNOME Shell 3.3.8, that's the end of the three series.

462
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,020
But I don't know if you recall this part.

463
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,560
You might.

464
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,140
The solution is instead of going to GNOME 4, which is what we've expected forever since

465
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,140
it was.

466
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,220
I mean, we're on three now.

467
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,100
We were on GNOME 2 and then we got GNOME 3 and then we thought we'd get GNOME 4.

468
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,500
And now what we're getting is GNOME 40.

469
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,020
And it looks like we actually have some dates now attached to GNOME 40.

470
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,020
Buckle up.

471
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,060
Yeah, it's slated for release on March 24th, 2021.

472
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:52,820
And you know, actually, they've simplified the development cycle along with the version

473
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,700
change there, because there will no longer be four development milestones released before

474
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,180
you get to beta, only three with an alpha, a beta and a release candidate.

475
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,180
Huh.

476
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,180
Is that what you say?

477
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,180
Yeah.

478
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,380
I actually think they're going to get some nice efficiency out of that.

479
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,140
And it solves like all these weird like considerations.

480
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,500
And we talked about the logic in a previous show.

481
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,620
But it means the final release of GNOME 40 is set for March 24th, which is just in time.

482
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,280
March 24th, 2021, of course, which is just in time for Ubuntu 21.04, which is due for

483
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:29,620
release on April 22nd and Fedora 34, which is due for release on April 27th.

484
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,620
Interesting.

485
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,580
Yeah, you know, I hope this goes well.

486
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,100
And I always it seems boring, but I always like to see some of these, you know, development

487
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,100
improvements.

488
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,180
Investing in the process itself, I think, is another sign of a healthy project that's

489
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,900
trying to enable better development.

490
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,660
Tyler, you point out that also lines up nicely with some other important releases.

491
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,660
Yes.

492
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:52,820
So with the new versioning, it means that GNOME 42 is going to line up with Ubuntu 22.04,

493
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,420
which means that the next Ubuntu LTS will have a desktop that is the answer to life,

494
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,420
the universe and everything.

495
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,940
GNOME Shell 42 better be a real winner, you know, right?

496
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,940
Fingers crossed.

497
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,940
Yeah.

498
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,940
I know.

499
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,020
So that's when you hear these large numbers coming at you in the near future.

500
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,300
That's what's going on.

501
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,300
We knew it was coming.

502
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,900
It's going to be all right.

503
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,420
Just prepare yourself.

504
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:21,540
Now, anybody want to take the over under on how many years they're trying to work themselves

505
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,660
out of this crazy numbering convention?

506
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,660
Maybe once they get to 100.

507
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,220
Yeah, that's a natural point right there.

508
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,220
Yeah.

509
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,420
Then they start at Roman numerals.

510
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
GNOME Shell X.

511
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,420
Yeah.

512
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:37,220
Oh, this is going to get confusing.

513
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,060
Linode.com slash unplugged.

514
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:43,020
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account and you go there to support

515
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,300
the show.

516
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,120
Linode is our cloud server provider and because the price is so great, it makes it possible

517
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,700
for a small team to have killer infrastructure.

518
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,860
We have just kick butt fast systems that would have just required crazy expensive systems

519
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,580
back in the rack and stack at day.

520
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,220
And so much planning and development, we don't have time for that.

521
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,220
Great point.

522
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,220
Great point.

523
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,940
One of the things that as a Linux user I love about Linode is they've got like all the distros

524
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,940
you'd want.

525
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,140
The Alpines, Arch, recent CentOS releases, Debian releases.

526
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,060
Of course, they have Fedora 33 on there and other Fedora releases, same with OpenSUSE

527
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,300
and Ubuntu.

528
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,300
You choose.

529
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,580
And they also have pre-built systems if that's your style.

530
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
Yeah, right.

531
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,100
Depending on like if you're doing a stack script or an image, is you can actually swap

532
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,340
out the distro for the pre-built thing you want.

533
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,340
Oh, that's neat.

534
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,420
If you want to use Debian instead of OpenSUSE, so you just choose that and then generate

535
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,420
it.

536
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,420
It's the one you're more comfortable with.

537
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,420
Yeah.

538
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,620
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing before AWS because they

539
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,020
saw what Linux could do.

540
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,820
As Linux users, and that kind of speaks to me too, is that I really saw what Linux could

541
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,760
do when I was in IT.

542
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,880
And I pivoted from the Windows line of things over to the Linux line of things.

543
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,500
And it's because I saw where this was going.

544
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,660
And Linode was like way ahead of the game, way before AWS.

545
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,380
And they're independently owned too.

546
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,920
So they didn't have to go get a bunch of VC funding, which just to go crazy, hire like

547
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,980
nuts, build out all this infrastructure, get all this debt and then sell yourself.

548
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,940
Instead, they built it up themselves and they own it.

549
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,780
And they're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing out there.

550
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,140
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

551
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,740
So I want to encourage you to take advantage of our $100 60-day credit.

552
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,460
You go to linode.com slash unplugged, you support the show, you get a $100 60-day credit

553
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,460
towards a new account.

554
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,420
Well, isn't that kind of nice?

555
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,900
Go to linode.com slash unplugged.

556
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,140
Thank you to Linode for sponsoring the unplugged program.

557
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,460
And thank you to everybody who goes to our sponsor page, lets them know you heard about

558
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:41,020
it here and tries out their offers, linode.com slash unplugged.

559
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:46,700
So I teased it at the beginning of the show, but there is a platform that is super interesting

560
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,020
that I always thought would be really great if it came to Linux.

561
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:55,100
And then I got an email about the Windows calculator getting ported over to Linux, like

562
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
the open source.

563
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,860
And I thought, well, how does this work?

564
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,500
And what did it take to get this Uno platform on Linux?

565
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,700
Because one of its tricks is it's not like an electron based setup.

566
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:13,820
What it is, is native applications on each destination hosts OS.

567
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,660
And I figured to get that to work on Linux, that must have been quite the journey.

568
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,140
So I had their CTO from the Uno platform come on the show.

569
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,780
So I'm Jerome, I'm the CTO at Uno platform.

570
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,740
And Jerome and I went through a couple of things like what it took to get Uno over here.

571
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,820
We talked about his Linux setup a little bit, the feedback he got from the Linux community,

572
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:40,860
the technology stack that they used, the reaction to choosing snap packages and how they handled

573
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,740
that feedback as a company that was new to the Linux community, that's all in there.

574
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,720
So I started with Jerome by congratulating him on the Uno platform and the big release

575
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,100
that I think was more than a year in the making for Linux.

576
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,620
Yeah, thank you.

577
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,580
It was an amazing one, a great response from the community.

578
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,580
Good, good.

579
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:04,980
Well, so I'm pretty new to the Uno platform and I was doing a little digging around and

580
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,260
I saw the first commit was by you on May 7th, 2018.

581
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:16,600
And now here we are in October of 2020 and the Windows calculator has been essentially

582
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,020
ported to Linux using the Uno platform and that caught my attention.

583
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,380
So can you explain to me what the Uno platform is?

584
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,380
Sure.

585
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,460
So the Uno platform is developer tooling and framework that allows for developers that

586
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,160
know about C-Sharp and XAML.

587
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:38,640
So the main Windows development toolkit that's for Windows developers to basically take their

588
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:48,600
code and port it over to iOS, Android, WebAssembly, Mac OS, Windows 7 in some cases, and Linux.

589
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,300
So that's a lot of platforms to target, but that's the basic idea.

590
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:58,060
And we want to make sure that people can reuse their skills that they have mostly on Windows,

591
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:04,140
but now with the interest of Linux being able to target one platform and then have it run

592
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,420
over to the others without changing much.

593
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:13,140
Well, it seems like there's been a dozen or more promises over the years of a single code

594
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,140
base.

595
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,140
Yes.

596
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:19,500
But like a lot of times the downside seems to be generally it may be one or two things,

597
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,700
potentially performance, but often you sacrifice what I would say like a native UI experience.

598
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,340
So as Linux users we'll often kind of get left out in that scenario.

599
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,460
Does the Uno platform address that differently?

600
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,620
Uno platforms were originally built for iOS and Android.

601
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:40,180
And there's always two sets of people, there's the ones that want to have the same UI everywhere

602
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:46,240
and there are other people that do want to have close to the platform and have some tweaks

603
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,040
around to be able to run on those devices.

604
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:53,900
So let's say that if you are on iOS, you want to have the iOS UI and Android UI to have

605
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,860
the Android UI specific for that one.

606
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,820
The problem is that in some of the frameworks that are doing this, React Native is kind

607
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,100
of close to that, for instance, is that you only can do that.

608
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,780
And then if you want to do some custom drawing, then it gets difficult.

609
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:15,740
So what we did with the Uno platform and we took what Microsoft has been doing for a while

610
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:22,680
with the XAML tooling and extended it to be able to do what is called look less control.

611
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,500
So let's say if you want to create a button, then in your markup or whatever that you're

612
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,040
using, then you create your button and then underneath you can style it to use whatever

613
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,540
the platform provides or your own style if you want to.

614
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:40,000
So if you're running on iOS, you're going to have your native button or toggle switch

615
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,240
or checkbox or whatnot.

616
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,260
Or you can change that style of that button that you've put in your code and then it can

617
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:52,660
render to whatever your fancy designers are going to be wanting to have, like a new video

618
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,840
button or whatever.

619
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,300
So that's the kind of things, the two ways to render.

620
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,300
I see.

621
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,740
So and that happens at build time of the project?

622
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,660
It renders out each native UI?

623
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,180
No, it really is at runtime.

624
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,180
You can actually switch.

625
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,540
We have a demo somewhere that shows that you can basically have a button and then you can

626
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:17,420
change the style of the button or the checkbox or whatnot at runtime so you can data bind

627
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,580
it to change it, change it visually so that it looks the way you want to.

628
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,220
So it's not really useful to change that style at runtime, but you can have a default style

629
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,500
if you want to for one specific page and then for another page you can have something else.

630
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,560
So that's the kind of things that happens.

631
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:38,220
And on the Linux side, does that target, say, like a single toolkit like GTK or Qt?

632
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,060
Yeah, so that's where I'm talking about.

633
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,740
There's a second way to look at that.

634
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:49,100
So the first way is we're using what the native primitives of the platforms are able to provide

635
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,100
us.

636
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,660
So let's say the ability to draw a combo box or a rectangle, something like that, but using

637
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,660
the platform primitives.

638
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:02,340
So we're instructing iOS or Android to draw a rectangle the way a native Android and iOS

639
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,140
application would do.

640
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,780
And then when we're going to the other platforms, people are asking us, I want to be able to

641
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,320
draw by the pixel.

642
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,180
So some of those users, not all of them.

643
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,420
So I want to draw by the pixel.

644
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:22,800
So what we said is, okay, so let's build a by the pixel render or backend rendering system

645
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,380
that allows us to take the same thing that we're doing on the other platforms that are

646
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,020
not specific to the platform.

647
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,840
So let's say if you want to render a button that has specific corners, a text inside,

648
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,360
that is the same everywhere, but we're going to be using Skia.

649
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:43,360
So the rendering engine that Chrome uses to render itself, we're using this to render

650
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,260
the applications on Linux for now.

651
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,260
Oh, fascinating.

652
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,220
But that doesn't mean that we're going to stay there.

653
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,320
It's one of the rendering methods that we're using.

654
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,420
So for instance, and that means for that matter, that's your application for now, let's say

655
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,380
the calculator, the Windows calculator, we put it over.

656
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:05,740
That one is really not using any of the GTK primitives to render a button or text or something

657
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,740
like that.

658
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,600
It's really drawing a canvas and pixel one by one.

659
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,720
So that's what's happening right now.

660
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,940
But we have the ability to change that and use another thing.

661
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,380
So let's say if we were to be having someone that says, well, I really want to have a GTK

662
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,980
rendering backend or a cube rendering backend or any kind of rendering backend that would

663
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,680
make sense, then it's possible to do that and actually use those controls there.

664
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,140
So it's an effort to do that and we're not there yet.

665
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:37,280
But the point was to be able to say, well, we're able to run that kind of UI natively

666
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,500
if you will, because we're rendering every pixel, but it's not an Electron app, for instance.

667
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,540
It really is an application running as a GTK shell.

668
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,140
We're actually using a GTK shell.

669
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,220
The window itself is built upon GTK.

670
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,480
Ah, very good.

671
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,820
And I think maybe that's one of the key differentiators here, isn't it?

672
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,500
You can take advantage of, it sounds like Skia, which is part of Chrome, but that doesn't

673
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,100
mean we're using Electron here.

674
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
No, no, no, no.

675
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
Not at all.

676
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,100
Not at all.

677
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Yeah.

678
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,100
That's really fascinating.

679
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,100
So I wanted to zoom out a little bit.

680
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,860
This is relatively new for the Uno platform.

681
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,980
This is kind of, it's, and also porting the Windows calculator, which is pretty, like

682
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,460
that's the current Windows 10 calculator.

683
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,460
That's pretty great.

684
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,460
It is.

685
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,460
And that's a great tech demo.

686
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,340
So what were the challenges coming over to Linux?

687
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,340
And before you answer that, I'm also curious, why now?

688
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,940
Why, why put the effort into supporting Linux now in October of, well, I'm sure you started

689
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,940
sooner, but why now?

690
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,980
We actually did start sooner.

691
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:37,340
It's actually a year old of effort because we had a few technical challenges to make

692
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,620
sure that it's not the Linux support itself.

693
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:45,160
It was all about making sure that the.NET platform was running properly and on Linux.

694
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,040
And many of those things have been evolving the last year, but most of the tech challenges

695
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,180
for us was on Uno itself, to restructure it properly so that it actually supports all

696
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,260
the platforms at once.

697
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:03,580
And what happens then is that for us, adding the Skia backend support was akin to modifying

698
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,900
the WebAssembly support.

699
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:11,260
So the WebAssembly support for Uno shares, I think it was something like close to 90%

700
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,840
of the code is the same as the one that is used for the Skia rendering backend.

701
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,540
So it's very, very close.

702
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,540
Fascinating.

703
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,540
Okay.

704
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:24,860
I think really kind of my last question is, what scope of applications do you see the

705
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,180
Uno platform being the right solution for?

706
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,540
What scale of applications?

707
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,500
The first commit that you see publicly on the Uno platform, the GitHub, the open source

708
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:41,460
repo is dating from 2018, but it actually started in 2013.

709
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,360
So it's been a while that we've been developing this.

710
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,500
And most of the applications that we have been doing on iOS and Android are actually

711
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,860
consumer grade applications and they're actually quite big.

712
00:36:51,860 --> 00:37:00,940
So we're talking movie theater, movie theater, drugstores, there's a natural geographic application

713
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:06,460
that is used for people that are non-native speakers, English speakers to learn English.

714
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,180
So that kind of new large application that are interesting.

715
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:16,460
But now that we've expanded that with the web and with Mac OS and Linux, we're seeing

716
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:24,220
people that are getting interested into making a lot larger application like line of business

717
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,220
applications.

718
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:29,980
The ones that have ugly interfaces sometimes or have nice interfaces, but lots of screens

719
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,260
to show.

720
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:37,340
So that's the kind of thing that we're looking at and we're making lots of progress for that.

721
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:42,020
And for the Linux part specifically, that's where it gets interesting.

722
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:47,720
A lot of people have been asking us, well, I want to be able to run on Linux specifically

723
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:55,860
because I want to do IoT or I want to do very specific things with my Linux only server

724
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:00,860
that runs something for my research project or whatever, and I cannot run something else.

725
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:06,300
So that's the kind of thing that we're seeing.

726
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,980
But they know about C-sharp and they want to make that application run over or they

727
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,940
want to target both the web and the Linux because they want to have something that deploys

728
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,080
very easily and don't want to bother with any kind of stores.

729
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,700
So that's the kind of story that we're seeing there.

730
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:25,940
And adding Linux support for it is, and I've been doing Linux for, I started on Linux on

731
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:31,660
the first Red Hat release that was there in early 20, I think it was 1999 something.

732
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,660
So it dates back.

733
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,020
So it's kind of a dear heart for me.

734
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,540
It's been a while.

735
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,580
And so getting all that running, can you circle back to Linux after all this time?

736
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:46,340
It's really nice to see all those people getting interested into having applications running

737
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,340
there.

738
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,340
I bet.

739
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,620
Well, now I have to ask, do you have a current Linux box?

740
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,180
And if so, what's the setup?

741
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,020
I'm running mainly on Windows for now.

742
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,860
I actually have multiple things.

743
00:38:54,860 --> 00:39:00,820
So I have a mix of Linux boxes that are running for IoT stuff that I have on my machine.

744
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:06,620
My machine is a Windows 10, but I have multiple WSL setups that are installed there so I can

745
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,020
test with all the different distros there.

746
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:16,540
I have an Ubuntu machine that's actually a Raspberry Pi running on it, plus a bunch

747
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:21,180
of other stuff with build machines for the calculators specifically.

748
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,240
So they're running on Ubuntu servers.

749
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,460
So lots of things.

750
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,300
That sounds like a pretty typical developer setup.

751
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,940
There's always a range of machines.

752
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,940
Exactly.

753
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,940
Plus a Mac.

754
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,940
Because I'm doing iOS stuff.

755
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,940
Sure.

756
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,820
It's interesting to hear WSL getting a workout.

757
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,660
I think kind of how Microsoft intended it to be used.

758
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,660
So that's fascinating.

759
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,660
Yes.

760
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,660
Yes.

761
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:47,260
And with regards to developers, it's all about expanding horizons.

762
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:54,300
And I see Mac OS users, they want to go and use Windows.

763
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,940
They don't want to be left out with their own tooling that they were Unix-like.

764
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,620
So they're using WSL for that.

765
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:06,060
There are other users that are just plain Windows users, but they have fancy tooling

766
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:12,460
that comes from Linux and they can use it that way without having to install it or maintain

767
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:16,780
the Linux box because maybe that's not their main way to develop that.

768
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:22,300
Or plain just Linux users that say, well, I have a Windows box and I want to do anything

769
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,460
with it, just gaming.

770
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,320
But I like my tooling so I can use that there.

771
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,320
So that's the kind of things.

772
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,460
Jerome, you're sort of sitting in a fascinating position as a developer.

773
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,420
Sounds like you've been in the Linux community in one form or another for a very, very long

774
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,420
time.

775
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,580
You've seen the transformation that Microsoft is making.

776
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,220
Uno Platform relies on some fundamental Microsoft technologies.

777
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,720
Also, I think you guys have a relationship to some degree with Canonical.

778
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,760
This is being distributed as a snap package.

779
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:57,200
This is almost a unicorn position in a sense, but I think one that's going to become a lot

780
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
more common.

781
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,260
I don't know, maybe you're not the first to this little, this quadfecta that we have here,

782
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:06,100
but it seems like this is maybe the new reality and from where you're sitting as a longtime

783
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,100
Linux user, I'm curious on your thoughts of where we're at right now with all this.

784
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:15,900
To be very honest, the last couple of years, let's say three or four years, I didn't follow

785
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:21,400
all the details about the packaging stories and I discovered that there's quite a few

786
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,980
new ones and IU snapped in one way or another.

787
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:31,580
But I stayed on the RPM and APT for a very long time, so that was my way of deploying

788
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,380
applications without any store.

789
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,340
There's always multiple ways to do things in Linux.

790
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,620
There's always.

791
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:45,060
But what surprised me is the community's response to snap specifically and the fact that it's

792
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:50,380
not so there's the technology itself, but there's the fact that it's also all about

793
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,820
having something with a centralized way of doing things.

794
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,220
It's not about canonical or anything like that.

795
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,700
It's just, I want to be able to install my things by myself.

796
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,960
I don't want someone to spy on me or maybe tentatively spy on me because that's not the

797
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:09,380
case for the calculator, but let's say, and so that's the kind of things that it's all

798
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,380
about choice.

799
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:15,460
And seeing that I said, well, I'm going to try to do a nap image of the calculator.

800
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,500
So there's an app image of the calculator now.

801
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,820
You're saying you got a lot of feedback.

802
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,820
I take it.

803
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,820
I did.

804
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:26,700
I got a lot of feedback and I read all of it, kind of skim through because there's snarky

805
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:34,100
comments and so skimming, but anyways, the interesting part is that knowing about the

806
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:41,060
preferences of people and what's available, I see snap as being a very easy commodity

807
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,920
way of installing things.

808
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,380
Same thing as a flat pack would be the same way.

809
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:53,820
But the idea is that people that are new to that space and using Linux for better or worse,

810
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:59,860
they're accustomed to installing application in a simple way from a user interface.

811
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:06,420
And I reckon that people that are the same ones that are going to be installing ArcLinux

812
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,800
or that kind of distribution that there's no UI and you install everything by the command

813
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,700
line and knowing all the options by heart, they don't want to have that kind of things

814
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,700
and that makes sense.

815
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:23,460
So that's why being able to have a wide variety of ways to install packages is important.

816
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:29,340
Would you say that the use of snaps is more controversial than say the use of mono or

817
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,500
anything into that regard from the Microsoft side?

818
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,540
It seems like it was pretty strong feedback and maybe I also wonder if it wasn't for your

819
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:39,700
longtime Linux experience that helped you convert that into actionable items versus

820
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,300
like, oh gosh, we've upset everybody.

821
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,300
No, no, no.

822
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,300
Not at all.

823
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,300
Not at all.

824
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:50,080
And I mean, to be honest on that part, because we've been introducing the Microsoft side

825
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,380
of it in many ways.

826
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:57,060
So let's say people have been, so I'm going to show you the wide range of responses that

827
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,060
we got.

828
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:03,340
On the iOS community, oh, this is C-sharp, this is not a native application, or it actually

829
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:08,380
is, but it looks different, it's not the same or it's not objective C code, so I'm not going

830
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,380
to use it.

831
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,420
So that's the iOS part.

832
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,660
On Android, they say, oh, that's not the kind of application that I want.

833
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:17,340
And it's having people that are developing things because they want to go faster.

834
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,460
They say, oh, the UI looks like iOS, I don't want it.

835
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,100
So that's the kind of response that we can also get from that one.

836
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,620
Then on the WebAssembly side, we say, oh, WebAssembly, that's not good.

837
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:30,900
I mean, it's something that looks, it's not JavaScript, so it sucks.

838
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,580
So I'm not going to use it.

839
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:36,420
That's the kind of responses that we get from communities because you're kind of an outsider

840
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,860
way of looking at that.

841
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,860
And that's fine.

842
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:46,700
It's all about adjusting how we present things, and I was pretty sure we were going to get

843
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:52,340
some kind of feedback in one way or another, and snap being one, and that's fine.

844
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:57,620
So we are adjusting for that and adding other ways to do that.

845
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:03,500
And now from the part with Microsoft specifically, I mean, Canonical, they have a relationship,

846
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,340
but that's not Microsoft pushing there.

847
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:11,420
Microsoft is specifically for WSL, they're providing something to enable Linux to work

848
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:15,460
there and happens to be that Canonical was one of the first to do that, but that's pretty

849
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,460
much it.

850
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:21,780
Now, for the calculator part, I mean, there's no Microsoft at all.

851
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,920
That's just Uno Platform, that we did that on our own.

852
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,780
So there's no pushing of any kind of agenda coming from Microsoft or any way.

853
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,780
Right.

854
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,780
It just makes a great demo.

855
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,780
It does.

856
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:33,780
It does.

857
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,780
And we're not done yet.

858
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,380
There's a lot of things that need to be worked out, like the fact that you cannot use the

859
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:44,180
keyboard keys to type in the calculator for now, because we haven't had added the keystroke

860
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,500
support for now.

861
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,880
So that's the kind of thing that is going to evolve.

862
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,060
And we've seen from the announcement people saying, well, that's Microsoft, they're going

863
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,940
to invade the Linux space and they're going to extinguish.

864
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,260
No, it's not Microsoft.

865
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,380
It's just Uno Platform.

866
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,900
We like the tech, we like Linux, and we're going there.

867
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,540
And the calculator is open source.

868
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,540
Exactly.

869
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,540
Exactly.

870
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:08,980
So the last point on the Snap thing is, my thought about it always is, is that it seems

871
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:16,500
to me having a central software repository that is ran by a company that you can interface

872
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,500
with, right?

873
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,620
You can have a relationship with people at Canonical.

874
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:24,220
I think that is worth something for people that want to distribute software on the Linux

875
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,220
platform.

876
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:28,620
And that's generally my answer to all the Snap hate, is you have to understand the larger

877
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,620
ecosystem.

878
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,620
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.

879
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,700
It makes a lot of sense.

880
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:36,060
And it must not be the same, the only way to distribute software.

881
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:41,180
And that's why being able to distribute as any kind of other distribution mechanism has

882
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,940
to be available and supported in some ways.

883
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,220
That's why AppImage is amazing because you just pack everything in one package and then

884
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,860
it runs without installing anything.

885
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,820
So that's pretty good.

886
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:58,980
But for people that want to discover the interface, if my application is only distributed on GitHub,

887
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,020
how do I go and find it?

888
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,940
It's quite difficult to get there.

889
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:08,500
On the other end, if you're publishing something on Snap and like Apple, they don't want you

890
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:13,900
to distribute any kind of very specific application because the local laws prevent you from publishing

891
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,380
your application there.

892
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,740
Maybe you don't want to abide by that.

893
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:21,220
So there's a balance to get somewhere.

894
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:28,000
For us, it was about being able to be published on a store that shows the applications there.

895
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,300
And for people that don't know much about Linux or the kid that got a Raspberry Pi

896
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:41,060
at Christmas and then wants to install something and then just happens up to have Ubuntu running

897
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,900
there and then just click through and then just the applications get there.

898
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,260
And then they end up learning about Linux afterwards.

899
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:54,660
That's the kind of scenario that I'm looking at, not the high-end tech user that knows

900
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:59,380
how to change anything on their platform by heart.

901
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,380
Right.

902
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,380
We're really kind of the future.

903
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:05,660
And tip of the hat to you for taking that feedback and rolling with it and then taking

904
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:09,820
action on it and making it available in more ways and targeting what looks like a future

905
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,820
generation of developers.

906
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,900
Jerome, I'm pretty excited about it and I'll be keeping an eye on the platform.

907
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,900
Thanks for joining us.

908
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,900
Yeah, of course.

909
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,900
Thank you.

910
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:21,100
Let's do a little housekeeping, Mr. Payne.

911
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,100
Let's do it.

912
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:27,420
I encourage you all to join the Luplug this Sunday and perhaps into the future because

913
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,100
something very fun is beginning to happen over there.

914
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:35,700
They got something special brewing and there's talks, there's recordings, but also another

915
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:44,300
JB Bugathon on November 22nd at noon Pacific in the JB Mumble Room in the lobby.

916
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,780
There's a new release of Jellyfin in the works and the developers have reached out in our

917
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:52,960
Matrix Bugathon chat and asked if we would help test it and the Luplug has stepped up

918
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,960
to the challenge.

919
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,680
And if you'd like to help test the next release of Jellyfin, you have some time.

920
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,620
It's November 22nd as we record this.

921
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,620
Hey, that's great.

922
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:04,500
I mean, I'm a Jellyfin user myself and it's already doing well and this could only make

923
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,500
it better.

924
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,980
And I've been thinking about switching more and more.

925
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:07,980
It's really nice.

926
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,020
Yeah, just minimal does what you need.

927
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,020
Not a lot of fuss.

928
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,680
But there could be some talks coming up in there.

929
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,060
There's all kinds of stuff in the works.

930
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,060
So check it out.

931
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,060
Luplug.

932
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:19,920
Also, I want to mention, if you haven't yet, you might consider grabbing the All Shows

933
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,740
feed for Jupiter Broadcasting.

934
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,500
Get all the stuff coming out.

935
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,100
Wes has now joined me on Linux Action News.

936
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:31,740
First episode is out and we're changing just a few things up.

937
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,120
I'd love to have you check it out.

938
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,780
Not much, just a couple of tweaks here and there.

939
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:42,500
So go check out Linux Action News if you haven't for a little bit because we're trying to make

940
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,060
it a little fresh with Wes on there.

941
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,100
A little fresh, but with everything you love.

942
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,100
Fresh with Wes.

943
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,100
Fresh with Wes.

944
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,100
So check that out.

945
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,540
If you're on the All Shows RSS feed, you're going to get stuff like that already.

946
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,540
Just shows up.

947
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:54,540
Yeah.

948
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,540
So search for that.

949
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,900
There's also a link at JupiterBroadcasting.com and we'd love to have you get all of the

950
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,900
shows.

951
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,060
All right, Wes, I think that's all the housekeeping for this week.

952
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,540
Nice and nice today.

953
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:06,820
Let's get into some feedback.

954
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,900
We have three emails that came into the show.

955
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,900
How about I'll take the first one?

956
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,900
You want to do that?

957
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,900
Let's do it.

958
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,900
Okay.

959
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,180
Wes says, falling for Fedora says, hey, Chris and Wes, long time Ubuntu user, but after

960
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:22,820
listening to your show and after listening to about four months of this, I decided to

961
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,980
give Fedora a go.

962
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,420
Oh, interesting.

963
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:31,700
It was also kind of sped up by the timing of a new ThinkPad T14 purchase with Renoir

964
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,700
graphics.

965
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,700
What do you think, Wes?

966
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,700
You know what I want to call it?

967
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,340
I want to call it Rainier graphics, but let's just go with that.

968
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,260
Only you and I would get that reference.

969
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,820
He said, I needed kernel 5.6 or above, so I have to say I'm really impressed with Fedora

970
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,860
32, and now I have to decide if I'm going to upgrade to 33 or maybe switch and try Pop

971
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,860
OS.

972
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,780
Hey, welcome to my struggle right now.

973
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:58,380
It's bad because I am in that phase where I'm trying to do apt on a DNF box, and I'm

974
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,380
doing DNF on an app box.

975
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,860
You don't know what you're doing.

976
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:08,660
Oh, it's just, yeah, it really is a struggle, which this is totally my doing, Wes, but it's

977
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:13,740
because I put pop theme on all of them.

978
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,740
You know?

979
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:15,740
Yeah, you can't tell what system I'm on.

980
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:16,740
Yeah.

981
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,620
I've just really done myself in.

982
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,100
I really have been happy with Fedora 33.

983
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,100
Are you still running it?

984
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,100
Yeah.

985
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,100
Yeah?

986
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,740
I've been really, really, really happy with it.

987
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:33,100
There's something just super solid about it, and I really like it, but I also really

988
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:37,700
have been happy with Pop, so you just got to try them both out and see what works for

989
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,700
you.

990
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,700
Too many good choices.

991
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,700
That's a nice problem.

992
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,700
Yeah.

993
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,700
He's also going to give Leno to try.

994
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,060
Hey, that's great.

995
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,060
Just signed up with our link.

996
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,700
Yeah, I'm going to put NextCloud on there.

997
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,420
He says, thanks from New Zealand.

998
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,420
That is pretty great.

999
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,620
Thanks, Brett, for giving us an update.

1000
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,220
Good luck on picking your distribution.

1001
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,940
The nice thing is, is you just have too many good options now.

1002
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,980
Yeah, right, and Fedora is definitely one of them.

1003
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:58,980
All right.

1004
00:51:58,980 --> 00:51:59,980
You want to take Adrian's?

1005
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,980
Adrian writes in, hello there, Chris and Wes.

1006
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:07,660
I've been a casual Linux user since 2005, but I've always used a Debian or Ubuntu-based

1007
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,660
distro.

1008
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:12,900
I've become familiar with apt and really not feeling up to learning a new package manager.

1009
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,980
Okay, maybe that's a bad excuse, I know.

1010
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:21,420
But lately, Ubuntu has been acting oddly on my current laptop, Firefox performance, blank

1011
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,860
screen after resuming from hibernation, other weird display problems.

1012
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:31,860
So I finally decided to give Fedora a spin last week, and I have not had any of the issues

1013
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,860
since.

1014
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,860
Huh.

1015
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,860
Displays are performing as expected.

1016
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,860
Suspend works great.

1017
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:40,620
And like you, I find the default setup fairly sparse, but also I like that I can slowly

1018
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:46,300
make the customizations that I want as I want them, and maybe figure out what, if any, extensions

1019
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,300
are causing me problems.

1020
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,460
I mean, that is it right there, right, is it's with Fedora, it's I kind of build it

1021
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:57,000
up to the desktop environment I want and with, and to a degree with Ubuntu stock, I kind

1022
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,380
of build it down a little bit, but I actually really like their default.

1023
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:04,300
So I almost feel like I need to channel my inner poppy here and say, you know, hang on,

1024
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,220
we need to be fair.

1025
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:09,140
All distros will exhibit problems after you've used them for a while.

1026
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,140
That's true.

1027
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,460
Fedora is not immune from this particular problem.

1028
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,460
Right.

1029
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,620
Well, you install a new setup while you get a new setup.

1030
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:18,580
But I also totally appreciate, you know, when you're of the opinion, like, I'd like to jump

1031
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,260
to something else, start fresh and just see what it's like, and there's absolutely nothing

1032
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,260
wrong with that.

1033
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:25,020
That's one of the great things we can do in Linux, and I think you're going to really

1034
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,020
enjoy it.

1035
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:31,460
So give it a spin, see what you think, and maybe report back after a little bit of usage,

1036
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:32,460
Adrian.

1037
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,460
I'd be curious to know how it goes.

1038
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,460
Yeah.

1039
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,460
Interesting theme there.

1040
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,460
And not planned.

1041
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:40,020
Stefan writes in, I know this is a question often asked and hard to answer.

1042
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:43,220
I've been a Linux user since the mid-90s with Slackware.

1043
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:47,500
I tried most of the distros at one time or another, and currently I'm running a Gentoo

1044
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,500
system.

1045
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,500
Oh, wow.

1046
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,700
The thing is, I'm kind of tired of having to compile everything.

1047
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,180
An honest Gentoo user.

1048
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,180
Yes.

1049
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,180
I know.

1050
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,180
That's how I felt, too.

1051
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,980
I'm kind of tired of having to compile everything for a little gain in speed.

1052
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:05,600
I switched to Gentoo from Angera, which was great, but wasn't a fan of the rolling updates.

1053
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,540
So I'd use Ubuntu, but I don't want to go back to a Debian-style system.

1054
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:15,140
I use my system to play Steam and good old, or, sorry, GOG games, some minor Python development,

1055
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,780
and every once in a while some C and C++.

1056
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,800
Also I use a lot of ham radio.

1057
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,500
So I've got some power to spare on this machine, and I've used that to dedicate that to Jellyfinner

1058
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,860
Plex I'm still deciding.

1059
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,380
I'm looking at the new and shining.

1060
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:30,380
I'm thinking maybe I should go with OpenSUSE or elementary these days.

1061
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,960
I'm kind of a fan of KDE5 Plasma.

1062
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,660
Are there any other distros you would suggest?

1063
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,660
Thanks for the help.

1064
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,340
Been a listener for many years on and off.

1065
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,340
Glad you're still around.

1066
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,340
Keep up the good work.

1067
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,100
Well, I'm glad you're still around, too, Stefan.

1068
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,140
I kind of feel like you should, I don't normally say this.

1069
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,140
Uh-oh.

1070
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,140
Going rogue.

1071
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,860
I think he should go OpenSUSE Plasma.

1072
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,860
You didn't think?

1073
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,860
No.

1074
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:51,860
You did not.

1075
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,860
I was just going to say you should try Fedora 33 since everyone else is loving it.

1076
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,860
Yeah.

1077
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,860
Okay.

1078
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,860
Keep going.

1079
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:57,860
Well, there is a Plasma spin of Fedora 33.

1080
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:58,860
Indeed.

1081
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:02,260
I think it's worth mentioning, you could totally give that a go, Stefan.

1082
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,260
Consider that.

1083
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:06,140
But, you know, he said in here that he's used Linux in Slackware.

1084
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,780
Put in his time.

1085
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:15,620
If you go over to OpenSUSE as a former Slackware user, you will, I think, notice some lineage

1086
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,620
there.

1087
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,220
I think there'll be some comfort there.

1088
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,100
And they have a killer Plasma release.

1089
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,700
And then I'm going to say this, too.

1090
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:26,980
If you have made Gen 2 work for you, then you're okay with a distro that does things

1091
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,420
a little differently.

1092
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,940
In OpenSUSE, it does things a little differently, but once you've used it for six months, you

1093
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,940
wrap your head around it.

1094
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:33,940
Yeah.

1095
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,860
And I think Stefan would be up for a challenge like that.

1096
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:41,140
And it really hits that sweet spot of you can get one that's semi-rolling, or you can

1097
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:44,060
get one that has stable releases, and you can pick and choose.

1098
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,980
So I think that would be a good candidate for you.

1099
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:50,360
All kinds of neat stuff with the open build service and really interesting technical foundations

1100
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,360
for sure.

1101
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,360
Absolutely.

1102
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,700
And, you know, I'm a big fan of elementary.

1103
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:59,380
I put it on my family's computers, but you have that Ubuntu base there, which you said

1104
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:02,380
earlier, not a big fan of the Debian bases.

1105
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:08,940
I think your options are to seriously consider OpenSUSE with Plasma, or maybe give the old

1106
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:13,500
Fedora Plasma spin a try, just for fun.

1107
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:18,940
I will talk about, you know, you mentioned Steam and GOG, and I don't have extensive

1108
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:24,260
OpenSUSE experience here, but I will say it has never been easier to get gaming going

1109
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,260
on Fedora.

1110
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:28,340
There is a flat pack that has a ton of the stuff you need for Steam.

1111
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:32,620
You can, with one click, add the NVIDIA driver repo now if you need in Software Center, and

1112
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,060
you have the latest and greatest NVIDIA driver.

1113
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:38,220
You get a very fresh and current kernel, which I know is also something you're interested

1114
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,220
in.

1115
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,020
So consider all of that, all those options.

1116
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:44,820
I don't know if the story is quite the same on OpenSUSE when it comes to gaming.

1117
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,780
Python development, you're going to be fine.

1118
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,020
Ham radio wise, you're going to be fine.

1119
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:50,940
Jellyfin or Plex, you're going to be fine either way.

1120
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:54,580
Maybe give Jellyfin a go though, and if Jellyfin doesn't work for you, then consider Plex.

1121
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,700
It's a good way to do it.

1122
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:59,060
If you're doing mostly just LAN streaming too, you probably don't need to worry about

1123
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,060
Plex.

1124
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,020
They also play decently together too.

1125
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:06,020
I have two going, and I point them at the same backing media storage on the file system,

1126
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,020
and that works great.

1127
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:10,540
Ah, a Westpane Media Pro tip right there.

1128
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,880
I want to thank our Unplugged Core contributors.

1129
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,580
You can become a member at unpluggedcore.com, become a core contributor to this show, and

1130
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:22,320
keep the show independent for as long as this show is on the air, but you also help reduce

1131
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:27,300
the ad load needed to make the show profitable, and we can be picky about who comes on, which

1132
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:31,540
is massive from a content creator standpoint, but you also get a couple of perks as a thank

1133
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,540
you.

1134
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,580
You get access to two feeds.

1135
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,220
I would probably just grab one of them.

1136
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:40,420
One is the limited ad version of the show, same full production with all of Joe's work

1137
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,340
gone into the mix and the edit.

1138
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:46,900
There's just limited ads in that one, or a second live feed, which is like the exact

1139
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,900
opposite.

1140
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:52,020
All our screw ups, the stuff that we would maybe have cut from the show for time before

1141
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:58,980
the mix, everything, full pre and post shows that happen well before we hit record in the

1142
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:03,820
main recorder, all of that is in a feed that's available to our members as well.

1143
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:07,680
And we also, and I don't normally say this, I should be though, because we work our butt

1144
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:13,700
off on this one, we try to get that full live feed out as soon as we can after the show.

1145
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:18,220
I mean, there's just limits in how fast you can encode and upload large files and it takes

1146
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:22,820
us a little bit to get the description written up, but usually within a half hour of us going

1147
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:29,180
off air, within that window of time, maybe an hour, the live full version is available.

1148
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:34,600
So if you like to get it as fresh as possible right after the show with no delay for editing

1149
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,600
and publishing.

1150
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,220
Or maybe I usually like to show up live, but you missed it.

1151
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,220
Yeah.

1152
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:40,220
Perfect.

1153
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,820
That's why we've made that feed available, because we're always talking about the live

1154
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,100
show in the main show.

1155
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,100
I mean, we're here live.

1156
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,100
Yeah.

1157
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:49,660
So we wanted to make that available to our core contributors as well, unpluggedcore.com.

1158
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,940
Now a pick this week, I told you about this one earlier, but I don't know if you had a

1159
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:56,340
chance to try it, Wes, because I just told you about it like two days ago.

1160
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:02,700
It's called Newsflash and you'll have to forgive the cliche term, but it is applicable.

1161
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:07,820
It is a quote, modern, end quote, feed reader designed for the GNOME desktop.

1162
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:08,820
It looks pretty nice.

1163
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,140
You know, I installed it this morning and I just opened it up right now.

1164
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,140
Yeah.

1165
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,140
Okay.

1166
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,140
So can you tell me a little bit more?

1167
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:17,100
So it says it's supposed to integrate with an existing feed reader service.

1168
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,780
What all can this actually do?

1169
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:24,060
So this is the probably most important feature for me in a desktop RSS feed reader.

1170
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:29,460
I consume tons and tons of feeds for the different shows, tons and tons of feeds.

1171
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:34,820
And I was way back in the day, I was a fresh RSS and a tiny, tiny RSS guy.

1172
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,140
And I even was a Google, Google Reader.

1173
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,140
Remember Google Reader guy?

1174
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,140
Yes.

1175
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,140
Yes.

1176
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,500
And I needed something more robust.

1177
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:46,360
And Feedly has actually added a lot of compelling features, including a bot that helps me sort

1178
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,460
news for various shows and whatnot.

1179
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,460
And they have a training algorithm where I can train it for the type of stories that

1180
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,460
I like.

1181
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,460
Figures out what you like.

1182
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,460
Yeah.

1183
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:57,060
And I can view in raw mode and filtered mode and all that kind of stuff that I just, for

1184
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:04,300
the amount of news that is consumed for this show, Linux action news and unfilter, I needed

1185
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,300
a tool for it.

1186
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:10,180
And so I ended up using Feedly, but I never was really happy with Feedly being a web app.

1187
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:13,980
I would like to have a desktop date of application, something I can sort of just leave open and

1188
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:18,020
flip over to when I have a couple of minutes, something that maybe takes advantage of my

1189
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:21,980
dark mode properly, integrates in with my GTK theme.

1190
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,260
And that's where Newsflash came in.

1191
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,820
As I hooked it up, there's several options.

1192
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:28,820
Feedly is one of many options that you can connect it to for syncing, including some

1193
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,300
self-hosted solutions.

1194
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,980
I hooked it up to my Feedly account.

1195
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:36,740
I pulled down all of my feeds, and it has a functionality that I just, I really love.

1196
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:42,100
And that is this situation where you get an article that only has maybe like an image

1197
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,700
and the title and maybe a one-paragraph description of the story, and then you have to go to the

1198
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,700
website for the rest.

1199
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,700
For the full thing.

1200
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:48,700
Yeah, yeah.

1201
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,060
Well, man, I'm trying to tear through stuff and read stuff and get an idea if the story

1202
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,060
is good enough.

1203
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,420
And I need more than just the headline if I'm going to make that call.

1204
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:59,820
And this has a one-button click where it makes a best effort to go out to the website and

1205
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:04,460
get the rest of the content of the article, but it displays it in line like it was always

1206
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,900
meant to be formatted for the feed.

1207
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:09,180
So it's a bit of a reader view that looks really good.

1208
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:11,300
Oh, that's what this little book icon is.

1209
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,300
Right.

1210
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,840
You hit that, and it'll go retrieve it for you and display it in line.

1211
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,840
And I just love that.

1212
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:22,100
And then, of course, it syncs back what you've read and whatnot and supports the latest GTK

1213
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,100
design ideas.

1214
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:26,900
So all the latest menu standards and the CSD and all of that.

1215
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:32,960
So it's a nice GNOME desktop app, and it's on Flathub, and I imagine it's other places

1216
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:33,960
as well.

1217
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,940
I wouldn't be surprised if this feels like maybe one of those things that was built for

1218
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,820
maybe elementary OS maybe.

1219
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:40,820
I'm not sure.

1220
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:41,820
I haven't looked in the...

1221
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,300
It is simple, clean, and functional.

1222
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,300
Yeah.

1223
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,560
And it's on Flathub, so it's just one click away.

1224
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:50,340
So it's news flash, one word, and we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

1225
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,020
So I'd like to hear your thoughts on it, Wes.

1226
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,220
You give it a go for a little bit and let me know what you think.

1227
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,420
Sounds like we've got some IRC folks using it too.

1228
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:57,420
Oh yeah?

1229
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,420
Oh.

1230
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,540
Linbo or LinMob, you've used it before?

1231
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:03,700
Yes, I'm actively using it.

1232
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:07,540
I'm using it with a self-hosted Miniflux instance.

1233
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:12,100
Miniflux is one of those self-hostable RSS readers.

1234
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:16,220
And I can report that news flash also works on the PinePhone.

1235
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,220
Awesome.

1236
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,900
And it's likely going to work on the Librem 5 too.

1237
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,920
Oh, so it is designed to scale all the way down.

1238
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,920
That's so cool.

1239
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:29,060
Oh man, we live in an interesting time for Linux users, I really have to say.

1240
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,060
Cool.

1241
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:31,060
Well, thanks for the direct report there.

1242
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,460
I've been using it just for, I don't know, half a week.

1243
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:34,460
I really like it.

1244
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:37,820
And I still can use Feedly, you know, and everything's synced up, so I really appreciate

1245
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:38,820
it.

1246
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,820
I'll definitely give it a go.

1247
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,780
You know, Wes, I encourage everyone to join us live.

1248
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:46,140
We do this show at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern over at jblife.tv.

1249
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:50,660
You can get that converted to your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1250
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,060
See you next week.

1251
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,580
Same bad time, same bad station.

1252
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:58,080
Also check out our sponsor, A Cloud Guru, on social media.

1253
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,780
Just find A Cloud Guru at YouTube, Twitter, or Facebook by going to any of those slash

1254
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,940
A Cloud Guru and you'll find him on there.

1255
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:04,940
Easy.

1256
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:07,620
And I mentioned it earlier, but do check out Linux Action News if you haven't for a little

1257
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,620
bit.

1258
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:12,420
Wes has joined me now cooking up something really great for this week's episode.

1259
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,700
And I don't know, I'm happy.

1260
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,160
I'm really happy with the way it turned out.

1261
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:20,140
We didn't really know because we had to kind of ask ourselves what we want to tweak about

1262
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,140
it.

1263
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,140
But I'm really happy with what we landed on.

1264
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:23,140
It's mostly the same.

1265
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:24,140
A little different.

1266
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,140
Yeah.

1267
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,140
Check it out.

1268
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:27,620
It's linuxactionnews.com for that.

1269
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:31,740
Links to everything we talked about, that's on our website at linuxunplugged slash 378

1270
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,860
where you can also get subscribed.

1271
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:37,020
You can find the mumble room, the chat info.

1272
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:40,460
All of that is linked up at the top of linuxunplugged.com.

1273
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:43,340
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1274
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:58,780
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1275
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:28,540
Well, speaking of the virtual lug, I wanted to pick Mini-Mech's brain because last week

1276
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:32,660
you mentioned to me that you were going to try recording the luplug.

1277
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:33,660
Did you give it a go?

1278
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:34,660
How'd it turn out?

1279
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:38,980
So Chris, honestly, I think we are really up into something here.

1280
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,700
So we had our first recorded luplug session.

1281
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:47,100
What we technically do, in fact, in MumbleList, we create just a recording room and then go

1282
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,680
in there and anyone who wants to record, records it.

1283
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:55,180
So we have multiple copies of the recording and then someone prepares a topic.

1284
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,960
In that case, it was me.

1285
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:02,240
We talked about shortcuts, mouse buttons and mouse gestures and then we had like a discussion

1286
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:08,300
for about 45 minutes and then it was really, really, really, really cool.

1287
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:12,520
And now we were so happy about the result that we decided that we want to do that like

1288
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:21,860
once a month and during our weekly meetings, we can discuss a topic and the one who proposed

1289
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:27,620
a topic that is accepted by the others can prepare a talk and can also be host of the

1290
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:31,000
topic in that recorded luplug session.

1291
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,020
So like we can earn ourselves a little podcast experience after listening to the master.

1292
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:39,140
Now we can try ourselves, you see.

1293
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:45,380
Now we also have like people like Computer Kid that offered his help for editing.

1294
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:50,660
And the last question would be how we publish all these recordings, but we can talk about

1295
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:51,660
that afterwards.

1296
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:58,260
Because while we have recordings, we could do something like a monthly RSS feed and publish

1297
01:05:58,260 --> 01:05:59,260
our recordings.

1298
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:00,260
Yeah, totally.

1299
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:06,100
Isn't that a great possibility for the JB community just to give you also some feedback

1300
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:10,200
to participate and yeah, do some stuff.

1301
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,020
We are really up into something here.

1302
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:13,540
I'm really happy.

1303
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,540
That's really exciting.

1304
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:17,060
I would, yeah, let's definitely talk more about like an RSS feed.

1305
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:22,180
And you know, something I've always fantasized about is revamping the JB live FM stream to

1306
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:27,460
have more community content on it and more current content when we're not actually live,

1307
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,740
but programming to some degree.

1308
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:33,300
That's always like when I have time for 20% project kind of thing.

1309
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,300
That's when I want to do that.

1310
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,980
But we could definitely set up an RSS feed a lot sooner than that.

1311
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:39,860
So we'll start rubbing our brain noodles together on that one.

1312
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,640
I bet we can figure something out.

1313
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,940
Really kind of neat thing to watch it grow.

1314
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:44,940
