00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Everybody loves an Amiga story and that's why we are first to bring you the news that the Amiga fast file system is

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,380
Returning to the Linux kernel who needs this. I think just about no one. Hey some soos developer, you know it

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,760
I mean, I would bet you search the search that article

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,640
I bet you three bucks that it's a soos. It's a soos thing. It's just sounds like them. It just sounds like them

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,640
Oh, yep. Okay

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,540
And kernel maintainer David sterba. Yeah. Oh, yeah a soos developer

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,000
I guess he was just reviewing it and committing. I don't know. I can't win him someone else authored

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,140
Yeah, but what are the chances somebody from soos is attached somehow? What are the chances?

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,560
Hello friends and welcome to 371 of your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, mr

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,480
Payne, did you know that this episode is brought to you by a cloud guru? Are you looking to get a high-paying career?

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,560
Maybe move into the cloud and make some good change

12
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,220
Well, there's no better place to start than getting a certification

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,400
ACG has helped more than 2 million people scale up on the cloud AWS Azure and Google Cloud Platform

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,920
Head over to cloud guru comm and get started now. We have a great show today. It's a special smoky edition

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,500
we're recording it a little early because I'm hitting the road and

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,100
And we're getting slow-cooked while we do it. It's it's a cold smoke. It's it is it is a cold smoke

17
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,020
It's a wood smoke that we're surrounded in

18
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,020
So if you hear Wes coughing during the show, it's definitely the wood smoke before we go any further got to say hello to drew

19
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,740
Hello, sir. Hello. Hi drew. We're in your Sunday pajamas. I see okay

20
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,220
We're I'm on Tuesday, too

21
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,380
You know, it's always nice to have your Sunday pajamas on Tuesday

22
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,100
And of course everybody in the mumble rooms in their pajamas time appropriate greetings mumble room. Hello

23
00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:00,260
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello a special hello to mr. Stewart language. Thanks for joining us Stewart. Hi, thank you

24
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,940
Hi, hi, we're gonna be talking about cabin in a little bit

25
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,220
I mean, we got a few things to get to today. We got more than just that Stewart geez

26
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,260
But we're gonna get to that a little bit. So do feel free to jump in on any topics as we go

27
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,780
Hello Popey. It's good to see you, too. I know hi, you'll be joining us for the cabin chat

28
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,100
But you know what Popey I also give you very special permission to jump in on any topic just any topic. Oh, you're too kind

29
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,300
All right. Well, let's start in the news not the Amiga file system update

30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:35,940
But the future of the Ubuntu community now, I'm gonna warn you I got up real early today

31
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,900
so I might have a slightly spicier than usual take on this one and

32
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,880
Any guidance from our friends in the mumble room would be appreciated

33
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,780
But I came across this thread on the discourse dot Ubuntu comm site may have heard of it

34
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,060
It's a new thing brand new should go check it out. No, not really and I'm not gonna name names at first here

35
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,060
But eventually this conversation

36
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,940
Led to Marshall with coming out of the woodwork and responding to this and it starts kind of directly at him

37
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,940
He says this is the original poster

38
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,380
I've seen discussions about the abrupt loss of leadership in the community and this is a sad event

39
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,580
I'm not entirely however surprised if you've been around the project for some years

40
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,060
You'll notice that there's been a progression towards de-investment in the community for many many years

41
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,860
But the thing that's most saddening though is that mark who has benefited from countless thousands of volunteer hours

42
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,020
Which are certainly worth millions of dollars

43
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:40,180
Didn't have the respect for the community to even articulate why he abandoned the community and has been silent on the collapse of governance

44
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,140
Which he played a part in since he after all is the project leader now

45
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,140
it's hard to read those two first paragraphs and

46
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,540
Not feel like there's a tone in there and the tone that I I impart on that is

47
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,660
One of all dad does is work all day and night two different jobs to put food on the table and a roof over our house

48
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,220
Daddy's too busy keeping the business running to pay attention to us and we're sick of it

49
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,760
That's what I hear when I read that and I appreciate that there is this is a complex issue

50
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,360
but

51
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,360
the structure of this is

52
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:20,200
It feels so privileged. It reads to me as so extremely privileged

53
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,340
I grant that there is some legitimacy to the complaint

54
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,160
There is value derived from the community and there is a certain level of investment

55
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,560
The canonical should be making in the community to perpetuate that I grant that argument

56
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,320
But I feel like this tact is it's almost designed. It seems like to elicit a response from shuttleworth

57
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,560
It's quite provocative and yeah seems to warrant a response

58
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,440
So mark chimes in eventually pretty far down in the thread because you know something like this people can they all got to jump in

59
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,640
With their two cents mark responds in part. I'm not absent. In fact for the past few years

60
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,620
I've set aside all other interests and concerns to help Ubuntu get into a position of long-term sustainability

61
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,280
This has been an amazingly difficult job

62
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:08,020
But I set my mind to it precisely because I care that the Ubuntu community has a backbone, which is durable

63
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:14,700
I'm rather frustrated at my own team because I have a I have long allocated a headcount for community lead at canonical a

64
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,220
Post which has not been filled. It's necessary to have a dedicated lead for this

65
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:25,340
Not so much because the community needs leadership, but because it's self-motivated leaders need support

66
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:32,300
I think for the role more as community secretary than community advocate helping to get complicated pieces lined up to empower

67
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
others to be great

68
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,900
The project has continued to grow in complexity and capability

69
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,540
There are more people than ever working on it more people than ever making demands on it

70
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,420
So getting things done requires patience and coordination

71
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,220
Helping motivated community leaders to be effective in driving their work forward is important to me

72
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,780
You could really read a lot into this and I'm curious to get everyone's take on this

73
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:05,080
One of the last paragraphs he writes Mark Shuttleworth writes. I watched how CC members stopped coming to meetings stopped organizing their meetings

74
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,220
Stopped driving activity. This is obviously not a universal picture

75
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:15,620
There have been harder working and less hard-working CCC bodies and there have been more effective and less effective CC members

76
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:22,120
I understand it's hard to put a lot of effort into something that doesn't seem to correspond directly to a specific project or outcome

77
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,100
And he kind of talks about how it had other issues with decision-making

78
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,500
I'm just gonna take a stab at the dark and I'm gonna say, you know

79
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,740
Mark's got a limited amount of time and he looked at the effectiveness

80
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:39,380
He was deriving from this community council and decided his time was better spent investing in making canonical sustainable and durable

81
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,060
yeah, it's also it's yeah just hard right the limited amount of time a little amount of oversight that one can have over all these

82
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,060
things and

83
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,180
If no one else is doing those if it's not actually being delegated or being handled

84
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,900
Yeah, at some point the stuff slips through the cracks probably from your vantage point

85
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:58,160
Do you feel like the role that community plays in the creation of Ubuntu is shifted over time?

86
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,180
Oh, definitely things have changed over time every open source project does

87
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,140
I think I recognize a number of things in this conversation

88
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,580
One thing I do have to point out is I'm glad that Ubuntu has the kind of community that will

89
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,740
Pick up on these things and will tell us how you're doing something wrong and will come to a place

90
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:25,340
They know we're gonna see like the given to discourse and will lay out their stall for how they think things should be improved and

91
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,700
Whether you think this was done, you know to trigger mark or whether you think Ben who wrote the first post

92
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,520
you know had good thoughts in mind when he wrote it or not the outcome is good because

93
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,160
It did ping mark obviously and it it made him think about this and

94
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,160
Articulate his thoughts and I've been on the CC about ten years ago before I started working for canonical

95
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,320
I was on the Community Council and I certainly recognized some of his comments about

96
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:01,600
the CC goes between periods of not having anything to do because they're quite a reactive group and

97
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:08,940
Having really difficult problems to deal with and that's that's very hard going from nought to a hundred

98
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,580
Like very quickly and having to deal with problems

99
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:18,760
I think one of the big problems with some of the community councils at what I mean by some of is

100
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:26,560
You know people's term runs out and they may get voted in again or they may not and so the staff that people change over

101
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,220
Time I think one of the mistakes is people

102
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:35,620
Feel that they have to wait for mark to say yes to something and that's not the case

103
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,020
When you're voted into the CC

104
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:44,100
It's recognition that you already have some level of recognition in the community. You already have autonomy

105
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,580
you already have a position of leadership and so you should feel empowered to go and

106
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,300
fix things or go and have conversations with people and I think people in

107
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,860
in previous CC's have felt like they had to run everything past mark and that's just not the case and

108
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:01,940
You know

109
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,380
Sometimes he didn't turn up to meetings because he was in the business school or on a plane or you know

110
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,340
There's reasons why everyone can't be at every single meeting

111
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:18,020
But it did tail off about a year ago or so when people kind of gave up and I I'm glad that this thread

112
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,020
has been triggered because it's

113
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,620
reinvigorated mark and reinvigorated the people around mark who

114
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,180
Hopefully will solve this problem and reboot the CC fair enough

115
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,620
In fact, there has been a development before we get there

116
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,780
But I wanted to ask Stewart and I'm trying to think of a way

117
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,020
I was trying to think of a way to phrase this doesn't say Stewart you're old you've observed a lot

118
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,620
But I mean sure you have been around for a while in the community and you you must have observed

119
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,500
There's a different value. It seems like companies

120
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:51,860
Many companies but canonical in particular are driving from the community today than they did say ten years ago. I

121
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,260
Would agree. I mean, I don't really have a position on this

122
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,460
I've been I have watched their conversation with interest obviously, but I think

123
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,500
One of the things that canonical has done as all

124
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,220
Long-term open-source projects do is think more about sustainability

125
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:18,300
This is why for example things like the unity desktop went away, even though it was marvelous

126
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,180
because

127
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,660
Canonical need to think about how can we ensure not only the urban to exist today?

128
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:30,900
But a bunch who continues to exist and carries on doing the best it can for the most people and

129
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,740
so I think

130
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,100
There was something of a sort of a community free-for-all in the early days

131
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:46,260
And now as it's got a bit more professional and some people have kind of gone. Oh, well, it doesn't seem as much fun

132
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,820
anymore

133
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,540
which is

134
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,420
Undeniably possibly the case

135
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:58,300
but on the other hand it means that I still have a desktop that I use every day and have done for

136
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,340
when did when the first came out 2004 so 16 years and

137
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:08,500
And I'd rather that was the case than the whole thing

138
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,940
fizzled like so many other projects have done when someone starts saying but

139
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,580
I've got bored with working on this and I'm not being paid for it

140
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,040
Yeah

141
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,760
I could definitely see a similarity when we started taking a boon to more seriously as a product and started using in production more

142
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:30,360
This attitude shifted a bit and it became less of this fun thing that we're playing around with as a community and more of a serious

143
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,100
Thing that we depend on. That's the thing. I mean, um as as you mentioned, I am I am older than some of the people in

144
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,100
the community and have said of the whole

145
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,400
But I think the other thing is that

146
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,940
fiddling about with your desktop is to some extent at least a a

147
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,760
Young person's thing to do in my experience. It certainly was when I was younger. I used to enjoy things like

148
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,320
changing between different distributions and so on but now my views have

149
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,680
Radically changed on that to the point where my desktop is the thing which launches applications and applications what I care about

150
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:15,880
mm-hmm, so I can get things done whether they're fun things or work things or whatever and so the

151
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:24,740
Importance of talking about the desktop itself has in my experience and in my life fallen by the wayside a bit

152
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:31,860
Right. I don't know whether this is because I've got old or I've got professional and boring or the Linux

153
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,060
Community has got professional and boring or all the above

154
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,300
Possibly a little from column a little from column B little from column C. Yeah

155
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,700
Right. I mean I think too is you know one who's taken over the cloud, right?

156
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,500
What you're using is more of the package infrastructure things like that and the desktop isn't really relevant, right?

157
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:57,300
Yeah, I mean it's it's absolutely something that matters to us but to most the market it's not it's not necessary for what you're deploying

158
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,540
on the server, I think there's a difference between

159
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,380
caring about the desktop and

160
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,220
people wanting to get involved in maintaining it because

161
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,700
Right. It was fun. As Stuart said back at the start

162
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,660
It was fun

163
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:18,480
Like we're breaking new ground and it's innovative and we're doing new things and we're making the desktop usable by normal human beings

164
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,740
As the old strapline used to go

165
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:29,140
But it turns out those things have to be maintained and if you commit to a five-year support term for an LTS

166
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,340
Or a ten-year support term for an LTS

167
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:39,660
Someone's got to keep cranking out those packages and that gets really boring really fast. And so yeah people move on to the next big shiny and

168
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:47,620
Canonical have still continued to finance people to support all those LTS releases for all those years and

169
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,100
Some of the community people have just moved on because it's just not fun and interesting anymore

170
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,700
I certainly would agree when you say people move on to the next big shiny. I think people who are

171
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:04,140
involved in maintaining the desktop for fun in their spare time are

172
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,180
entitled to go to where the fun is and

173
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:14,980
The fun honestly is not as you say in maintaining a thing that already exists making sure it stays stable and so on

174
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,060
so I think

175
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
some of the

176
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,660
motivated

177
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
community developers

178
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,980
It's not as much fun to work on

179
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:31,680
Ubuntu the desktop as it is to work on some other desktop who are doing radical changes of things because they're not supporting

180
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,500
Millions upon millions of users who don't want their desktop to change every 30 seconds

181
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:44,060
But if you do if you do want to hack on this stuff, then yeah go somewhere where they're doing something radical innovative

182
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,220
That's a really good idea. Right? Which is an Ubuntu is not valid. I mean when it came out it was this

183
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,180
Incredibly big change the idea of having a sense of design and

184
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,980
being design led in the Linux world was itself a radical

185
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,260
reinterpretation of the text and

186
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,700
It brought calm to chaos in a way too because there was app selection that took place instead of having three mail apps

187
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:15,580
Yeah, exactly. So having opinions being prepared to state them and pack them up and pack them up with money made a really big difference

188
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,580
but now Ubuntu is not the

189
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:24,460
It's not the new play thing. It's the old statesman of the Linux world. It's what you know

190
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,060
95% of people actually out there using their looks are using those people are not interested in hacking on the desktop

191
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,220
It's just the thing that launches their applications

192
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,460
Yeah, or maybe even more starkly put the thing that launches their web browser mini

193
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,500
Make you think maybe the the role falls upon us to reach out to a newer generation

194
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:49,260
Yeah, we shouldn't forget the talking. I see all the arguments and I'm also one of the older generation

195
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,860
So I normally stay with stock insulation. Maybe I change my

196
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:59,940
Desktop manager, but we need in younger generation and these are the hackers like when we mentioned two weeks ago

197
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:06,820
we need to find new channels and new ways to communicate with them give them access to the hacking and

198
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:13,280
Yeah, so they have really fun to do the thing and then discover Linux like that

199
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,780
Yeah

200
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:20,020
I could see just trying to be there to support their journey and learning and being open to whatever that path might take them because

201
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,220
It's probably gonna be a lot different than our path was when we were younger because the industry has changed

202
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,500
Significantly as we're recording this though. The story has updated a bit

203
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:35,440
Mark Shuttleworth announced that now in cooperation with an Ubuntu member and and former community council member

204
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:41,860
I'm gonna say Walter lap chinsky. What do you think think you did pretty good? Really?

205
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,960
We call him Wexel because it's easy to just call him Wexel

206
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:52,580
Well Wexel I will be working to restore the community council and mark world having considered over the weekend

207
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:59,060
I think I'll take Wexel's offer to help run the process. Let's go ahead and call for nominations to the community council. Well

208
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,460
How about that?

209
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,920
He also thanks Wexel for the conversation and getting it going and then he ends with an apology for having dropped the ball

210
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,260
It seems like he really did reflect on this over the weekend. And that seems like a positive development, too

211
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:15,020
right, I mean I can see big default too if there's been you know mixed levels of availability and

212
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,100
Seemingly excitement around this process. He you know, he does note that it's nice

213
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,700
Maybe it is a good idea to have this in place, even if it isn't particularly active

214
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,180
So maybe there just needs to be some discussion and clarification here around what the roles should be and you know

215
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,720
What it really means to be a part of it? Well speaking of other positive developments

216
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,600
There's been a lot of positive developed developments for the workflow development of butter FS

217
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,580
Now Wes, I'm gonna go and say Yosef

218
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,780
Akik

219
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,020
Well, this is one of the butter fest developers who I follow and you know

220
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:51,620
We'll have to we'll have to check after the show because his his talk over the summer we'd mentioned before about butter fest development

221
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,820
And use in Facebook that's out now, which will have added to the show notes, right? Thank you

222
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,980
Yes, which I did catch a little bit of it's it's you know, it's a file system talk

223
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,700
So prepare yourself for a lot of excitement, but put some fascinating insights into how Facebook uses it

224
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,940
And it looks like after some discussions over the weekend and working out how they want their future development workflow to work

225
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,740
They're on track to improve things quite a bit. Yeah, how about this?

226
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,700
All of our patch submissions will be tracked as individual github issues

227
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,860
So we know what needs to be reviewed and what is pending

228
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,420
We're also tracking XFS test failures in our FS test tree and we'll start staging fixes there

229
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,460
So we don't step on each other's toes when adding new tests

230
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:39,660
I like this line here getting a group of developers who have different companies and different bosses on the same page is

231
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,700
Tricky, but we think this is a step in the right direction and right

232
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,540
I mean, yeah, there's a lot of interest in different folks helping maintain butter a fast in Syria can't be easy

233
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,420
Yeah, and it's good that they recognize as a team. They got some workflow stuff to work out

234
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,900
I mean, it's not like everything solved

235
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:02,420
Yeah, sometimes you understand, you know do a little work on the ways that you work and that way you can work

236
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:08,660
That is so wise West somebody should put that on a t-shirt. You know, that could that could be what drives industry for years to come

237
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,900
Oh, I think it will and that and the next Linux kernel which

238
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:19,140
Mr. Larable over at for Onyx seems to have been hot on the truck on a performance regression and even gotten a bit of a

239
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,740
Conversation back and forth with mr. Linus. Yeah on what the heck's going on

240
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,420
I mean, you know, he loves benchmarks, you know, we love a good kernel story

241
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,180
So anytime we have an excuse to cram one and we do and like, you know, you got to talk about the kernel

242
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,100
Of course, you know

243
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:39,080
It deserves its respect and last week for Onyx reported that there was a performance regression in Linux 5.9

244
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:47,020
When you go from like say 5.0 and you compare it to 5.9 pretty noticeable performance drop in things like Apache and nginx workloads

245
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:52,060
So it look it would directly impact quite a bit of cloud servers if deployed not necessarily great

246
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:58,100
and so it seems that he he sent a note to Linus and Linus took a look at it and

247
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:04,100
Kind of gives an explanation on what's going on and I think that's fascinating if you're interested in what the actual

248
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,460
real world performance results were

249
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,100
They actually are pretty noticeable

250
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,540
Yeah, you could you know

251
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,760
I thought it was interesting that there'd been some other sort of tests on like a hack bench other systems that the kernel uses

252
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,380
But it was actually, you know

253
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:24,080
Michael's benchmarks because they had tests that Linus at least felt were a little more real world that stood out and you know gave some

254
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,020
More attention to this issue. That's kind of a nice feather in his cap. Yeah

255
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:32,860
So here's how Torvalds originally summed up the issue with all of the interesting technical details in an email to Michael

256
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:39,980
Following the bisect report. Mr. Payne. Take it away. Let's say that a page is locked by some user doesn't matter

257
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,060
Why it might be IO it might just be for any number of other reasons that I need to get and make sure that this

258
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:51,620
Page stays consistent. I need a lock and while that's happening a number of other processes come in and want to lock it

259
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:57,100
What we do and what we did before that commit to is to queue them up in the hashed page

260
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,160
Wait queue and a flag is set on the page structure to say this page has waiters

261
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:08,900
We queue things up in order so that the oldest waiter is first that is meant to be about fairness

262
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:14,900
But you'll see later why that didn't actually used to matter look at Linus the storyteller here. I love it

263
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:21,580
Anyway, this thing didn't change fundamentally by that commit that you bisected the performance regression to yes

264
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,380
The commit changes that queuing but not in any fundamental significant way

265
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,820
The change is incidental to the big change, which is the what happens at wake up, right?

266
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,980
So that's what the big difference here is

267
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,700
It's that wake up behavior both before and after the basic trigger is the same

268
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,260
The process that holds the page lock does an unlock page call and as it unlocks

269
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:49,320
It also checks that do we have waiters bit on the page structure and goes off to process that wait list

270
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:55,040
And here's the big difference. We used to just wake things up on that wait list and that was it

271
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,140
We had various anti herd behavior. So we'd only wake up one exclusive waiter process

272
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,040
ie somebody who was doing a lock page

273
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:09,880
So we wouldn't have all these waiters suddenly wake up. But basically we just did oh, we've now released the page

274
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,680
So wake up the waiters that that's the simple end of it

275
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:20,120
Okay, that sounds obvious, but actually it has a rather non-obvious effect in particular. The page is now unlocked

276
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,520
And the waiters have been woken, but they aren't necessarily running

277
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,680
They have become run a bowl, but particularly under load

278
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,720
It's probably some time before those waiting processes actually get any CPU time in the meantime

279
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:44,920
All the processes that weren't on the wait queue and are runnable are free to come in and take that page lock again

280
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,920
Before the person that's supposed to take it has actually gotten CPU time

281
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,800
I see so I barely follow but it seems like you have this situation where it's waiting to wake up

282
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,620
It's waiting to wake up and then there's this wait queue. I

283
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,720
Don't really follow the technical details of this but it seems like they're on the case

284
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,860
Well, so it's it's kind of like this, you know, you're waiting for something, you know

285
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,120
Maybe it's next it's your turn to head up to the buffet buffet line. Okay, remember though. All right now I'm following

286
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,640
Yeah, all right, so you're in your queue

287
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,400
you're ready to go to the buffet line, but it takes some time to actually get from where you're waiting all the way over to

288
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,000
Where the buffet is and even though you've now got the magic spoon that you're gonna use to ladle all your food from the buffet

289
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,680
Okay, someone else can just come sneak in and since no one's currently using the buffet in between

290
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,360
Well, they'll just take your place

291
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:28,680
No

292
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,440
And then there's some like more, you know

293
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,360
There's more nuances here where then actually the person would notice that the page had been locked before they got there

294
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,880
You know the one who was supposed to get it

295
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,440
But then the way the kernel scheduled is they'd be they'd end up back at the end of the wait queue again

296
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,400
So they were at the front

297
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:42,680
Oh, no

298
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Get the resource had to go all the way to the back and because of this that you'd notice these big regressions where suddenly you have

299
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:54,680
These horrible latency spikes. So to round out this analogy, is it basically brought not to the front of the line?

300
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,960
Exactly, that's how you lose out on the pudding Wes is you get sent to the back of the line

301
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,960
That's super unfair. So Linus's change was aimed at trying to make this more fair

302
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,840
But unfortunately that can have bad places for throughput because while you might have a you know

303
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,960
Less maximum latency probably your minimum latency is going to be worse because it's it's more fair and at the same time

304
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,160
They've you know, this has been unfair for a long time

305
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:26,560
And so that just means sort of accidentally a lot of the other parts of the kernel have been built around that and so changing it

306
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Touches a lot of other subsystems

307
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,680
It's just peculiar why you see problems with Apache, but you also see a bunch of issues possibly in file system benchmarks

308
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,360
Yeah, Linus is he's trying some stuff. He's kind of ideating playing around with some solutions looking for feedback

309
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,720
So probably this will be something we see fixed sooner rather than later. Okay. Well, I'm glad they're on it

310
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,720
That's my summary of it. Go get them

311
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,320
So we don't have to

312
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,520
Linode.com

313
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:59,400
Unplugged this is an exclusive offer for Linux unplugged listener sign up going to Linode.com slash unplugged and get a $100

314
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,260
60-day credit towards new accounts Linode is simple cloud infrastructure that you can deploy in seconds

315
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,960
With shared hosting starting around $5 a month

316
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,460
But then they have a bunch of different options going from there with dedicated CPU plans GPU compute plans

317
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,840
You can use orchestration management if that's your preferred way to deploy systems

318
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,280
And of course, they have a one-click app market. I've been a little no customer for a couple of years and over that couple of

319
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,280
Years, I've witnessed this company

320
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:33,480
Just grow and evolve their product offering in a really clever way Linode.com slash unplugged

321
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,280
Of course, they have native SSD storage 40 gigabit connections coming into the machines

322
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,900
Industry leading fast processors and a new revamped cloud manager that's built on open source

323
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
How about that West?

324
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,720
I'm want me some and of course you get root access to your box

325
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:57,320
But the thing that I really like and I've never really taken advantage of this before is their command-line application

326
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,380
I just started using it about I don't know

327
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,160
It's been I don't know

328
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,960
It's less than a year and I find this to be a really easy way to send up files

329
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,560
To their object storage and then link them publicly to shut down machines

330
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,680
I get alerting and reporting on what's happening with my system

331
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,940
So like I saw over the weekend Alex was working on a self-hosted development machine that we're setting up

332
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,700
We use Linode to host our matrix server right now, and it just works fantastic

333
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,040
Sure does we also set up multiple accounts so the guys can log in and work on stuff as they need West paying can go

334
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,580
In there and set up a machine if he needs to just like Alex can

335
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,280
Super simple to set all of that up and with a hundred dollar credit

336
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:37,280
Just go over there set up a new account. You get $100 for 60 days just by going to Linode.com slash unplugged

337
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,280
There's a lot a lot you can learn a lot you can mess around with

338
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,480
I know that's what a lot of our listeners are doing with it right now

339
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,640
It's a great opportunity to support the show and get great cloud hosting for yourself from someone who's been around

340
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:56,120
For a long time. That's the other thing that's really great is they like a deep community member just about every event

341
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:02,520
I've ever gone to they've been a part of a booth there. They've been giving away swag even our humble Linux fest Northwest absolutely

342
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,680
So it's really awesome now that they're a sponsor Linode.com slash unplugged and a big

343
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:12,320
Thank you to Linode for sponsoring the unplugged program Linode.com slash unplugged Chris. I signed up for Linode just last week

344
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,680
Oh, yeah. Yeah, and what are you using it for? I am upskilling

345
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,640
Getting up to speed on some technologies in the sysadmin space that I haven't really played with

346
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,280
Since I've been out of that world. That's such a great use right? Oh, it's awesome

347
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,880
I think I hear that from a lot of our listeners that they use it for training. It's a great opportunity. Mm-hmm. Linode.com slash unplugged

348
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,960
Now Stuart and poppy are specifically joining us today because

349
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:44,040
They had a proposal. Maybe I'll let poppy tell the story that didn't quite get the traction

350
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:51,240
They were hoping for originally, but it's now kind of been opened up to the community to potentially run with last year the genome project

351
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,840
Announced that they were in collaboration with

352
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,760
Endless, they were doing a community engagement challenge and they pre announced it last year

353
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:08,800
To launch this year and the goal of it was really to come up with ways that could

354
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,440
Encourage more people to get involved in open-source software and

355
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,400
part of the motivation for that was endless stumped up some cash as prizes for

356
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,400
people who were successful in getting their projects through this

357
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,560
community engagement challenge process and

358
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,880
ever

359
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,880
interested in the idea of

360
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,760
Baking money. I I looked at this and thought huh? That might be interesting. I'm sure

361
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:44,640
Me and some pals can come up with some ideas that could get through this and maybe we'll make a little bit of beer money

362
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,680
on the side

363
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,960
so I mentioned it to my good friend Stuart and

364
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,800
We brainstormed for a bit about things that might be interesting and we came up with

365
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,400
This idea for something called cabin, which I'll let Stuart describe

366
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,800
But we we went through a process of creating

367
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
a proposal and writing

368
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
plan documents and

369
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,560
Submitting them almost at the last minute when the deadline for the first phase of this project

370
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:21,120
Came about but as you said, yes, we weren't successful in being selected for the first phase

371
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,200
Um, and those projects go through a filtering process for the further phases which will

372
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,240
Follow through the rest of this year and into next year

373
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:35,840
um, but we were keen for this to not be lost because we put some effort into creating this proposal and so we thought we'd

374
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,440
Publish it and so Stuart published it because he did the lion's share of the work on cabin and came up with the original idea

375
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,640
So he published it on his blog. I wonder if is it correct in my assumption that that's the case

376
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,960
So he published it on his blog. I wonder if is it correct in my assumption that this feels like it's informed by

377
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,720
Maybe a longer held philosophy that you've been developing for a while that we need more apps less distros

378
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,040
I know i've heard both you and poppy talk about that as it's

379
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,480
There needs to be maybe a better way to get apps onto linux. Is that what informed this or what was the nature?

380
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,240
As you say i've been developing a philosophy that we need more apps and fewer distros for years

381
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,320
Um, and a whole bunch of other things about how

382
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:23,300
Application development should work and the kinds of developers and the kinds of applications i'd like to see on our desktops

383
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,760
and

384
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,120
Cabin is an attempt to answer some but not all of those questions

385
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,360
so

386
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
To give you an example

387
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Think about your phone

388
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,520
I would say

389
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,280
about half of the applications I use on my phone

390
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,440
are

391
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,160
single shot apps, they're not um

392
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,400
big complicated apps which do a whole bunch of things they are

393
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,000
small single function things to

394
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,280
grab an image and crop it or to

395
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,320
uh grab an image and put a um

396
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,640
A speech bubble with some text on top of it little helpful tools. Yes, exactly

397
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
now

398
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,700
Ignoring the command line

399
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,280
On the linux desktop to a first approximation. We have none of them

400
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
We do not have tools like that

401
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,560
If you want to take an image and put a speech bubble with some words on top of it. You have to open up

402
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
You know again, right?

403
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,480
which is

404
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,260
a

405
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,280
Terrible thing or maybe you want to open up kryta or something like that instead whatever

406
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:43,120
but the point is these are full-fat fully complicated applications and

407
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,160
Building such things is hard using such things is hard

408
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
and frankly

409
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,240
It's one of the reasons why we've got 10 000 applications and android's got 10 million

410
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
and so

411
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,800
From my perspective the issue is not that people don't have ideas for these applications

412
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,720
it's that it's really difficult to build them because

413
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,320
our application development story

414
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,320
Is fragmented it's complicated. Uh, it's full of

415
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:28,080
Holy wars going back 20 years that nobody even remembers the original reasons for really? Yeah, what I wanted was

416
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,880
a way for

417
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,480
Someone who's not a particularly experienced programmer, but this is someone who's on who's using an elix desktop

418
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,640
Right. So they're already using those desktop. They have an idea for a small application that

419
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,520
They would like um those of you out there who are Linux desktop users and our programmers. So especially if you're web

420
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,880
Developers and our and programmers

421
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,920
You will probably have the experience of people, you know

422
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,920
Asking you to build tiny little applications to do things

423
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,920
so

424
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,560
I've built applications for people to calculate the angle that they should tilt the handlebars at on their on their new road bike

425
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,800
in order to um

426
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,680
Best fit their frame and i've built

427
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,840
Uh tiny little applications to count down to the next star wars film that they could put on their home screen

428
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:29,280
Excellent stuff like this that I think real people have this idea for applications all the time

429
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,560
And they should be able to follow the whole app process through from I have had an idea

430
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,560
To other people are now happily using that application. Well a couple of observations

431
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:48,000
It seems that I mean the reason we call them even apps now is this idea that they're smaller applications

432
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,160
It's not a full application. It's an app and they do smaller functions

433
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,480
but that's what you expect on a mobile device and I think

434
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,280
Those app stores have totally proven out that that model of application development

435
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,400
Not only works can but can actually be quite profitable for some developers

436
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,160
But when I also kind of look at the broader picture of what you're sort of proposing here

437
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
I kind of look over at the elementary os guys and I go, you know

438
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,280
Who does have apps kind of like that?

439
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,620
Is elementary os because they have created a consistent and clear story for the developers on how to create applications?

440
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,240
For their platform what they should look like and then how to distribute them to end users

441
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,640
Potentially with the possibility of making a profit and they've gotten some traction

442
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,520
It's not blowing the doors off and changing open source as we know it

443
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:35,600
But it could be in a way a sort of a test lab proving out what you're proposing here. Yes, absolutely

444
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:41,280
and the elementary people have exactly the right idea in my opinion and they're doing the right thing because

445
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:48,400
Most importantly what they're attempting to do is create a culture which values this kind of thing

446
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,760
And this is why in my opinion they've taken a fairly long step away from

447
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,440
Calling themselves a linux distribution exactly because they're not they don't want you to be running

448
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,460
Applications that run on linux generally on elementary. They don't want you to be running elementary apps on other distributions

449
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,020
And when you show up and say hey

450
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,380
Your desktop environment. How do I run it on?

451
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,500
Something else they'll say well suppose like this

452
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:22,100
But we don't really want you to do that because they want to build a culture where everything fits together

453
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,820
And that's really important and valuing this kind of application. I think is

454
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,820
a big thing

455
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,260
What cabin attempts to do is slightly different?

456
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,780
It is like the elementary model in that

457
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,020
Elementary have nominated the way you should build applications handed down on stone tablets

458
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:47,060
You should use their libraries their programming language. This is how you should publish them so on and so forth

459
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,540
And that's the right thing to do frankly

460
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,540
but

461
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,380
I think val is too hard for the kind of applications the kind of

462
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:02,360
Programmers that cabin is targeting. It's at least a big ask. Yeah, the elementary people have the disadvantage

463
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,920
by comparison with cabin

464
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,680
that they would like you if you want to sit down and build a

465
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,560
full-fat fully complicated application on elementary, they would absolutely welcome that and

466
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:20,760
Therefore their development environment and their development libraries and their development process has to be able to encompass that kind of application

467
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Cabin utterly does not

468
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:30,160
Cabin buys itself a bunch of ease of use by intentionally sacrificing breadth of scope

469
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,400
You cannot and would not ever be able to build

470
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:41,700
Anything more than these naughty little applications in cabin and that's fine. Is there a risk of creating?

471
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,640
To put it harshly trash apps that sort of clutter things up

472
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:50,840
Is there a risk of that do you think or does that sort of sort itself out that depends on your definition of trash?

473
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,680
and

474
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,640
frankly

475
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,600
Yeah, it would probably be a problem if we had a million applications and a bunch of them rubbish

476
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:05,000
But right having a million applications would be a good problem to have on desktop, right? Yeah that point

477
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,120
Yeah, there's a filtering issue there, which belongs to the app stores the snap store or whatever

478
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,120
About how you filter good applications from bad and it's a problem

479
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,400
The iOS is dealing with my Android is dealing with and the Windows is dealing with this the web's dealing with it

480
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,880
The reason we haven't had to deal with that promise would be have no apps to filter. This is absolutely true

481
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:33,400
Yeah, so what cabin attempts to do is provide a programming environment that someone relatively new to programming can understand

482
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,200
But without hiding the idea that applications are built with code

483
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,600
So it's not a snap some jigsaw pieces together thing

484
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,140
I'm being terribly made to things like scratch here, but you can actually build really cool stuff with

485
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:51,180
But I didn't want to hide the idea that this is still fundamentally

486
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,900
Programming. Hmm, right if you're not interested in programming, you shouldn't be trying to build applications

487
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,420
You can't hide that away forever and any time you do try and hide it away

488
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,420
What happens is people discover it and pleasantly halfway through and then suddenly don't understand things

489
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:10,140
so you don't want to pull the rug out from under people when they're attempting to develop your applications, but

490
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,900
Cabin apps are built so that they're essentially compiled

491
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,620
Into Python and GTK and it doesn't hide that

492
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:25,560
So the idea is if you ever get to the point where you're hitting the limit of what could be built in a cabin application

493
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,820
You've then learned enough about programming that you can take a peek under the covers and go. Ah

494
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,260
what this is is a simplified interface to a

495
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:37,420
More powerful things and now I'm ready to learn the more powerful thing

496
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,660
Yeah, and that's often what you know gives people a chance to start and begin to build something

497
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,580
So steward you and hope we have put this out to the world

498
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:53,620
What would success in a scenario like this kind of look like because realistically it must be some form of adoption or inspiration

499
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,020
I would like someone to pick it up and and

500
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,940
prototype

501
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,940
What we?

502
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:05,660
Envisaged it to look like with some guidance, you know, we'd be happy to help but you know

503
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:12,300
we're both busy and it's not something we could commit full-time to but we want we didn't want the the

504
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,780
proposal to die in

505
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:22,260
And a file we uploaded to a contest that we didn't succeed at we didn't want it to just die there

506
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,180
So we want that we thought it had worth and so

507
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:31,500
success would be if someone you know started hacking on something if they had a bit of time and they had some time to hack

508
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,260
On it and you know get it bootstrapped, you know with guidance

509
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:41,500
we'd love to like help as a normal open source project like anything else and you know future success would be

510
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:47,800
People created little apps with it. That would be a measure of success for sure. Sure. Yeah, absolutely

511
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:55,020
There are a half dozen ideas that cabin in bodies in my opinion. One of them is

512
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,100
the thing about

513
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,220
helping

514
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,340
people with ideas transition them into applications without

515
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:08,380
Throwing the world of programming at them a second one is that it's a stepping stone to more complicated things when you're ready for them

516
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,260
a third one is

517
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,420
the idea, um

518
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,420
If you look at the cabin specification

519
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:20,780
Uh, you'll see that you've got your application and your code on show at all times changing one

520
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,500
Changes the other in lockstep in concert

521
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,820
Which is an idea from brett vector and I think that's a really important way

522
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,260
to

523
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,180
Develop things and people don't currently have it fourth idea

524
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:38,780
Building an application is considerably more than just writing the source code

525
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:45,340
Making sure that your application has a description an icon a tagline a title

526
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,620
that it's packaged up and uploaded to a

527
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,180
Software store that it's available in that software store and you can push new versions to it

528
00:40:53,180 --> 00:41:00,060
That the community can gather around the application and feed feedback back to you

529
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:06,940
All of that stuff is just as important as the source code and it's shamefully slighted by

530
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:12,780
most of our development environments at the moment unless you're using some kind of

531
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,800
immensely complicated

532
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,060
full bore ide like

533
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,940
Android studio is or xcode is q creator does some of this but not a lot of it

534
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:29,260
And a lot of that is because those environments have to be able to cope with a building the most complicated applications on earth

535
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,820
um, including themselves and

536
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,340
be

537
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:38,460
To be swappable out in the kinds of applications. They can build cabins allowed to just say

538
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,900
This is the kind of application it builds. This is where it publishes it

539
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:47,040
We make that easy and you can't switch it out for publishing different kinds of applications

540
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
And from my point of view

541
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,020
If someone were to be inspired by those ideas

542
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,180
But build something quite different to cabin, but it still met all those requirements

543
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,160
I consider that very successful. Obviously the way I think you should meet those requirements is cabin why we spect it

544
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,320
Right, of course

545
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:12,320
But that would be that would be a benchmark of success right the idea getting propagated. Yes, the the idea that

546
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,640
people should be able to build an application get it into the hands of

547
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:22,480
Other users who can then enjoy it build a community around it feed back to you about it

548
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,640
learn

549
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,300
Maybe how to start programming applications themselves

550
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,000
that to me is

551
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,480
A thing that we should be aiming for on our desktop. We're not currently doing it

552
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,000
So if someone is inspired to do that, i'm happy

553
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,400
I also think another key aspect of this is the concept of redefining. What is an application worth time?

554
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,280
to develop and deploy on linux

555
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:54,800
and I look at my usage on and off over the good old years and I used to have plasmoids loaded up on

556
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:01,060
My plasma desktop which would show me different information and pull in different feeds, which are essentially tiny little qml applications

557
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,120
And same with gk realm and of course there was other other systems before then where i've had small little

558
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:12,800
Useful contained applications and there's just never been something that's broader and higher level for it

559
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,880
And I I really think it does have some interesting ideas that would i'd love to maybe even just see people discuss at the upcoming

560
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,480
linux application summit

561
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,360
That could be a good place for something like this to get talked about, you know

562
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,160
So is there anything really further after this guys or is this kind of it's out there for the world now and

563
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,480
People are welcome to come see it

564
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,360
The goal was to get the ideas out there because we as uh, as far as he says we spent a while

565
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,120
Putting this together and it seemed a shame to just have it

566
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,520
Quietly die on a hard drive somewhere could make for a good talk. Yeah, if someone wanted to talk about it, but um

567
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,920
yeah, it's not something I could afford to devote a bunch of

568
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,160
Uh my free time to because i've already got a zillion free time projects

569
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,280
Uh, if someone wants to come in with a checkbook and pay me to build it i'll listen because then it's paid time

570
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,680
which i've got more of but

571
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,680
But yeah, I think um

572
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,080
From my point of view it's out there and if someone were to want to pick it up

573
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,040
I'm, sure we'd be happy to talk to them about it. I don't I suspect I don't would agree 100. Yes

574
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,480
Yeah, and I I just like us thinking about this stuff if nothing else

575
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,800
It's a good thing for us to it's a good headspace for us to be in

576
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,160
Thanks for coming on on your sunday gentlemen and chatting with us about it

577
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,620
It's an interesting idea. Of course. We'll have links to it all in the in the show notes at linux unplugged.com

578
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:33,860
Unplugged.com slash three seven one seven one nice

579
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,940
I want to say thank you to cloud guru for sponsoring this episode of unplugged

580
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,700
You know, we talk about one of the best ways to learn is by actually doing

581
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:50,820
The cloud guru now includes cloud playground for azure aws or google cloud platform sandbox as you get on there

582
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,820
You log in you have a system

583
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,460
And it's on their dime not yours. I like that

584
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,580
Um, and it's a great way to learn by actually doing it

585
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,100
Of course, then there's a bunch of other resources. You can fall back on as well

586
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:06,740
It's just one click to a fast fresh disposable cloud environment at your fingertips

587
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:11,140
There's really no better way to learn is there and then you have the confidence to actually go test

588
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,140
Or even better

589
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:19,540
Do the job in the real world just go to a cloud guru.com and thanks to cloud guru for sponsoring the unplugged program

590
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,020
How about some feedback? Mr. Payne?

591
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,020
Um

592
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:29,540
So last week we had our bugathon after the show and pretty happy with the way it went some lessons learned but overall

593
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,660
We got great tips on how to make a bug report that was useful for developers. That's awesome

594
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,980
I earned my first fedora badge sure did that's pretty cool

595
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,900
And then also there was just a lot of good information about just general troubleshooting

596
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:47,060
Throughout and there was a couple of times we thought we had found ourselves quite the bug

597
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,180
But then you know reproducing the process and working through it. We kind of worked it out

598
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,180
Sometimes it's just ui inconsistencies

599
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,140
It was really a lot of fun. It was and

600
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:02,260
Learn some stuff. So I decided to make it available to our unplugged core contributors. You just have to go sign in

601
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:06,020
So if you go to unplugged core.com, there's a little sign in button there

602
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,020
They make it really small because it's the sign up page

603
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,780
But if you you click the little sign in button then go to your downloads area the whole thing's available for download

604
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:16,020
And I actually think it's worthwhile even if you're not a fedora user or interested in butter fs

605
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:22,100
To hear the guys talk about you know what they need in a bug report and how the processes you got to go through

606
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:26,200
And some of the some of the little nuances that carl and neil went into particularly

607
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,940
When we actually came to the point of okay i'm about to create this bug report. Here's my questions

608
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,100
Oh, well for that you need to know

609
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:32,820
I've really

610
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:36,900
Little edge case shone a lot of light on the yeah the intricacies of keeping track of all this stuff

611
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,560
And how do you actually make it actionable and test methodology?

612
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,020
So it's available for the core contributors right now

613
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:47,540
and I think maybe you know, maybe in the in the future we'll probably release it in the main feed like if we

614
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,460
Like if we get sick or something need a week off

615
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:54,020
but in the meantime, it's available for the core contributors right now at unplugged core.com and

616
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,100
The other thing that's really cool about the bugathon is we're going to keep the channel going in matrix

617
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:58,980
so

618
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,220
Developers are welcome to join us in there to seek people to help them test their projects if that

619
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,300
Is a benefit to your project if you are understaffed when it comes to testing

620
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:10,500
We'll have people that are able and willing in our bugathon matrix room

621
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,780
Uh, but additionally what was kind of neat is even people who couldn't attend live

622
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,140
Ended up doing it on their own. So i've been hearing from people throughout the week

623
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:21,540
Oh great about them testing it and uh that I really like I didn't really think about that

624
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:26,340
But that's a neat knock-on effect is even the download audience who didn't attend live could never make it live

625
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,500
Can still help us with this, right?

626
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,340
And so that's something I think I want to definitely take advantage of in the future for the next project we do this for

627
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:35,140
I think we're gonna do it again. Can I also just say uh seems like

628
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:40,340
Seems like finora 33 shaping up to be quite a release. I mean hardly any bugs at all so far

629
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:45,460
I mean, we really you know, we really put it through its paces. I uh, did a live conversion to butter fs

630
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:51,220
That was fun, which was successful but did teach us a couple of things that we'll we'll try to cover in our uh,

631
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,140
In our review in the future a couple of going indie updates

632
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,620
I figure keep everybody in the loop on what's going on with jb

633
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:02,740
Now you'll see a new logo rolling out to the shows and to the website a little updated logo

634
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:07,700
I I don't know if this is our permanent logo or if this is like get us to linux fest

635
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:13,060
I haven't really decided yet. I'm sitting with it and I kind of just like the simplicity of it

636
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,340
so if you haven't seen it yet, it'll be showing up like in the mp3 art and

637
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,060
On the feeds and on the website so you can check that out

638
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,740
Lots of work going on behind the scenes to build up the pipeline for the membership feats

639
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:26,660
Thank you specifically to you and drew for working super hard on that. I really appreciate it

640
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,580
So that's been getting rolled out. We're still making tweaks to some of that and working out a pipeline

641
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:35,460
Uh, you know a lot of times we start manual processes a lot of times they fall on west's shoulders

642
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:41,060
So I really appreciate you doing the picking up the slack there and then we develop them into an automated process

643
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,500
Exactly, uh, you know, so first the human the human process and then it's like you learn it, right?

644
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,860
You understand what has to be done and then you just replace it with bits of automation

645
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,060
Right. Otherwise we wouldn't I mean we got to answer a lot of questions of how are we actually doing this?

646
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:59,860
Yeah, I really love that you said wes and me when really my whole thing with it is hey wes

647
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,860
Are you handling the ad free feed this week?

648
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:08,420
That's like the extent of it. Yeah, you can find it on our on our next cloud. Yeah, go get the file you do it

649
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,020
Go here. Yeah. Yeah

650
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,900
Uh, and so the other thing I want to be clear about that is i'm it's like a

651
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,140
It's an ad it's limited ads

652
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,100
There is a couple of short ads in there that are contractually obligated

653
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:22,340
But we're going to start cutting out the membership plug itself from that version of the show

654
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,220
And future ad contracts won't be included in that show

655
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:30,180
Uh right now it's it's it's probably technically slightly a shorter show too. I'd imagine I guess

656
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,620
but it's uh

657
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:35,540
It's coming along and it's really been a team effort and it's been also kind of like

658
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,180
I think we're all kind of motivated because there's been a great community response. It's been really awesome to see

659
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:45,860
Um, and then we're also still taking your ideas for linux prepper, which is in the matrix be prepared in layers

660
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,900
And what are those layers? What about with what if your cloud service goes out?

661
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:53,620
What if your main rig goes out just can't boot that day? What if you got a bug out?

662
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:58,820
How do you prep as a linux user join us in the new matrix room and check for the linux prepper room?

663
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,140
in particular and

664
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,580
We'll get a conversation that'll eventually turn into show content

665
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:08,580
see if we were thinking ahead we would have had a linux powered smoke filtration system set up already

666
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:13,700
No kidding. No kidding. All right. So, uh five creative you think you think that's how you say it five

667
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:21,620
five creative, uh writes in about dev ed dev ide's he says hey guys longtime listener first time collaborator

668
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:28,020
Collaborator dirty collaborator. I thought it might be a cool thing to do something similar to the podcatcher playoff

669
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,660
But for ide's and editors, oh

670
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,420
Nobody has an opinion on editors, right? Of course not

671
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:39,620
He says i've been a longtime user of komodo ide namely for its integrated ssh support

672
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:44,820
I've gone all into linux and I no longer require that feature with built-in ssh support in the os

673
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:50,340
I just received my pinebook pro and thought it would be great to ask around for a lightweight editor

674
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:55,140
I know of many but which ones do people love thanks for the hard work you put into the podcast

675
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,940
And he also says that ubuntu podcast is great

676
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:02,420
It is doesn't actually say that but we do think that and that bad voltage podcast, right?

677
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,420
He says that in there too. He just put that in there

678
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,980
I shouldn't give him edit access. I know weird, right?

679
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,860
Um, so does anybody have a text editor that's lightweight, you know

680
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:16,180
We often on this show will joke about nano being the one in true text editor, but there's others out there

681
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,260
Does anybody have one they want to give a little love to?

682
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:21,700
I use four of them on a daily basis. Wait, wait

683
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,220
Four, all right, walk me through this i'm gonna brace myself here

684
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:31,380
Okay, so I use vim primarily as one does as one does because the church of him is awesome

685
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:36,020
But sometimes I need a graphical text editor because you know, sometimes I like to use a scroll wheel of my mouse

686
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,140
You know use like the standard keyboard shortcuts and all that like a gentleman

687
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,460
So I use mousepad because that's installed on all my systems on my workstation

688
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:50,340
I have vs code and and another one i've been playing around with called cocoon, which is like vim but different cocoon

689
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:54,900
Okay, and don't think I didn't just notice that you just cash drop that you're an xfce user. I totally caught that

690
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,980
Uh, no, actually i'm not using a xfce

691
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,820
Really? Oh, but you're using mousepad. What kind of animal are you?

692
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,620
A savage animal that's the kind

693
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,620
mix and match

694
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:09,700
And mousepad is actually a pretty nice lightweight gooey editor. Yeah, it's pretty nice lightweight

695
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:15,300
It does not actually pull in the xfce dependencies. So it's actually pretty well standalone

696
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:20,260
All right, so I don't see why you wouldn't use mousepad outside of xfce. Yeah, that's fair

697
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:25,380
Yeah, definitely. One of the chromium based ones isn't going to be a list isn't going to be a candidate for this one

698
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:31,460
Is it anybody else have a graphical one? It's tricky. Well, you know some folks really like sublime text

699
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:35,540
You know, there's a stalwart contingent there. Yeah me first off

700
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:42,740
Yeah, they're better too another vote for sublime, okay sublime's wonderful, although i've got i've got terribly um, uh

701
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:48,980
Unassuming requirements for the text editor. I spent half my life in it basically has to start up quickly

702
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:56,500
It has to have multiple curses syntax highlighting and it must never ever ever ever lose a file

703
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:59,940
Even files i've never saved never given a name to

704
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:06,500
If I start typing into a file and then I yank the power socket out of the back of my machine and then plug it

705
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,980
Back in again. It'll still be there in sublime when I start up and that's why I can't switch way to it

706
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:17,460
Switch way to anything else because nothing else will guarantee that so i'm now used to doing that

707
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:22,100
Half the files i've got open in sublime. I've got I think six sublime windows open at the moment

708
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:27,700
Each of which have got about 10 or 15 tabs in them and half of those have never been saved

709
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,700
And they're still there across reboots

710
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,860
They're actually across upgrading the operating system

711
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:41,460
It's magic magic sublime voodoo. I love it's the best just use sublime for everything. It's brilliant

712
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:48,020
I have to say I wrote years of consulting notes in sublime and it never ever failed me

713
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:54,420
And it always relaunched with my notes right where I left them even massive multi-month documents

714
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:58,020
documents I do not use it anymore because um

715
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:04,260
I've just switched over to vs code i'm one of those people but I I love it and it is definitely of the graphical

716
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:08,900
Nice high-end text editors. It's definitely one of the quickest. It's not chromium based and

717
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:13,700
It's uh, it's pretty been around for quite some time too. You know, it's not going anywhere

718
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,900
Battle tested casual chemist, which is one of my favorite names, uh writes in

719
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,180
This is funny because you can tell where people are at in the back catalog

720
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:27,300
Because when they get to the next cloud episode we did they go. Holy crap. I got to write these guys. What are they doing?

721
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,460
Don't worry. We're working on it. But he says hello listening for a few years, although i'm a few months behind

722
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:36,420
Yep, see told you he said i've just heard of 362 on linux unplugged the hidden cost of next club. Yep

723
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:42,680
That's totally that's totally fair casual chemists. A lot of people are still getting there. I'm also up to episode 21 of self-hosted

724
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,060
Uh, he loves that show apparently awesome

725
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,340
Good job new episode just came out where I compare sync thing to next cloud

726
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,020
Which was something we were going to do in the show

727
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,620
but we actually ended up cutting it for time and then I had more experience with it and so

728
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:58,660
I'm trying to convince my co-host alex to give sync thing and go you're working there. Yeah, i'm working it

729
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:03,460
Yeah, i'm working it. So casual chemist goes on he says I was surprised that y'all pay 350 a month

730
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:09,380
That's 350 a month for next cloud storage. I was surprised but then when you broke it down I was less shocked

731
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:15,940
However, have you considered using backblaze or wasabi instead of digital ocean's object storage? They're both s3 compatible

732
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,580
That's true. And then he gives the price currently of backblaze

733
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:23,780
And he says by the way, I want to give a shout out to my favorite backup solution the love of my life

734
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,940
Boy that's somebody loves a backup solution when it has all your data in its hands a borg backup

735
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:35,400
Wow, which we've talked a little bit on the show before and it just recently stumbled across a project called borg-o-matic

736
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:42,660
Which uses some yaml config to automate borg backups. There you go. What's one more yaml file? That's a winner. Um, yeah, so

737
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,900
We've kind of taken a different approach. This has been a common suggestion

738
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,460
It's just essentially swapping out the backend cloud storage

739
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:56,580
We're kind of thinking about doing more of a primary storage on site here at the studio kind of thing because we do have a nas

740
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:57,300
here

741
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:01,220
And then keeping the raw editing files up on the cloud

742
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:06,340
So that way they're fast and easy to move around and quick for remote host upload and quick for remote editors to download

743
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,060
But keeping that tighter than we have in the past, you know

744
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,620
Maybe keeping it close to like 50 gigs or something, right?

745
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,140
Right just managing the hot stuff that you know needs to be up there and then anything else

746
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:19,460
We can move it to long-term storage. Yeah, and we'll probably in this process

747
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,860
We're probably going to migrate the server over to the node

748
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:26,500
We're probably going to move the domain over and then we're going to have to migrate a bunch of the data

749
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,980
Down to the studio. Yes. Yeah

750
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:35,700
And then we might take advantage maybe maybe not of federating the two next cloud instances, although

751
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:41,540
I'm kind of tempted to keep them separate, you know, one's like an archive and one is current working projects

752
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:47,380
And we're using them quite differently. Yeah, exactly one is so we can retrieve something as an asset that we might need

753
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:52,740
A year down the road and one of them is for collaborating with co-hosts and remote hosts and editors

754
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:57,780
They're kind of two different systems anyways, right and it's just going to be pulling in the one direction

755
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,740
So we're going to kind of we're thinking cut it down that line

756
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,620
And that's where the bulk of the storage is going to be now is at the studio

757
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:08,180
Which means maybe you know, maybe I end up needing to buy disk sooner for the nas down here than I planned

758
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:13,380
But that still will be a little bit out. We'll be really uh, you know getting a use out of the old large server

759
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:19,140
I know and it has survived yet another summer where there's been no air conditioning in that garage

760
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,900
and

761
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,420
I'm not joking

762
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:29,460
This year the the vent for the water heater broke and so the water heater was just venting into the garage

763
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:35,780
Right at the server kind of actually on the same wall as the server at least but you know, keep static electricity down

764
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,540
Um

765
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,820
So, I mean that server not only is put up with like

766
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:45,380
90 degree. I mean it's it's hot in there and then I I pull a car in there that's been driving

767
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:51,060
Right, so it's got a hot engine and hot metal surface and then I park it in there and that's got to raise the ambient temperature

768
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:54,980
Oh, yeah, and then the hot water heater which we don't use a lot of hot water at the studio

769
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:00,340
But it still keeps it heated up, right? So that's venting. I mean, it's unbelievable that what that server has survived

770
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,540
You know, we do sell colo here, but you probably don't want it

771
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,020
Yeah, jupiter broadcasting's discount hosting

772
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:14,580
Yeah, our prices are so low well and not to mention the fact that we abuse the hell out of it for fun and profit

773
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:22,580
Yes, that's true too live on the air for poor server. It really has put up with a lot. All right. Let's talk about cozy

774
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:26,900
Uh cozy is a modern audiobook player

775
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:34,820
For your gnu slash linux desktop and it's designed to make it super comfy kumskies and cozy to browse your library

776
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,660
It it's sort of like plex for audiobooks, but it's a local application

777
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:44,580
It's pretty sharp too. It does it's I mean if you if you're the gtk persuasion, which I often am

778
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:50,740
Um, even even on my plasma desktop. I still I still like gtk up design. You know, it's assuming simple clean

779
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:55,540
I'm that guy but it has sleep timers, which is my favorite for audiobooks

780
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:00,180
Audiobooks and yes, it remembers your playback position. It has offline mode, of course

781
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:05,700
So you can keep uh your uh your books locally and then there's you know

782
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:09,780
There's other things out there too to help with that. I think it's I think it's called open audible

783
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,260
Are you familiar with have we talked about that before? No, I don't think so

784
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,660
Yeah, I mean I might have to do a little live googling on the show

785
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:18,500
But if you're an audible customer check out open audible and then you could use something like cozy

786
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:21,220
to uh import all of those

787
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:24,740
So it's kind of a nice combination. It seems like it's not biting too much off either, you know

788
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,940
It's not this like crazy complicated ebook managing monster

789
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:33,060
It's really just like a clean way to read your ebooks and what they have done, you know, it's been well integrated

790
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:36,420
It's got you know, media player controls on your desktop if your desktop has that

791
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,780
It seems very usable. We'll have a link to that in the show notes

792
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,420
And we already got a whole bunch of really good nice picks

793
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:46,820
Can I uh, can I give a book suggestion for somebody to listen to on cozy totally?

794
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,780
Uh, I'd recommend going to check out the strain

795
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:57,300
It's kind of a vampire book written by guillermo d'arturo and chuck hogan and it is narrated by none other

796
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:02,420
Than ron perlman, you know who i've been trying to find books narrated by you're gonna i'm such a dork

797
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,060
Captain janeway kate monger anything

798
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:11,860
You get a good book by her. I found a voyager book so that kind of worked but yeah, yeah good pick

799
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:12,180
All right

800
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:16,260

Didn't actually hold up quite as much for me
