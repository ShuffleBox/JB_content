1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
I totally don't mean to be like a Chrome hipster but I am really getting to the point where

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,840
it feels like Chrome is way too big.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,000
It's getting – there's way too much stuff and Google doesn't seem to be slowing down

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
at all.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,880
Like they're adding in payments, APIs to the desktop browser in Chrome 60.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,200
They are making it – they're re-engineering the way that it handles your mouse cursor

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,720
and they're just – they're doing a lot of improvements so I got to give them credit.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,880
Like it's making steady progress but it's getting a little ridiculous as to the amount

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,440
of things that Chrome can do and it's – the versioning is just getting out of control.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,880
It's like version 60 is the new beta.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,240
It's nuts and not that Firefox is too much better.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,520
As we record, they just released version 54 this morning but this is what's awesome

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,280
about 54 and maybe Wes, maybe – I know you were joking about switching back to Firefox

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:53,340
but this could be it here because they're bringing the multiple process system to other

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,920
operating systems besides Windows.

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
Hey, that's exciting.

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
Yeah.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
So it's like –

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
I have been waiting for that.

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
Me too.

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
Me too.

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
Me too very much.

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,440
So it's like I'm looking at – while I'm looking at Chrome right now and I'm going

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,560
– there's some extensions like template is just such an awesome extension for composing

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
our show notes.

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
It's so great.

27
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
What does it do?

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,560
Game changer.

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
It's a game changer.

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
I don't know about this.

31
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
I'm not hip.

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,560
It's an extension that lets me – so you see – so take this paragraph right here.

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,160
You got a title that's probably like a header 5 maybe or a header 4.

34
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,560
It's probably a header 3 or 4.

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,680
Then you have a paragraph here that has some links in it.

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,420
It looks like it has two separate links and what I can do which is really great is I can

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,640
highlight this text on this webpage.

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
I can right click.

39
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,800
Everybody is going to steal this from me now.

40
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,800
I can go to template and then I can say quote and link and what's great about it is – so

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,200
if I go to text edit here – not test edit but if I go to text edit, what it's produced

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,440
for me is simple, easy, clean markdown where it's given me a markdown link for the URL.

43
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,800
It grabs the title of the website.

44
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
That's handy.

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,560
It looks like it was a header 2 and so it doesn't actually comment a header 2 ironically

46
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,920
but if say there wasn't a header there, it would put the text I selected in a markdown

47
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,720
block quote and then it does reference links for all the URLs in that.

48
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
That's neat.

49
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
Yeah.

50
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,320
If you're someone who does this 200 times a day, you can imagine how nice it is to not

51
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
have to –

52
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Yeah.

53
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,320
Absolutely.

54
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,320
Yeah.

55
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
I mean it's a huge part of what I'm doing for all of our show research all the time

56
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,320
for all the shows every single day and it is so handy especially like when we're on

57
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,080
the air and say Aiki says something that's like really something I want to cite in the

58
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,680
show notes like yeah, go grab this thing here or here's the post where he talks about

59
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
this.

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,200
I can quickly while I have it up on my screen, grab that text and go drop it –

61
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,240
It's already ready for –

62
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,440
Right in the doc and then it goes out as part of the show notes.

63
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Browser handy.

64
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
So I love those things.

65
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
No converting.

66
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
No messing.

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,440
But I bet you somebody out there in the audience could come up with a way that's not a browser

68
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,120
extension because that's what I'm going for here is let's just get off the browser extension

69
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,000
sauce completely and come up with other methods to do that to other ways to process text.

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now I don't know exactly.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It would have to be probably something that can read my clipboard because I could copy

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,080
it into my clipboard and then something that could read my clipboard and output structured

73
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,560
markdown for me would really be all I need and then I could start switching to Firefox,

74
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,560
I could do gnome web, I mean it really wouldn't matter at that point.

75
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,560
And I think that's the direction to go and once I replace some of these things I can

76
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,240
only do in my browser with other tools that are just more operating system based then

77
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,900
I think I'm going to go back to Firefox which should probably be a couple of releases down

78
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,360
the road where this stuff's landing.

79
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,320
It could be one big kumbaya, Wes.

80
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,320
Oh, kumbaya.

81
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:53,000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 201 for June 13th, 2017.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,440
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly talk show that has a show so good this week we

83
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,800
probably should have made it our 200th episode.

84
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
My name is Chris.

85
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
My name is Wes.

86
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,920
You know what, Wes, sometimes you roll the dice and you have a 200th episode where nothing

87
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,820
happens and then the next week it's like oh damn, now that's the party.

88
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,960
So I'm really excited because we've got some great follow up stories of things we've talked

89
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,600
about recently in the show just a couple of weeks ago.

90
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,700
A project that I think doesn't get enough attention has a new release.

91
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,840
Then we'll get into a couple of news stories that we haven't talked about, do a deep dive

92
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,560
into Fedora's, or I guess Red Hat's cockpit, the security of it, some interesting choices

93
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
they've made.

94
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,540
We'll discuss the new Fedora 26 beta as well.

95
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,540
And then the internet's friend, Ikey, that's what I'm calling him now, everyone's favorite

96
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:44,080
distro maker, joins us to discuss his big news and the resulting huge news for Solus

97
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
users.

98
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,160
And then I'm really happy to announce that something that was locked down to Windows

99
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,040
users and proprietary systems will be opened up to all of us.

100
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
And it was opened up in such a big way.

101
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,240
And then I was so impressed by the project I did a little deep diving and discovered,

102
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,520
there it is, discovered the source of something magical.

103
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,320
Maybe I'm overselling it a bit, but I can tell you it's better than a keyboard.

104
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,160
If Apple can call a keyboard magical, I'm definitely calling...

105
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,280
Can and does.

106
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,840
Yeah, they can and do currently.

107
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,440
I'm calling this story magical.

108
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,960
And that's more magic than their magic.

109
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
So I think it holds up.

110
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
I think it holds up.

111
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,680
A lot of good stuff to get into, a lot of fun stuff, and we have ourselves, as always,

112
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,480
a traditional virtual log.

113
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,600
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

114
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Time appropriate greetings.

115
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Hello.

116
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Hello.

117
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Good day.

118
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Hello.

119
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Howdy.

120
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Hi.

121
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Hello.

122
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Hello.

123
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Howdy.

124
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
We'll let them be the judge of if you're overselling this or not.

125
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
You think so?

126
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Mm-hmm.

127
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
They were so quiet.

128
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
They did so good.

129
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I don't know if you heard-

130
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Not a peep.

131
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,160
I paused right before I introduced them because I had to double check the soundbar.

132
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,520
I looked over and I'm like, shit, I didn't mute them.

133
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,800
I usually mute them, but we were just shooting the shit before the show, and so I muted you

134
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:06,520
and Hai, left them unmuted during the intro, and during that whole set up of the show,

135
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,320
and none of you guys screwed it up.

136
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
That is-

137
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
We love you.

138
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,440
Really, really, best, best audience in podcasting.

139
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,560
I swear to God, it is so amazing.

140
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,840
You guys are literally more professional than me today.

141
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
It's-

142
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
By far.

143
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Job well done.

144
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,840
Thank you, Firefox, that I lost my head.

145
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
Let's start with some follow-up.

146
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,320
The big Gnome survey that Joey published on OMG Ubuntu, I didn't know when we were going

147
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,120
to... I actually didn't know if we would hear the results.

148
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Could be months.

149
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
Sometimes those things don't...

150
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,840
Maybe we'll find out when they ship the LTS version of these.

151
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
This is what you wanted.

152
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
But no.

153
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,640
No, the results are in, and I don't know.

154
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,520
I don't find them to be too shabby, but I would say overall, my reading of Joey's post

155
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,400
on OMG Ubuntu was a little disappointed.

156
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,620
He was like, well, a little uncommitted on some of this stuff, but check out some of

157
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,560
these numbers, and congrats to OMG Ubuntu for pulling this all in.

158
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
Can you hear that?

159
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Yeah, you're squeaking.

160
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
That's my chair.

161
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
You're so squeaky.

162
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,700
I've got to get some ranch hand on that thing.

163
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,700
Ranch hand, Wes.

164
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,700
That's better than WD-40.

165
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,120
Get some ranch hand.

166
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,460
So a massive 18,330 people took part in the survey.

167
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,280
There were eight questions, if you recall.

168
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,160
They were all optional, and they just asked people to rate how useful they considered

169
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,000
various GNOME extensions on a scale of one to five, one being not useful and a fiver

170
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,600
being very useful.

171
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,320
The first question was about the Dash to Dock extension, and 17,948 people participated

172
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:41,240
in that question, and 80% of them, Wes, rated Dash to Dock as a three, four, or five.

173
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,800
Eighty percent of people thought at least it was useful.

174
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,880
And this is where I think Joey's maybe a slight disappointment seems to come through to me,

175
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,080
and I don't mean to put words into his mouth.

176
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,920
I might be misreading this, but he says, Dash to Dock's pop, this is, he said it seems like

177
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,200
a slam dunk to him, so Canonical responds, Dash to Dock's popularity doesn't necessarily

178
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,520
mean we should ship Dash to Dock as an extension by default, but rather it shows us our users

179
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,000
would like the Dock to be visible at all times or shown hidden automatically, as opposed

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,720
to only shown in the activities view.

181
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,720
He says that sounds uncommittable by Canonical, and sounds like it almost, like their intention

182
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,880
is to persuade Gnome upstream to add Dash to Dock functionality in.

183
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
Interesting.

184
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,080
Which sounds like the beginnings of a rift.

185
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,140
You know, I mean, that's how things start.

186
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:31,320
We got this great idea for notifications, or the way system tray icons should be handled.

187
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,120
Hey, here's some suggestions in code, what do you think?

188
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,680
And Gnome says, well, we've already got that figured out, thanks though.

189
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah, I guess it all depends on how the upstream would take it, right?

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,880
Would you want Dash to Dock features built into Gnome?

191
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Would you use that?

192
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Absolutely.

193
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,400
Yeah, I mean, I have it on every Gnome system.

194
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:56,000
I find, I'm not a big fan of hidden UI elements to begin with, especially for anybody who's

195
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
using a system for a first time expert user or total noob.

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,280
When you rely on certain incantations, aka gestures, or putting your mouse in a certain

197
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,620
corner to get the menu, or knowing that there's a particular button on your keyboard that

198
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,320
you should press to activate that menu, I think you're expecting too much from the end

199
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
user.

200
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,920
They sit down in front of most interfaces in their life, and like say their car, or

201
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,240
a drill, or a microwave, and everything's laid out in front of them, and then it's up

202
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,560
to them to deduce how to operate that machinery, and their intelligence will either make them

203
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,960
more successful or less successful.

204
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,220
But when you completely hide the interface from them, there's literally nothing for them

205
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,220
to grok.

206
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,880
There's nothing for them to intuit from it.

207
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,280
There's nothing for them to instinctually poke at.

208
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,600
And so they either have to know, well, on a lot of systems, if I flick up from the bottom,

209
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,480
or I know that on Windows, if I press this key, it brings up the start menu, which most

210
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
users don't know.

211
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,540
I find it to be poor UI design.

212
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,000
So yes, to me, dash to dock is a must.

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,120
Just like I also agree with 90% of the respondents who said that top icons is useful, 90% of

214
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,600
the respondents say, yeah, we want top icons.

215
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,820
And I think, again, this is another one of those, you have this little nubbin that likes

216
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,960
to sit there and flatulate down in the corner of your GNOME desktop.

217
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,280
And it's irritating as fuck, especially when you have a full screen application, which,

218
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,440
by the way, GNOME encourages you to use.

219
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,920
So anytime you're interacting with the UI down there, you have this stupid little thing

220
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,120
flatulating down there.

221
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,120
Nobody likes it.

222
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,180
Plus, again, it's hidden UI.

223
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:35,160
And so I can completely become unaware that I've left Meleus sucking down resources in

224
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,700
the background when it hides the icons, or that Skype is logged in.

225
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,320
These are things that I like to have a heads up display about.

226
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,880
So I am aware of these applications sucking down resources in the background.

227
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,120
You're saying your shell should tell you about the applications that you're running?

228
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Yeah.

229
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
And I think most GNOME users agree.

230
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,080
And so there's certain obvious things like this that I think if Canonical were to go

231
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,400
to GNOME and say, well, duh, guys, you should be doing it this way, they'd go, well, screw

232
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
you.

233
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
We intentionally didn't design it that way.

234
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,600
I don't know.

235
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Maybe I...

236
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,920
Ike, do you think my reading of this is too extreme?

237
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,920
No.

238
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Well, not overly extreme.

239
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Appropriately extreme.

240
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
I find...

241
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Yeah.

242
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
I mean, I guess...

243
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
An appropriate level of extremity.

244
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,440
So I find some of these answers, too, to be pretty obvious.

245
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Would you agree with that?

246
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Yeah.

247
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,120
I mean, if you compare what Ubuntu was shipping before versus what they're going to go now,

248
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,800
a lot of it feels polar opposite and isn't going to be discoverable by their user base.

249
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,360
So if you look at things like top icons, they're kind of a must-have.

250
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,920
And as for the dash to the dock, well, that kind of speaks for itself.

251
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,520
I meant to say that perhaps it's not as important.

252
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,480
It doesn't quite add up in my head.

253
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,600
Maybe it's just me.

254
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Yeah.

255
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
They...

256
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:57,200
I can totally see them either implementing it on their own or just shipping the extensions.

257
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,300
I don't think Canonical has to play hardliner here.

258
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,600
So they have sort of an advantage.

259
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,560
Okay, if you guys want to do it upstream, we are happy to do that.

260
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,300
But if you don't want to, we will package up these extensions and we'll maintain them

261
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,080
and make sure that we test them before we ship you package upgrades to Gnome and...

262
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
Yeah.

263
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
I mean, that's...

264
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
That'll be our cross to bear.

265
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Either of those sound okay.

266
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
Yeah.

267
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,880
So practically to end users, I think they'll still get the functionality.

268
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,820
It was the most divisive result.

269
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,820
Can you guess what it was?

270
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,360
Of course, you'd have to remember all of the different options.

271
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,640
So it's not a fair question.

272
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:35,440
But it's one that Joe and I just talked about on Linux Action News on Monday.

273
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:42,440
No top left hot corner and the applications menu, which is, I think, pretty not surprising

274
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,440
because we've also talked about on this show, they were the biggest deviations from Gnome's

275
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
core design.

276
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Right.

277
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,800
The applications menu gives you that drop down applications and the left trigger area,

278
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
which is normal.

279
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,960
I think really Gnome was almost reliant on people accidentally triggering it to discover

280
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,880
how to use the desktop.

281
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
It's inevitable.

282
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
It will happen.

283
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
And then the last one, which is cut right down the middle.

284
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,520
And this is the one Joe and I were talking about, actually.

285
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:12,600
Window controls, left or right, which on 1710 beta right now, or alpha, they're on the left.

286
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Like a Mac.

287
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Like a damn dirty Mac.

288
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
I don't really care.

289
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
I don't know, whatever.

290
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
I know how to close a window.

291
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
Why the hell is it not configurable?

292
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Yeah.

293
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I mean...

294
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
I suppose that could be.

295
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Yeah.

296
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,480
If I switch over to Arc, do they stay on the left?

297
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,360
That would be a bit of a pain in the butt.

298
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,840
Anyways, so there you go.

299
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,680
Follow up on the survey results.

300
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,040
I find the whole thing to be sort of a good inclination, or a good, not inclination, but

301
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:48,160
a good forecasting or foreshadowing of where all this is going.

302
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,240
And I'm really kind of happy we got to see some of the results.

303
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
I wasn't sure.

304
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
It doesn't tell us what their decisions are going to be.

305
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
No, it does not.

306
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,560
But hopefully we'll see some upstream activity or, I don't know, actual decisions forthcoming.

307
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,680
You know, in some ways, I'm really glad they're not saying what their decisions are, because

308
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:09,120
it gives them the opportunity to try different things out, go all in on an idea.

309
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,600
Yeah, hopefully they can land on an idea that it will actually work and they can invest

310
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
in it.

311
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,600
It allows them to bounce around without being constrained by the things they've promised.

312
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,400
So it's probably a good thing that they're not.

313
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:26,320
And really, the core truth will just be whatever ships.

314
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
Yeah, right.

315
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Exactly.

316
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,080
So, okay, one more story that's sort of breaking today as we record the show.

317
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:39,280
I've been trying to do these sort of at the top, not to take away from less news coverage.

318
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,560
I've been doing a little less news coverage in this show and trying to do more community

319
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:50,360
stuff, more project stuff, more things that I think are applicable to daily Linux users,

320
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,760
people who live and breathe in Linux.

321
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,800
But stuff that's really super news-heavy and headlining, I'm sort of saving for Linux action

322
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
news.

323
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
That makes sense.

324
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,640
So I'm kind of shifting some of the tone of some of this stuff to be more like community

325
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,480
projects and things that are sort of underreported but really great sources of discussion or

326
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,880
really interesting things happening at.

327
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,800
I've been enjoying it more and more.

328
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,800
And one of the projects I'm kind of including in that, because I don't think it really gets

329
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,160
a lot of discussion, it's maybe just more of a small community focus.

330
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,960
People who love it really know it, but we never really discuss it.

331
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
It's Open Media Vault.

332
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,760
And Open Media Vault 3 actually shipped today.

333
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,680
It was close to shipping when I reviewed Open Media Vault months ago.

334
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,200
And so it is using Debian 8, Jesse, as you would probably expect.

335
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,440
They've totally quote-unquote refactored the back end, and they have quote-unquote adapted

336
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,240
that back end to SystemD.

337
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,320
Hey, moving with the times.

338
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
That's good to see.

339
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,920
It seems like that's probably kind of obvious since Debian made the switch to SystemD.

340
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
Anyways...

341
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,640
Hey, they wrote new unit files.

342
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,080
Yeah, that's true.

343
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,700
Also added support for Extended FAT, which would be nice for people hooking up external

344
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,920
devices to import them into their Open Media Vault.

345
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
LVM snapshots?

346
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,160
Yeah, and LVM snapshots is good.

347
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,320
And improved USB and rotational storage device detection.

348
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,600
I brought this one up because I think this is a direction I want to go with the Open

349
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,040
Media Vault server I set up for Angela months ago.

350
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,680
Because I was considering setting up another one here at the studio eventually.

351
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,320
And then setting up some sort of rotational backup system between her place and this place.

352
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
That would be pretty slick.

353
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,820
Yeah, a little off-site exchange.

354
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,400
And maybe something like, because we're talking terabytes and terabytes and terabytes and

355
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,480
terabytes of data.

356
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,020
So maybe something like, maybe I could do the initial moving of data would still probably

357
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,020
take days.

358
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,960
And then it sinking over the internet would probably be sufficient after that.

359
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
I don't know.

360
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,640
But I was considering, so I was really happy to see that go into Open Media Vault 3 as

361
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
well.

362
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
No more I-386 though.

363
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Yeah.

364
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,600
I mean, you can still install it, I guess, but they will no longer be making an ISO image.

365
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,400
Yeah, at first I was like, so what?

366
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,820
But then I was like, actually, one of the really nice things about FreeNAS and Open

367
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:06,260
Media Vault is this whole take something that you are maybe going to toss or has been sitting

368
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,240
around in your garage or whatever for months or years and get new life, get new use out

369
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
of it.

370
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Yeah, that's true.

371
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
This is my old rig.

372
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
I don't need much.

373
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,640
I'm not doing a crazy array, but I can buy a little extra RAM, put some disks in it.

374
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,720
That's a good point.

375
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,200
You know, Mr. West, last week was our 200th episode.

376
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Is that right?

377
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
I know.

378
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,200
And in tradition, we were pretty unplanned, pretty unorganized.

379
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,940
I mean, this is the quote unquote unplugged show, which suffers from time to time from

380
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,940
proper planning.

381
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,880
I admit that is part of it.

382
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,160
It is a design flaw, if you will.

383
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,580
But we are making up for it in a big way.

384
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:49,720
On America's birthday, Tuesday, July 4th, 2017, we will be having a virtual lug become

385
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
a real lug.

386
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Wow.

387
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
How about that?

388
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
It's not virtual when you're going to actually be here.

389
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
It's hard not to say, though.

390
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,040
We are inviting you, the lug out there, to come join us in person here at the J.B.

391
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:05,080
One studio for a little barbecuing, or Noah has advised me to call it grilling.

392
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,080
Fair enough.

393
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,080
They've been advised by my counsel.

394
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,080
We didn't invite him, so it's fine.

395
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,840
You should tell him he's not invited, because then he would show up.

396
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Oh, yeah.

397
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Right.

398
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
That's a little-

399
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Disinvite.

400
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
Little Noah trick for you there.

401
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,840
Tell him he can't do something, and he'll do it.

402
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
Sorry, Noah.

403
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
You can't come.

404
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
You just absolutely cannot come.

405
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,920
I don't think you could pull it off.

406
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
I don't think you have the means to-

407
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
It's not really your crowd.

408
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,920
Yeah.

409
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
And I just don't think you could make it happen.

410
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,920
So there you go.

411
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Maybe now we'll see him.

412
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Yeah.

413
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,880
So that'll be streamed to some degree.

414
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,280
I'm not exactly sure how the hell we're going to do that, since we'll be outside.

415
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,080
But people have, well, it's already been committed, so I'm going to try to make that work.

416
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,800
I wasn't conferred with on that decision, but I can try to make it happen.

417
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
But be here.

418
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,200
Dustin's going to also be here sous-viding.

419
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,880
I might have another sous-vide going.

420
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
We don't know.

421
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
Oh.

422
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
There has been rumors of ribs as well.

423
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,520
Wes, if you've got any inclinations of something you'd like to make, you are welcome.

424
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
Okay.

425
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,960
Like a nice, I don't know, macaroni and cheese, I don't know, fruit salad, I don't know.

426
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,080
Oh, I could bring some Hawaiian mac salad, yes.

427
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
What?

428
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Really?

429
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
Heck yes, I can do that.

430
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,080
Okay, there you go.

431
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
Absolutely.

432
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
Coming right up.

433
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Shit, I wouldn't want to get down on that.

434
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,600
Anyways, we're going to celebrate 200 weeks, I think without interruption too, of the Unplugged

435
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:25,080
program on July 4th, which is not too long before I hit the road and head off to Montana.

436
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,720
So we'll talk a little bit about that in user error, but I will be gone shortly after that.

437
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,720
I think actually, I think I leave the weekend after that barbecue.

438
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,880
So we have the barbecue on the 4th of July, yeah, and then I leave on the 14th.

439
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,400
So I'll be back, I'll be here for one Unplugged after our barbecue one, and then I'll be on

440
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
the road.

441
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,640
If we survive.

442
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,380
If the studio doesn't get burned down.

443
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,340
So if you're going to be able to make it, I don't think we're having, you know, probably

444
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,960
it's going to be a small crowd, because not only is it only people in our neck of the

445
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,820
woods are going to be able to make it, which is, you know, a tiny percentage of the audience,

446
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,160
but then half the people that go, they say they're going to go, don't show.

447
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,880
People have, you know, jobs and kids and lives.

448
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
We get that.

449
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,520
Of course, I'm going to buy enough food for all the people that say they're going.

450
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,520
So those of you who do make it, we're going to eat food, it's going to be great.

451
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,040
We're going to have a very food coma episode that week.

452
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,460
Anyways, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

453
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,760
If you think you could make it, we'd really like to see you and toss in there, we got

454
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,920
a little conversation going.

455
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,200
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting to have Wes and Chris cook for you.

456
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
That's right.

457
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
That's what we're doing for 200 episodes.

458
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
What the hell?

459
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
Who thought?

460
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
That was my idea, too.

461
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
They should be cooking.

462
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Make it more work for us.

463
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
They should be.

464
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,680
Damn it, Wes!

465
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
Take this down.

466
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
Take this down, Wes.

467
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,840
For episode 300, the audience cooks for us, okay?

468
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Thank you.

469
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Yep.

470
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
Make a memo.

471
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
Yeah.

472
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,840
Thank you.

473
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,840
Thank you.

474
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,840
Okay.

475
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,840
Next time, you know, I'm new to this.

476
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
I'm still learning.

477
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,840
Someday.

478
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Someday.

479
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,760
I'm gonna go there to support the show, and if you sign up, you'll get either if you bring

480
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,160
a device or if you got no device, you're gonna get a great deal.

481
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,280
You get $25 in either purchase power off a phone or $25 in service credit.

482
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
Now, you're like, Chris, $25?

483
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,440
Yeah, I know it's $25, because $25 matters.

484
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:17,280
Average ting line, it's gonna be $23 per month per phone, so you get $6 just for the line.

485
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,800
I'm gonna break this down for you right now.

486
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Ready, Wes?

487
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Ready?

488
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Like you never heard before.

489
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Let's hear it.

490
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Let's hear it.

491
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
That's what you use.

492
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,440
That's what you pay for the minutes, the messages, and the megabytes.

493
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,840
Oh, I got the chair squeak in there, too.

494
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,840
That was good.

495
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
I hope that showed up on mic.

496
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
Hold on.

497
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Let me see.

498
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Hold on.

499
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
Did I get it in there?

500
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
Did I get it in there?

501
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,160
See, the chair squeak's important, because that tells you I'm a thrifty person, and so

502
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
you can trust my recommend.

503
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,600
He's not spending money all over town.

504
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,080
No, no, because I'm gonna buy equipment for the studio.

505
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,080
No.

506
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
It literally impacts the broadcast.

507
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,080
It affects the job.

508
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
You know what?

509
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
I'll tell you what.

510
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,200
When I see a good deal, I'll get a chair, and when I saw a good deal, I win it, and

511
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
I got Ting.

512
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Lytics.ting.com.

513
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,480
That's where you go to support the show and get the $25 credit.

514
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,040
Now, I think you're probably gonna have a device that'll work.

515
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:09,120
Check their BYOD page to be sure, but they got a CDMA network, and they got a GSM network,

516
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,320
and so that's a lot of network, and that means it's gonna work with a lot of phones.

517
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,180
You have a great dashboard, nationwide coverage, no contracts, no early termination fee.

518
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,440
You just pay for what you use, however much you talk, however much you text, however much

519
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,320
data you use, that's what you pay for.

520
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,280
Like me, I'm all on the Telegram.

521
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,960
A month or more since I've gotten a text message?

522
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,720
What I tend to get is either an SMS alert about a system being down or a two-factor

523
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,400
thing on one of my services that I use.

524
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,280
That's maybe like three or four text messages, maybe one a week.

525
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,720
There's no way I'd want to pay for more than that.

526
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,680
It's just a waste of money.

527
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,840
Pissing in the wind, is that the saying?

528
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
Like throwing money into the wind?

529
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
Mm-hmm.

530
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,880
Yeah, well, I'd be like pissing on money and throwing it in the wind, which then it would

531
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
just come back wet and smack me in the face.

532
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
No one wants it.

533
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
It's gross now.

534
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
You've ruined the money.

535
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
It's super gross.

536
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,880
I don't care.

537
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,880
I don't care.

538
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
I just don't want it.

539
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
It's a waste of money.

540
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
It was literally a waste of money.

541
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,080
Linux.ting.com.

542
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,880
Great devices, either from Ting directly or you can bring your own, and they have fantastic

543
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,240
customer service, great dashboard, and a blog that I follow.

544
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,600
This one, I'm going to put out there as probably the best retrospective I've read on Pokemon

545
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Go.

546
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,720
Looking back at it, really what it was about was augmented reality becoming a thing, and

547
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,680
I think long-term that's what we're going to take away.

548
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,520
You don't really see people walking around playing.

549
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Write a passage for AR there.

550
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Exactly.

551
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,080
So it's a really good write-up on it, and on AR in general and the state of AR and the

552
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,040
market and where it's going and the different vendors that are getting in on it, including

553
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,320
Google and Apple and even Facebook in there and Samsung.

554
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,400
It's just a great write-up.

555
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,840
Start if you want to read that, but start by going to linux.ting.com.

556
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,520
They've got a picture of a dog with a Ting sticker too.

557
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
Linux.ting.com.

558
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,000
You go there, look around, and even if you're not ready to switch to Ting, I recommend their

559
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
blog.

560
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,580
It's a good resource for pretty much any enthusiast out there, linux.ting.com.

561
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,840
It's a shame our friends from Canonical couldn't join us this week because I'm about to talk

562
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,400
about their favorite subject right now, and that would be snap packages.

563
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,240
Snap packages have finally gotten something that flat packs can do, and they essentially

564
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,140
make the snap packs smaller.

565
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,360
So take Corebird, a Twitter client.

566
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,760
It's about two megabytes.

567
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:31,880
The flat pack would be about 12 megabytes, and the snap of Corebird, 112 megabytes.

568
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
That's good, right?

569
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,400
I mean, you get more software that way.

570
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,800
Holy, holy, holy shit.

571
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Holy shit.

572
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,240
The thing is that flat packs are able to take advantage of shared GNOME stuff, like stuff

573
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,120
outside of just that flat pack, like the GNOME platform runtime.

574
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,920
So snaps are essentially getting functionality close to this now.

575
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,880
That's my rough understanding.

576
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,120
Like I said, I don't want to misrepresent what it is, but my understanding is that now

577
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,280
if there is a GNOME platform snap, you could pull that in as part of Corebird.

578
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,720
So I think you would still be pulling that stuff down if you don't have it originally.

579
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,240
Right, but it's then going to be shared across different apps that I'll use now.

580
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
Yeah.

581
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,080
Eike, do you have a better understanding of any of this than I do?

582
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
I'm assuming you must.

583
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,240
Yeah, I mean, they're basically doing the same sort of thing at the moment as flat pack

584
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,240
is doing.

585
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,000
That's basically what it comes down to, bundling up the shared library.

586
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,520
So you've got this shared, dare I say, dependency to de-duplicate the dependencies between the

587
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
apps.

588
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,580
So while the app may appear smaller, you still have that initial cost of that runtime.

589
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,480
So once you've installed one app, it's shared between loads of them.

590
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
Yeah.

591
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,120
And at the moment, I believe it's limited to GNOME only.

592
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,560
I'm not really sure how scalable this is going to result in being, though.

593
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,720
Because while the GNOME is a very specific platform, if you start getting things that

594
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,760
have these custom patch libraries and that, it's not going to work there.

595
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,820
Since things are bundled in their own libraries, you just can't de-duplicate them.

596
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,200
So time will tell.

597
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,720
I mean, it's an early start, but it's a good start.

598
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Time will tell if people don't end up just bundling their own GTK stuff so that way it

599
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,240
works and is stuck to the versions they expect and has the right theming and functionality.

600
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,040
That option's there now.

601
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,120
Some may use the shared stuff, and some people may find it's just more practical to just

602
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
bundle it all themselves.

603
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,840
I don't know.

604
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,860
Speaking of flat packs, though, there is a bit of a fundraiser for infrastructure for

605
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:34,200
Flat Hub, which I think Flat Hub is a necessary thing if we're going to have...

606
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,680
Flat packs are going to be sustainable.

607
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,040
You don't want to get them from GitHub and then compile them yourself, Chris?

608
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,840
Or some GNOME developer's blog where he just updates it every few months with new links.

609
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,120
No, that's not been working for me very well.

610
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,120
What I like what Robert's doing here, Robert McQueen, is he also is intentionally trying

611
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,160
to make this outside of GNOME.

612
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,840
This is more than GNOME.

613
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,960
This is a bigger deal.

614
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,220
The GNOME Foundation agreed to support Flat Hub by offering support for legal advisors

615
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,220
and whatnot.

616
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,800
So they sat down with them to figure out the best way to get the initial ball rolling in

617
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
all of this.

618
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:15,320
And GNOME has also offered their sysadmin to help with some of the setup and monitoring.

619
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,660
But his intention is to keep Flat Hub infrastructure independent from GNOME so they can make their

620
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,360
own app decisions about making it easier to install proprietary apps, collecting donations

621
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,400
for app authors, et cetera.

622
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,960
So he wants to build up an infrastructure.

623
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,080
And he's trying to raise, I think, 100 pounds, no, I'm sorry, 800.

624
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,520
And he's already raised, as of this post, 532.

625
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
Oh, that's great.

626
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,640
But it looks like it's a paypal.me slash ramcq if you want to donate, paypal.me slash ramcq.

627
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,040
I think if you're perhaps, I don't know if this is a thing that exists in our audience,

628
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,560
but if you're an end user who's an advocate of Flatpaks, this seems like a pretty good

629
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,080
thing to get behind.

630
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,380
The Flat Hub.

631
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,880
And I applaud Robert's decision to try to keep it a separate thing.

632
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,000
I think that's a really good idea.

633
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah, I think so too.

634
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,560
It's obviously, you know, it's a very useful GNOME tool.

635
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,960
But speaking of GNOME and Red Hat, and well, why not mention Fedora?

636
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,760
Fedora 26 beta is out today as we record.

637
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Ah, I lied.

638
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,320
There was one more hat-breaking story today.

639
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,740
And I was going to come on here and give you like my first takes.

640
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,740
So I downloaded it.

641
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:32,160
I installed it, and...

642
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,160
You converted.

643
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,880
No, I mean, it's Fedora.

644
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,600
It's great, I mean, it's fine.

645
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
It's fine.

646
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
It's fine.

647
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,240
It's just a revving of Fedora.

648
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,240
It's like GNOME 3.24.

649
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,240
A quiet march.

650
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,560
Yeah, it's exactly, yeah, it's exactly it.

651
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:55,240
So I checked out Fedora Workstation, and it's got a new background, which is the one I have

652
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,320
up on the screen right now, and that was what I took away from it.

653
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,560
You know, because if you're already on GNOME Current, there's nothing different.

654
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,100
So when you install Fedora 26, it's just GNOME 3.24, and it's great, it's fine.

655
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
It looks like a good, solid release.

656
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,080
I installed it with no issues, the performance was fine, but I don't have anything else to

657
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
report.

658
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,200
I thought I'd have a nice little bit of journalism moment there and do a little deep dive on

659
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,680
a topic, and I walked away with a realization that this is why distro reviews are not really

660
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,440
a thing I do anymore, because there's just nothing there to really talk about.

661
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,280
It's a great release, and if you want to...

662
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,680
Where if you want an uncanny valley of distro reviews, where it's just good enough.

663
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,240
It's like, what it is, it sounds like what Mark Shuttleworth was talking about early

664
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,320
on, where they're like, we're just going to ship GNOME, and we're not really going to

665
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,760
touch it, and if you just want a GNOME workstation, fine.

666
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,440
That's what this is.

667
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,720
If you want a nice workstation, and it has GNOME, and it's got a decent package manager

668
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
on it, fine.

669
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Have it.

670
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
Done.

671
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
You're good.

672
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
They're not screwing around.

673
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,800
Yeah, so that's what it is.

674
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,280
So instead, I decided to spend-

675
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,600
I would listen to a whole thing where you just gave really sarcastic and unenthusiastic

676
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,520
reviews or short little summaries of distros.

677
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,680
I was actually thinking about doing a special for the patrons called the Linux Critic, where

678
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,680
I would just do that.

679
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
That sounds fun.

680
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,680
Yeah, you should.

681
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,600
You should do that publicly, because I don't want to hurt feelings.

682
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,160
Yeah, there's bridges and all those.

683
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Yeah, exactly.

684
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Yeah, it always causes controversy.

685
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,400
But just for the patrons, the Linux Critic, I thought would be a good-

686
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
That would be fun.

687
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
Yeah.

688
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
I have a few.

689
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
I have a few.

690
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
I could take some of our Slack discussions we've had.

691
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,360
We could get you a little drunk, and then-

692
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
Oh, God.

693
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,840
I don't want to get people offended, but yeah.

694
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,200
No, we've had some good Slack conversations that don't make it on air, because it's a

695
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,480
little bit- some of it's sometimes slightly satirical.

696
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,520
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking, Ahrefs.

697
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:52,280
Ahrefs is just added warning satire to it, and I think maybe that's what I would do.

698
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,440
But you never know.

699
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,120
You may see the- I should just do it now, because somebody's probably going to steal

700
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
the idea.

701
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:03,960
So I decided to spend my time, since I wasn't just spending all my time deep diving into

702
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Fedora.

703
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,760
There's just not a lot to parse for me.

704
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,920
It's just a great release, but I thought maybe I'd spend a little time digging into Cockpit.

705
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:18,520
And so I was reading in, and I saw on Steph's blog, I think his name is, he was doing a

706
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
deep dive himself.

707
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,760
And I thought, okay, well, let's go through some of his stuff.

708
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,120
And I have it installed on a DigitalOcean Droplet, so I was kind of doing some side-by-side

709
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,840
comparisons to kind of confirm what he said.

710
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,200
And I liked it.

711
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,120
I liked what I found, and I'll link you to his conclusions as well.

712
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,100
I thought one thing that was interesting is that Cockpit actually runs as an alternative

713
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Linux session.

714
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:43,280
Unlike your webmins or your cPanels of the past that are running as an Apache, the Apache

715
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,400
server is listening and executing the pages, or their webmin where it's a self-container

716
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
thing.

717
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,500
This – but it's listening as a remote port.

718
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:59,060
This is actually using PAM and Lognd and TTY, and if you have SE Linux, those things are

719
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,060
being applied.

720
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:04,200
So this – just right off the beginning, I was impressed with how Cockpit is getting

721
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,080
you logged in to your Fedora system.

722
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,960
I thought that was pretty cool.

723
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,820
And then on top of that, Cockpit itself has no special privileges.

724
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,840
It's the credentials of whatever user you log into.

725
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,840
So this is – I thought, okay, this is fascinating.

726
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,500
So if I log in as Chris F, I can perform exactly the task that Chris F logged into that system

727
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,680
has access to.

728
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,520
Or more importantly, I can't do anything that I don't have access to, which is hugely

729
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,120
important for remote administration.

730
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,640
And I'm like, how the hell then – how the hell am I able to do all of these amazing

731
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,080
things even though I'm authenticated as my user?

732
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,520
Well, essentially by using sudo.

733
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,880
So when you log in to Cockpit, there's a little checkbox that says reuse my password

734
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,880
for privileged tasks.

735
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,240
So instead of like remember my password, which is what you normally see, it's use my password

736
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
for privileged tasks.

737
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,040
And like you're probably guessing right now, it's essentially using policy kit in the

738
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:07,480
background to sudo me and perform admin tasks that I would be able to do via sudo, which

739
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,560
is also, I think, a brilliant way to do it.

740
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,200
And then I thought, okay, well, this is great and all, but what if I don't want to expose

741
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,760
my server to the web?

742
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,920
Is there a way to still use Cockpit since it's a web-based tool?

743
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:26,040
And Cockpit itself typically listens on TCP port 9090, where you then connect to that

744
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,880
and it'll launch appropriate software.

745
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,840
And okay, but anytime you have anything facing the network, it's essentially a security risk.

746
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,640
Anytime a computer is listening to the network, there is the potential for exploiting it and

747
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,600
something that executes code on the other end.

748
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,080
So this is a thought.

749
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,080
So what I learned is, and I kind of learned this the backwards way, is that if you install

750
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,940
like Fedora Atomic or Fedora Cloud, like my DigitalOcean instance, it installs Cockpit

751
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,320
by default, but it installs it in a mode where Cockpit is configured for you to connect to

752
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,320
it over SSH.

753
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
Oh, interesting.

754
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
Yeah.

755
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,320
Super interesting.

756
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,000
Because I'm going to have SSH listening on my droplet, right?

757
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,880
And so you can log in to Cockpit over SSH, which is, I think, super awesome.

758
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:22,840
And anyways, just sort of double down my sort of deep dive into this, kind of expecting

759
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,420
it to be a little underwhelming.

760
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,560
And at every turn where I was trying to figure out, well, how did they solve this problem?

761
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,580
I went, oh, shit, they really thought this through.

762
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,140
And what's great about it is it's something you can deploy yourself.

763
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:40,580
You can put Fedora Atomic – or maybe they call it Fedora Cloud, I can't remember.

764
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,840
You can put it on a DigitalOcean droplet and you can manage containers this way.

765
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,660
They also use Kerberos for single sign-on if you have that.

766
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:52,120
They have authentication tools that you can use to help replace the back-end authentication

767
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,760
completely if you want.

768
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,600
So it's well thought out and it's layered, which kind of matches the Linux system in

769
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:04,880
general where it uses user permissions and policy kit and it becomes an alternative Linux

770
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,880
session itself.

771
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,000
So it's bound by SE Linux and I just – you know, it's not Webman.

772
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,800
It's not Webman of years past that I had come across.

773
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,960
It is a legitimate tool to manage a server that's really been well thought out and

774
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,560
I was impressed by the security architecture of it.

775
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,000
So if you want to be impressed by Fedora on a server, which I know is kind of an oxymoron

776
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
for a lot of you, but it's interesting, Cockpit is such a great way to manage a Fedora

777
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
server.

778
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Yeah, I know.

779
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,360
I mean, it makes me want to learn other things.

780
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
Maybe there's a way to do it.

781
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
I haven't really investigated that.

782
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,200
Because it does seem very approachable, especially people who aren't like – maybe they sys

783
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,560
admin some of the time but they know the changes they need to make but, oh, I don't remember

784
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,560
which flag that is.

785
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,560
Yeah.

786
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Yeah.

787
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,520
Or if you – this is another one that I was picturing while I was going through this was

788
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,240
gosh, you know what I would use the hell out of this for is back in the day, I would set

789
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,200
up test systems for developers and then they would have to ping me to do things like restart

790
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,680
a service or restart the box and then I would have to stop whatever I was in the middle

791
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,760
of, SSH in, you know, not a big deal.

792
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,880
But if I could have given them a login to Cockpit where they could see all of their

793
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,460
containers and they could go in there and turn them off and turn them on and essentially

794
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,480
to them would just be applications, that would have been so nice, man.

795
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,360
So I could see Cockpit – I could have seen some uses for it back in the day.

796
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:24,000
Now I just was like, well, okay, if I got this running on Fedora, well, let's put Sab

797
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
NZB in here.

798
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Boom.

799
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Container Sab NZB.

800
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I'm like, oh, shit, that was really easy.

801
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
All right.

802
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Let's try a mumble container.

803
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Boom.

804
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Oh, man, that was crazy easy.

805
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
This is great.

806
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,840
And then you get – also you get performance charts and metrics and information right there

807
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
in Cockpit.

808
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
It's a good tool.

809
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
It's a really good tool.

810
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,400
So server side, Chris, maybe he's coming back in this age of containers.

811
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
I tell you what.

812
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,400
There's something about it that's sort of feeling good, like I'm scratching an itch

813
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,440
that's been on my back for a while and I'm like, oh, I finally got a back scratch your

814
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
way out.

815
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
Oh, wow.

816
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,440
Oh, yeah.

817
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,440
Oh, yeah.

818
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,440
Well, you heard me mention it's a great way to play around with this stuff.

819
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,440
DigitalOcean.

820
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,560
Go over to digitalocean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUG.

821
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,560
That's one word.

822
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,360
You apply it to an account after you create it.

823
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,160
I know that's tricky, but the reason for that is because it's like a $10 credit they

824
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
apply.

825
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
Well, it's exactly what it is.

826
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
So they're applying it.

827
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
They need an account to apply it to.

828
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,800
And once you have $10, you can get surprisingly far with DigitalOcean.

829
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,040
First of all, they've got a $5 a month droplet, 512 megs of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU,

830
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,640
a terabyte of transfer.

831
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,520
They have all SSD storage for all of the rigs, but it starts at $5 a month.

832
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,120
Then it goes up from there into just phenomenally huge systems, hundreds of gigs of RAM, tons

833
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,000
of CPU cores, whatever you need.

834
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,680
And one of the things that's super nice is the flexibility with the storage.

835
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,160
You can attach block storage, itty bitty, I think like a gigabyte is the smallest number.

836
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,200
I don't think I've ever attached one that small, but you can go up to 16 terabytes,

837
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,400
which is what matters to me, and it addresses on your system as a block storage device.

838
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
It's brilliant.

839
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
I love it.

840
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,500
And it makes expanding storage on a DigitalOcean droplet dead simple, which means once you

841
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,280
get into something, you keep going, you're like, geez, I can't believe how much headroom

842
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,440
I have on the system.

843
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,360
I spun up a $5 a month droplet and I thought I could only do one thing.

844
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,320
Now here I am doing three different things on it and using up my storage.

845
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,600
You attach block storage easy, no problem.

846
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,560
And the other thing I want to mention about it, it's a great way to play with complex

847
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,800
file systems because you can format them, you could do ZFS, you could do ButterFS, it's

848
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,420
a great way to learn, too.

849
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,460
Something else they've recently rolled out, they have a great infrastructure.

850
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,380
They're always making improvements to it and integrating it in with their dashboard is

851
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:26,080
cloud firewalls, 40 gigabit connections into the hypervisors.

852
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,680
Data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto, Germany, they

853
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,400
probably are going to build one on the moon one day.

854
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,640
But what I really love is they're building in cloud firewalls at the network level.

855
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,680
You'll have a central location to define access rules, apply them to all of your droplets

856
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,000
and then DigitalOcean enforces those rules at the network layer so the traffic never

857
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,440
even hits your droplet.

858
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,040
You don't even waste a millisecond of CPU time trying to process those packets.

859
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,600
They do it for you at the network level all through that super sweet dashboard.

860
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,280
And then they have an API that makes it all smooth as butter.

861
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,000
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code D-O-Unplugged.

862
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,600
A big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

863
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,120
DigitalOcean.com, D-O-Unplugged.

864
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
Thanks DigitalOcean.

865
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:17,120
Now, Wes, I'm wondering if you heard the big news this week.

866
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,000
There is a reason why Ike is joining us.

867
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,560
It's not, I mean, other than I'm sure he just loves to catch up with his buddies, Chris

868
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,560
and Wes.

869
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,800
But no, it's because Solace is going to have some big growth coming down.

870
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,440
I mean, like they haven't already, which is funny.

871
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:38,360
But I think it's all about to look like small potatoes compared to what could be coming.

872
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:45,560
So Josh did a blog post over on the Solace project site and welcomed a new team member,

873
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,560
Stefan.

874
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,520
I think I'm saying his name probably right, to the project.

875
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,520
And then a little bit down in the post drops the big bomb that I think is going to have

876
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,400
huge ramifications for Solace and announced that Ike is going to become a full-time Solace

877
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,880
developer in about four weeks.

878
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,280
Hey yo.

879
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,440
So I heard a little bit on late night Linux last night about it.

880
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,760
And of course, see there, they don't want to gush about Solace too much, but here I'm

881
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
all about that.

882
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,920
So let's dig into this, Ike.

883
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,400
First of all, congratulations.

884
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,280
And it must have been kind of a hard choice.

885
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,840
You've got, I imagine, a pretty good gig at Intel.

886
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:29,640
Yeah, I mean, you've got to weigh the pros and cons, but you know, eventually it comes

887
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,560
down to do you want to follow your dreams or do you want to wait a few years and regret

888
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,560
not having done them?

889
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,480
You know, it sounds almost cliche, but I completely concur.

890
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,560
It's been about six years, I think, five or six years since I quit my full-time IT consulting

891
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,240
gig, which paid much better to do Jupyter broadcasting full-time because I just knew

892
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,160
I would really regret it.

893
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,800
I would just really kick myself down the road.

894
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,560
So with that sort of lens, I look at the situation, I'm very excited and very happy for you, Ike.

895
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:14,760
But this is often, in my experience, a transitional moment for an open source project when the

896
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,280
founder of the project or a key member of the project is able to shift to full-time.

897
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,480
I think it's made big, big improvements and big changes for elementary as they've made

898
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,240
some of those shifts.

899
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
There's other projects out there.

900
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,600
I could name drop, but it's kind of pointless.

901
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:34,640
I think it's going to be a huge shift for Solace, and I know you still have four weeks

902
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,560
at your old job, and I know you've got to be focused on wrapping that up, but your mind

903
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:44,680
must already be running very, very, very, very fast on all the different things that

904
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,280
might happen, all the directions you might go, where are you at?

905
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,920
How are you doing this?

906
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,800
What is the first couple of steps for you?

907
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:59,520
I'm not asking you way down the road, but are you setting up an office situation where

908
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,920
you're going to be working every day?

909
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,560
What is the first few steps you're going to take?

910
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,960
The future stuff, we'll just see where that comes, but what's next?

911
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:14,040
Well, I work from home anyway, so in some ways, there won't be that many changes.

912
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:21,120
The first thing is doing the legal, boring side of it, setting up as a limited company,

913
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:28,760
all that crap, just to protect me from that one guy and his Chrome install.

914
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,840
The very first thing is the change is the cadence of the project, so what I'm doing

915
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,280
now is I'm using energy between effectively two full-time jobs, and while I've done a

916
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,920
lot to date, the cadence of the project has been pretty good, to be fair.

917
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,760
Now it's basically going to be my bread and butter, and it's going to be my nine to five,

918
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,920
if you like, but without the connotations of a nine to five.

919
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,160
I will be putting all of my work energy just into Solace, so instead of having those two

920
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,880
or three hours at the end of the night, I now have all of the day to be doing that every

921
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,880
day.

922
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,040
So first thing I'll be doing is storming through the issues that we already have and working

923
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,640
on refining some of that stuff.

924
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:18,840
After that, things that I've wanted to do in the past, but might have fought against

925
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,640
for how they might be perceived or whatever, I'm kind of freer to do a few things now with

926
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,160
Solace.

927
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:31,160
There's risks that I can take, and essentially, it's applying the startup culture to Solace

928
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,160
in a big way.

929
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,000
Well, here was my first take when you announced the news.

930
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,100
I think you'd probably acknowledge that a lot of the criticism that projects like Solace

931
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:48,360
and others, even Mint, they take on is, one guy can't do all this.

932
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:53,120
He can't possibly do all this, and at some point, he's going to burn out, and he's going

933
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,160
to have to quit.

934
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,760
I think you probably just told all those people to shut the hell up with this move, because

935
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,400
essentially what you said is, to me, what it seems like you're saying is, well, when

936
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,240
the rubber hit the road and I had to make a decision, I chose Solace.

937
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,520
Is that sort of what happened?

938
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:12,720
No, I mean, to be clear, this is a transitional movement.

939
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,840
It's a personal decision.

940
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,520
I've enjoyed my job now for four years this month.

941
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,080
I've absolutely loved it.

942
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:25,160
The thing for me is deciding what I want next out of life.

943
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,520
I'm not in a position now where I have to choose anything.

944
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:34,400
It's something I voluntarily want to do, call it an easing of the soul, if you will.

945
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,960
It is something that I feel like I want to do, and it's something I feel like I should

946
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,440
do, because again, this is my passion.

947
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,680
It's something I believe in.

948
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,760
In terms of how people view the project, you are going to have that connotation around

949
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:52,400
the project of, oh, well, he's only doing it as a hobby.

950
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,440
To an extent, people are only going to take you so seriously, but not fully.

951
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:05,440
So for me, this is like, well, I'm fully committed to this project and the community around it.

952
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,000
I am going to make this thing run circles.

953
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,160
There's already been a positive uptake by the community as well.

954
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:19,440
On our Patreon page, you can see, I basically dropped it to them privately as a patron-only

955
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,440
post.

956
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,880
I told them, well, first of all, I actually kind of clickbaited them first.

957
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,720
I said, exciting news, come in, and told them nothing.

958
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,120
I left it off for about, well, I did that on Google Plus later.

959
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,760
I'd already done it on Patreon.

960
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,760
So I did that for about four hours or something, recorded late night Linux, went back, and

961
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,440
I basically told them about it.

962
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,360
The reaction was overwhelmingly positive.

963
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,560
There wasn't a single negative comment about it.

964
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,520
The beautiful thing that I saw was people were like, well, you know what, you're committing

965
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,520
to it, so we're going to up our commitment as well.

966
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:59,800
Since then, the Patreon has jumped up about $250 suggested, because people have taken

967
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,800
it upon themselves.

968
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,760
It's like, well, if you're all in, we're all in.

969
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,040
For me, the last few days have been very emotional, to be honest with you, just having people

970
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,800
believe in that you can do it.

971
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,800
That's got to feel good.

972
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,800
That's got to feel good.

973
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,800
Life change.

974
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,800
Yeah.

975
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,760
I mean, it validates a lot of things as well, but when people have faith in you, take everything

976
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,880
else aside, take finance aside, and take the methods of the way you're doing things.

977
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,680
For people just to believe in what it is you're doing, that alone is empowering.

978
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,680
Yeah.

979
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:35,360
It also means that in a very real way, your success personally and the ability to feed

980
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:40,600
yourself is now tied to the success of the project, which not that you weren't 100% committed,

981
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,200
but I think it just removes any doubt in an observer's minds.

982
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,080
That's probably why you're seeing an uptick there, because I kid you not, Aiki.

983
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,640
After you made the announcement, I myself was like, well, I better make sure I'm on

984
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,880
their Patreon, and I went there and go, oh, good, I already was, but I was like, oh, yeah,

985
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,880
okay.

986
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,720
Even though I'd been seeing your posts on Patreon, my first response is, well, I got

987
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,720
to go double check that I'm... Because that was how I felt to me, is like, this is going

988
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,200
to be a way for you to be able to keep doing this, I would imagine.

989
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,360
I should just say right now, patreon.com slash solace.

990
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,160
The main thing for us is, as I said, you're going from those couple of hours a day now.

991
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,880
I'm not trying to blow me on Trump or anything, but what we've managed to achieve as a project

992
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,640
already in a fairly small amount of time, when you look at the grand scale of projects,

993
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,760
we've repeatedly been told that everything that we've done, we've repeatedly been told

994
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:36,640
that it's impossible, you can't do that, you'll burn out, this isn't how projects work.

995
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,640
What do you mean it's independent?

996
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,680
Who are you based on?

997
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,280
We've already done the impossible.

998
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,280
We've basically bootstrapped this project, and now it's at a point, it's not like I'm

999
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,640
... I don't want to say I'm completely financially reliant on solace.

1000
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,360
I don't want people thinking, oh, now he's going to be scared to make decisions.

1001
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,760
Quite the opposite.

1002
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:00,240
To put it semi-crudely, this is basically retrofitting the balls of a Volvo S back onto

1003
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,720
solace, because that was a ballsy project, and that's effectively what I'm doing here.

1004
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,560
I'm going effectively back to roots with it.

1005
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,560
That's an interesting perspective on it.

1006
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,560
Yeah.

1007
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,240
It almost matters more than ever now.

1008
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,920
It matters more than ever now, in a way.

1009
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,760
Yes and no, right?

1010
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,440
There are some people that would say, well, you're dependent on this, this has got to

1011
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,440
be this way.

1012
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,960
Obviously, I've made sure I can make the transition, and that were anything to go wrong, that I

1013
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,400
was still covered to do it.

1014
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,120
I've made sure it's a safe time in which to do it, but yeah, people are basically then

1015
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,040
paying me to work on solace.

1016
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:40,760
It's not like it's a hobby thing, and it's just the usual, we'll cover a hosting cost.

1017
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:45,120
It's quite literally keeping the lights on now.

1018
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:51,560
I guess I can't really put my hands on it, but for some reason, I feel different as a

1019
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,760
solace user.

1020
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,600
I've been just reconsidering all kinds of things about the Linux desktop recently.

1021
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:05,800
I got a long list, and the desktop and distro I use is one of them.

1022
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,960
I really, really appreciate that.

1023
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,680
Just as an aside, if Ike wasn't here, I would say this, and Wes, I think you would agree,

1024
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:19,240
I would say this in our Slack channel too, I feel like solace has a unique take and tackle

1025
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,400
on building a great desktop Linux.

1026
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,720
It's not a great VPS OS.

1027
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:31,880
It's not a great OS to run in VirtualBox, but it is a great OS to run on my XPS 13.

1028
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:39,440
It's a great one to run on my desktop with a nice 2K screen.

1029
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,400
Ike, you yourself are aware of issues in the desktop world that most users don't think

1030
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,400
of, and you're fixing them in solace before they're even a problem.

1031
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,120
It almost feels like in some ways, I could make a comparison to what some people view

1032
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,020
elementary OS as for the beginning Linux users.

1033
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:57,400
Solace is kind of that for your advanced particular Linux user.

1034
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,600
It's simple enough that it's applicable to new users.

1035
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,600
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1036
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,160
I guess, so I say all of that to also say, one of the reasons why we talk about it on

1037
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:09,400
this show so much is because in the 11 years or 12 years, whatever the hell it is now,

1038
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,000
that I've been doing Linux podcasts, it's one of the distributions that stands out to

1039
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,800
me as a strong performer, rapid growth, huge community, quick and large community adoption,

1040
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:25,640
I should say, a well-spoken, well-communicated team who has clear blog posts that clearly

1041
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,320
explain what the project's goals are and what they're working on.

1042
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,480
And then, and now I can add to that entire list, a reputation of following through on

1043
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,480
commitments on what they're doing when they went, like when you said you're going rolling,

1044
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,100
it's a rolling method that actually works pretty well for me.

1045
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,160
It's not totally crazy and it's also not haphazard.

1046
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,400
It's like at certain times, new updates come down for me and it works.

1047
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,400
It's fine.

1048
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,400
It's working.

1049
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,000
Everything you've committed to and now, in a sense, at a whole other level, is so far

1050
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,400
checked out.

1051
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,360
Those are five attributes that I don't say I could apply to many distros.

1052
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,000
You can say a lot of distros have been around for a long time, they've had a good slow burn,

1053
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,960
they have a great reputation, they have a huge deployment.

1054
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,120
You can give different attributes, but there are a lot of unique characteristics to the

1055
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:14,000
Solus project that have kept it on my radar, essentially since the project, well, got a

1056
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
new name.

1057
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,080
I think the best way to summarize it with the Solus is when we started out, I mean,

1058
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,080
back in, you know, like when it was Evolve OS days, because in some senses, you've kind

1059
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:31,240
of got to ignore what came before because it was like the first attempt and then wanted

1060
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,440
to go independent because by that time, it's like you'd learned the things that you wanted

1061
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,920
to do with it, right?

1062
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:42,720
So then we have the lifetime really starting with Evolve OS and we were very adamant from

1063
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,820
day one that we were building an OS.

1064
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:49,320
We weren't telling people that we were building a distro and we were very, very adamant with

1065
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:54,680
that message to everyone and it became kind of meme-worthy after a while, but once we'd

1066
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,920
got all of that nailed down, because one of the things that I had learned from my previous

1067
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,920
experiences was how to say no and I had to be efficient with saying no and it was something

1068
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,080
I hadn't said before and that was what contributed to past failures.

1069
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,160
Now this time around, it's like, this is exactly what we're doing.

1070
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,280
This is what we define it to be.

1071
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,880
I don't care about all these other things, you know, package management and servers,

1072
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,720
you know, the usual controversial stuff you hear from me.

1073
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,720
This is what we're building.

1074
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,520
So wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1075
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,480
So when you say no, can you expand that?

1076
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,680
When you say no, it's like, when people say, well, I mean, because I'll just play devil's

1077
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,680
advocate.

1078
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,400
You know, you have plasma desktop, you have matte desktop.

1079
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,600
There's a lot of different flavors now.

1080
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,400
It seems like saying no would have been, no, we're just going to do Budgie and all of our

1081
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,560
resources are going to go into that.

1082
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:49,440
So my version of no is effectively a tool of scope limitation.

1083
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,400
So when I'm working on something, it's like, okay, at this current state, we can't do such

1084
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,760
and such and such.

1085
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,120
We need to do only this.

1086
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,600
This is what we must focus on for now.

1087
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,400
We pretend other things don't even exist until this is done.

1088
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:08,120
And when we first started out, you know, our scope was limited to supporting Budgie because

1089
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:13,080
at the time that was where our tooling, our technology, our basis, our process was at.

1090
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:18,520
And then as time goes by, well, you know, it stopped being just EvolverOS.

1091
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,080
We'd gone in, evolved into Zolas.

1092
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,080
Sorry.

1093
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,080
Sorry.

1094
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,080
You're loud.

1095
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,080
You're loud.

1096
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,120
We actually devolved into Zolas, if you like, and then by that time it was the OS itself,

1097
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,880
which was taking precedence in some centers.

1098
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:38,640
We made this mental differentiation between the operating system and the face, as I kind

1099
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,120
of run out of recalling it.

1100
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:44,400
So Budgie became the face and then at that point it's like, we have all this stuff.

1101
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,520
We know how to rapidly deploy a rolling OS at this point.

1102
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:53,640
It's like, okay, at that point it became, let's legitimize as a distro as well.

1103
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:58,000
So instead of just being an OS, because we weren't being assuming with most of our decisions,

1104
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,400
you know, like it's not, you don't feel belittled or anything, or the questions asked of the

1105
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,540
InstaHall or anything, you don't think it's trying to chastise you or anything like that.

1106
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,360
So there's no limitation on skill levels or the way it works.

1107
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,000
You can use a terminal, equally you can go and use this thing.

1108
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,240
So it's like, okay, at this point we have all our basics down.

1109
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,240
We've covered everything we want to be, but we still have this OS that other people want

1110
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,240
to use.

1111
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,440
And at that point it became about also legitimizing as a Linux distribution as well.

1112
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,160
So it stopped becoming just being an OS.

1113
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,480
It became legitimized as a Linux distribution that is used as an operating system.

1114
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,040
So that's when those two bits merged together conceptually.

1115
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,520
And then that's when you started getting the other desktops and slightly more tangent use

1116
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,120
cases coming along with it.

1117
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,080
But they're all done in a way that's improved everything else.

1118
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:48,240
Like everything that came in improved something else.

1119
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:54,360
Like the initial introduction of Steam, I never intended to go off and create all this

1120
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:59,840
gaming runtime and Linux-Steam integration and batching this and the performance.

1121
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:07,360
But it became something of a, again, a natural evolution that's going to get really old soon.

1122
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:13,240
But then that forced us to basically make all of our processes better by doing that.

1123
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:20,760
So our support for what we call Emul32, which is basically 32-bit libraries, it became first

1124
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,920
class to the point where you just said Emul32 in a package build and boom, off it went.

1125
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,120
A lot of the things that we include we do in that way.

1126
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:32,440
So we integrate them, they work well, and they improve something else as a consequence.

1127
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,320
Like we refine the core project and the core code base as a result of that.

1128
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,320
Yeah.

1129
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,320
And fair enough.

1130
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:43,800
You know, just going back to the Steam thing, for example, it's a serious differentiator

1131
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,800
of solace in it.

1132
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,280
Again, a lot of distros I try, it makes for a really smooth out-of-the-box experience

1133
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,480
when I, that's a stupid term, I hate that term.

1134
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,760
But it makes for a smooth experience when trying to play games, when you just want to

1135
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,640
sit down and play some games with your kids.

1136
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,280
Which is how I pretty much play games now is when my kids are sitting over me or standing

1137
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,280
over my shoulder.

1138
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,320
Dad, can we play Race the Sun or something like that.

1139
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,160
And so I quickly install Steam and...

1140
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,960
Can we play Race the Sun?

1141
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:14,600
I tell you what, when something fails to load like that, it's so defeating as a dad.

1142
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:19,280
Like you're sitting there, you want to have a good dad-kid moment around Linux and all

1143
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,520
that, and then it doesn't launch and it's just so embarrassing.

1144
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,680
It's like a shameful moment.

1145
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,160
Yeah, I mean, I've had a defining moment slightly like that before.

1146
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:32,520
It was a few years back, but actually it was at the very beginning of the Volvo West.

1147
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,040
So I was with my ex at the time.

1148
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,560
She wasn't the ex at the time, obviously.

1149
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,120
But then what happened?

1150
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:43,280
Yeah, I mean, we didn't break up because of that.

1151
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:49,880
I remember at the time that the multimedia codec support just wasn't fully baked at the

1152
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,880
time.

1153
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:57,680
And shamefully, shamefully, I had to download another Linux distro, nuke and pave the computer

1154
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,440
to watch a DVD.

1155
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,480
It was mortifying.

1156
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,880
And experiences like that, they will stay with you.

1157
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,720
You will make sure stuff like, I mean, it's a horrible term, you know, to work out of

1158
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:12,800
the box, right?

1159
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,200
There's no box.

1160
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,040
I downloaded this thing.

1161
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:21,360
But things like that, like enabling users to get stuff done and staying out of the way

1162
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,600
because an OS is not sexy.

1163
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,880
It's not at all.

1164
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,160
What you're doing is you're enabling someone to do something.

1165
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,960
You're enabling a workload, you're enabling a task.

1166
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,680
It's something to be done on the OS.

1167
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:40,760
The OS itself, I don't believe personally you can charge for an OS.

1168
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,120
Supporting the project and what it enables around it, yes.

1169
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,200
But charging for the OS, no.

1170
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:50,760
Even Windows, they're not going to be charging for it because you're enabling people to do

1171
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,240
stuff on top of that.

1172
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,880
How do they get their applications?

1173
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,480
That becomes very important.

1174
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,160
Something that didn't used to be as important in Solace history, notoriously became very

1175
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,160
important.

1176
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,080
How do you get those applications to them?

1177
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,240
How do you keep them safe when they're doing their daily stuff, when they're accessing

1178
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,240
in there?

1179
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,840
You want to make sure that they're up to date and more importantly, that they're informed

1180
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,680
as well, that they are being updated, that updates are available, that this is a good

1181
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,680
process.

1182
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,620
So you're slowly educating them with good practices over time.

1183
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:24,120
So those become the core considerations of the OS, not the OS itself.

1184
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:29,080
It's interesting to me and to Linux guys, how it works internally, but it's what we

1185
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,560
enable people to do.

1186
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,200
It's not the OS itself.

1187
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,200
That's what should be important.

1188
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,320
And I think that's now one of the defining characteristics of Solace.

1189
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:42,440
What can we enable our users to do and what experience do they deserve at the end of it?

1190
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,400
That makes me wish we had introduced the show with clips of the episode.

1191
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,880
That would be the highlight of this episode.

1192
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,880
No kidding, right?

1193
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,840
And that's what I really like.

1194
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:56,760
That philosophy does come through in a subtle way, but it's like 15 to 125 different subtle

1195
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,880
ways when you start using Solace.

1196
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,220
And each one of them is a complete message that essentially I think reflects the philosophy

1197
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,720
that Aiki just laid out there.

1198
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,560
And so I guess I was thinking about it as you were talking here, Aiki.

1199
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:12,920
I wonder, do you think that in some ways this is just sort of like now that this is going

1200
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:19,520
to be your full-time gig, proportionately, this feels like you're just getting started.

1201
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,200
Like you're really just getting started right now in some sense.

1202
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,200
Yeah.

1203
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:29,640
I mean, I've been lucky enough to be able to have done what I've done effectively as

1204
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,640
part-time.

1205
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,640
Right?

1206
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,640
That's basically what I've done.

1207
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,400
I've done it in part-time and I've had colleagues, I've had my teammates, I've had a community,

1208
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,760
which is now at a point where we've got so many patches coming in.

1209
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:45,160
I'm going to have to start having more gatekeepers to get the patches in on time.

1210
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,200
But obviously me working full-time, I'm going to be able to do that more quickly.

1211
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,640
But yeah, now all the pieces are there.

1212
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,440
I've got the deck of cards.

1213
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,600
Now I just need to build the house, right?

1214
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,600
That's a bad example.

1215
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:00,600
Did you not do that on purpose?

1216
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,600
The house of cards.

1217
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,040
They're really structurally sound cards, it's fine.

1218
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,040
Don't look too deep.

1219
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,040
They're weighted.

1220
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,040
Super glue.

1221
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,040
Super glue.

1222
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,040
Right?

1223
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:16,880
No, we use wooden planks that look like cards and then we've got iron rivets on them.

1224
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,920
But yeah, I'm now just getting started out.

1225
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,840
There's so much I want to do and I'm excited by it as well because it's four weeks from

1226
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,640
now but also it's like, it's four weeks away.

1227
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,960
It's a whole four weeks.

1228
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:33,000
But once that comes, again, it's back to that word, cadence.

1229
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:41,240
What we're going to be able to do is probably should terrify over projects what we're going

1230
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,240
to achieve.

1231
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,240
Because if it's taken that long, then you can dense that.

1232
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,000
I can do this every single day, as well as doing the usual stuff, like dealing with bugs

1233
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,200
and making sure that you still stay in touch with the community.

1234
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,040
It's one thing I've always done, Reddit, Twitter, wherever, I'll always try and engage

1235
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,080
with the community because I'm not above them.

1236
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:02,160
Especially now, I work for them.

1237
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:08,840
But so many projects that I haven't started, we're going to be able to get it done.

1238
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,520
For me, this is now where solace breaks out.

1239
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:16,120
We spent all this time building this engine, we designed this engine.

1240
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,800
I'm now confident that that engine works.

1241
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,200
Let's go take off.

1242
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,480
I'm so excited about that.

1243
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:28,720
I really can't wait to watch it and I hope you keep us updated on what happens.

1244
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,720
I'll be keeping an eye on that.

1245
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,720
Oh yeah.

1246
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,280
I mean, I need the PR now.

1247
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,320
I have to ask, I don't know if you can comment or have an opinion, but can you talk at all

1248
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:44,160
about what this means for the Clear Boot Manager or Clear Linux in general?

1249
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,400
I mean, obviously, that side of it, yeah, I'm very sad for that to happen.

1250
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:53,640
I'm transferring what projects I have into the Clear Linux organization on GitHub.

1251
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:57,080
Now for projects like Clear Boot Manager, as much as I obviously won't own them, their

1252
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,880
Intel projects, I'm going to be sending bullet requests to them.

1253
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,800
I'm still going to be contributing to them.

1254
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,400
Solace is going to continue to use it?

1255
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,400
Yeah, definitely.

1256
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,400
Neat.

1257
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,920
I want to be clear here.

1258
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,400
There's no animosity or anything like this involved there.

1259
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,400
There's a lot of sadness at work because I've been there four years.

1260
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,680
It's almost like a family at this point.

1261
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,480
I've been very honored to work with some incredibly talented people.

1262
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:28,480
I'm not just saying that the usual BS you hear, like some gangster was shot, but he

1263
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,480
was great.

1264
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,480
He was lovely.

1265
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,480
It's not that.

1266
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,840
You know the stuff, but I've really enjoyed myself.

1267
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:42,320
For me, it took me from a hobbyist open source contributor four years ago to an engineer,

1268
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:48,360
someone who can rationalize the design process and give real solutions, not give solutions

1269
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:52,240
where problems aren't present, but consider the problem that's already there.

1270
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,600
For me, it's changed me a lot.

1271
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,200
Because there is a bit of a special relationship, really, if you look at it between Clear Linux

1272
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:05,880
and Solus, as much as I am the common denominator there, there's a lot of shared philosophy

1273
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:12,360
in certain senses in the way that a distribution should be built and focusing on the task at

1274
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,360
hand.

1275
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,320
I'm not going to sacrifice that.

1276
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,840
Again, it's open source projects.

1277
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,480
You see that as an example.

1278
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:25,480
I'm not here shilling, but too often you'll hear people complaining about a so-called

1279
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:29,600
corporate backed project not doing open source things right.

1280
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:36,040
This is an example of it being done right because there is that collaboration and there

1281
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,040
is that crossover.

1282
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:42,000
There is that sharing of patches and the slightly aligned philosophies.

1283
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,800
That stuff will still continue.

1284
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:50,320
Basically the patches and the PRs that I send, they'll just come from a different email address.

1285
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,640
I'm still quite happy to use that technology.

1286
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,640
I'm proud of it.

1287
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:57,320
I was involved in it for a long time.

1288
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:04,560
It's interesting too because I think it's a point well made that it helped you become

1289
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:09,420
an engineer in a sense that allowed you to build something in a way that I think a lot

1290
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,840
of hobbyists maybe don't build it.

1291
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:17,100
It also made me realize, in some senses, this is really your Solus is really, of course

1292
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:21,880
it's an evolution, but it's really your third go too because you've got Evolv OS, Clear

1293
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:26,400
Linux, Solus, so it's not like it's the first time you've tried this either, which explains

1294
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,840
probably why it's fairly well put together.

1295
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,520
You learned a lot, obviously.

1296
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:34,880
By this time it started off in the old days, contributing to Linux men, I'm very thankful

1297
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,520
for the times I had there as well.

1298
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:41,680
I know people might think there's animosity there, there isn't really.

1299
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,280
I think the guys nowadays, they're servicing their community.

1300
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,400
To me that's important for any distribution to be servicing their community.

1301
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,340
It started off humble beginnings all the way back there.

1302
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:57,640
We had Linux Mint Debian Edition, then eventually I went my own way with Solus OS.

1303
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:01,720
I was contributing to Peppermint back there, I was in talks with the CrunchBank guys, they

1304
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,860
were using some of my stuff back then.

1305
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,240
Go all through the history.

1306
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:11,440
To give you an idea, my free node IRC account is over seven and a half years old, and that's

1307
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,440
the second account I've had.

1308
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,240
That's a good nerd brag, I like that.

1309
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,240
That's a proper nerd brag.

1310
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:23,760
Then you had Solus OS 2, then we had this break, six or seven months or so away from

1311
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,760
it all.

1312
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:30,440
That was actually after I had started with Intel, funnily enough, that Solus OS itself

1313
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:34,440
was, and I hate to use the term, but put down.

1314
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,160
Things took a bad turn during those days because I had come to the point then where I realized

1315
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:43,640
the stuff that I want to achieve as a Linux distribution, I think we all know now the

1316
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:48,040
only way I can achieve what I need to do is an independent distribution, and I tried it

1317
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,040
with the upstream.

1318
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:56,800
Over multiple revisions, it's like v1, v2, v3 of the spec, we finally got to a point

1319
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,240
where Evolver OS is like, nailed it.

1320
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,400
We got the right people in the community coming forward and that community building around

1321
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,400
it.

1322
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:09,400
I would like to say I'm a fairly experienced distro engineer by this point.

1323
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:17,960
I think so, and I think it shows, and I think it's a good investment if you're a Linux desktop

1324
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:18,960
user.

1325
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,320
I think you should go to patreon.com slash solus.

1326
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,560
He's got 301 as we record.

1327
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,960
I think we should bump that up a little bit.

1328
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:32,120
If you've already got a Jupyter Signal Patreon or Unfilter, you got all the details.

1329
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,440
You need to just go over to patreon.com slash solus and become a contributor.

1330
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,720
I'm in myself.

1331
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,520
Even if you don't use it every day, I think it's just really good for the Linux ecosystem.

1332
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,720
This is the kind of sustainable OS development that we need.

1333
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:49,720
That's one of the reasons why I'm also a patron of the BcashFS developer.

1334
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:55,480
I don't use BcashFS, but I think it's really important for desktop Linux, so I'm also a

1335
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:58,080
patron of BcashFS, which is another one I recommend.

1336
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:04,080
By the way, if you become a patron, patreon.com slash solus, you get access to 27 Patreon-only

1337
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,080
posts.

1338
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:10,400
That's pretty old, but the reason why I mention that is it shows you that IKEA and folks are

1339
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,520
clearly engaging with their patron community.

1340
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,840
The perks are actually worth it.

1341
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:20,960
As a Solus patron, you sometimes can get access to ISOs a little earlier.

1342
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:26,000
You just get an idea of what's coming down, like information about the new app center.

1343
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
It's nice.

1344
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,080
It's nice as a user of the distribution to have access to this kind of stuff, and they

1345
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,440
actually give you value.

1346
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,440
Patreon.com slash solus.

1347
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,960
For our people supporting us, I will just say one more thing.

1348
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,040
You're not just supporting Solus as is.

1349
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:43,040
You're supporting our efforts and other projects as well.

1350
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:48,520
Brisk menu, not quite because our beloved Wimpy is actually supporting Brisk menu, but

1351
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,600
we've got projects.

1352
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,520
There's upstream contributions to GNOME, to MATE.

1353
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,840
There's software that we have that's used everywhere else.

1354
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,720
You've got the Budgie desktop as well that that supports.

1355
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:05,080
The MATE slate notification theme, Linux driver management, which is becoming quite sexy to

1356
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,640
axe derivatives, so they'll end up using that as well.

1357
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,160
There's a whole slew of that stuff around there.

1358
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:15,860
If you are our patrons, obviously you're supporting us and enabling us to do this.

1359
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:21,400
We will keep bribing you with secret ISOs and stuff so you do get goodies.

1360
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,400
Very nice.

1361
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,400
Yeah.

1362
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,560
I think Patreon is becoming a good way to support folks like Ubuntu MATE, like the

1363
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:35,960
BcashFS developer, like Aiki and the entire Solus project, I think – and Jupyter Broadcasting.

1364
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:41,160
I think it's because – it's not because people want to make money off the internet.

1365
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:49,460
It's because having patron funded either content or software development aligns the

1366
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:56,680
goals of the project or the broadcaster with the intentions, expectations and goals of

1367
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,300
the patron.

1368
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,300
Not the advertiser or not a donor or –

1369
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,300
Yeah.

1370
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,300
There's no third party.

1371
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,300
It's just you and them.

1372
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:13,280
It's a very clean, honest incentive and reward system that I think works particularly

1373
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:17,200
well in both content creation and in open source software development.

1374
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,640
So it's – if you've been resistant to Patreon in the past, I would ask you to reconsider

1375
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,760
not just because obviously it's in my best interest but because I also think it's a

1376
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:29,720
way for us to get to sustainable software development for things that large corporations

1377
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:36,000
or whatever don't find a particular motivation to invest in where we as end users who have

1378
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,520
typically been underrepresented because Linux itself is underrepresented have been just

1379
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,760
left to suffer.

1380
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:47,440
We now have a way to directly vote with our wallet that is completely unrelated to market

1381
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:53,960
share or strategic goals of Google or Apple or Microsoft and is directly connected to

1382
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:59,160
what we want to see happen on the Linux desktop or in Linux content creation, et cetera.

1383
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:03,600
I think that is one of the biggest things that we're not really discussing because

1384
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,880
it sounds over self-serving if I talk about it too much.

1385
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,920
But with – now that I can plug Aiki's Patreon, I have an excuse to say that, patreon.com

1386
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,400
slash solace.

1387
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,480
Great work Aiki.

1388
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:19,800
Very excited for you as somebody who also quit a very great job to do this passion project.

1389
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:24,160
I think it serves the soul and when you end up doing what you love, you invest more in

1390
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:27,200
it than – you work harder than you ever have which almost seems like an impossible

1391
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,600
statement for me to say to you right now because you've worked so hard already but I can

1392
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,520
tell you, you'll work harder than you ever have and it will be more rewarding than it

1393
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,520
ever has.

1394
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,520
So I'm very excited for you.

1395
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,520
Yeah.

1396
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,520
We're excited to see what comes of it.

1397
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,520
Thank you.

1398
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,520
Thank you for joining us too.

1399
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,400
It's just so – I feel like it's a birthday or like a baby's been born or

1400
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,400
something.

1401
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,400
It's Aiki Day.

1402
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,400
Okay.

1403
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:50,080
So I also want to talk about a very exciting project that is bringing something that's

1404
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:54,480
been locked down to Windows users or proprietary device users and now it's available to all

1405
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,480
of us.

1406
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:59,080
And it's much further along than I expected and much easier to get started with.

1407
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,080
But you know –

1408
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,440
You're talking about Windows Defender, right?

1409
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,440
We can run that on Linux now.

1410
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:03,440
Thank you.

1411
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,440
Yes.

1412
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,440
You know that is actually a story.

1413
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,440
You do know that.

1414
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:07,440
I do know that.

1415
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,620
He does know that because it was one of the stories we discussed covering in this show.

1416
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:10,620
So he knows.

1417
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:14,520
And I just like – when I saw that, that is such a clickbait.

1418
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,400
When I saw that, Wes, I was like that's brilliant clickbait.

1419
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:21,520
I mean the old IT admin in you, you want those firewalls, you couldn't find a great one

1420
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,520
on Linux.

1421
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,160
Do you know the funny nuance story – the thing about that guy that got all that working?

1422
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,480
Do you know what the funny thing is?

1423
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,480
He's a Google employee.

1424
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,480
Yeah.

1425
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,480
That's right.

1426
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,480
Did you know that?

1427
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,480
You did?

1428
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,480
All right.

1429
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:33,480
So let's talk about your mind for a second.

1430
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,480
Let's go a little Ben Folds.

1431
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,480
Let's talk about your mind.

1432
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,580
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1433
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:43,080
Go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial.

1434
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:52,320
Linux Academy is like a classroom in the sky, like an academy, like some sort of academy

1435
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,800
but in the sky that you connect to telepathically.

1436
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:56,800
How about that?

1437
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:57,800
Is that –

1438
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,800
Cloud Academy.

1439
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,800
Wait.

1440
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:00,800
Hold on.

1441
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:01,800
I'm getting a note here.

1442
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:02,800
No, that is not correct.

1443
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,840
That is not how I should – it is a platform and it does teach you about Linux and all

1444
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:08,080
the things around Linux that you would want for your – but it is not actually an academy

1445
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,080
in the sky.

1446
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,720
I think I was thinking – I think I was thinking of Iron Man.

1447
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,400
Anyways, LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1448
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,400
You go there.

1449
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,400
You support the show.

1450
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,740
You get a seven-day free trial and you can see really how it works.

1451
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:24,280
Get a little taste of the hands-on labs or the learning paths, the practice exams, which

1452
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,720
I want to talk about more here in a second, or the video courses, self-paced in-depth

1453
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:30,360
video courses on every Linux, Cloud, and DevOps topic.

1454
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:34,300
They have a vibrant community stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members that are there

1455
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:38,360
to help you learn and enrich their experience and they do that through parts of the Linux

1456
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:41,840
Academy experience that are actually forkable by the community and if you're busy and

1457
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,940
I understand, especially as a father of three and a small business owner, you can be very

1458
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:45,940
busy.

1459
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:46,940
It's hard to fit this stuff in.

1460
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:50,820
That's why I really appreciate the Linux Academy course scheduler.

1461
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:54,080
You can pick a course and then there will be a time frame that you can work with.

1462
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,080
You set that up.

1463
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,320
It will help you keep with that.

1464
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:00,320
It will set goals for you along the way so it can be flexible and if you ever get stuck

1465
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,420
and need help, instructor mentoring a real human being is available.

1466
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:07,680
If you're on the go, if you've got some downtime on community transit or if you're a passenger

1467
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:11,360
in a carpool, check out their iOS and Android apps to study on the go.

1468
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,480
They have cloud servers.

1469
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,600
They spin up when you need them, USSHN.

1470
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,480
They have nuggets which are their cute way of saying if you've just got a little bit

1471
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:21,120
of time or you just want to do like a single topic, maybe you've got two hours and you

1472
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,040
want to do it like it's five minutes to two hours, like you've got some time, a little

1473
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:27,880
bit of time, single topic, deep dive and then you've got study guides you can download

1474
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:32,640
and take with you, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1475
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:38,520
So the blog's got a what to expect when you're testing for the Red Hat exams.

1476
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:43,000
They have a poll rundown of what practice exams you should take, how to prepare yourself

1477
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,200
beforehand, all of it.

1478
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:48,040
It's nice because I know that's popular in the audience and this is a good way to get

1479
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,040
ready.

1480
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,600
You don't even have to really subscribe to Linux Academy to read the blog.

1481
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,600
Yeah.

1482
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,440
You'll get a taste of it right there, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux

1483
01:13:55,440 --> 01:14:01,360
Academy for sponsoring this here podcast, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, a platform

1484
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,960
for learning more about Linux by Linux enthusiasts.

1485
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:12,280
So Moonlight, it's not like a project to run mono on Linux.

1486
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,280
That's what I was hoping for.

1487
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,280
Were you, Wes?

1488
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,280
Yeah.

1489
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,280
Yeah.

1490
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,280
Lots of demand for that these days.

1491
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,280
Remember mono, everybody?

1492
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,280
What a big deal that was.

1493
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:25,640
So Moonlight is an open source Nvidia game stream client.

1494
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:31,340
Now stick with me, stick with me, because I actually think this is a huge deal.

1495
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:38,640
Because it takes the Nvidia GeForce streaming crap that you could only, the game stream,

1496
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,400
that you could stream to a couple of tablets and the Nvidia Shield TV, which rocks.

1497
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,240
Oh yeah, you would mention that.

1498
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:53,240
And I think a Windows client, it was something that Steam kind of worked on, but some people

1499
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:57,560
say this is nicer, and it was something that Linux users just couldn't get access to.

1500
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:02,760
And it kind of bugs me, because I've thought about, my kids have asked for, because people

1501
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,680
at school tell them about these games, so my kids have been like, dad, we want Windows.

1502
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,640
I'm like, not happening.

1503
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,640
Not happening.

1504
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,840
And so the first time they asked, I was like, okay, we won't talk about that.

1505
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,200
The second time they asked, okay, he doesn't know what he's talking about, we won't talk

1506
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,200
about that.

1507
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:18,160
The third time they asked, I thought, nope, nope, we're not gonna talk about that.

1508
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:23,000
And then the fourth time they've asked, I thought, well, what if I did game streaming?

1509
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,480
So I've been sniffing around, and I found Moonlight, and I like the way it smells.

1510
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:32,000
So Moonlight allows you to stream your collection of games from a game stream compatible PC,

1511
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,880
read Windows, I'll tell you more about that in a second, to any supported device, remotely.

1512
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,480
It's perfect for game play, even on the go.

1513
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:46,000
You can stream to Android tablets, you can stream to Macs, you can stream to Linux boxes,

1514
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
of course.

1515
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
No way!

1516
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:54,200
Low latency, 60 frames per second, yes, really, controller support, iOS, Android, you can

1517
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:57,560
even have a Raspberry Pi as the end streaming client.

1518
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,560
Is that right?

1519
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,120
You can turn a Raspberry Pi, I'm gonna say it again, into the end streaming client.

1520
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:04,040
So I can just throw my Xbox right in the garbage.

1521
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:05,040
Throw it away.

1522
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,040
Put it in the garbage.

1523
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,040
Yeah.

1524
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,040
Just put it in the garbage.

1525
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,040
I got this Pi.

1526
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,040
Put it in the garbage.

1527
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,040
Put it in the garbage here at the studio, West, would you?

1528
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,040
Yeah.

1529
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:13,040
Just put it in the garbage.

1530
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,040
Yeah.

1531
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:22,120
Because, the reason for this is, it's really just using video streaming, and a client

1532
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:26,720
that expresses back and forth the different input controls, and it shows up, and there's

1533
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:31,160
a little piece of software that looks for the game controller and stuff, and it communicates

1534
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:36,720
it back to the streaming PC, and then it sends everything over an H.264 stream, basically.

1535
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:37,720
Okay, yeah.

1536
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,920
A GPU accelerated H.264.

1537
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,920
So that's part of the magic, is the GPU, the NVIDIA, you have to have a system with an

1538
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:49,040
NVIDIA GPU, and I have the requirements in the show notes, and it has to be running Windows,

1539
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:56,280
so my vision was something that has a 600 plus NVIDIA GTX card, which is probably anything

1540
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,280
still running anymore.

1541
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,280
Yeah.

1542
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:02,560
I mean, I'm sure that's wrong, but anybody that's remotely interested in playing games

1543
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,560
is probably...

1544
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:04,560
Yeah.

1545
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,560
Yeah.

1546
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,560
Check.

1547
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:12,520
And AMD's GPUs are not supported, because this is an NVIDIA thing.

1548
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:17,400
And you have to have a 720p or higher display connected to the PC.

1549
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,800
No standard definition for you guys.

1550
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,800
Yeah.

1551
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,640
The one thing I'm going to test is there are, from my Bitcoin mining days, I know there

1552
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:25,720
are some plugs you can put in the back of the video cards to make it think there's a

1553
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:26,880
monitor attached.

1554
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:31,400
So there's a display, we'll see if that's really truly required, but here's my idea

1555
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:38,320
is put a decent-ish older, but decent, I've got a GTX 970 card I think I could put in

1556
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:44,920
there, and put that in the garage, and then use this to stream to a Raspberry Pi device.

1557
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:45,920
Yeah.

1558
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:46,920
That sounds fun.

1559
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:47,920
Maybe.

1560
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:48,920
Yeah.

1561
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:49,920
Because I was thinking I should have it.

1562
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,360
What kind of controller are you going to go with?

1563
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,360
Ethernet.

1564
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:57,360
Probably the... I guess for them, maybe actually the 360 controller.

1565
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,440
I was going to say I have the Steam controller.

1566
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,440
Oh, you have a Steam controller.

1567
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,440
Right.

1568
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,440
Yeah, of course.

1569
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,680
But I think actually my kids would probably do better with the Xbox 360 controller.

1570
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:11,220
I might be grasping at straws, but Moonlight to me seems like a potential project to keep

1571
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:15,160
my kids on Linux, but give them access to a couple of games that are exclusive to the

1572
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,160
Windows platform.

1573
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,960
I don't know if a Raspberry Pi is going to do it.

1574
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,640
I might also experiment with the iOS apps.

1575
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,280
I think I might experiment with just setting up a client on the Linux machine because there's

1576
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,280
a Java client.

1577
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,280
Okay.

1578
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,280
Interesting.

1579
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,280
Yeah.

1580
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,600
Yeah, which Java is working fine on their machines, so I might try that.

1581
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,520
And then, and this is what I thought, well, for shits and giggles, I might give it a try.

1582
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:41,800
There's also a Chrome extension to act as a client to Moonlight streaming.

1583
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,800
That'd be convenient.

1584
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,920
It would be actually kind of great in a way.

1585
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:51,720
Any system you have this on, you could theoretically connect to your Moonlight server and start

1586
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,880
gaming if you forwarded the ports on your firewall.

1587
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,300
Or your kid's got a Chromebook.

1588
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:59,320
You don't really want them using your nice work machine, but they can use your-

1589
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:00,320
Oh, yes.

1590
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,120
Actually, they have Chromebooks at school, so conceivably they will be bringing them

1591
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,880
home someday, I suppose, as they go up in grade.

1592
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,800
Or Dylan just really needs to play Race the Sun.

1593
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,560
He doesn't want to listen to the instructor.

1594
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:12,560
That need is real.

1595
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,560
That is a real thing.

1596
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,560
We've all been there.

1597
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,600
Yeah, of course we have.

1598
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:21,160
So Moonlight's the project, Moonlight-stream.com, if you want to check it out.

1599
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:25,920
And yes, they support... So when you try it out, you can see, yeah, Chrome, then they

1600
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,360
have a Java client that works on Linux and Windows and Mac, and then they have the Raspberry

1601
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:39,160
Pi particular image, which fascinates me, because if it makes a really easy appliance,

1602
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:42,080
then anytime they have an issue, like, well, Dad just gives you a new SD card with a new

1603
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,720
Raspberry Pi, because I've got two of them sitting right here.

1604
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:45,800
There you go, kids.

1605
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,800
That fixes it.

1606
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:47,800
Plug that in.

1607
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:48,800
And then problem solved.

1608
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,240
Like, if the Raspberry Pi thing works and it's super appliance-like, that could be a

1609
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:55,760
game changer for this whole thing, because then it takes my troubleshooting down to basically

1610
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,760
nothing.

1611
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:57,760
I like that.

1612
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,200
And then, are you ready for this last one, which I'm never going to really test out?

1613
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,200
Well, maybe.

1614
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,440
No, I'm never going to test this out.

1615
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:07,200
They have an unofficial port to the Samsung Gear VR.

1616
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,200
Oh, cool.

1617
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,200
I guess.

1618
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,200
Maybe.

1619
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,200
I don't know.

1620
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,200
I don't know.

1621
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,200
I'd have to have wimpy things.

1622
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,960
But I'll be interested to see about that monitor thing, because it makes me think, like, I

1623
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:23,280
wonder, could you go run this on some cloud GPU box, and then, oh, I don't have my nice

1624
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,280
machine on me.

1625
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,280
But I really want to.

1626
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,720
I'm sure the latency would be terrible, but it might be worth trying.

1627
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:29,720
Yeah.

1628
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:34,680
To me, it's funny you say that, because it did make me think, like, well, what if I could

1629
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,680
project the entire desktop this way?

1630
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:41,920
And I don't know, like, I'd want the Windows desktop, but if you could use this, I guess

1631
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,800
it's reliant on the GPU feature.

1632
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,600
So I mean, it's driver-dependent.

1633
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:52,720
But it'd be such a great way to maybe, instead of use Wine, to have a Windows application

1634
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:56,000
like AutoCAD or something like that on Linux.

1635
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Yeah.

1636
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Or Photoshop.

1637
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Or Premiere.

1638
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Yeah, that's an interesting idea.

1639
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,080
Of course, you wouldn't have local file system access, because it's on the remote system.

1640
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,240
You could have a mounted remote file system.

1641
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:09,040
Yeah, you'd have to have, like, or a NAS that both systems are connected to.

1642
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,040
That might be legit.

1643
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,040
Man.

1644
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,040
Yeah, it is.

1645
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,040
It's an open source.

1646
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,040
Oh, so anyways, OK.

1647
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,040
I'm saying that a lot.

1648
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,040
I apologize.

1649
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,040
Yeah.

1650
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,800
If you take a shot, everybody, we should create a game, and then put it in the comments.

1651
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,960
Every time I say, anyways, you have to take a shot.

1652
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,720
The thing that I was like, geez, this thing seems really far along.

1653
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:25,720
How much does it cost?

1654
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:26,720
Well, yeah.

1655
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:27,720
I mean, what the hell?

1656
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,320
How can something like this be this far along?

1657
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,480
How the hell did they get this to work?

1658
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:38,040
It's created by Case Western Reserve University as a project at the mHacks hackathon.

1659
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:42,600
And then it was taken from that at another hackathon in 2014, and now it's a project

1660
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,160
that is ongoing.

1661
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:45,160
Wow.

1662
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,160
That's neat.

1663
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,160
I thought so, too.

1664
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,160
That's a worthy project.

1665
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,160
That's great.

1666
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,160
I thought that was...

1667
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,160
And it seemed really complete.

1668
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,720
And I'm like, how the hell can this be such a thing?

1669
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:53,720
It's up on GitHub.

1670
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:54,720
It's open source.

1671
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,720
It's nice to have it on the...

1672
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:58,160
Because, like, the Steam streaming stuff, it was always like, all right, well, they

1673
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:01,680
kind of just, like, you know, put it out there, but there hasn't been much happening with

1674
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:02,680
it.

1675
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:05,440
And then on the NVIDIA side of stuff, for me, I was like, geez, if I could take a little

1676
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:10,320
PC with a 970 in it that has this capability and put it in the garage, and it's just they

1677
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,840
never touch it, and it just launches these games for them.

1678
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,840
Yeah.

1679
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:15,840
That'd be awesome.

1680
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:16,840
That's super great.

1681
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:22,580
But I was never going to do it if I had to have them using an NVIDIA Shield or a specific

1682
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:24,800
device that supports NVIDIA Game Stream.

1683
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,160
It's a lot less useful.

1684
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,240
That was never going to happen.

1685
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:33,640
But now that it can be anything from a Raspberry Pi to their Linux laptop, done.

1686
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:36,160
Check it out.

1687
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:39,280
And if you've played around with it, too, let me know at ChrisLAS.

1688
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:43,120
I would be really curious to know about how that's gone for you.

1689
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:47,360
So just a reminder, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, if you want to come to our episode

1690
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,360
200 meetup.

1691
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,960
It's going to be, I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

1692
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:52,960
I don't know how much...

1693
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:53,960
We'll try to stream some of it.

1694
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,620
I'll put, like, a camera out the window or something.

1695
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:59,560
So if you can't make it in person, which would be 99.9% of you.

1696
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,560
We'll try to make it.

1697
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,800
Something will happen at jblive.tv.

1698
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,320
Maybe I'll just have Wes run around inside the studio.

1699
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,960
Maybe I'll just do that.

1700
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,520
You could chase me with the drone.

1701
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,520
That'd be pretty good.

1702
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,640
That'd be pretty good, Wes.

1703
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:14,640
That actually, you know...

1704
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:17,520
I wonder if we could figure out a way to livestream from the drone so we can make sure that goes

1705
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:18,520
out on the livestream.

1706
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,520
That would be amazing.

1707
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,520
All right.

1708
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:25,560
Well, if you want a little more of Wes Payne, check out this week's User Air.

1709
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,680
I think it was episode 12.

1710
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:32,240
Or go grab yourself any recent episode of the TechSnap program.

1711
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,800
We subscribe to that and get Wes every single week.

1712
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,960
Check back here on Tuesdays where we do this show live.

1713
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,080
We'd really love to have you on our virtual log.

1714
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,080
You're welcome.

1715
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,360
We just check your mic and then we get you in.

1716
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:46,160
Go to jblive.tv, join our chat room, and then do Bang Mumble to get all the info.

1717
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:48,360
And join us on our virtual log and take part of the conversation.

1718
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,840
We'd love to hear from you.

1719
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:50,840
Thanks for being here.

1720
01:23:50,840 --> 01:24:08,040
We'll be right back here next week.

1721
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:31,960
Bye.

1722
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:45,720
All right, JBtitles.com.

1723
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,720
Thank you, Mumble Room.

1724
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,720
Yeah.

1725
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,720
Fantastic and wonderful, as always, JBtitles.

1726
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:53,360
You know, if Gnome was as reliable as the Mumble Room, we wouldn't have those kinds

1727
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,360
of problems.

1728
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:58,160
Yeah, we really almost made it through the whole episode without a crash.

1729
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:01,360
So I don't think people in the final version, I don't think we made any mention of it in

1730
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,360
the show.

1731
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,280
But yeah, we had another Gnome crash.

1732
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:09,600
And yes, I haven't replaced it yet because honestly, I got other things to do.

1733
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,040
We put this in here and it's just supposed to be working.

1734
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,240
And it almost, it's like 90%, just works.

1735
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:18,360
Yeah, it really is just pretty much during the shows that it seems to crash.

1736
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:24,000
It sits here and runs over the weekend, although I suppose it could be crashing and we just

1737
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,780
don't know it because the stream does eventually come back on its own.

1738
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:28,780
So who really knows?

1739
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,880
So no, it can't actually do work.

1740
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,880
Well, who knows really what the cause is?

1741
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:38,560
And by the way, for the record, I got a few people that have snicker snicker Arch, well,

1742
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,120
that's what he gets for running Arch.

1743
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:46,100
Well, first of all, first of all, LTS kernel and LTS Nvidia driver.

1744
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:51,800
And I suspect that the, and it's not like Gnome has changed in the last three months.

1745
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:59,120
So I suspect that our culprit lies somewhere in either an Nvidia driver bug, something

1746
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:05,580
happening between OpenGL and the Nvidia driver or OBS OpenGL and the Nvidia driver or something

1747
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:07,840
that causes Gnome to take a shit.

1748
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:12,000
And then when Gnome takes a shit, it reboots and in the reboot process, Paul's audio restarts

1749
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:18,500
and technically the recording never stops, but we lose all audio for a bit.

1750
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:25,240
So if Paul's didn't poop out, but what happens is we go back to GDM and then we go back and

1751
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:32,160
then we go back to GDM and then we go back in and in that process, Paul's takes a shit.

1752
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:36,000
And people have suggested we switch to every distribution under the sun.

1753
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,280
People suggested we switch to XFCE or LXQT.

1754
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:45,560
Maybe we should just run OBS in an accession, just a single window full screen.

1755
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,560
You know, maybe.

1756
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,040
I'm suggesting ZOS, just so people can suggest it.

1757
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,040
Yeah.

1758
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,800
The only thing that hasn't been suggested is Mac OS or Windows.

1759
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,000
Pretty much everything else has been suggested.

1760
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:04,440
Heart and Solus, how come nobody's voting?

1761
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,440
JBtitles.com.

1762
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:08,160
I mean, people are voting, but it's pretty widely spread out.

1763
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,160
Look at that.

1764
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,160
Holy shit.

1765
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:13,280
That's one of the widest spreads we've had in a while.

1766
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,160
We got to hone that in a little bit.

1767
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,160
Get that.

1768
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,160
You spread it wide over there, Chris.

1769
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,160
Yeah.

1770
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:25,120
And the lights come on because we're getting...

1771
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,160
So now you can look with the lights on, you can actually see the touch screen.

1772
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,160
Oh, yeah.

1773
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,160
Look at that.

1774
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,160
Yeah.

1775
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,160
And we're getting ready for Tech Snap.

1776
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,160
All right.

1777
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:36,240
So he gets a promotion, Gnome's Bad Touch.

1778
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,240
No, that was from the pre-show.

1779
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,240
Let's see.

1780
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,000
It was just so funny.

1781
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,320
Soul has Plugged.

1782
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:44,320
Heart and Solus.

1783
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,320
Really, guys?

1784
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:46,320
That's what we're doing?

1785
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:49,600
We're doing Heart and Solus right now?

1786
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,160
The fuck's the matter with you guys?

1787
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,160
Come on.

1788
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,160
You know better than that.

1789
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:54,160
WD.

1790
01:27:54,160 --> 01:28:11,440
You know, Huey Lewis had the newest song.
