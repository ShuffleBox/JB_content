00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged, Episode 15, for November 19th, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,600
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's applying

3
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,000
all its updates before we do our online banking every single week. My name is Chris.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Matt.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hey Matt, welcome to Episode 15, buddy.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Thanks for having me.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Now, I might not be, um, I might not be giving the whole situation enough of its due, but

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,480
I felt like that line right there was all we needed to say about this whole mint canonical

9
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,000
controversy that erupted over the last couple of days.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
No kidding.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,920
You and I, here we go. We put out a nice Linux action show talking about OpenSUSE 13.1. Meanwhile,

12
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,600
the whole interwebs blows up because somebody three weeks ago on a mailing list said something

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,920
and then some other blog picks that up and then Slashdot picks it up and then it goes

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
crazy, Matt.

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,040
Well, it's almost like someone peed someone's Cheerios. I mean, really, it's like, come

16
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,040
on people.

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,040
That actually would have been more newsworthy.

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,320
It would have been, right.

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,720
That would have been a more interesting topic. Uh, so, you know, this week, this week, it's

20
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,880
interesting. I, every now and then I'm a bit of a slow man and it takes me a while to realize

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,920
that there's trends that happen in my inbox. We get lots of email from the Linux action

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,560
show and now this show as well. And a lot of new users that are looking to switch over

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,080
to Linux and trying to, trying to do their investigation, right? Trying to suss out the

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,800
situation before they move over, they'll tune into the Linux action show, watch our how

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,600
tos, watch, watch the news, just kind of get a feel for it, which totally makes sense because

26
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,240
if I was switching to Linux back in the day when podcasts, there weren't any podcasts

27
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,800
really. I mean, I think there was some podcasts, but there wasn't really any major Linux podcasts

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,600
and I would have totally loved that. So it totally makes sense. But what I, what I failed

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,640
to really notice is we've been getting a lot of emails about people switching from Windows

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,820
to Linux and for a lot of the reasons you might suspect, but there's a catch. The switching

31
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,320
is not going very well.

32
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,720
No, no. There's definitely some bumps in the road, some hurdles along the way and whatnot.

33
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,180
Yeah. And, and some people are, are, um, I think sometimes they're sold a bit of, a bit

34
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,520
of bag of goods as it were. And they're kind of told all switch one-to-one replacements

35
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,600
for your applications, stability, security, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then they

36
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,100
switch over and they're in, they ended up maybe a little disappointed or something doesn't

37
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,080
work the way they want. They end up in the end disenfranchised and they go back to their

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,360
Windows and they huddle down and they stay there even longer. And they say, well, I'll

39
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,240
just live it out. I'll just make it work over here on Windows. And so this week we're going

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,760
to pull in our mumble room. That's our online Linux users group. Matt and I are going to

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,680
kick around as long time Linux users and people who've, you know, run multiple OSs and helped

42
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,360
lots of people switch over to Linux.

43
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
Oh yeah.

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,200
I want to just, you know, we're just going to have a frank discussion about the legitimate

45
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,280
downsides. If you are a full fledged alternative operating system user and you're going to

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,240
move over to Linux, there's some things that might not go very smooth. And I don't feel

47
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,960
like there's enough places out there that are talking about that stuff, frankly.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,680
That's true. Actually, you know, I think you nailed the nailed it on the head there because

49
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,920
I think the big piece of it with any distribution out there, especially the ones targeting newbies

50
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,760
because they're the worst offenders and that they have this great experience waiting for

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,800
people. But there's things that folks need to be aware of and it's not always attractive

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,560
from a visual standpoint or even from an experience standpoint to spend a lot of time talking

53
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,520
about it because then you're detracting from the value of that particular decision. And

54
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,080
that's where it gets funky for. And I can see where they're coming from, but still.

55
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,040
It is hard. It is hard. You know what? Essentially what you're saying is that sometimes it's

56
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,840
hard to talk about this kind of stuff.

57
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
It is.

58
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,720
Because, I don't know, you know, you got a little skin in the game.

59
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,000
I mean, we can talk about it, but at the same time, I think if I'm running, you know, Jim

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Bob's, you know, virtual Linux thing or whatever it is and they're trying to switch to my distro,

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,360
I'm a little gun shy about saying, oh, hey, by the way, here's a list of things that might

62
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,880
stop you. That's a funky spot to be.

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,840
Well, and I'll be honest, I'm a Linux advocate, right? So I like talking about all of the

64
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,760
stuff Linux does really well, right? And all the stuff that's really cool in Linux. I don't

65
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,480
like to so much talk. I don't even like to focus on the stuff it does really bad. So

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,560
I've brought a third co-host to the show this week. His name is Woodinville Whiskey Bourbon.

67
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:37,280
And actually, I figured I picked up this bourbon whiskey from, you know, the alcohol store,

68
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,040
whatever you call it. And it is a local brew. Micro Barreled, they call it, Matt. Have you

69
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
ever heard of that?

70
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Micro Barreled.

71
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,600
This is batch number eight and bottle 115 handwritten on the bottle too, I might add.

72
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,240
I mean, I lived in a state with drive through liquor stores once, but I've not experienced

73
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
a Micro Barreled.

74
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
So, wow.

75
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,040
I mean, you know, for when you're too drunk to get out of your car.

76
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,640
Yeah, right. Yeah. This is crafted entirely by hand in a small batches and aged to maturity

77
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,880
in a new charred American oak barrel. The demanding process results in extremely rich

78
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,000
and full bodied bourbon whiskey. So I'm going to be drinking that today to help bring out

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,920
the honesty. That'll be my, that's my honesty gateway this week.

80
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
That works. That works.

81
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,800
Still fighting through some of the tech issues we talked about last week on the show. I feel

82
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,920
like I actually haven't really solved any of them, but I've learned like the new way

83
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,680
to mitigate them to just create a new normal, which is a lot more work, takes about 45 minutes

84
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,880
more, which I've whittled down from two hours. It takes about 45 minutes per show. I'm going

85
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,240
to do some more work tonight. So there's not going to be a live side by tonight, but it'll

86
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,440
be on her, she's going to do a hangout on her Google Plus page if you search for Heather

87
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,600
on Google Plus.

88
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,680
So you know, still going through a lot of, a lot of troubleshooting there. Had some great

89
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,120
suggestions from folks that have heard of different solutions to try it on Linux. You

90
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,160
know, all of them I've heard of so far, but I still love getting those because you know,

91
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,640
if I could do, if I could do the bulk of this on Linux, man, even if I had to do a bunch

92
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,400
of work at this point, I'm already doing a whole bunch of work.

93
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,320
So exactly. There may be that eventual update to where, you know, blurb comes out and you're

94
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,680
like, oh hey, that wasn't there before.

95
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,800
You know what, they just released an update today. I haven't tried it obviously cause

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,360
I didn't want to mess with the show, but I'm going to install it tonight. So we'll see

97
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
how it goes.

98
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,640
All right. Well I wanted to, I wanted to get to some emails. We like to do the, we like

99
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,760
to do some followup emails that are sort of continuing threads that we've had in previous

100
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,820
shows here at the top of Unplugged. That way every show is, we're not like Star Trek here

101
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,120
on Unplugged and I love me some Star Trek, but Star Trek did the monster of the week

102
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,280
and that way they could syndicate. We don't have, we don't have those pressures here on

103
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,820
the Unplugged show. We like to do a continuing thread. So the Unplugged show is an evolving

104
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,960
storyline that takes place across a whole series of episodes. That way we make you listen

105
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:50,360
to all of them. And so going back a ways in our threads is OwnCloud. We talked about OwnCloud

106
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,280
a lot. Big OwnCloud fan. I don't actually have an OwnCloud installation in production

107
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,840
cause I'm kind of waiting for a few things to kind of work themselves out, waiting for

108
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,400
the next version. However, I know a lot of you out there have it and we also have the

109
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,800
JB Cloud that people are experimenting with. So Richard wrote in and this one was a little

110
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,240
bit of a warning to any of you running your OwnCloud installation on an SSD with Trim

111
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,040
enabled. He said, I had an existing home server running an established OwnCloud setup with

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:22,640
a laptop running an OwnCloud client on my SSD. I upgraded my home server to Mint 15,

113
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:28,240
reformatted my drives and did a full reinstall of everything including OwnCloud. No issues.

114
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,280
On my laptop client, I tried to reestablish the OwnCloud sync and push my files back up

115
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,120
to the server. It briefly showed a screen with two options, which I seem to remember

116
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,920
asking which way to sync. It defaulted to the one where the local files would push to

117
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,840
the server. The other option had a warning about data loss. Since I defaulted to the

118
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:51,120
right value, I clicked next. I sat back with a smile thinking that was easy until I got

119
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
a notification.

120
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,480
That's your first mistake right there is you sat back, you got all cocky, your big old

121
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,960
smile and you thought that was easy.

122
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,760
Pulled the staples right there. All right. Until I got a notification that it was unable

123
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,000
to delete a file that I was editing. What the F, he said. I quickly looked at my document

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,840
structure and it was gone. It synced my laptop to match the empty OwnCloud installation.

125
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,880
Even if I did pick the wrong option, would a are you sure you want to do this prompt

126
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,280
have been that hard? He's a little burned there. He said, I killed the power and booted

127
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,680
up on a live disk and proceeded to try to get the data back. I had all my favorite go

128
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,800
tos for the data recovery, such as test disk said it was unrecoverable. Then as I dug deeper

129
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,080
with Google's researching, undelete on extended for became clear. SSD with trim support means

130
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,920
deleted files are unrecoverable.

131
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,660
While this isn't a little side effect ever talked about and why isn't this ever talked

132
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:51,560
about in SSD conversations. I've never heard of this fact stated in last or text out discussions

133
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,520
with SSDs either. I would have have been a little more careful had I known this when

134
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,400
I switched to SSDs. I was using OwnCloud with its versioning as a backup strategy for

135
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,600
documents not safe for Dropbox, consulting documents, uh-huh, and accepted some short

136
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,440
term risk to rebuild the server knowing that I had another copy on the laptop. This is

137
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,240
exactly why the data must reside in three locations or else it doesn't exist. Two is

138
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,420
not enough. I had an older outdated backup on a Windows home server share, but about

139
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,000
two months of documents that were not safe to sync to Dropbox were lost. Please remind

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,440
users that switching SSD means you lose the option of data recovery undelete with them.

141
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,680
And you know, Richard, I've also heard the opposite side of that where because the way

142
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,800
an SSD can kind of randomize the way it writes to a file, to a disk, in some cases when you

143
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,380
try to do like an overwrite, sometimes it doesn't necessarily overwrite all the files.

144
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,960
So we're still kind of learning really some of the challenges of SSDs because not everybody

145
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,160
switched over yet. So they don't have the mass adoption that, you know, a spinning disk

146
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
does.

147
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
That's true.

148
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,480
But this is a hard thing because like you want to have the master authority generally

149
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,540
be the central server. That's generally how you avoid all these sync conflicts.

150
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,800
But at the same time, and this of course there's exceptions to this rule, large media files,

151
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,920
things like that obviously are in limit. But for the most part, you know, they were talking

152
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,400
about backing up in three locations. One of those three locations needs to be offsite,

153
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,720
whether that's physically in a physical drive in another location or in the cloud or whatever

154
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,000
you're comfortable with. But, you know, for something like this to happen, that's kind

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
of the whole thing of it.

156
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,600
As far as something like this happening, yeah, I think that we need more SSD action taking

157
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,520
place out there so we can kind of gauge what other little surprises are out there.

158
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,360
Yeah, and this is stuff we'll hit. You know, I'm pretty much all SSDs these days as I can.

159
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,400
And so I'll experiment more with this. You know, his point is well taken. And this is

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,980
why I've – so here's – we had an email this week. So Chris, you know, you talked

161
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,520
about your backups but you'd never really said what you've landed on.

162
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,520
And I really haven't landed on a good one except for anything that's important I store

163
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,560
in either BitTorrent Sync or directly on my Synology. Now, if I put it in BitTorrent Sync,

164
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,680
it syncs to my Synology. And then everything that's in this important data area on my

165
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,400
Synology NAS goes to Spyderoak. And that's how I'm doing my back – I'm not doing

166
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:14,120
like nightly backups on my laptop, right? I just don't – I don't have time. And

167
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,740
to be completely honest, setting up a new installation is kind of like playing a video

168
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,700
game for me. So, you know, if I got to set aside an evening and stay up super late and

169
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,240
have a few too many drinks to get my KDE configuration rocking, that's a sacrifice I'm willing

170
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,320
to take. So then it's just a matter of moving my data back in. And, you know, to his point,

171
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,480
you got to have multiple copies.

172
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:42,560
And I want to go back to one point in his email. Mint on a server, that's a bad time.

173
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,260
I can't even fathom that. I'm not sure I understand what the – what the advantage

174
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,260
would be.

175
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,260
I'm not sure either.

176
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,260
On the desktop, okay, arguably that's fine.

177
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
Maybe it's also a desktop?

178
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,260
Yeah, that could be.

179
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,280
Maybe it's doing dual duty or something? Because otherwise, go Ubuntu LTS, if you like

180
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:05,480
the Ubuntu underlying system, go Debian, go Cent, whatever. I like Mint, but, you know,

181
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,840
the inherent disadvantage that Mint's always going to have – and Lunteli changed this

182
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,160
– is you need to reinstall to go to the next version. And eventually, if you want

183
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,040
to get security updates, you're going to have to reinstall. And this is the problem

184
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,920
with reloading servers. You know, my approach to a server installation is I'm really hands

185
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,600
off as much as I can be. And that kind of plays into the whole stability thing.

186
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,680
But sorry to hear about that, Richard. I wanted to pass that along to folks out there. You

187
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,520
know, just be careful when you're doing that kind of stuff. It's –

188
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,880
And I agree with him, though, on the whole being prompted. I mean, I totally am on board

189
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,840
with that, that you should be prompted for something like that. I mean, it's kind of

190
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
a –

191
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Yeah. I feel like the old cloud desktop program is still early days a little bit. And it just

192
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,920
doesn't have the deployment level that Dropbox does. So it – you know, things like that

193
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,720
just don't get quite as – identified as much, I guess. So yeah. Bummer, Richard.

194
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,000
All right. Well, next email comes in from Tim. And he's positive in the pragmatic dimension.

195
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Pulling off of last week's title, he said, I hear you guys. I believe in support free

196
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,420
software. However, there is a lot in my life I have to get done and a lot of people who

197
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,920
depend on me and I will use whatever tools available to get it done.

198
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,440
And I remember last week we were saying, even as Linux advocates, we can understand how

199
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,000
sometimes there's reasons not to use Linux if an application you just got to have –

200
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Right.

201
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,960
You got to have it. So he says, I'm beholden to Windows for work. Proprietary software

202
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,360
enterprise applications I have to access and use from home. Yet, I have a free NAS box,

203
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,960
an Ubuntu server, a Roku and a digital ocean droplet for a VPN as well as an Android tablet.

204
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,800
Not to mention a laptop with whatever distro I'm currently learning about. But again,

205
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,760
I have an iPhone from work and I use Windows for my sCrypt miners. It's an economic decision.

206
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,420
I could get better hash rates in plain and simple. And I've noticed this too, sCrypt

207
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:50,920
and also mining Bitcoin, it is much easier to get up and running under Windows. I actually

208
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,000
haven't noticed better hash rates under Windows, but it is easier to get running under

209
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Windows.

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,920
He said, I may get bashed by free software proponents, but this is the world I live in

211
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,200
and I got to get it done every day. Cheers, Tim.

212
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,200
I think he's basically looking at this as there's effective behavior and then there's

213
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,000
ineffective behavior. And that really removes the argument of, well, you can't do it because

214
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,120
that's just not supporting blankety blank. At the end of the day, you have to decide

215
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,680
what's going to provide the most effective outcome that you're seeking. And for him,

216
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,680
that's what's working.

217
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:26,040
Yeah, I think so. I think so. We got an email about switching over to Linux and we got a

218
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,340
lot of these and one of them was quite long. And so I want to read his email to set us

219
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:38,000
up and kind of set the tone of the discussion because we've talked before about switching

220
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,480
to Linux from primarily Windows. I think maybe now we should start talking about switching

221
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,620
from Mac too, because I think there's more and more Macs out there. And I think a lot

222
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,280
of times the way we've kind of just come out and say, yeah, it's going to be great. It's

223
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
going to be awesome.

224
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,360
Sure. It's awesome. Yeah. Just load it up. You'll figure it out.

225
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,200
Yeah. Yeah. So we have an email as a great example of what somebody runs into when they

226
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,560
take that advice. So that'll be a good spot I think for us to kind of frame this conversation

227
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:10,400
plus or you just did a great piece over on Datamation about Linux desktop's missed opportunities.

228
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,160
So we might even just want to start there. So before we dig into that, I want to thank

229
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,640
our first sponsor this week and that my friends is Ting.com. Now Ting is mobile that makes

230
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,360
sense. My service provider and Matt's service provider for mobile. You can get started by

231
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,920
going to linux.ting.com. That'll take $25 off your first month of service or $25 off

232
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,640
your first device if you don't already have a device. Now, one of the things that really

233
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,720
makes Ting stand out is to pay for what you use system. And I want to talk about this

234
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,560
for a little bit. Actually, I'd say there's a few things that really make Ting stand out,

235
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,760
but the pay for what you use system is pretty unique. I don't really know anybody else that's

236
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,600
doing that. So they take your messages, your megabytes and your minutes, and they add it

237
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,420
all up at the end of the month, whatever bucket you fall into. That's all you got to pay.

238
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,400
It's pretty reasonable pricing. It's not like it's going to surprise you because they've

239
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,360
got a very active dashboard. This is where I want to change gears. This dashboard is

240
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,880
really something. So not only do you get a snapshot of where you're at, what your usage

241
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,080
is, what your bills have been, you can manage all of that. You can activate and deactivate

242
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,160
devices. You can manage your voicemail settings. You can manage your call forwarding settings.

243
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,420
You can manage what happens when you get X amount of calls. You can manage all of this

244
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,960
from the most intuitive dashboard I have ever seen to do any of this. And as a long-term

245
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,080
Ting customer, this is the kind of stuff that down the road, other than the amazing savings

246
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,960
you're going to get because each device is just $6 per month. Yeah, $6 per month for

247
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,680
a phone. That's it you guys. That's all you have to pay. And then you just pay for your

248
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,440
usage fairly on top of that. When you combine that with the awesome management of their

249
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,200
dashboard, it really has a long-term solution. It really is awesome. And if you go over to

250
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,880
Ting.com and you're kind of checking things out, you're not quite sure if it's going to

251
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,760
work for you, they have a savings calculator. You can get an idea of what kind of money

252
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,900
savings you're going to see. And if you're worried about your contract with your current

253
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,600
mobile provider, they also have an early termination relief program. Up to 75 bones per line. It's

254
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,480
super easy. You get your phone from Ting. You port your number to Ting. And then you

255
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,640
submit your early termination relief claim to Ting. Now the other great thing about Ting

256
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,120
is they are riding the wave of the investment the Sprint Network is making in LTE right

257
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,580
now. They are trying to roll out LTE. They are on a mad dash right now to roll LTE out

258
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:19,640
to all major nations, all major areas in the United States. So you're going to see a lot

259
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,800
more areas turn up. I happen to be particularly lucky and you might be as well. You can go

260
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,920
check out their coverage map on their website. I live in an area where I get great 3G. I

261
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,640
get great LTE and I also get awesome WiMAX. So I'm sort of benefiting from like all the

262
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,960
major available types of connectivity and that for me is great because I'm a heavy ways

263
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,960
user. So every moment I spend in the car I have a data connection. It's up. It's pulling

264
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,480
down information. The state troopers on our Interstate 5 here are absolutely maniacs.

265
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:57,000
I went up to the, seriously, I went up to the meat store today up in Arlington and four

266
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,200
or five cops on just that between three exits. Waze flags all that stuff for me. So Waze

267
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,000
is an absolute must. And I don't want to have to sit there and worry about am I going to

268
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,560
reach my two gigabyte cap or am I going to, you know, or if I, do I need to, do I need

269
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,680
to make a slightly less phone calls this month? That, all of that honestly feels like a scam.

270
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,240
It all feels like a scam to get my money when I'm just using the service the way I want

271
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,480
to use it and Ting just nukes all of it. They give you control and they give you the tools

272
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,540
to keep control and monitor all of it. Plus they have fantastic Android apps that really

273
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,680
work in concert with all of this stuff. If you're in a small business or if you're in

274
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,560
a family, that six dollars per line from the pooled minutes and you just pay for what you

275
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:43,080
use really works amazingly well. And then to top it all off, Ting has incredible support.

276
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,400
You can call them and somebody answers. You can go to their support forums. They've got

277
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,880
people there discussing stuff. You know, as they're working through the Nexus 5, there's

278
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,760
some awesome threads in there right now about getting Nexus 5 working on Ting. And to see

279
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,640
that just, not only just to see the community kind of take on that, but to see Ting embrace

280
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,560
it, right? Not to try to stamp it down, no, no, don't, don't try to port some unauthorized

281
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,400
device onto our network. Oh, no, they're not about that at all. They embrace the community.

282
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,740
They work with them. And by working with their community, they've come up to have a working

283
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,120
solution to get the Nexus 5 on Ting. You can go buy the Nexus 5 from the Google Play Store.

284
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,960
Like you should be able to just buy a computing device directly from the manufacturer and

285
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,040
you can put it on a network where you only pay for what you use and you're in no contract.

286
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,600
There's no early termination fee. That's exactly how it should be. We're finally starting to

287
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,400
see the smartphone market shape into the version of the future we want and we can all make

288
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,720
that happen. So go over to linux.ting.com, sign up, you'll get $25 off your first month

289
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,160
of service and I think you're going to be pretty happy. So a huge thanks to Ting for

290
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,120
sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

291
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,880
Thank you. That's awesome.

292
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,460
All right, Matt. So you wrote a good piece over at DataMation that said Linux desktops

293
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,280
missed opportunities. And you said if Windows users consider migrating, or this was the

294
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,560
sub headline I guess, does the Linux desktop offer a clear and easy choice? And one of

295
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,880
the areas you said, well, right now Linux definitely has a leg up and some people might

296
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,820
be surprised by this, but it hasn't a leg up on old peripherals.

297
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,920
This is something that's a misnomer with most people. You ask even experienced Linux people,

298
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,640
I've actually had some of them actually be misinformed on this, you know, what's the

299
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,880
hardware support look between Windows and Linux? With peripherals dating back to even

300
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,840
some modern ones, but especially with older ones.

301
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
Like scanners and printers?

302
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,040
Scanners and printers are the big ones. But even other stuff, Bluetooth dongles, certain

303
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,360
headsets, you'd be surprised. In certain, depending on the age, in certain instances

304
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,080
you will find that the support is crap under Windows. Even if you try and find a driver.

305
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,320
I remember when Windows 7 came out, it had been out for, I don't know, a year at the

306
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,600
time, and I was setting my mom up with her printer. Okay, I'll go get a driver for

307
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,800
it. HP has no reason to do a driver for that.

308
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Oh, what a nightmare.

309
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
This is an old printer.

310
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Yeah.

311
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
What a nightmare.

312
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
I mean, no, granted, I managed to hack it together, I think, with something later on

313
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,760
and then eventually switched her anyway over to Linux. But at the time it was just like

314
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,080
it was really appalling. Okay, same thing with Bluetooth. Try the Bluetooth dongle.

315
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,280
No love. Okay, maybe there's drivers for it. Nope, Bluetooth dongle is too old.

316
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,280
You know what, I found this is, this is kind of my enterprise background coming through,

317
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,160
but Ethernet adapters, which is such a linchpin because if you don't have network connectivity,

318
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,360
you can't get drivers for all the other stuff, right? And Linux, you know, because the stuff's

319
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,880
at the kernel level, man, you just, you plug it in and you turn it on and it just works.

320
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,780
And the experience there, if you really want to personify it, is you take a mouse on a

321
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,520
Windows box, it's never seen that mouse before, and you plug it in. And then you do that wait,

322
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,480
call it, and it goes out, it downloads the updates, it installs the driver. And then

323
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,760
the case, well, ironically, the worst offender are the actual Microsoft mouse and keyboard

324
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,760
where then they download an installer and a wizard you have to run through.

325
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,960
Is there some extra software you didn't ask for?

326
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,040
Right, and same with scanners, right? But on Linux, you plug it in and the software

327
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,600
detects it or it doesn't. It's very one or zero, right, for most basic users. And I think

328
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,940
this is a good point as Linux has sort of got a bad rap from the past because vendors

329
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,600
couldn't give a crap about supporting it, but that really has started to change. But

330
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,740
the other point you make for switchers is the security issues, right? Windows historically

331
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,280
and to this day remains massively targeted by hackers.

332
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
It's horrible.

333
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,520
Windows XP, obviously worst offender, and you look at the end of Windows XP, seems like

334
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,160
an opportunity to make a case here.

335
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,280
It's absolutely, and the big picture here is that, and of course Windows XP actually

336
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,160
ties into my peripheral argument earlier because a lot of people running XP are still running

337
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,600
those peripherals that were working with XP. So then you have the peripheral argument and

338
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,440
then on top of that, from the security standpoint, you had a Swiss cheese operating system that

339
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,240
now what little basic security you had is going to be yanked out from underneath you.

340
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,200
And people are going to run it blind. They have no idea. They have no clue. They don't

341
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,280
know that what they're running is essentially like riding a motorcycle down a bobsled track

342
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,720
in ice and snow. I mean, they have no idea. It's just incredibly dangerous and they don't

343
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,200
realize they're doing it because of the marketing problem.

344
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,880
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. And I recommend people go read Matt's piece here, but you

345
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,880
also made, and on this one, I kind of want to push on you a little bit here because you

346
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,960
say, well, you know, vendor lock-in is totally not a problem under Linux, but I wonder if

347
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,600
that really resonates with Windows users. I don't know if they recognize the fact they're

348
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
in vendor lock-in.

349
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:18,680
It's application specific. In most instances, it's maybe some random thing they created,

350
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:24,120
maybe let's say a greeting card maker or some random, you know, Podunk-y piece of software

351
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
they don't really think twice about.

352
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,320
Gosh, or yeah, like the holiday card maker. That's such a great example. That's totally

353
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
what I've seen happen too.

354
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,460
And it's the consumer stuff. It's usually some Podunk software consumer thing they bought

355
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,280
at Best Buy at one point or whatever it is. And they don't really think twice about it

356
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,640
until they go to, I don't know, maybe they're trying to upgrade to the next version of Windows

357
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,000
and they realize, okay, it's no longer compatible or there's even compatibility modes not working

358
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,440
for them or go to Windows 8 or whatever it may be. And then of course, going to Linux

359
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,840
though, it's not always a straight shot. I mean, there are tools that make it easier.

360
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,340
Scribus, for example, has worked on their publisher support, but it's not quite a hundred

361
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,240
percent yet. But it's one to watch and that helps. But that's the danger of vendor lock-in

362
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,800
even at a consumer level. It does exist. It's a problem.

363
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:11,880
So do you think there is an option here that average, you know, I'm thinking, you know,

364
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,080
the people that would want to make a greeting card software that want to buy that to make

365
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,160
a card, they put their kids on it and they send that out to the family as the family

366
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:27,700
holiday card. Do you think there is a solution for that type of user under Linux or is that

367
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,700
type of user going to be better served by the Mac?

368
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,540
If I was in PC repair still, first thing I'd do is I'd get up to an affiliate program to

369
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,160
want it for one of the cloud-based alternatives for that same program. And there's lots of

370
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,040
them. Then you're not only saying, oh, by the way, you know, your app is no longer compatible

371
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,040
with my upgrade, you know, they're upgrading them to Windows 8 or whatever it is, but you

372
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,920
can go this route. Same thing if you're moving into Linux.

373
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,080
Yeah, I think that's a huge part of the conversation we're about to have is like the cloud, I hate

374
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,720
calling it the cloud. I wish I could. Should we just call it the butt solutions? I don't

375
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
know what we should call it.

376
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,160
You can call it the butt solutions. I mean, I was in Best Buy here recently and I remember

377
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,000
some woman asking the Geek Squad person, I want to make sure I get the computer with

378
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
cloud.

379
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Oh, no.

380
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Not the cloud, but just cloud.

381
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I want cloud. I want cloud.

382
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I got to get some cloud.

383
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, yeah.

384
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
This is the people you're dealing with.

385
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,360
Well, and look at Microsoft. Well, we've integrated SkyDrive into the Windows operating system.

386
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,000
That way you have cloud storage built in.

387
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,040
Because they get marketing. I mean, as much as I hate to say it, I'm not a fan of saying

388
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
that, but it's true, you know.

389
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:30,840
I look at this and I think this conversation, even two years ago, would be more like, yeah,

390
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,900
if you kind of want that, you kind of have to go to the Mac. But now we're looking at

391
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,800
a new generation, really, of web apps that do a lot. A great example is that greeting

392
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,880
card thing could probably completely be done on some greeting card maker's website. They

393
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,600
probably have an HTML5 or, God forbid, Flash-based wizard you run through, and then they just

394
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,120
submit it and print it right there.

395
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,920
So the cloud now offers a whole new set of apps, because it's itself an application.

396
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,320
Let's just call them web apps. We won't call them cloud apps. Web apps. They're web applications.

397
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,280
They run on an NGINX or Apache server. They have a SQL backend or something, right?

398
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,040
And so this sort of relieves some of that pressure. Now, as we talk about this, it brings

399
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:17,560
me to an email we got. And I really felt for this guy, because the subject was, please,

400
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,240
help me switch from Windows. And his name is Milan. And he says, hello, good people.

401
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,600
I've been watching you for a bit, about less than two years, and you're the only nudgers

402
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,000
I have helping me switch from the glory whose symbol is inspired by a carpenter's design.

403
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,520
Yes, I am struggling to switch to Linux, simply because of the non-existing Linux community

404
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,240
in my area. Out of laziness or comfort, one seems to want more and better. So here's my

405
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
frustrations.

406
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,760
Also, my parents have a lot of issues with Windows. Getting them on the Mint world would

407
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,760
never happen. But I've decided to get Mint with Cinnamon 2, as it seems to be stable.

408
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,960
I've settled on Mint 13 for now, Cinnamon Edition, eight months ago, on my old 80-gigabyte

409
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,160
hard drive. I used Matt's guide to do it. Big thank you, Matt. And it was a breeze.

410
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,440
The reasons I didn't use it now. So here's what happened. He ended up reinstalling Windows

411
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:11,280
7. That process removed the boot choice as an option when he booted up, so he could no

412
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:17,600
longer boot into Mint. Obviously, Windows overwrote the boot motor. Now I have a drive.

413
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,360
Now I have to dive inside the cable world and unplug my main hard drive to power up

414
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,880
Mint, and that annoys me. So I'm going to have Linux on its own machine all by itself

415
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
and be Windows-free.

416
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,200
Second problem I have. No power programs I like to use on Mint. Things like Photoshop,

417
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:41,440
Premiere. There's also a lack of audio players, such as Awesome or AMP. And yes, one can run

418
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,560
some of these things under Wine, but I do not see that as a viable option. Everyone

419
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,680
praises Clementine. I haven't tried it, but it seems fine. It just seems a little bloated.

420
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,040
I noticed a couple episodes ago that you set up a service for monitoring resources. He

421
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:01,520
says, I went and found a parallel. I can set that up, but he says, I don't like the way

422
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,400
it works. There's some things that lack compared to the commercial versions. He says, some

423
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,400
of these things seem like silly stuff, but you had a little quarrel a couple episodes

424
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,680
ago in the IRC on the same topic, and he says, I share your same point of view. Windows is

425
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,400
just too comfortable. Everything works for me in Windows. I spent a lot of resources

426
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,840
to get under people's skin. It's made us weak and comfortable seeking fools, thinking that

427
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,880
data security is an issue that is nonexistent and unimportant. He says, I'm also a bit fed

428
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,000
up with Google, mainly about mail safety, but also forcing the way it uses some of their

429
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,880
products onto us. So he says, here's the essentials I need in order for Linux to get

430
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,280
some traction. In a nutshell, I need Photoshop, Premiere, a good audio player, and system

431
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,960
resource monitoring, and a mail service.

432
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,480
So the long and short of this is right off the bat. The first mistake he's making is

433
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,120
this is someone who obviously is using computers in his professional life, and so a one-size-fits-all

434
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,760
tool is probably a bit naive. He probably does need to consider a multi-platform experience

435
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,960
because that sounds like he's got a lot of stuff. Music player thing, I definitely argue

436
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,600
with that. I think there's minimalist music players. You just got to spend a little time

437
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,080
at SourceForge or whatnot.

438
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:15,320
As far as the other part of it, I today actually had to do a multi-Skype thing for work, and

439
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,400
I plugged in my headset with Skype open, and boy, you betcha, it went ahead and just froze

440
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,580
the entire desktop for me because that's a feature. So I reboot with the device detected.

441
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:30,280
It sees the device, but I can't get any sound to happen. So this belief that one operating

442
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,880
system is somehow easier to use, honestly, I think it proves to me it's really what

443
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
you spend the most time in.

444
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,200
So because I spend so much time in Linux, I pull my hair out trying to do the most basic

445
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,840
stuff in Windows. I can't. I spend all my time in the device manager going, okay, no,

446
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
it's not working.

447
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,480
Yeah, I think you're right, too. So another email we got this week was somebody who tried

448
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,800
to switch to Linux and just was not happy with any CAD solutions.

449
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,640
And that's a fair point, actually.

450
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,240
I guess, too, part of me feels like you've got to do a little research before you make

451
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,240
the switch.

452
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,600
You would think, yeah. There are a number of program areas where-

453
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,400
Is that asking too much?

454
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,000
The research, no, but at the same time, the expectation has been set. See, Microsoft and

455
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,960
even to a certain extent Apple has made people complacent in whatever you do, don't think.

456
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,080
We're going to do, especially Apple, we're going to do the thinking for you and we're

457
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
going to-

458
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,360
But look at Windows, right? Windows is so popular that you're guaranteed to probably

459
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,880
find an application that'll do what you expect.

460
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,520
Just based on market share, it's a given. The market has spoken in that space.

461
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
Could be a shit app.

462
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,760
It could be completely crap. You have to be off some shareware site. But yeah, it's interesting.

463
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,960
I think with Linux, that's again, going back to what I was saying as far as Joe Bob's distro.

464
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,520
When they're promoting these distributions, they need a section that is painfully clear.

465
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,440
Your experience is going to be completely different than anything you've had before.

466
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,760
This is not a Windows experience.

467
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,560
Yeah. And I think you're kind of getting to-

468
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,880
Honestly, I think when it comes to that, Ubuntu does a great job. It says right up front,

469
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,200
this is not Windows. Do not expect it to be Windows.

470
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,640
I've yet to find that page.

471
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,360
It's in the download page.

472
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,360
Is it? Okay.

473
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,000
I've not experienced that because everybody I've ever talked to that frustrates with it,

474
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,560
it's like, well, I don't understand why it's little. And I think also that you're also,

475
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,520
even if it's a paragraph or even a whole page, you're expecting people to unlearn a lot of

476
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,520
that too. Again, Windows made people lazy and complacent.

477
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,240
I think it's not that Ubuntu is trying to say it's, we're not Windows. They're trying

478
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
to say we're OS X.

479
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:41,080
That was a slam. But yeah, no, I think Ubuntu does a good job, but I mean, their documentation

480
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,960
is a great example. Horribly, horribly out of date. I can point to example after example

481
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,720
of just, and again, it's all volunteers and I get that. I understand that. But compared

482
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:55,400
to say like large or some of these other distros, it's like, obviously it's not impossible.

483
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,480
Well Don Thornton Jr. in the chat room says, why switch? Why does it have to be all or

484
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
nothing?

485
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,680
That's what I was saying. There's different tools for different jobs. That's why I live

486
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,960
in a multi-platform universe.

487
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,840
Yeah. I mean, even here, I've got a couple of Macs. I don't have any Windows anymore,

488
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,240
but I did for a long time.

489
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,840
I've got to be honest on my end, my desktop, my main entertainment machine runs Windows,

490
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,840
but my laptop is 100% Linux.

491
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,560
Is that that Netflix?

492
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
That's how I started out actually back in the day.

493
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:28,880
My suggestion is to just use something like Mint that has already a good base of applications

494
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:36,080
installed and just use the IRC. Don't be afraid to ask questions in the IRC because, I mean,

495
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,880
the problem with the Ubuntu IRC is there's a ton of people in there and oftentimes I

496
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,280
want to see it squatted like after like two or three seconds and then Mint IRC is a little

497
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,960
bit more stable in that regard too. Plus they'll help you most of the time in there too.

498
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,760
But people don't know about IRC, right? I mean, see here's what we are going to be encountering

499
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,040
is the Steam generation. The Call of Duty players or whatever it's going to be who,

500
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:10,480
you know, I'm trying not to be stereotypical here, but let's just go worst case scenario.

501
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,440
Mom and Dad won't pay for a new version of Windows. I need Steam OS, so I load it on

502
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,040
a box. I have no idea what I'm getting into or I try out Ubuntu. I have no idea what I'm

503
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:23,200
getting into, but I know it can play Steam games. I know it can browse the web. So I'm

504
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,560
just going to jump whole hog into it because here's what I'm noticing, you guys, and this

505
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:32,400
is not, I'm not, I don't mean to like shame anybody who's emailed in because, you know,

506
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,960
because you emailed in, we have this topic, but a lot of, a lot of people don't even,

507
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,420
don't even look beyond their nose. They just jump, man. They just, they just, they have

508
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:47,000
a certain expectation of sort of appliance like functionality because their previous

509
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,320
operating system provided them appliance like functionality in a sense and they just switch

510
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,720
like whole hog like I got to open up an AutoCAD file tomorrow. I'm going to switch to Linux

511
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,940
today and they just do it and I, I feel like I want to, I want to, I want to put up a red

512
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:07,720
flag here and say if you're listening to our content and, and you think that's possible,

513
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,100
it is not. It is, you know, you are switching, you are switching to a different philosophy

514
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,640
of computing and one that I argue is better. It is worth that switch. It is worth that

515
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,320
effort, but it is a transition, my friends. It is. It'd be a good chunk of time to get

516
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,680
rid of my Windows partition, but I still have Windows programs I have to run, so I run them

517
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
in a virtual machine.

518
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,680
Yeah.

519
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,680
Yeah.

520
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,920
Another thought, you know, is this next couple of days, I'm actually going to play with open

521
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,960
SUSE 13.1 and try to get pipeline working on that and I might try to spend some full

522
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,880
time Linux experience on my desktop again for the first time in a while and see how

523
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,880
that runs.

524
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,880
That should be fun.

525
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,960
Chris, I think that, I think you're talking about awareness here, really. There's not

526
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:57,000
enough awareness of what Linux is all about and that's why some people, they fire up,

527
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,880
we always pick on Ubuntu because it's the easiest one to install or mint a variation,

528
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,680
although Debian soon. So, they fire it up and they think it's going to work out of the

529
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,960
box. It does, more or less, until you start installing proprietary drivers and there's

530
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,080
a kernel update, for example, and things like that.

531
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that can be really tricky. You know, we were just talking on the pre-show

532
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,400
on the live stream about the need to sometimes update your kernel to get some piece of hardware

533
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
working correctly.

534
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,040
Well, not only that, but with new computers as well, there's a new hurdle that, you know,

535
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,520
with traditional BIOS, really wasn't that big of a deal as far as...

536
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
UEFI?

537
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,280
Yeah. I mean, you know, that new hurdle there is really, for us, it's like, okay, whatever,

538
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,760
you just find stuff in a different place.

539
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,440
No, you nailed it. People have been emailing in and they've been talking about it.

540
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
Every one of them is different.

541
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Yeah, they've been talking about it. It's a problem.

542
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,560
You know, if I can bring something up about the codecs, on Windows and OS X, people expect

543
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,960
those codecs to be there out of the box these days. The idea of having to install codecs

544
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,960
is in the last decade.

545
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,200
It seems like a deficiency in the functionality of my desktop operating system to them. And

546
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,560
I think that's why a lot of them are going mint.

547
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,760
The old-school mindset is when someone buys a computer, it's an appliance, like a toaster.

548
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,680
And that is what they've been growing up in, when they actually switch the internals of

549
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,880
the toaster. Our system is dynamic. It's more dynamic.

550
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
Well, yeah.

551
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,640
Yeah, it's not static, like they bought, when they bought the appliance.

552
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:33,120
My biggest suggestion is you have to search about these things. Google is your best friend

553
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,200
in these situations.

554
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:44,240
What if we just said Linux is computing without the training wheels, and it's just not for

555
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:51,280
the absolute beginner user. It is, Linux is for somebody who is comfortable with Googling

556
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,360
things. Linux is for somebody who's comfortable with, you know, having to maybe set a few

557
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,160
settings that they wouldn't normally have to set under these up there. Is that really

558
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,760
that bad to say?

559
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,560
I wouldn't even agree with that, though.

560
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
I think yes, it does.

561
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,920
Because they're not too old of a dog to learn a new trick.

562
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,400
Well, I disagree, too.

563
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,920
I don't agree with that, just because, for example, my mom is a person who doesn't want

564
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,480
to learn how to do anything like that, and I have a neighbor who has no intention of

565
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,680
ever learning how to install anything. They don't even know what an EXE file is on Windows.

566
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,200
So what I would suggest is if there's people like that that you want to have try Linux,

567
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,560
don't just tell them to try Linux. Give them an out-of-the-box situation where you take

568
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,960
their computer, put everything up, set it exactly how they're going to use their computer,

569
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,400
and then let them go at it, and they will never have a problem.

570
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Exactly.

571
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,960
I consider it's a little bit harder than that.

572
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,600
My wife is running Linux on her computer. It's an Arch install that I made for her,

573
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,880
because I know what she's going to use it for. I know that she's not going to tinker

574
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,560
around with it and muck it up at all. She's not even going to touch the command line.

575
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,840
She's just going to do word processing and web browsing for school. That's all she's

576
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
going to do.

577
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,840
So why Arch?

578
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,800
Why Arch? Because I can custom make it for her.

579
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Because you're managing it.

580
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,200
But you have to manage it. You have to manage it for her.

581
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,400
But it's different, though, too, because you know that you can update it and never have

582
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,400
to worry about reinstalling. You're only doing those things if you're not trying to add five

583
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,880
different desktops doing stuff like that.

584
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,440
And that was the major motivating factor, to be honest.

585
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
Exactly.

586
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,480
For many people, their operating system is like a religion. You're not going to be able

587
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,640
to change their way of thought. There's some cases which cannot be fixed. They cannot change.

588
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,640
They're stuck.

589
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,360
It's true, because you're trying to retrain the brain. You're trying to retrain how people

590
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,260
think. And I go back to what I said about the Ubuntu page. I've looked back and forth

591
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:44,360
both on slash download and slash download slash desktop. You couldn't be, you know,

592
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
it says nothing.

593
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,560
Yeah, you almost wonder, you almost think like there should be a legal disclaimer warning.

594
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,880
Your Windows applications will not work under Ubuntu.

595
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,960
Honestly, it has a lot of great details here, but it's missing that core, hey, by the way,

596
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,560
we have a great operating system experience for you, but understand it's different.

597
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,560
Yeah.

598
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,640
Honestly, I think this is why this whole discussion is why Canonical is partnering up with these

599
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:12,400
manufacturers to push out computers in markets where people don't have that established bias.

600
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Yeah, it doesn't look like it's in Africa.

601
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
And that's actually from Firefox OS.

602
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Yeah, I actually have a great wallpaper for that, too. It's a little hitchhiker's guide,

603
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
a little robot thing, and it says, don't panic, it's not Windows.

604
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Yeah, right, exactly.

605
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:30,800
All right, well, I tell you, you got to send that, like put it in the room or something.

606
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:39,240
I think Microsoft has built this regime where we have all learned to ride the bike, and

607
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,880
we all know to ride the bike, we pedal forwards, and we start moving forwards.

608
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,520
And for somebody to say, hold on, you can start pedaling with your arms, they're like,

609
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,000
no, that's not what Microsoft taught us to do. Do you see what I mean?

610
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Not at all.

611
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:03,040
Well, no, I think it goes deeper than Microsoft. I think it goes deeper into how many people

612
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,600
will actually truly cook a meal versus do whatever is quick and easy. How many people

613
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,800
truly change their own oil versus go to the Quicky Lube. How many people truly go and

614
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,360
go to their own cow. So Microsoft catered to an audience of people that wanted that

615
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,360
anyway.

616
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,240
Yeah, I mean, the Windows environment is just as much of a sandbox as the Mac is. It's just

617
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,800
a way bigger sandbox. And to me...

618
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,000
It's becoming more closed and closed as it keeps going.

619
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,320
Oh, yeah. The advantages of the Windows desktop are diminishing, and the advantages of the

620
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,280
Linux desktop are increasing, especially as we get to HTML5-based applications, especially

621
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,560
as Qt comes around and we get a lot more cross-platform applications. As all of these things mature,

622
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:50,680
the advantage is that Linux inherently advantages from cross-platform development, from web

623
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,440
standards, from all of this stuff, and Windows inherently is disadvantaged by those things

624
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,040
because they take away the Windows advantage, right? They take away the monopoly.

625
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:07,500
So it's almost like this problem we are struggling with today, we are heading... I truly believe

626
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,760
we are heading... And I couldn't put a time and date on it. We are heading to a point

627
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:21,920
where just like Linux has completely dominated every area of computing, the desktop eventually,

628
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,520
like Steve Ballmer said, almost like a cancer, will be consumed by Linux because as these

629
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:34,360
top-tier vendors begin to focus on their new areas of revenue, mobile, they will recede

630
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:41,080
and they will offer less and less advantages to running on those platforms, and as Linux

631
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:47,120
will continue to just grow as it has, it will benefit from standardization, it will benefit

632
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,500
from all of these things that weaken these other guys, and it will become the dominant

633
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,360
desktop platform. I don't know what that's going to look like or what form factor it's

634
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,840
going to take place in, but I got to believe these problems we are talking about right

635
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:04,020
now, these are solvable problems, and I do not believe the problems that Windows faces

636
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:11,520
are solvable. I believe they are the eventual outcome of a maturing market.

637
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,840
Well, Windows is also killing Windows intentionally.

638
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:24,200
I think that people when changing from Windows because they don't like it or whatever the

639
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,960
reason, they have to know that in Linux, you don't use the same program as in Windows because

640
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:37,480
you don't have them, and you use alternatives like LibreOffice. You don't use Winamp, you

641
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:44,520
use WrittenBox or Clementine. You use different programs, and you need to know that before

642
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,520
you switch.

643
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:51,320
I guess I feel like we've always hung our hat on games are the barrier to desktop Linux,

644
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,960
and man, if we just had games, dude, if we just had games, people would be switching

645
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,720
to Linux, and now I feel like we're starting to get games and I'm realizing actually it's

646
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,440
more than that.

647
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:06,080
And another thing I kind of want to mention is the whole thing about the word Linux sometimes

648
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:11,280
being dirty in people's mind. You ever wonder, like back in 2010 when Canonical changed their

649
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,920
branding of Ubuntu, they started removing a lot of references to the word Linux.

650
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,120
Yeah, I mean, I think that's kind of understandable. Cars aren't manufactured as gasoline anymore.

651
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,200
This is a gasoline engine. Everybody just kind of assumes it's a gasoline engine.

652
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,800
Yeah, people think too that, Linus has said this before, people do not install OSes. They

653
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,800
just don't.

654
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,800
Right.

655
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
Yeah, that's right.

656
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,680
So, like, you're having Joe is not going to download like an ISO of the Bluetooth and

657
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,880
put it on a flash drive and install it. That's just not going to happen. It's got to be somebody

658
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,880
like us to show him that.

659
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,880
Or it's mobile.

660
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:50,200
I think that most people don't even know what is Linux. When my mom came to my room and

661
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,480
said, what's that Ubuntu thing? What's that?

662
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,240
Yeah, I think the Linux branding right now. So here's what it is. It's a deficient brand.

663
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,880
There isn't enough there to bank on it. Brands are like a commodity that could literally

664
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,800
be traded on the stock market. And they are so much amazing amount of value. You guys

665
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,040
don't even realize how manipulated you are by brands, but brands are everything. And

666
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,080
Linux right now doesn't have a super strong brand. Windows actually has the opposite problem.

667
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,040
It had a great brand. It had a very strong brand. Shit, you bought something because

668
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,040
it supported Windows or because Windows ran on that. And that's why you bought it. But

669
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,840
now it is a debt. It is a problem. Things that are in the marketplace do not succeed

670
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,680
when they are branded with Windows. So they have crossed that lexicon. They have moved

671
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:40,040
into a territory where Windows now is a problem.

672
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,880
The branding of Linux is not yet like, oh shit, that's Linux. Oh, I'm going to buy that.

673
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,880
But it could get there.

674
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:52,760
I think it suffers from a lot of old stereotypes where it was the, quote, hacker's OS where

675
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,240
you required more knowledge to use it.

676
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,120
You could have made that same argument. If you take it, so one of the things that I think

677
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,980
you can draw parallels to, to watch what happens in a compressed timeframe. The commercial

678
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,760
industry, in my opinion, operates in a much more compressed timeframe than the open source

679
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,720
organic evolved market, which is the Linux market. If you look at the Apple branding,

680
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,800
Apple was a joke in the late 90s. I don't know how old you guys are, but in the 90s

681
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,800
they were terrible.

682
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,800
It was awful.

683
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,280
Right? Yeah. Now they're almost like at a, you know, their brand is like the number one

684
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,840
brand in the world or some crap. Like they're competing with Coke. It's ridiculous, right?

685
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:40,600
And so you can see how you, as long as, I feel like the brand can cross from, I feel

686
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,680
like you can have a brand that people understand isn't there yet. And then down the road, they'll

687
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,280
acknowledge, okay, it's reached that point where it's refined enough that now it's good.

688
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,360
It's a good thing. And I know about this and it's good. Whereas a brand like windows can

689
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,560
also be, can, can travel that whole lifespan and then enter that period that it's in now.

690
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,720
I don't feel like Linux has crossed that. What's that?

691
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,080
I wonder, you know, how close we're going to achieve that when distributions like Ubuntu

692
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,560
would rather focus on the Ubuntu brand rather than saying, Oh, Hey, we're Linux.

693
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,560
But aren't you glad?

694
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,240
It will never be that brand. It will never be that brand because it's an, it's impossible

695
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,200
for the quiz. The people who own the brand of Linux and own the trademark won't do that

696
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:25,360
themselves and a company won't want to put money behind it to advertise someone else.

697
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,360
It doesn't make sense.

698
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:32,120
It is more empowering to the user. And in this case, the user could be the manufacturer

699
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,280
that they don't have to live on that brand that they can build their own. The fact that

700
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,880
Ubuntu can build a respected brand by using Linux makes Linux more important. Like I go

701
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,960
back to my gasoline comparison, like GM doesn't say this is the gasoline powered Chevy Volt

702
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,160
or whatever. Volt's probably a bad example. Chevy truck or whatever, right? They don't,

703
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,960
they don't advertise the fact that it's powered by gasoline. I mean, everybody just knows

704
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:54,960
it.

705
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,600
Well, I guess an electric car would have different advertising and branding. I mean, the same

706
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,920
thing goes for like Chrome OS or Android. You don't, it's more about the Android focus

707
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,400
or the Chrome OS focus and not so much on the Linux aspect, which I definitely understand.

708
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,200
Well, I kind of like to say like the Chevy Lithium.

709
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,640
Chevy Lithium is one. A big piece of what we've got to remember is what makes or breaks

710
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:22,280
a brand is the experience that they are selling and or otherwise offering. If they're selling

711
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,760
an experience that you want to participate in or emulate in some fashion, whether it

712
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,560
be Apple or whatever it may be, it's like, wow, I like what they're doing. I want to

713
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,160
do that or I want to try that or I want to experience that. That's what will make a brand

714
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,520
successful. Even if it's past, even if you're watching something.

715
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,880
When it comes to the business side of things or the Quicken or the, you know, it's always

716
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,880
the business apps.

717
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,760
And I think that's why Ubuntu focus on changing, I'm sorry. I think that's why Ubuntu focus

718
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,920
on changing their branding three, four years ago because rather than being Linux for human

719
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,680
beings, they were just Ubuntu.

720
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,840
Yeah, it is. That is a good point. And so I guess the way to kind of bring this back

721
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:04,800
to the switching conversation is people will be, people definitely, I mean, based on my

722
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,120
inbox. So here's the trend I've noticed when I started doing the Linux action show is Fedora

723
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:14,000
that people were finding because they were finding the link from Red Hat and then they

724
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,120
would follow that down to Fedora and then they would try out Fedora and then they'd

725
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,120
be burned.

726
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,680
And you would see it, you would see that reflected in my reviews. Like I'd be like, why the F

727
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,720
are they doing this? Don't they understand they're making, I mean, literally you go back

728
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,680
to my early Fedora reviews, I'd be like, don't they understand they're making the Linux community

729
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,200
look bad by shipping a volume app that doesn't actually change the volume. Like I, but now,

730
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:39,480
I would say the vast majority, the vast majority of emails are people that are trying Mint

731
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,480
or Ubuntu.

732
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,480
Yeah.

733
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,360
Mint or Ubuntu. What's interesting, it seems to be older versions of Mint too. I don't,

734
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,320
where's that coming from? Magazines? I don't know what that's about.

735
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:53,160
I found Ubuntu back in 2006. That was my first experience with Linux. And now when I use

736
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,600
Linux, I go right for OpenSUSE. So just because of the tools it offers.

737
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,960
I think this is part of the problem is like to understand what makes a successful long-term

738
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,520
viable desktop. And it's based on like, well, what do you need? For me, I want community

739
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:11,120
and I want modern software. So that's art, right? But for a lot of folks, it's, I want

740
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,680
to know this is going to be around forever. I want to, I want to know it's enticing to

741
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:20,960
commercial software creators. And in that definition, Fedora, Ubuntu and OpenSUSE fit

742
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,720
that definition a lot better. But how is a Windows user supposed to know that?

743
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,120
Exactly. And if you go back to early days of Lin Spire, Xandros and some of the other

744
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:35,080
guys, we've seen people try and take this concept without any disclaimer, disclosure

745
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:39,480
or what their people are getting into, put it into storefronts or in some cases, online

746
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,640
shopping. People will buy these machines not realizing what they're actually getting.

747
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,680
So they get it home and they say, great, I'm going to go ahead and install my, let's

748
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,560
say, you know, the greeting card maker software. They put the CD in the tray, they close the

749
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,160
tray, they go to install it, nothing happens. Okay, what's going on? Well, okay, I'm

750
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,120
going to, I got to get Microsoft Office on here. I got Microsoft this. Okay, that's

751
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,240
fine. Got my, I got my product key. I had to, you know, dig it out from under in the

752
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,880
drawer, got it, good to go, entered it in, nothing. And so it's like, okay, well, especially

753
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,440
with Xandros, which actually, believe it or not, for a while required a product key, which

754
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,240
was weird, but you know, which really sent a mixed message. But these guys, you know,

755
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:17,040
this was the early days. And what was worse is if you look back at the time, they were,

756
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,040
I won't use the brand names, but they were using very low end hardware. So you had a

757
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,680
double pronged sword of misinformation, really bad experience, a misunderstanding on OS and

758
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:32,280
bad to make it more confusing, at least under Xandros business edition, business edition

759
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,680
came bundled with crossover, which I like, I like crossover was fine, but they didn't

760
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:43,520
really explain what you'd put. If you put the office CD in your CD drive, like it would

761
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,920
auto mount it and it would actually start the office installation process like right

762
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:54,400
there. It's very confusing because like some applications, so what you got was some applications

763
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,880
automatically installed when I put in the disk and some don't do anything. I don't understand

764
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,880
what's going on, right?

765
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,200
And then you had Lenspire, which on the consumer side of it, automatically worked with DVDs,

766
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,240
encrypted or otherwise. It actually even went so far as to allow you to purchase weird stuff

767
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,440
like hang on to your hats kids, parental controls. We don't have that now, but we had that back

768
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,360
then and they did a really good job with it actually. And then of course you had a variety

769
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,560
of other tools, but even with all that stuff, because of the legacy concerns and questions

770
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,120
and things that people would have and no real support system, they didn't really understand

771
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,120
what they were getting into.

772
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:30,720
But I would say, I guess our tips to new switchers to kind of put a bow on this whole thing is

773
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:36,760
just spend some weekends, spend some late nights doing your research, find all of the

774
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,240
programs you think you would use for the stuff you need before you switch. So you know going

775
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,920
in what programs you're going to try, right?

776
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,640
I would also suggest dual booting.

777
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,640
Oh yeah, or virtualization.

778
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,640
USB.

779
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:54,000
Yeah, I would say USB is one. Dual booting at one time I was a big proponent of at one

780
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,880
time. I used to think it was great. These days I'm absolutely shaking my head, jumping

781
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,880
up and down no.

782
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,320
Yeah, with the UEFI it seems to be kind of hit and miss. One of the things I've been

783
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,760
noticing in the emails is UEFI sometimes people booting up their machines and they're just

784
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,560
getting different results even.

785
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,680
So who's to say a Microsoft update won't break something, you know, MBR wise? You don't know.

786
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,200
I mean you're putting a lot of trust in that.

787
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,600
Is when I dual boot, you know, I find one week I'll spend 90% of my time in one of us

788
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:26,360
and then put it together and feel alien so I go spend a week in that and then vice versa.

789
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:31,120
Absolutely a depressing conversation because a lot of times if you're willing to learn

790
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,720
and try something new Linux is a good option. If you're not willing to learn and try something

791
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,960
new you have to stay with Windows. It's unfortunate and sad.

792
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:46,360
Well Windows 7, which is the last good version of Windows, hear ye, this is the last version

793
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,220
of Windows that will ever be acceptable as far as I'm concerned.

794
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:54,200
It really wasn't terrible. To me Windows is actually going to die. Microsoft themselves

795
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,840
are going to kill Windows.

796
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,360
So you have time though. I mean they're not going to pull the plug on it next year. It's

797
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:03,240
got years of support left. So it's not like somebody can't find the time to try this stuff

798
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,600
out eventually. Buy a new machine, set up your new machine, so then see how it works.

799
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,160
And if it doesn't work with Linux then put Windows on it. You know there's a lot of different

800
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,520
ways to approach it. Virtualization, dual boot, whatever works for you.

801
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:18,760
Usually whatever they buy they're going to use. They don't care to change it. It comes

802
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,760
as it is.

803
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,440
I feel like if you're going to take this on yourself, wait until you're going to buy

804
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,760
a new computer. And when you buy that new computer put Linux on it. And just try it

805
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,640
like that for a little bit because then you have your old computer if something should

806
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,640
go wrong.

807
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:37,020
Here's what I don't like about the dual boot. The dual boot, the problem with that is you

808
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:42,200
immediately will reboot your computer after 30 seconds of not being able to do whatever

809
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,480
it is you know you could do within 10 seconds on the other operating system. So the problem

810
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,360
is that temptation to hit that restart button and now you've got an SSD so it's going to

811
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,200
reboot into Windows super fast. It's not like you've got to wait that long. You're going

812
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,120
to reboot back into Windows and you're just going to get the job done under Windows. And

813
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,880
the problem is lesson will never be learned. You'll never have learned how to do that.

814
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,800
If you have it on its own machine it's just that much more of a barrier where you're going

815
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,640
to stick with it and try it for a little bit and you know you've got plan B. You can go

816
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,560
over to the other computer if you can't get it working on that new computer. And I'm envisioning

817
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,440
like you've got a desktop for years and you buy a new laptop. Maybe you try that new laptop

818
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,100
with Linux and you keep Windows on that desktop for a month or two until you've decided you

819
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:24,520
can switch over right. I mean and other things like Dropbox and BitTorrent Sync by the way

820
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,900
make this a lot easier. Set up a synchronization between your two machines. Open the same files

821
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:33,640
on both machines and if you're working on a GIMP file and you just can't get it to work

822
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:38,560
the way you want after you've tried it enough go open up on Photoshop right and do it there.

823
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,560
But you can avoid the dual boot. There are solutions where you can avoid the dual boot

824
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:47,400
now. With UEFI I think it might be time to start considering at least for a little while

825
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,680
not doing the dual boot solution. And that Chris is kind of why I have a different machine

826
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,920
for different purposes and run a different OS on different machines. Yeah. Yeah totally.

827
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,300
Yeah I think you really nailed it there because I think at the end of the day I generally

828
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,200
recommend to people that if you have an older computer and you're wanting to try Linux and

829
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,920
you're going to buy a new computer anyway whatever your new computer is I generally

830
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,200
recommend using the operating system it comes with. If you're not sure get it with whatever

831
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,280
you're going to do whatever you're at. But with older computers you have a little more

832
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,000
flexibility in that you know the compatibility is going to be more likely especially with

833
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,680
people that tend to buy a brand new Windows machine and then they go I'm going to go put

834
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,640
Ubuntu on it and then five minutes later they're in the forums whining about how Ubuntu sucks

835
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:29,300
because it doesn't work with this thing that has a Microsoft sticker on it I might add.

836
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:34,400
So that's my pick. That's one of my pick describes. Well said. And also maybe a little bit is

837
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,660
be willing to be your own teacher like Bullet Freak is saying in the chat room is like we

838
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,520
are living in a time where information is so abundantly available to us it's kind of

839
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:48,560
ridiculous like to not take advantage of that is almost negligence on our part so be willing

840
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:53,840
to be your own teacher do the investigation that you need to do. So yeah I think that's

841
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,840
remember trying to learn stuff pre-internet. I was having this conversation with my nephew

842
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,560
earlier you know what we used to do. It's kind of fun when I you know in the enterprise

843
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:05,600
what we would do is about once every quarter we would a couple of guys a couple guys would

844
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,520
jump in the car and we could take a super long lunch and we go down to the most closest

845
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:15,640
Barnes and Noble and we would just buy a crap ton of books. We would just buy a bunch of

846
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,520
books right because we didn't have Google. We didn't have Google. I mean come on. I mean

847
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,080
maybe we had Alta Vista back then maybe but that sucked. Well that was a joke. Yeah. So

848
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,960
we bought books. Now you just Google. I mean everybody knows HotBot won right. I mean you

849
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,240
know. Yeah good times. I kind of miss some of that a little bit. I miss HotBot. I don't

850
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,320
know why. Maybe it's the logo. I don't know what it was. Yeah. All right. Well I want

851
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:41,000
to shift gears and kind of bring us into the end of this week's show but first I had an

852
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,440
email I wanted to get to and that was from No Need to Pronounce My Name Correctly. Hey that's

853
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,160
one I think I can get. I think I can manage that one. They just won the internet. What

854
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,200
do you think? You think I can. I think you nailed it. But before we do I want to talk

855
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,360
about our sponsor this week. Now Matt did you know that DigitalOcean is sponsoring

856
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:02,100
this week's episode of Linux Unplugged. Oh that's awesome. Yeah DigitalOcean is cloud

857
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:07,560
hosting made simple. Now cloud hosting like somebody like Ray Ramey and our audience pointed

858
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:11,720
out cloud hosting might not be the best way to put it. Think of it as hosting you completely

859
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:17,800
control on your own. It is a brand new way of getting your own server under 55 seconds

860
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,540
and pricing starts at just five dollars per month. DigitalOcean has data centers in New

861
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:27,520
York San Francisco and Amsterdam. Interface is super simple. It's intuitive with the control

862
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,240
panel. They call it intuitive. I would say the control panel is inspired. It is so easy

863
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,080
to deploy a new machine whether you want a lamp stack, you want something that supports

864
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:39,340
Docker or you want to go cray cray like I did and deploy a Linux machine you can. It's

865
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:44,960
all click click and you've got it. 55 seconds if you're slow. Here's what you can get in

866
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,960
under 55 seconds for only five dollars per month. 512 megabytes of RAM, 20 gigabytes

867
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:55,960
of SSD storage, one CPU and a terabyte of transfer. Now you might think oh SSD that's

868
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,840
interesting. You know what? It is interesting and when you combine it with their super fast

869
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:04,720
network speeds, oh boy does that sucker sing let me tell you. So here's what I want you

870
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:09,720
to do. Go over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code Linux13. That's going to get

871
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,840
you a ten dollar credit. Now if you buy their lower end machine for five bucks, their beginning

872
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:17,880
machine, that's the machine, I've been using it now. Five dollars a month when you combine

873
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:23,300
SSD storage with their crazy awesome network performance and the fact that Linux has amazing

874
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:28,180
memory management so 512 megs of RAM is plenty for what I'm using it for. I have been so

875
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:32,460
happy and I got the first two months for free because I used the code Linux13. They'll give

876
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:36,640
you a ten dollar credit. Five dollar machine means you get it for two months. They've also

877
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,980
got servers by the hour. If you want to toss up a machine, now here's what's great is they

878
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:46,440
have droplets and these can be the pre-configured droplets like I was talking about, LAMP, Docker

879
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,780
or you can make your own image like I've done of my Arch installation and then if I want

880
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:55,580
to test something and I don't want to spend a couple of hours setting up Arch, I just

881
00:58:55,580 --> 00:59:00,200
deploy that image, I do an update and then I've got a fully current Arch machine with

882
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:04,080
all the installations I need and I can pay by the hour if I like. I think it's really

883
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:07,100
nice too because you can also resize on demand so if I want to really throw something at

884
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:11,240
it, I can add more memory, more CPU. I can get web console access if I don't want to

885
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,860
fire up SSH. You can also SSH into it later. You get backups, you get snapshots, you get

886
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:20,640
one click application installs. It is really awesome. Plus they have a 99.99 percent uptime

887
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,860
SLA. So go over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code LINUX13 and oh by the way DigitalOcean

888
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,660
offers a vast collection of tutorials for their community. Yeah, they're big on community.

889
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:33,260
You know I'm a fan of that too. Here's the great part though. If you want to contribute

890
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:36,420
to the articles that community has, you know reference stuff, if they decide something

891
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:41,420
they want to publish to the community, you can get $50 per published piece. That is awesome.

892
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:45,740
We'll have a link to that in the show notes too as well as a link to get this deal. Use

893
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:50,060
the promo code LINUX13 when you're checking out over at DigitalOcean. You're going to

894
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:53,660
love it. I've been using it for all kinds of things. It's a fixed cost so I know what

895
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:57,580
it's going to be every single month, not like some of the other stuff where it varies depending

896
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:02,740
on CPU and bandwidth and you get a surprise. It's got a great, amazing, awesome interface.

897
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:07,500
I get root access to my box and the performance is incredible and on the back end I love the

898
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:11,680
technology they're using. They're using Linux. They're using KVM. They're using industry

899
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,940
standard security technologies and I love it. So go over to DigitalOcean.com and use

900
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:21,180
the promo code LINUX13 to get a $10 credit on your account and thanks to DigitalOcean

901
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:26,540
for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. You know what's awesome about that? You got the promo. You

902
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,300
walk in, right? You get started essentially for free really and then by the time you're

903
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:34,100
done and you want to continue with it, it's like a Starbucks coffee. I mean that's crazy.

904
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,060
Yeah, it's no bigs, right? Right? Yeah, it's great. I love it. All right, no need to pronounce

905
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:41,660
my name sis. First off, thanks for lasting all the shows on Jupiter Broadcasting. I've

906
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:48,140
been an avid listener ever since installing Ubuntu 9.10 and experienced Linux for the

907
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:53,540
first time back then. Oh man, oh man, did I freaking fall in love. Now after all these

908
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:58,060
long years, I have been mainly staying in Ubuntu. In particular, 1204 LTS has been treating

909
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:01,620
me well. I'm not much worried about having the bleeding edge like an Arch, but with all

910
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:06,380
these news and all of these recent privacy issues in Ubuntu, I have thought about switching

911
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:10,580
to a different distro. I know Chris, you use Linux Mint. Actually, I use Arch these days,

912
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:16,500
but I do like Cinnamon quite a bit and it caught his eye as well. He said, I've used

913
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:21,580
Unity starting in 1204 and I'm looking at the next LTS release and I really feel like

914
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:25,420
maybe after looking at what their plans are for the next LTS, maybe I should try Linux

915
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:30,180
Mint. But at the same time, I kind of want to know how Manjaro works. It's rolling release

916
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:34,940
instead of LTS, so I kind of want to test it out. I know Matt likes Manjaro. I do. So

917
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:41,460
here's the long and short of it. I would say, is it as easy as Ubuntu? Not exactly.

918
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:46,260
It's close, but there's a couple of little snags that you might run into along the way.

919
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:49,420
The good news is that their forums probably have already covered it. So if you're willing

920
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:53,580
to check that out, you're probably fine. Like setting just little things. On the bonus

921
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:56,980
side of it, yeah, most of the stuff you expect to be set up like in Ubuntu will be set up

922
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,060
for you automatically and you want to fool with it. That is nice. If you're wanting

923
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:05,300
to actually step out a little further and try something a little more hands-on, you

924
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:10,580
can actually go full-on Arch with what we're using now, Integros. Integros has kind of

925
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:18,260
been a hit in the JB community. It has. Totally based on straight up Arch. So one of the things

926
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:23,900
I'm not totally sold on with Manjaro is their approach to stability is having a repo that

927
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:27,100
they just kind of held back for a little bit. But I do not believe, and I could be wrong

928
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:31,660
and maybe time will fix this, but I do not believe their testing base, it's not big enough

929
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:35,860
to really suss out problems. So what you really just get is delayed packages. Now that's a

930
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,940
bit of a, that's a, I'm sure Manjaro camp hates hearing that criticism, but the reality

931
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:43,300
is that's, that's how I see it. They're not Debian, right? They don't have a Debian deployed

932
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:47,860
base where they literally have thousands and thousands of people running the testing branch.

933
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:50,740
That is true. They probably have hundreds of people using the testing branch, maybe

934
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:55,820
500, who knows, right? Whereas with Integros, you stayed more married to the mainline Arch.

935
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:58,940
So when Arch pushes out that security fix, you get it right away.

936
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:02,140
But I would also point out that, and that's true, and you know, I definitely would agree

937
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:06,020
with that, but I would also say the difference between setup is, oh, there's no question

938
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:10,000
Manjaro is easier. I mean, it's, it's not, it's, oh yeah, it's not, it's not hard for

939
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,940
Integros just because I mean, I've done Arch. So for me doing Arch, it was no big deal.

940
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:16,780
I mean, Integros has a very Ubuntu like installation.

941
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:21,100
It's real, the install is fine, but as far as like getting some of the niceties set up,

942
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:24,620
first of all, if you don't know what Pac-Man is from Space Invaders and you're coming into

943
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:28,860
this, okay, then what are you doing? That, you know, the tool they provide is a little,

944
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:31,580
you know, you might want to actually, you'll either want to study up ahead of time and

945
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:35,740
learn what the hell it is, or if you go with, you go with Manjaro, they provide an app where

946
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:36,740
you don't really care.

947
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:39,420
Do you think maybe, do you think maybe he should go Mint?

948
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:43,180
Ah, you know, because he's kind of coming from a, you know, an Ubuntu Debian kind of

949
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:46,500
space and he's kind of doing the whole app scene, you know,

950
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,500
Elementary OS?

951
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,140
Yeah, I'd say probably Elementary OS over Mint. Mint is making me kind of nervous lately.

952
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:54,660
So Elementary OS is probably a good choice. Manjaro's cool if you want to try something

953
01:03:54,660 --> 01:04:00,640
cool or new. And Tegros is awesome as well. But if you want something you can just slide

954
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:05,980
in directly, probably Elementary. Mint, I don't know. I just lately, they're just, not

955
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:09,140
because of all the other stuff that's been going on as far as the back and forth, but

956
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:13,060
more just from stability. I'm not really feeling it. I've always had, I've always had nothing

957
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:14,580
but problems getting it to work right.

958
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:16,580
Oh snap. You talking about Cinnamon?

959
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:20,260
Yeah, or no, not just Cinnamon, but just the later versions of Mint. It's like, there's

960
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:24,500
always some little thing that pops up that, yeah, I can work with it, but it's just kind

961
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:27,780
of like, look, if I want to work with it, I'll use a more advanced operating system.

962
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:31,940
He also asked, how would you compare rolling releases to LTS? And I would say apples and

963
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:37,420
oranges, right? So the LTS is you get all of your updates in one big go. And I mean,

964
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:42,340
one really big go, like you moved to a whole new OS. Whereas rolling is a lot of little

965
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,820
changes frequently.

966
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:47,820
Absolutely. And no matter what distro you choose to go with, first and foremost, say

967
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:53,860
it with me, a dedicated home. You'll thank me later because you will forget to back something

968
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:57,460
up and kick yourself. But by having dedicated home, your life's going to suck a whole lot

969
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,460
less.

970
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,140
Hey, hey, hey, hey, maybe we should be recommending OpenSUSE 13.1. It's got, it's never been

971
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:07,260
released, three years of support. It automatically recommends a home partition for software availability.

972
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:11,900
You've got software.opensuse.org. I mean, seriously, maybe this is an opportunity for

973
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:12,900
no need.

974
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:13,900
I think I agree.

975
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:17,300
Yeah, no need to pronounce my name correctly. Go check out OpenSUSE 13.1. I actually think

976
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,580
this is your perfect solution.

977
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:21,860
I think I'm going to agree with that because it's kind of a balance of both, the best of

978
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:25,420
both worlds. You can actually try something new and cool, but at the same time, it's really,

979
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,420
really easy to use.

980
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:30,380
Yeah. And Yast is a pleasure if you're not super comfortable with Linux.

981
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:32,900
You're going to discover things you didn't even know you could do.

982
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:37,100
Just go check out the one click installs for the software you need, and I think you'll

983
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:41,420
be pretty happy. And because they got three years support, I think that's just right.

984
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,740
For somebody who doesn't want something that changes that often, but you don't want to

985
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,240
get too stale, I think that's the sweet spot.

986
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,460
And you got your package access, which you got to love that.

987
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:51,660
And you got your sugar daddy who's keeping the project alive long term.

988
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:52,660
That's right.

989
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,660
So there's advantages there too.

990
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:54,660
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

991
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:55,660
So very good.

992
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,660
Yes.

993
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:58,480
All right, Matt. Well, I think that'll bring us to the end of this week's Linux Unplugged.

994
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,100
Now you know, sir, of course, we love to get people's feedback.

995
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,100
Yes.

996
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,980
So they can go over to jubilabroadcasting.com. They can pop that contact link and then choose

997
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:10,060
Linux Unplugged or Linux Action Show. We'll take them both. Send that in to us and we'll

998
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:13,500
read it on the next week's show. And of course, we want you to join us live. You can go to

999
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:18,580
jblive.tv on a Tuesday afternoon. You can also join our mumble room if you go over there.

1000
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:23,260
We put all the details in our live chat room over at jblive.tv or jblive.info. Timing for

1001
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:28,100
that can be found over at jubilabroadcasting.com slash calendar. So you can go over there and

1002
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,220
get it updated in your neck of the woods.

1003
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:33,380
Well, Matt, I'll see you on Sunday for the big show, okay?

1004
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:34,380
See you Sunday.

1005
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:37,820
All right, everyone. Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1006
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:45,740
We'll see you right back here next week.
