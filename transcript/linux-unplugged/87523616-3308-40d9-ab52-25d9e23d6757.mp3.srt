1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
I'm not even sure how I came across this this week, but

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,400
this might be the most adorable kernel patch ever.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,920
Now, I'm gonna read this to you, but I want you to bear in mind that the author of

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,240
this kernel patch is only four years old, okay?

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,760
So I know already it's adorable.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,680
I know, I can't believe, this isn't even all that recent.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,600
I think this is from 2014, but like I said, I just came across it.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,080
It is a fix for formatting.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,260
And it goes, the letter, and the last letter, which is an S, is sad.

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,960
Because all of those have things like equals below them, and this one does not.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,040
This patch fixes the tragedy so all the letters can be happy again.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,160
And you read the patch notes, and it was a simple formatting fix.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,440
And one of the kernel submitters worked with the young four year old

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,400
to clean things up and actually submit it into the kernel.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,800
It's so great, it's so adorable.

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,720
Hopefully years later they just like find this unexpected nerd cred in their past.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,880
Like yeah, I'm a kernel committer, of course.

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,000
Also I just realized how unaccomplished that makes me feel.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I look forward to seeing Linus Torvalds reply, like shredding this four year olds patch.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,120
No, no, he was good.

21
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:34,000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 276 for November 20th, 2018.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,400
Welcome to Linux Unplugged.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,440
This episode may be cursed because I realized I didn't grab myself a beverage before the

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
show.

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
My name is Chris.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
My name is Wes.

27
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
Hello, Wes.

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,800
So assuming we sort that tragedy out, we otherwise have a pretty great show.

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:54,240
Coming up, we've got some community news that caught my attention this week, and we'll explain

30
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,740
that Android kernel mystery that's probably been on your mind and you didn't even realize

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,740
it.

32
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,600
Take a look at that deep end.

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,640
And then rumor has it, 1804 is going 10 years of support.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,620
We'll play the clips and a few other little highlights from Mark Shuttleworth's talk at

35
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,620
OpenStack.

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,620
Berlin, I think it was.

37
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,620
Berlin.

38
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,620
Berlin.

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,620
You and I weren't there.

40
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,620
But we did actually have...

41
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,620
We've been bonding with Mark all day.

42
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,940
We had crew members from Linux Academy at the event.

43
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940
Got the inside scoop.

44
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,940
Whoa.

45
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,940
Got the inside.

46
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,480
They actually ended up getting stuck in Berlin too for like an extra 48 hours.

47
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
It was rough.

48
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
There are worse places to be.

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
That's true.

50
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
That's true.

51
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,040
Then coming up, we will launch officially, officially the voting for our new automation

52
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
system.

53
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,260
And then we'll take in some feedback, answer some questions, give you some app pics, some

54
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:50,400
gnome shell extensions, and I'll give you my first review of a Thunderbolt 3 dock that

55
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,480
I got from my Linux box.

56
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,480
But this one has an NVIDIA GPU built in.

57
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,760
Can you actually add full dedicated graphics via a single cable to your Linux box?

58
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,700
And does that crap actually work?

59
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,040
And what are the downsides when you externalize things like that?

60
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,240
I've got my initial report on all of that.

61
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,640
But before we go any further, we have a solemn duty that we must perform, and that is bringing

62
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,140
in our virtual lug.

63
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,800
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

64
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,840
Good morning, everyone.

65
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
Hello.

66
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
Hello.

67
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:32,120
Brandon, Brent, Charlie, Cubicle, Nate, Mini Mac, Poppy, Scott, Sean, the Silent Drifter,

68
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
and Mr. Wimpy.

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,880
It is good to see all of you in the virtual lug today.

70
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,440
Really happy to have you there.

71
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,420
You know, the virtual lug is one of the best parts of the show, so I'll just mention it

72
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,460
right here at the top of the show.

73
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,520
You should totally join us.

74
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,320
We've only got a few more episodes before the end of the year, and we'll probably be

75
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,280
recording our predictions episode either on December.

76
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,600
It kind of depends, because Linux Unplugged really gets the shaft on the holiday schedule

77
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
this year.

78
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,720
Linux Unplugged lands on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.

79
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,720
So we'll probably be recording our predictions episode around December 11th or the 18th.

80
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
Those are like the last Tuesdays before Christmas.

81
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,120
That's your shot to show everyone just how smart you are.

82
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,680
Yeah, that virtual lug is open to all of you, and if you want to get a prediction on what's

83
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,560
... I think what we're going to do, just so you can prepare yourself, is we're going to

84
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,720
make a prediction of what we think will happen, and we're going to make a prediction of what

85
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,920
we'd really like to see happen, what we really want to happen.

86
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,800
Like if you had a magic wand, what would happen?

87
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Because those are always a lot of fun.

88
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,880
We'll be doing those, and then, if all goes as planned, we'll review them a year later

89
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,840
and see how things held up.

90
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,760
I mean, usually that's pretty rough, but we do it anyway for consistency.

91
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
That's right.

92
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
That's right.

93
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,760
So Mr. West, what have you been up to?

94
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,960
I saw a little problem solving involving X forwarding or something that you were working

95
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
on this last week.

96
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,600
Okay, so sometimes it's a weekend and you want a game.

97
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,480
Now by this I mean play a board game.

98
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,040
In particular, perhaps you've played Settlers of Catan, Chris.

99
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Oh yeah.

100
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,920
Yeah, it's a classic board game, of course, but sometimes, well, your friends just aren't

101
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,600
where you are.

102
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,120
Enter Pioneers.

103
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,320
Now this isn't the fanciest game in the world.

104
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,780
In fact, it's a pretty old GTK2 implementation, but it is free software and it implements

105
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,200
like a whole bunch of the various expansions like Seafarers.

106
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,520
It's not super shiny.

107
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
It does work well.

108
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
On Linux, like it's packaged in Debian.

109
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
They have maintainers there.

110
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
So it's really easy.

111
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Okay.

112
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,360
They have some binaries that someone manages to make for Windows.

113
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Oh, really?

114
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,240
Unfortunately, one of my friends, well, he's on a Mac and he's a political scientist.

115
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,920
So he's not, you know, he does do some statistics in R, but compiling C++ and GTK applications.

116
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Getting a GTK2 app on Mac OS.

117
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
How was that?

118
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
How did that work out?

119
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
Well, we dodged that bullet.

120
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,840
In the past, I'd had him use a virtual machine.

121
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,440
He was like, I think we used something called virtual bugs for this, which I was like, yes,

122
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
okay.

123
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
But I didn't want to go through that.

124
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,640
It was already 6 p.m. on a Sunday.

125
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,160
We just wanted to play the game.

126
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:06,700
I spun up a new VPS somewhere and then I used XPRA, which bills itself as screen for X11.

127
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,160
And it's probably most similar to X2GO, but serves similar functionality to almost any

128
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,320
VNC or RDP type application.

129
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,500
One of the things that makes it nice, though, is it basically starts its own little X server

130
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,960
on the side and then you can set the display variable for any app you want to run on it.

131
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,280
And then from any client, which includes an HTML5 client, I haven't tried it, but I'm

132
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,240
curious on like it has a package compiled for OSX.

133
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,520
He could just install.

134
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,160
He ran one command on the command line and up pop the application and I used it to run

135
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
the server that way.

136
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,280
They have a nice little GTK dialogue to configure the server.

137
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,760
So I didn't have to run that on my machine.

138
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,980
You set up a droplet.

139
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:48,520
You set this Xperia on there, XPRA, and then you forward just that GTK2 game.

140
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,560
Yeah, exactly.

141
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,500
And you can do it over SSH if you like, or it can bind just like a TCP port.

142
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,840
That's pretty nice.

143
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,320
That is interesting.

144
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,760
So it's application level X11 forwarding.

145
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,580
Now where does this fall in Wayland?

146
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,580
Probably doesn't do anything at all.

147
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,600
But for the moment, it is pretty useful.

148
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Unless you use X-Wayland.

149
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,400
Oh, that's right.

150
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,120
The other thing it notes here is that you have forwarding of sound, clipboard, and printing

151
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,180
services.

152
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,700
That's pretty nice as well.

153
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,080
And you can do it over SSL if you like, or like Wes said, over SSH.

154
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,120
And that HTML5 client, think about that.

155
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,200
You could deliver single X11 applications inside a web browser with that.

156
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
Yeah, right.

157
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
That'd be pretty neat.

158
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,160
I have used OBS before with this on a droplet.

159
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,280
And of course, the video is not the snappiest.

160
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
But it worked.

161
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,240
I mean, I could control the software, and that's what counted.

162
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,240
So did they have to install a next server on their Mac?

163
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
I didn't follow along.

164
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,260
He didn't show me his screen.

165
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,480
But they have like a package for OSX.

166
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,240
I just told them, hey, install this and then run that command.

167
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,360
And with no further help or prompting from me, he got it working.

168
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
I see.

169
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Yeah.

170
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Huh.

171
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
And there's a Windows binary there, too.

172
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,200
Chris, I remember you were asking for a way to watch movies and shows when you were traveling

173
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,480
with some loved ones.

174
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Would this solve that problem?

175
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
You think it could do video?

176
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,840
I mean, I think it would transmit video.

177
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
I don't know.

178
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,180
I don't know that it's specifically optimized for that use case, so probably would be choppy.

179
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,180
But I'll give it a shot.

180
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,180
Yeah.

181
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,180
Yeah.

182
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,180
Can you post a link to it in the chat?

183
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,180
Sure.

184
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,180
Yeah.

185
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,520
You can post a link to it in the show notes, linuxunplug.com.276.

186
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,040
But we'll put it in there.

187
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,600
It's expira.org.

188
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
And it's really neat.

189
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,120
I'm thinking about setting it up on a droplet that I use.

190
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,960
So I have gone the other route just recently.

191
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,180
In fact, I was talking to you about this this morning, is I've decided to set up a work

192
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,600
environment that I can access from less capable or less set up machines.

193
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,680
I've decided to just set up a work environment that's all on the command line as much as

194
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:49,920
possible that I can SSH into from a tablet, I can SSH into it from a phone, a desktop

195
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,700
that hasn't been set up yet.

196
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,140
And right now, and I kind of would like some feedback from the audience since I haven't

197
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,060
really pulled the trigger yet, I'm debating between two possibilities.

198
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:05,500
Setting up a VM on a droplet that I already have, a pretty powerful droplet, or setting

199
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,920
up an Ubuntu environment container.

200
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,280
When you look on Docker Hub, there are Ubuntu based containers and others that are just

201
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,480
pretty much, they're ready to go workstation container environments.

202
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,680
And you might say, Chris, why do this?

203
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,960
Well, my idea is, I don't want to thrash the local host.

204
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,880
I don't want to thrash the main host system.

205
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,920
I want to have a disposable environment that I can load packages into.

206
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,580
I can try out different applications.

207
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,040
I can do all kinds of things that I wouldn't want to do on a system that I want to keep

208
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,320
around for years.

209
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,180
And my first thought was, we'll build a VM, or anything like that.

210
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,520
But then I thought, maybe I could do this in a container and maybe have something a

211
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
little bit faster.

212
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,720
So you combine it with this Xperia, and then I could potentially even forward web browsers.

213
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,200
So what application do you want to run?

214
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,520
Well for the most part, I was just thinking the command line, like YouTube, DL, things

215
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,280
that I might want to run from the command line, do network diagnostics from a remote

216
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,760
system, that kind of stuff.

217
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
And so I initially-

218
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,080
I should set up some things like maybe Dropbox or other syncing systems so you could talk

219
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,080
to it.

220
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,440
I want something like that so I could move files in and out of cloud storage.

221
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,240
So that would definitely be a component of it.

222
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,680
And SFTP, you know, stuff like that.

223
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,960
So it doesn't have to be a lot.

224
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
So I'm curious to know what the audience would do.

225
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,400
Would you set up a VM or would you set up a container?

226
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,720
And the reason why you might go containers is because maybe it'd be a little faster.

227
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,920
I use sort of a mix of both.

228
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
Oh really?

229
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
Yeah.

230
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,720
So yes, you could have your droplet, an Ubuntu droplet.

231
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,240
And then for trying stuff out, you know, when you want to make sure it's all working nicely,

232
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:42,320
what you could do is use a combination of LexD and Multipass to start up full VMs when

233
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,360
maybe you're wanting to run something that needs its own kernel in order to, you know,

234
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
function properly.

235
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,880
And LexD, when it's something you can just jam inside a container quickly to test.

236
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,640
And you know, if you get those things set up and they're working for you, then you can

237
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,280
just leave them in those VMs and containers.

238
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,360
Or you know, if you're just testing something out, then you can chuck them away when you're

239
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
done.

240
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
This is a job for multiple.

241
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,320
This could be the perfect job for a Multipass.

242
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Good suggestion, Wimpy.

243
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Thank you.

244
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,120
And I mean, LexD is, you know, very well oriented for that full system in a container approach.

245
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Yeah.

246
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Yeah.

247
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,360
I mean, you could probably do a lot of it in the new versions of LexD.

248
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,840
Both of those are available as snaps, by the way.

249
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Hmm.

250
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Hmm.

251
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Okay.

252
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
All right.

253
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,680
All right.

254
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
Go figure, right?

255
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,680
All right.

256
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,860
So I woke up to this news this morning and I have to be honest, it was the last news

257
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,400
item I expected.

258
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,680
It appears that Valve is discontinuing the hardware Steam Link, I guess, or another way

259
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,400
to put that maybe more accurately is they're discontinuing the Steam Link hardware, the

260
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:55,280
actual box itself, the little HDMI gadget that you could connect to your TV and it would

261
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,680
stream video games from your PC.

262
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,760
So not the client functionality in Steam, just the cute little box.

263
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,800
And they still are going to maintain their apps, so they're going to deliver this functionality

264
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,860
via an app.

265
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,060
And I was really surprised to see this for a couple of reasons.

266
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:17,580
Number one, Steam has really kind of led the way with the streaming service.

267
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,600
They were out there with the Steam Link before Google ever talked about their stream beta

268
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,000
or Microsoft ever announced the Xbox streaming.

269
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I mean, they didn't beat One Live, but they were out there really early.

270
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,760
One of the first serious attempts.

271
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,160
And the really nice thing about Valve's approach is it's over your LAN.

272
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,420
It is over your damn LAN.

273
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:42,280
And that is just going to be a much less error prone experience when you're not having to

274
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,760
rely on your crappy internet connection or your ISP's crappy routing or five ISPs down

275
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,120
from your ISP's crappy routing, you're going to have a much better time.

276
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,080
And having this go over your local ethernet, there's just no competition.

277
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
No competition.

278
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,560
It's like the full control too, right?

279
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,820
You can build the system that runs the game, you can manage the network that it plays through,

280
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,320
and you set up the client that you want.

281
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,920
And I've had multiple people tell me that the Steam Link is a much better experience

282
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,060
than the Android version of the same thing.

283
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,600
So I was pretty surprised because it seemed to me that Valve was continuing also to invest

284
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:23,040
engineering in this area as of very recently, like a couple of weeks ago, so I was shocked

285
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
by this.

286
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,320
Poby, I was talking with you about it this morning, what was your reaction when you saw

287
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
the news?

288
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,720
I can't say I'm all together surprised, to be honest.

289
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Really?

290
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Yeah.

291
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
It's not had a lot of love.

292
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,680
I mean, I actually predicted that they would make a 4K version of it, but that obviously

293
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
didn't come to pass.

294
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,640
So the fact that there was never a 2.0 made me think this thing's end of life, they're

295
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
not going to make it anymore.

296
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
So I'm not enticed by it.

297
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,680
I'm a little sad because actually the Android app is rubbish, and it's way better on a big

298
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,640
TV.

299
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,320
I use them all the time when the kids want to play a game together with me.

300
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,480
It's one of those really nice family experiences to sit around in front of the telly, and each

301
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,940
have a Steam controller, and we play Gang Beasts or Tower Fall or Ultimate Chicken Horse

302
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:17,960
games that we play that are multiplayer local, and the gaming PC is in a completely different

303
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
room in the house.

304
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,120
It's upstairs out the way, and we just connect to it over the network, and away we go.

305
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,960
And even when the kids have sleepovers with friends come over, they all play Gang Beasts

306
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,240
or whatever and punch the what's-its-out-of-each-other, and it's great.

307
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,440
So yeah, I'm glad I've got them, and I'm keeping them, and you can prize them from my cold

308
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
dead hands.

309
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
Right.

310
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,640
And it does say they're going to continue to support them for a while.

311
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,600
Wimpy, I'm curious to know if you think it's just simply people weren't willing to hook

312
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
up a dedicated hardware box to their TV.

313
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,400
They've got enough set-top boxes now.

314
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,960
Yeah, I mean, there could be some fatigue around that.

315
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,080
I've got three set-top boxes downstairs now.

316
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,480
I've got a Roku, an Nvidia Shield, and a Steam Link.

317
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,800
I feel a little bit aggrieved because the Steam Link is the most recent addition.

318
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,500
I got that in the sales just a couple of months ago, but hopefully there'll be some longevity

319
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,600
to the device because the functionality will be the same as whatever the software solution

320
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,080
is that replaces it.

321
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah, and it was, I think in a way, it's a bit ahead of its time.

322
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,620
I think you may see once streaming services become more mainstream and people recognize

323
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,960
some of the limitations, there may be consumer interest in a solution that avoids those bottlenecks

324
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,120
and those limitations, and the Steam Link would be that.

325
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
But it would be.

326
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
I don't know.

327
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,560
Maybe this will be a refocusing point because, I mean, they could still maintain market share

328
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,640
or mine share if the Android app wasn't crap, or if it integrated with more third-party

329
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,880
services in a better way.

330
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
Yeah, I mean...

331
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,920
Because they're not going to win the be the end device battle, but they could win the

332
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,380
were the game marketplace still.

333
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,680
So I'm pretty sure the Nvidia Shield's GeForce streaming gaming stuff is very similar in

334
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,840
nature to the Shield's, or I'm sorry, to the Steam stream stuff, and there's not a latency

335
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,160
or lag issue with the Nvidia Shield GeForce stream service.

336
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,920
So it must be doable on Android because the GeForce one's fine.

337
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,240
Brandon, you mentioned in the chat room that you've had a Steam Link for a while.

338
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,000
What's your sort of quick review of the device?

339
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,240
It seems like it was a solid product to me, but I had limited experience with it.

340
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,920
Well, I thought it was fine, and it was also, like, I could play a few games on it.

341
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,320
What I also liked about it is if I wanted to project something on the TV, like, you

342
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,720
could actually do something like, what does Apple call it, the AirPlay, you can actually

343
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,080
do something like display or desktop on the screen if you hack it right.

344
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,920
Yes, that's right.

345
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
That is so cool.

346
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,160
As a geek, that is just the best.

347
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
All right.

348
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
Well, okay.

349
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,880
Well, then we'll take a moment.

350
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,600
We take a moment and we say goodbye to the Steam Link hardware, and my first thought

351
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
was maybe I should buy one.

352
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Yeah, right?

353
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,240
I actually have one already, though, so I'm good, I'm good.

354
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,680
I wanted to highlight an article over at LWN that talked about mainlining the Android kernel

355
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,260
contributions, and as everybody knows, Android devices are based on the Linux kernel.

356
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,200
Those devices, though, don't really run a mainline kernel.

357
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,260
There's a good amount of out-of-tree code shipping on those devices, and that often

358
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,260
causes problems.

359
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:24,320
In 2008, I'm sorry, in the 2018 Linux Plumber's Conference, which just wrapped up, there was

360
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:31,220
specific discussions around fixing this, and maybe even running mainline kernels on Android

361
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,160
devices one day.

362
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,640
We're definitely not there yet, but it may be closer than most people think it is.

363
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
It is complicated, though, right?

364
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,920
Because it starts with this LTS release from the mainline, then that's combined with core

365
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,780
Android-specific code to make what's called the Android Common Kernel release, then vendors

366
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,640
pick up that Common Kernel, add a bunch more out-of-tree code to create a kernel specific

367
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,680
to a system on a chip, and then ship that to actual device manufacturers.

368
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah, and then they end up with this, like, essentially a device kernel.

369
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,180
So you have the mainline kernel, which becomes the Android Common Kernel, which then becomes

370
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,480
essentially a device kernel.

371
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,920
That is really complicated, and the Android core has really kind of been slow because

372
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
of this.

373
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,560
And in this development process, it's meant being based on really old kernels.

374
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,960
And it takes, really all told, a lot of the advantages out of basing all of this on Linux,

375
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
if you think about it.

376
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Yeah, you have all these...

377
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,720
I mean, the biggest problem, I think, has been that you don't have a lot of abstraction

378
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
between them.

379
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,960
Like, people are just modifying the kernel.

380
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,120
So when big upstream changes come from the kernel, all this random out-of-tree code that

381
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,360
no one else can see, that's just gonna break.

382
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
Yeah.

383
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,960
Now, the word at this Plumber's Conference, though, is that Google plans to continue to

384
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,560
push vendors to ship updates, eventually mandating updates to newer LTS releases even after a

385
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,300
device is launched.

386
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,560
At some point, LTS releases will be included at Android security boltons because there

387
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,480
really is value in getting all that info out there and getting the bug fixes upstream.

388
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,800
Now, really the problem of getting devices around mainline kernels, of course, is all

389
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,520
of that out-of-tree code that the device manufacturers add.

390
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,320
That's really where the issue is.

391
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,200
The amount of code in the Android common kernel has been reduced considerably, though, with

392
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,520
a focused effort on getting these changes back upstream.

393
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:29,600
And there are now only about 30 patches in the Android common kernel, adding about 6,500

394
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,640
lines of code that are needed to boot Android.

395
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,520
Eventually though, they hope to get that down to zero once they can bring in a few things.

396
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,320
Some of those, though, are kind of exciting, like getting energy-aware scheduling into

397
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
the mainline.

398
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Yeah.

399
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
Yeah.

400
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:50,560
And part of this is Google is going to knock off all that behavior of OEMs building in

401
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,640
their own schedulers and replacing the mainline scheduler because then sometimes you get wonky

402
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,520
results with apps that are really hard for developers to test against.

403
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,140
And you're probably thinking, as we're reading all of this, you're probably thinking about

404
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,140
Project Treble.

405
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,140
I know I was.

406
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,140
Yeah.

407
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,140
Right?

408
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,260
That introduced that new vendor interface, an API that implements a sort of hardware

409
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:14,440
abstraction layer, along with this interface came the concept of a generic system image,

410
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,040
which you'll hear Android developers refer to as a GSI.

411
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,680
If the GSI can be booted on a specific device, then the manufacturer has implemented the

412
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:28,920
vendor interface correctly, i.e. one of the tests is booting this standard image on your

413
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
device.

414
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,960
If you fail, then you're not matching the standard.

415
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,880
Now, so here's where it gets better.

416
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,580
Right now, the kernel is considered to be part of that vendor interface, right?

417
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,680
So the vendor must provide it as part of the low-level implementation.

418
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:47,420
But the plan, and this is the big change, is for Android to provide that generic kernel.

419
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,720
Devices will be expected to run this kernel.

420
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,740
To make that happen, they have to provide a set of kernel modules, and that's where

421
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,000
that new boundary comes in.

422
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,920
They can no longer provide their whole custom kernel, just a module, and that makes it a

423
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
lot easier to interrupt.

424
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
Yeah.

425
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,680
So they're moving all of that out of the main kernel itself, putting it into a module, and

426
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,800
that would, I wonder, hopefully mean, down the road, damn close to mainline kernels,

427
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,520
which means much faster security updates.

428
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,680
Like, okay, vendors add a couple of their own modules to support their hardware.

429
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,520
That is a lot more reasonable.

430
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
It's really how it should be done.

431
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Yeah, right?

432
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Yeah.

433
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:27,040
I do kind of, in the back of my mind, wonder if this is the fallout and result of Spectre

434
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,600
and Meltdown, in a way.

435
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,480
Being able to respond to those types of vulnerabilities across an entire platform really became a

436
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,640
thing at the beginning of this year that a lot of vendors became aware of.

437
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,440
Like, the concept that shit, we have shipped something that is faulty by design, and we

438
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,320
have to retroactively patch these internet connected devices, and we don't have a standard

439
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,400
mechanism to do that.

440
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,840
There's no continuous integration.

441
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,920
There's no pipeline to get this stuff built.

442
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
It takes years.

443
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
They're working on those tools.

444
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,200
They go into some detail on their continuous integration pipeline in the LWN article, if

445
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,400
you want to read more.

446
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
It's a ways off.

447
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:11,440
What's interesting is when they very, very begin the process of taking the mainline kernel,

448
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,400
they're really kind of just a few weeks off.

449
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,920
When they start working on it, they're just a few weeks off from mainstream.

450
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,880
It doesn't transition to years late until it goes through that device manufacture phase

451
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,280
where they customize the kernel for their hardware.

452
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,880
So making that into a module could make a huge difference for Android.

453
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
Okay.

454
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,960
So there's also one other question that just comes to my mind.

455
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,720
This is a lot of work from Google.

456
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,740
Like they're putting a significant pressure on those kernel releases, changing the way

457
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
this is done.

458
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,640
How does that fit in with their Fuchsia play?

459
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,080
I was just thinking the same thing.

460
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,640
I was thinking that all through this discussion.

461
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Yeah.

462
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,640
So what do you think Wimpy?

463
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
What is the play here?

464
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,360
Why invest all this time, make multi-year plans just to pull the rug out from underneath

465
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,760
it all and introduce Fuchsia?

466
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,480
Well, that's been people's reading of Fuchsia and Magenta right now, and maybe we've read

467
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,480
it wrong.

468
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,520
Maybe that isn't the intention.

469
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,580
Maybe Android's safe and it's not going to get replaced.

470
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,960
The other idea maybe is that they're trying to prepare OEMs and manufacturers for this

471
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
relationship.

472
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,040
Like, look, on our next operating system that we want you to ship, they're getting updates.

473
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
You have to plan for it.

474
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,440
Now my glass is half empty, Wes.

475
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
Thank you.

476
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,920
My pleasure, sir.

477
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,920
It really could be.

478
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
It could be that.

479
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:25,160
It also could be the fact that even once they start shipping Fuchsia, that there will be

480
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,640
years still of a market dominating.

481
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,640
It has to be, right?

482
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,200
I mean, there's billions of Android devices now.

483
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,080
So this is something that needs fixing regardless.

484
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,040
And I am one that thinks that Fuchsia is designed to replace Android.

485
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,580
I admit it.

486
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,360
And I have not much to go on other than what it can do, the way it's built, and the fact

487
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,000
that their most recent products didn't ship with Android, but they shipped on the Chromecast

488
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
platform.

489
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,480
That, to me, is a big indicator that Android isn't a hot product inside.

490
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
I don't know.

491
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
We'll see.

492
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,600
I hope I'm wrong because I had a recent go with the Pixel 3.

493
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,280
And some memory issues aside, I think Android P is pretty damn good, especially put in that

494
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
dark mode.

495
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,280
Did you get a chance to update your device?

496
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,280
I did.

497
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
And honestly, P is great.

498
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
It's snappy.

499
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
It's a lot faster.

500
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
It's smooth.

501
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,040
The notification management stuff's way better.

502
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,120
It's nice to be able to just shut that stuff up.

503
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,880
And then one of the other things, it'll come up and say, hey, bro, I've noticed that you

504
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,560
commonly dismiss this notification.

505
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
Do you want me to stop?

506
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,200
Do you want me to just turn it off?

507
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,440
And I'm like, yeah, I do.

508
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
Thank you.

509
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Yeah, that is good.

510
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,520
And also, the settings menu is really great now as well.

511
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,720
Yeah, much better.

512
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Much better.

513
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,280
So I kind of hope they stick with it in some ways.

514
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,620
I don't want to see them bail on it because we haven't gotten to that perfect...

515
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,720
That perfect Android device is that DEX concept that everybody's excited about right now.

516
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,260
That's the perfect Android device.

517
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,180
You have a USB-C interface or something like that that you plug into a monitor.

518
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,680
You get mouse and keyboard, everything.

519
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,480
You have a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard.

520
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
You sit down at your desk.

521
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
You plug in one cable.

522
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
You get power.

523
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,520
You get external display.

524
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,720
And you have a full desktop environment running on this Android device.

525
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,720
That is...

526
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,220
I still think that's possible.

527
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,400
And I think the interest in the new DEX system...

528
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,400
I mean, you could also see tablet hybrids, which was a case you shove your phone inside

529
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,560
and then that mode activates into a hybrid tablet mode.

530
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Cool.

531
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,560
That'd be pretty good.

532
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
That'd be pretty good.

533
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,560
All right.

534
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,240
Well, let's do a little community news here.

535
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,560
Deepin has a release, 15.8.

536
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,000
The latest version of the Deepin Linux distribution is out and available for download.

537
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,120
I gave it a download today.

538
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,700
Man, their mirror is getting hammered.

539
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,560
So I downloaded...

540
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,080
They had one option to download it off Google Drive.

541
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,600
I did that and that went a little bit faster.

542
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,600
This I'll say right off the top didn't boot for us.

543
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
I mean, actually it booted.

544
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
It didn't install for us.

545
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,100
It would not install on our MV&E storage.

546
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,660
I don't know what was going on.

547
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:47,040
We only had a little bit to play with it, but really pretty, really, really pretty.

548
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,100
It adapts to different display resolutions really well.

549
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,880
They've added an auto brightness function, which is, I think, all of the rage and should

550
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,360
be mandatory on today's 2018 desktop.

551
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,320
And they have a great doc system.

552
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,480
Deepin is one of those, I don't know, right now it feels like it's maybe not getting the

553
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,520
respect it should.

554
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,260
It's really a unique take.

555
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,720
I'm not saying it's like an elementary OS, but it's in that category.

556
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,720
It has worked hard to carve out its own little niche out there.

557
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,280
It's an elegant distribution, right?

558
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
Yes.

559
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
Yeah.

560
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
It's not for everyone and it won't meet all of your needs.

561
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
Right?

562
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,400
We couldn't get it to install.

563
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,640
The installer is not super full featured, but it was really elegant.

564
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,920
And if it had worked seamlessly, it would have been a really good experience.

565
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,880
Do you know if they ended up fixing the issue that they had in the previous release where

566
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,960
some of their native applications are not the same as other ones?

567
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,520
I kind of vaguely recall what you're talking about.

568
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,560
Does anybody else in the Mumba room recall what he's talking about and have a recollection

569
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
there?

570
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,880
That sounds vaguely familiar.

571
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:51,540
So in particular, if you go into the settings menu, you open up certain settings applications.

572
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,520
And if you've got the dark theme on, it'll be the dark theme.

573
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,360
But then other ones, it will only be white and you don't have an option to change it.

574
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Okay.

575
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Okay.

576
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,400
That might have been something I would have had a chance to try had it installed.

577
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Yeah.

578
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
I don't quite understand why it didn't install.

579
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,800
We were doing a full disclosure on a core boot system and I did see some weird grub

580
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
install errors.

581
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,800
So who knows?

582
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Yeah.

583
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,800
It could have been the core boot thing.

584
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
But I don't know.

585
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,360
I don't have a lot of experience with this distribution.

586
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,480
Nobody in the Mumba room is speaking up about it.

587
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
So I guess nobody.

588
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,480
Yeah.

589
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,880
I've used it quite a bit recently.

590
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
Oh, really?

591
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
You have?

592
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
I have.

593
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Yeah.

594
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,080
It's one of my go-to distros for doing distro testing.

595
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
Yeah.

596
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,080
I love it.

597
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,080
I think it's brilliant.

598
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,080
Okay.

599
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
Why is it your go-to?

600
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
And what do you like about it so much?

601
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,320
It's my go-to because we're testing stuff that is not on Ubuntu and is not necessarily

602
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,720
Debian because it's built from Debian unstable in a similar way that Ubuntu is.

603
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Right.

604
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,520
So it's a good sort of halfway house for testing stuff, but also it's just so nice and I actually

605
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,760
enjoy using it.

606
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,640
I think, oh, yes.

607
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,880
Every time I boot up Deepin, I just think this is really lovely and thoughtfully presented

608
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:08,160
and elegant and pretty and modern and it's just everything about it I think is just really

609
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
on point.

610
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,200
I think it's terrific.

611
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,840
One thing we noticed when we were going through the installer was the end-user license agreement.

612
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,720
What do you think about that?

613
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
I'll be honest.

614
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
I haven't read that.

615
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
I mean, we didn't either.

616
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,960
You just got to scroll down, but we didn't read it.

617
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,400
You don't often see like a full screen EULA when you're installing Linux though.

618
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,400
Yeah.

619
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
It's its own unique thing though.

620
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Its own unique installer.

621
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
It's very pretty.

622
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,880
It's very minimal as well from what I remember.

623
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,880
Yeah.

624
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
Yeah.

625
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
All right.

626
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
Okay.

627
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
I'll give it a go on an Encore boot system.

628
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,640
I mean, I'll take that installer even with it not working over Anaconda any day.

629
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,640
Yeah, that's true.

630
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,280
Why is it not a fan of Anaconda?

631
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,840
Which I've turned on it over the years.

632
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,880
I've liked it a little bit more.

633
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,880
So package availability, snaps, those things, how's that on Deepin, Wimpy?

634
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,920
It's all tickety-boo.

635
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
It works really well there.

636
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
Oh, very good.

637
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
Okay.

638
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
All right.

639
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
It's on the we'll try list.

640
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,920
We'll try it on a different laptop.

641
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
Yeah.

642
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,600
You know, the thing is, is I really wanted that core boot machine, which is a Purism,

643
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
by the way.

644
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
It's the Librem 15.

645
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,160
I really want, I like that to be my go-to distro tester.

646
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,400
That's really like the, but core boot sometimes does throw things for a loop, which always

647
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
surprises me.

648
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,560
Like it seems like if any operating system was going to have solid core boot support.

649
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
It would be.

650
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,560
It would be Linux.

651
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
Come on.

652
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
But it's just not, you know, it's not a priority for that distro.

653
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,560
So it's understandable and it doesn't really properly reflect actual consumer hardware.

654
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Right.

655
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,160
In one ways it's great because it's this like free hardware sort of thing, but no one else

656
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
runs it.

657
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
Yeah.

658
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,440
This is the beginning of the process where Chris justifies yet another studio computer.

659
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
Just kidding.

660
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
Never enough.

661
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,320
You know, maybe I'll keep them around now that I know that these 1804 installs are going

662
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,120
to get 10 years of support.

663
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Well, there's some, there's some details along with that, but this was an interesting announcement

664
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,200
in several ways, actually.

665
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,880
Mark Shuttleworth, of course, the founder of Canonical was at the OpenStack Summit in

666
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
Berlin.

667
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,520
Mr. Wimby, I think you were there as well, weren't you?

668
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,400
No, I wasn't in Berlin as it happens.

669
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
I was in Stuttgart.

670
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,800
Oh, oh, I would barely even know the difference.

671
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
So I'm sorry.

672
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Yeah.

673
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:16,720
So, uh, yeah, I, um, I, uh, was with a team of colleagues in Stuttgart, including Mark,

674
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,160
um, at the back end of last week.

675
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,580
And the OpenStack Summit seems like, um, like it's Mark Shuttleworth's power zone.

676
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:30,240
Like he really knows that market, uh, I don't know when I watched him up on stage, I thought

677
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,960
this guy really knows how to speak to this audience and he knows specifically what's

678
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
important to them.

679
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
I'll give you a little flavor.

680
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,720
So I grabbed a couple of clips so you guys can get a taste of what, what an OpenStack

681
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:46,480
keynote by Mark Shuttleworth is like, and this is the very beginning here.

682
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,740
Good morning, everybody.

683
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:53,180
It was so great yesterday to see everybody from this community again.

684
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:59,360
Every six months we meet up, uh, but I was stopped a thousand times by people with the

685
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,880
same two questions.

686
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,640
So I thought I may as well just answer them here.

687
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:09,280
Now he, uh, he's about to make a joke, but before he makes the joke, he actually addresses

688
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,920
what his thoughts are on the IBM buying Red Hat story, which I thought was pretty bold

689
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,440
move up on the stage, especially since that's a player in that market, you know, I mean,

690
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,440
they're competitors.

691
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,840
Um, the first question, uh, since everybody sees Canonical and Ubuntu as the company that's

692
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:38,240
risen to challenge Red Hat in the enterprise, it's what do I think of IBM buying Red Hat?

693
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,080
There's two big burly Texans behind the curtain.

694
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,880
So let me say I wasn't surprised to see Red Hat sell, uh, because over the last two years

695
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,120
I've seen some of their largest users and customers opening up and saying they wanted

696
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:00,560
to have new Linux options, uh, and signing up to build open infrastructure with Ubuntu.

697
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:08,040
But I was surprised at the amount of debt that IBM took on, uh, to close the deal.

698
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:13,500
And I would be worried for IBM, uh, except the public cloud is a huge opportunity.

699
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:19,440
And I guess it makes sense if you think of IBM being able to steer a large amount of

700
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:26,200
on-prem rail workloads to the IBM cloud, then that deal might make sense.

701
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,260
I was both, uh, cutting and astute, right?

702
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,640
It's like, I think that's great and brave of him.

703
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,080
He then goes on to joke that the second most common question that he gets is, uh, who did

704
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,920
you lose a bet with to have to glow, to grow out that, uh, I think as he puts it glorious

705
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,560
beard, I think are magnificent or something like that.

706
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,160
He really is rocking a beard these days.

707
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,680
Have you seen a recent latest look?

708
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
Yeah.

709
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Have you seen a picture of Mark Shuttleworth?

710
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,240
It is funny because none of the like stock photos used in like quotes of him around the

711
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,280
various news sites have updated at all.

712
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
No.

713
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,600
Well, it's, it was a lot of beard.

714
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,880
I mean, if for, in ratio to Mark's public appearance, it was a lot of beard in a short

715
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
period of time.

716
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,920
Um, so while he's up on stage though, he's, he's gotten really good at doing a keynote

717
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,480
in like 10 minutes.

718
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,560
And when you're doing a keynote in 10 minutes, you really got to get going and you got to

719
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
explain stuff.

720
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,840
I mean, you got to have all, all the terms and the jargon you got to get through.

721
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,540
You have to have a clip.

722
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:28,360
And so Mark's going through and he's identifying what is a new area of growth for canonical.

723
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,520
And in this, he just casually drops in there that Ubuntu 18.04 will just receive 10 years

724
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,480
of support instead of the five we all expected.

725
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,100
A couple of years ago, we started focusing on telcos and I think everybody knows that

726
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,360
Ubuntu is the platform, uh, for telco open stack.

727
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,560
Um, last year we said we were focused on adding financial services to that.

728
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,940
And I'm very excited to tell you that over that period, six of the world's top 20 banks

729
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,840
have signed up with canonical to build open infrastructure on Ubuntu.

730
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,740
Now let's actually think about that.

731
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,400
Six of the world's top 20 banks.

732
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,000
Now you say, okay, six out of 20 doesn't seem like a lot.

733
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,620
Well, that has to be out of those 20 people that are interested in doing an open stack

734
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,520
deployment to begin with.

735
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,320
So that narrows down the list, right?

736
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,160
And also like each one of those deployments, it's a sizable deployment.

737
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
Yeah.

738
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,160
Oh yeah.

739
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,160
All six of them are going to be huge.

740
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
Right?

741
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,920
But only not, you don't, you don't just assume that all 20 just were itching to go to open

742
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
stack.

743
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,000
So only some of them were looking to switch their core infrastructure to begin with.

744
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,260
And the ones that did, six of them went with canonical solution.

745
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,640
That's a pretty major win.

746
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,600
But as somebody who has worked in the financial institution for nearly a decade back in the

747
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,880
day, I can tell you they move at a different pace.

748
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:48,080
As we moved into these new industries, that really raises the bar and the complexity and

749
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,960
the diversity of things that we support.

750
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,680
For those of you who are grappling with GDPR, you'll be delighted to know that the current

751
00:34:54,680 --> 00:35:00,560
release of Ubuntu open stack supports full disk encryption, bastion and uses vault for

752
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,380
key storage.

753
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:11,080
I'm also delighted to announce that Ubuntu 18.04 will be supported for a full 10 years

754
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,760
in part because of the very long time horizons in some of those industries, financial services

755
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,800
and telecommunications, but also from IOT where manufacturing lines, for example, are

756
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,940
being deployed that will be in production for at least a decade.

757
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:29,540
Ten years now that's part of their ESM program, which I'm pretty sure when I looked on the

758
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,240
website has a $2,500 minimum to join, which means you probably have to have $2,500 worth

759
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,320
of machines.

760
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
Which makes sense, right?

761
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,200
I mean, we're used to thinking about Ubuntu solely in the open source or the cloud side,

762
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
the unsupported side.

763
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Yeah, right.

764
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,720
But like the market they're talking about here, the market Mark's talking about, the

765
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,680
market that people investing and considering these things are talking about is enterprise

766
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
support.

767
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,840
Yeah, they have a fleet of Ubuntu systems and meeting that $2,500 minimum is easy.

768
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,240
That's where it's kind of interesting too, right?

769
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,680
Because you think about banks or especially telcos where you have these new breed of internet

770
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,320
companies that roll out their own, right?

771
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,800
They're like, we'll take your software, we'll hire a bunch of highly paid engineers in San

772
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,100
Francisco and they'll build our systems.

773
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,240
But not everyone wants that.

774
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,360
Telcos have their own technology to build.

775
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,160
So that's where they need a partner who can provide support for the layers they're not

776
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,160
interested in.

777
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,880
And there's a market reality here too, where if you're shipping a product in 2020, 2021,

778
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,160
then you're just starting to build it now.

779
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,560
And you want to base it on an operating system that's still going to have valid support when

780
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,760
your product actually makes it to the market and ships.

781
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,680
Yeah, you don't care about all the glibc changes that might happen in four years down the road

782
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,260
when like that doesn't affect your Java library.

783
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,820
We have some additional coverage and details in this week's episode of the Linux action

784
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,520
news program.

785
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:49,260
Check out linuxactionnews.com slash 80 for discussions on also their impending IPO.

786
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,780
But I wanted to move on.

787
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,080
I wanted to keep talking, I'll throw it to the moment room there for a moment if anybody

788
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,760
has any commentary on Ubuntu going for 10 years of support.

789
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,560
My early spoiler alert prediction is the next LTS of Ubuntu will just ship with 10 year

790
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,000
support by default is what I think.

791
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,280
Because this is what the market that they're competing in does.

792
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,160
This is what RHEL does.

793
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,620
This is what Microsoft does.

794
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:19,720
This is what large vendors in this area that they're competing with do is 10 years of support.

795
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,160
That's a lot of cadence though, right?

796
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
I know.

797
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,800
When you look back at the most recent LTSs that we put out like this, obviously 1804,

798
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,480
then before that 1604 and 1404, there are still a ton of people out there who are running

799
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
1404.

800
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,400
I mean, it's not surprising there's a lot of people running 1604 because that was only

801
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
two years ago.

802
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,000
But you know, 1404 was four and a half years ago now, and there are still plenty of people

803
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,480
out there running, which is why we backported snap support to 1404 is because we knew that

804
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,200
there were people who wanted the latest applications on the oldest LTS that, you know, is still

805
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,440
reasonable support.

806
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,560
So it makes total sense to support these releases for a longer period of time.

807
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,480
There's a snap angle to this as well, because if you have a lot of customers that are running

808
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,520
a wide variety of versions, snaps can kind of smooth that out.

809
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:17,440
But the thing that strikes me about this is Mark's up there on stage for about 10 minutes.

810
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,720
This announcement is 30 seconds at most.

811
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,440
Actually, let me see here.

812
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,160
Yeah, it's 30 seconds.

813
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:33,120
But in that 30 seconds, what that represents is teams of people in Canonical working away

814
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,840
at years backporting things to this old ass version of Linux for 10 years.

815
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,800
And you have to do it for all of the supported LTSs.

816
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,120
It's such a simple statement to make, which represents such a massive undertaking for

817
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,240
the company.

818
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,800
It strikes me as one of those things.

819
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Do you agree?

820
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
I do.

821
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,960
And you know, if you want a better appreciation for what's involved in maintaining the security

822
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:02,360
profile of Ubuntu, Alex Murray, who's the security tech lead in Ubuntu, does a brilliant

823
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,680
podcast called the Ubuntu Security Podcast.

824
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,760
It's about 10 minutes each week.

825
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,360
And he runs down everything that the Ubuntu security team patched, fixed or otherwise

826
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,120
improved and goes into the details behind the CVEs and the vulnerabilities.

827
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:23,280
So if you want to get a real feel for the pace and momentum behind the work that the

828
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,920
security team do, 10 minutes a week and you'll learn an awful lot.

829
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,920
Yeah, I like that 10 minutes.

830
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,480
Will you put a link to that in the show notes?

831
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
Absolutely.

832
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,480
We will have a link in the show notes.

833
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
People want to check that out.

834
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Ubuntu security podcast.org.

835
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
I've listened to a few myself.

836
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,440
I enjoyed it a lot.

837
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,280
You also touched on snaps there as well.

838
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,800
And, you know, whilst yes, if you have snap capability on your system, then you're able

839
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,160
to install these applications, you know, forwards and backwards.

840
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:54,440
But the other property that snaps give you is you could take legacy applications that

841
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,040
were deployed on Linux from the past.

842
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:04,560
You could create a snap of that, you know, artisanally bundle everything that that aged

843
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,960
application requires in a confined, isolated container, and now you can install that snap

844
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,080
on, you know, any of the supported distributions without exposing the whole system to those

845
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,080
old libraries.

846
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,520
Yeah, and not having to go through these flag day, you know, changes when a new release

847
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
comes out.

848
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,520
You have to now update your application, as Wes said, to support the new glibc or whatever.

849
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,380
I think that snaps honestly, like it makes sense because with snaps, it allows them the

850
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:37,880
opportunity to, you know, all of this maintenance that you would normally have to do back porting

851
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
it 10 years.

852
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,660
I mean, that normally would be a nightmare.

853
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:45,360
But if you've got that all isolated, that makes the core maintenance quite a bit less.

854
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,200
I thought that we might end up like with a Windows 2000 situation where there have been

855
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,920
applications that have been running on me for like 10, 15 years running on me for so

856
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,120
long that the company that made it might not exist anymore, and it might be a business

857
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,960
creation that no one knows how to port to the new version of iOS, so having it as a

858
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
snap would be excellent.

859
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Yeah.

860
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,280
You can just like put it on whatever and it will work.

861
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,840
Well, so not only is there the old legacy enterprise application angle, and, you know,

862
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,760
to a lot of these degrees, Flatpak solves this as well, but there's also I think what

863
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,240
Wimpy was kind of getting at too is there's sort of the historical preservation.

864
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:24,540
We preserve physical pieces of art, but we're not really good at preserving digital pieces

865
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,600
of art.

866
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,680
And sometimes because the technology moves on, these old pieces of art can't even run

867
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,680
anymore.

868
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,980
And so being able to create a self-contained environment where you could preserve maybe

869
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:41,160
your favorite video game or your favorite old spreadsheet program, you know, that's

870
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
really important.

871
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,160
And I mean, I don't think it's right.

872
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,040
We shouldn't think about it necessarily only an old stuff too, like getting the ability

873
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,720
to have that flexibility also means you can use newer systems that might be supported

874
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,720
or get the latest security.

875
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,920
It means I can move on too without having to lose that legacy.

876
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,920
Exactly.

877
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,920
Oh, that's good stuff.

878
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
All right.

879
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,280
Well, let's shift gears and talk about docs here for a moment.

880
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,160
Wimpy really got us excited about this recently.

881
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
We've been drooling all week.

882
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
We have.

883
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,720
And Zach the penguin wrote into the show just a little bit before we went on the air and

884
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,900
he says, hi, Chris, you mentioned looking at getting a docking station and I found very

885
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,160
little online that suggests docs work well with Linux.

886
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,260
Would love to hear more about what doc you selected and how well it is working.

887
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:24,520
So I thought I would give my report on the doc that I ended up purchasing after last

888
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,520
week's episode.

889
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,360
I just decided to pull the trigger because I felt like this was an area that maybe the

890
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,560
Linux audience could use just some hands on experience.

891
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,600
There's a lot of uncertainty, you know, like any of this, it's all kind of brand new.

892
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,600
Right.

893
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:43,280
And in my case, this was a $367 doc and that's a big chunk of change to not know if you can

894
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,280
even plug in and make it work.

895
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
Yeah.

896
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
I'm not going to spend that money knowing it won't work.

897
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,280
No way.

898
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,280
No way.

899
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,720
So I thought, okay, well, I'm, I was really wanting to come to a doc solution and Wimpy

900
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,420
had found like a professional grade Lenovo doc that may have even been a touch more price

901
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,320
wise in this, but had a lot more ports than this does.

902
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,660
So there's a couple of different options here.

903
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,760
But so since Wimpy went with that one, which is working well, I don't know Wimpy just for

904
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,960
the sake of completion, do you know the model again?

905
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,640
Is it just called the Lenovo professional Thunderbolt doc?

906
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,640
I think that's what it's just called.

907
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,640
Yeah.

908
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,640
Yeah.

909
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,720
It's called, yeah, the Thunderbolt doc gen two, I think it is.

910
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,640
It's hard to decide if like the different docs Lenovo has can be pretty tricky.

911
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,240
I've linked to it for the last couple of weeks though.

912
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,240
That's the easiest way.

913
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,240
Yeah.

914
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,960
Anyway, so specific to this model of laptop as well.

915
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,960
Okay.

916
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,960
That's good to know.

917
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,920
So I sort of tucked and rolled and went with the Lenovo Thunderbolt three graphics doc

918
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,520
and it's got Lenovo on the name, but my understanding is it's not necessarily Lenovo specific, though

919
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,600
the packaging does sort of pitch it that way.

920
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,440
In fact, the packaging makes it sound like it doesn't even work with my laptop.

921
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:51,400
So when I got the box, I was a little apprehensive because for $367, I kind of have some expectations.

922
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:57,280
And what I want to get out of this is I have two display port driven 21 inch or no 27 inch

923
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,280
2k monitors.

924
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,600
Then one is vertical and one's horizontal.

925
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,080
I want to be able to plug in and have them light up.

926
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,160
I want to have my sound system plugged in because I have pretty nice speakers up in

927
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,160
my office.

928
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,080
I want to have a couple of USB devices, like a nice webcam.

929
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,480
The dream, right, where you like you bring your laptop in from the road, you just flew

930
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,400
in, you set it down, you plug in one cable, you get power and you have your full desktop

931
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,400
experience.

932
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,400
Totally.

933
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,200
That is 100% what I want to do.

934
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:29,160
And I did buy a Lenovo, well Linux Academy did, that is only Intel and that was very

935
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,920
intentional for heat and power and Wayland.

936
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,520
I just wanted to go Intel only.

937
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,640
But there is a part of me that every now and then really would love to play a game.

938
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:46,000
You don't happen to do it very often, so I wouldn't even consider myself a regular gamer,

939
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,840
but I am a sporadic gamer.

940
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:52,480
And so the concept of having an external Thunderbolt dock that had a graphics card in it was very

941
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,480
appealing.

942
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,120
But everything I looked at was nearly the size of a PC tower.

943
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,880
It was huge.

944
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,480
And even the ones that weren't super huge were very limited on the ports.

945
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,680
Like they maybe had some USB and none of them would have Ethernet, you know, like I really

946
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,680
want Ethernet.

947
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,560
It's no good if you have to have more than one thing.

948
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,360
Like the whole point is to be the only device you plug in.

949
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,240
So this is why I was willing to spend the money hoping it worked on the Lenovo Thunderbolt

950
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,800
3 graphics dock.

951
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,920
Baked into this dock and it's not overly large.

952
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,960
All of these are about the same size.

953
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,700
It's a very slim profile.

954
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:33,560
It has a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card built in.

955
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:38,460
I don't remember off the top of my head right now how much RAM is on it, but it's a decent

956
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,460
amount.

957
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:43,440
Again, I'm not looking for even 4K gaming here.

958
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,000
For the most part, I'm looking to do 1080p gaming.

959
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,120
You want to go from the difference of I have integrated graphics and can game basically

960
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,000
not at all to, okay, I'll play some things on whatever settings are reasonable.

961
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Once a month.

962
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,640
So it's not a huge thing, but when I do have the opportunity, I really want to be able

963
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,640
to do it.

964
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,640
Or maybe you have like a sudden video processing workload that you just need to sit down and

965
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,640
get through.

966
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,280
Yeah, that absolutely can happen as well.

967
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,240
So I hooked it up and the first thing, I didn't know which USB-C port to put it in.

968
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,900
First time I plugged it in, I got power right away.

969
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,720
And this thing's pretty decent power delivery.

970
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,160
It's a 175 watt dock.

971
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,760
So you're going to be able, or I'm sorry, 170 watt power dock.

972
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,280
So you're going to be able to charge your battery pretty fast.

973
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,560
It's got a one USB 2.0 port.

974
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,600
It's got two USB 3.0 ports.

975
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,940
One of which is always on, which has got a little lightning bolt to indicate which one's

976
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,640
always on, so you want to charge your phone or something like that.

977
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,400
It has two DisplayPort 1.2 ports on the back.

978
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,280
One HDMI 2.0 port.

979
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,800
It has one headphone jack on the front.

980
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,800
What?

981
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,800
That legacy port?

982
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,800
I know, right?

983
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,760
Mine's got the courage port as well.

984
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,560
I love it.

985
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,280
Oh, man.

986
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,680
One gigabit ethernet, and then in the box it comes with the power adapter, obviously,

987
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:03,720
and a very, very short Thunderbolt 3 cable that barely reaches for my setup.

988
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,840
And all in all, I plugged it in, the first time I plugged it in, I plugged it into the

989
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:10,760
power USB-C port and nothing happened other than powering my laptop.

990
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,880
The second time I plugged it in, I plugged it into the main USB-C port that you're supposed

991
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,880
to.

992
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,880
The correct port.

993
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,180
And everything was good for like a good 20 seconds and my machine locked up and I had

994
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,560
to hard reboot.

995
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:26,020
But when I rebooted, I came back up and everything was detected.

996
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,020
And I did that.

997
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,020
I love this.

998
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:32,280
There's this command sudo ubuntu-drivers, can't remember the exact syntax, but it's

999
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,280
like auto install.

1000
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,280
Yes.

1001
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,280
Yeah.

1002
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,280
Thank you.

1003
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,200
And I just do that and it just goes and gets the NVIDIA 390 something driver, loads up

1004
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,640
the NVIDIA driver, NVIDIA settings control panel for me.

1005
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,200
I do one more reboot to make it all clean.

1006
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,440
And sure enough, I open up the NVIDIA settings control panel and I can see all the information

1007
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,680
about my video card.

1008
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,720
Now, I didn't have the right display adapter cords.

1009
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,280
I had display port to mini display port, which doesn't work with my monitor.

1010
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,920
So I haven't yet hooked up my external monitors.

1011
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,920
But this gave me an opportunity to find out if the internal display, the 1080p display

1012
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,840
that's built into my Lenovo laptop, if that could be accelerated by the NVIDIA chip in

1013
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,880
the external dock, which if you think about it, means you're round tripping a lot of video

1014
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,240
data over that Thunderbolt 3 cable.

1015
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,640
Didn't know if this was possible.

1016
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,000
I didn't really know how to check to see which video card was powering my desktop.

1017
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,280
I looked at LSPCI, I looked at the NVIDIA control panel and it all kind of seemed to

1018
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,240
imply that my built in screen was being powered by the NVIDIA graphics card in the external

1019
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,240
dock.

1020
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,240
All right.

1021
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,800
I thought, well, the only one way to really find out, let's fire up some games.

1022
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,240
So get serious.

1023
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:48,280
I've recently got back into playing Star Trek Online under wine, under Linux, of course,

1024
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:53,080
and it's been actually playable-ish with the Intel graphics.

1025
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,880
I mean, I feel like it has to be because you don't game that much.

1026
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,600
So are you really going to play a bunch of a game that doesn't work?

1027
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,600
No.

1028
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,160
And so it was playable-ish.

1029
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,700
Space combat was fine.

1030
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,360
Ground combat was laggy, which is so typical Star Trek Online.

1031
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:15,080
So I fire up the Star Trek Online and I immediately can tell even at the login screen that something's

1032
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,080
different.

1033
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:21,880
So I go in, I turn up the settings, do all of that, jump into the game, smooth as butter.

1034
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:26,360
So the next thing I do, I close out, I load up Bioshock 2, go into there, full settings,

1035
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:32,680
Bioshock 2, hit play, smooth as butter, full screen, 1080p, again, that's all I need, right?

1036
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:38,800
It is legitimately accelerating the graphics on my built in Lenovo display with no external

1037
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,720
displays hooked up to the dock, which I will have eventually, but for right now, I can

1038
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,000
still get benefit out of that NVIDIA chip just with my single display.

1039
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,240
Even without all the cables you need.

1040
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,240
I've got my power.

1041
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,080
I've got my USB devices all hooked up.

1042
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,120
And now I've got actual playable 3D graphics on that thing.

1043
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,120
Sounds like Wimpy might have a little command line magic to help you out here, too.

1044
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,120
Oh, really?

1045
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,120
What's this, Wimpy?

1046
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,120
Some command line lerv?

1047
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,120
Right.

1048
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,120
Okay.

1049
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,120
Yeah.

1050
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,640
So listeners of the Ubuntu podcast will know we have a segment called command line lerv.

1051
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,240
So I've got some command line love for you.

1052
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,520
What you need is prime hyphen select.

1053
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:21,480
And if you do prime hyphen select and query, it will tell you what video subsystem is currently

1054
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,480
enabled.

1055
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,480
So on my system, it says NVIDIA.

1056
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,560
And is this part of the NVIDIA drivers graphics package that were this?

1057
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:32,600
This is part of the Ubuntu additions to the NVIDIA drivers.

1058
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,040
NVIDIA dash prime looks like the package that contains it.

1059
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:41,520
And if you do prime hyphen select and then type either NVIDIA or Intel, it will switch

1060
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,540
the drivers between the two modes.

1061
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,160
And then all you need to do is log out and log back in.

1062
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:53,480
And those drivers for that GPU or IGP will be enabled in the ones that you're using.

1063
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,480
Awesome.

1064
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,120
So that's how you can do it at the command line.

1065
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:02,400
Users of the glorious, glorious Ubuntu Marte will automatically have an applet appear in

1066
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,560
their taskbar when you've got a prime capable system.

1067
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:12,520
And it will show you an icon which GPU you've got, so an Intel logo for Intel, an NVIDIA

1068
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,320
logo for Intel, and a means to just toggle it through a simple UI.

1069
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,240
That Ubuntu Marte, that's a clever distribution that they're...

1070
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,240
Yeah.

1071
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,120
And that was Mark's idea from the Ubuntu podcast.

1072
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:29,840
He reviewed Ubuntu Marte 1504 on a super stellar Entroware that had hybrid graphics.

1073
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,120
And he said, what we need is a tool to do this.

1074
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,120
So I wrote one.

1075
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,120
That is awesome.

1076
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,120
That's great.

1077
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:41,000
And it looks like there's also Fedora Prime, which is the same thing for Fedora and other

1078
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,960
distributions to be able to do that.

1079
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,960
So that's cool.

1080
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,960
So that's something...

1081
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,960
Can we...

1082
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,960
Will you also toss links to that in the show notes?

1083
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,960
Yeah.

1084
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,920
That'll be for me after the show.

1085
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:57,080
So at this point, I've now tried my Lenovo ThinkPad out with three separate Thunderbolt

1086
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,280
3 docks.

1087
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,960
One which was an OWC dock that was originally purchased for a MacBook, which got repurposed

1088
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,720
now for the ThinkPad.

1089
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:09,280
Another which is a cheapo one that I got off Amazon, I can't remember the name of it.

1090
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,520
And now this graphics enabled Thunderbolt 3 dock.

1091
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,860
And this was the trickiest of them all, I feel.

1092
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:20,480
It was the one that I thought for sure would not work, especially not with the internal

1093
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,480
graphics.

1094
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,880
And I'm really, really just pleased that it's worked as well as it has.

1095
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:31,180
I can't necessarily say I wholeheartedly recommend this dock.

1096
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,000
It really kind of depends on what you want to do.

1097
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,820
If I was going to spend the money again, I would probably still buy it, but I would still

1098
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:44,640
give another serious consideration to the dock that Wimpy got because it has more ports.

1099
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,720
And I'm already kind of...

1100
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,720
I'm out of USB ports.

1101
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,800
I've got cables hanging off the front of this thing that I don't like the way that

1102
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,800
looks.

1103
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,800
Yeah.

1104
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,800
What?

1105
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,800
A dock in a USB hub?

1106
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,800
Who does that?

1107
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,800
Yeah.

1108
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,800
Right?

1109
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,800
Where Wimpy has more USB ports.

1110
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,800
It has more of the ports on the back.

1111
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,800
All of that, right?

1112
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,800
Because I've got my headphone jack on the front.

1113
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,800
But no graphics, right?

1114
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,800
Right.

1115
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,680
So this particular setup, that's a compromise I'm willing to make.

1116
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,240
I'm willing to make because I don't need a lot.

1117
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,760
I need a couple of USB devices, a couple of monitors, and I want 3D graphics.

1118
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,000
So for me, it's delivering what I want.

1119
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
But it's just like...

1120
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Might not be right for everyone.

1121
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,840
Just keep in mind, you're compromising a little bit on the ports.

1122
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,440
At least you do get gigabit.

1123
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,360
That was the real deal-sealer for me, is I like getting my gigabit.

1124
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,800
And that's nice to have that built in.

1125
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:32,120
So I will have links to the specific model that I bought on Amazon.

1126
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,840
They don't give me a commission, so it's not for that.

1127
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,840
Let's not get into that.

1128
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,840
But you know what?

1129
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,440
Maybe we should mention at this point, speaking of saving some money, Linux Academy is doing

1130
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,840
a Black Friday sale, Cyber Monday sale.

1131
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:49,820
And it essentially cuts off a huge amount of the price and makes it around like 30 bucks

1132
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:50,820
a month or less.

1133
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,440
Somewhere right in that neighborhood.

1134
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:57,380
But the bigger deal is you lock that in for the lifetime of the account.

1135
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,140
Now consider what that means.

1136
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:04,880
They are growing like crazy, adding, they just this year added 420 plus new types of

1137
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:10,760
individual usable content and consumable learning activities and training lessons and video

1138
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,760
courses.

1139
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,760
Way over 420.

1140
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,500
In fact, I think in the last quarter, it was more like 500 just in one quarter.

1141
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,120
But my point is, you get this Black Friday price or Cyber Monday price and you lock it

1142
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,120
in for the lifetime of the account.

1143
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,280
So if you're a subscriber now for five years, you're getting that price.

1144
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,640
And they update the existing content.

1145
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,600
So if you forgot some, you come back five years later, you still got your account, then

1146
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,600
that's right there.

1147
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,680
And then here's the other thing that I didn't really appreciate until just recently.

1148
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,540
Existing students can also go get the price.

1149
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:44,240
So if you're paying the regular price right now, yeah, you can go get the Black Friday

1150
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,440
Cyber Monday price and then just lock it in for your subscription.

1151
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,360
So I wanted to point that out, linuxacademy.com.

1152
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,600
Just go there like on Black Friday that I'll be there.

1153
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,040
Plus on their live page, you can see the live streams I did announcing some of the new content

1154
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,840
with Anthony, which is fun.

1155
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,040
We ended up doing four of them.

1156
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,600
They have a streaming machine.

1157
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:08,200
Yeah, we went from, like when I first went down there the first time, it was like a kind

1158
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,200
of rough shot.

1159
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,960
We just did it out of Anthony's office, set up an OBS machine, and it was just kind of

1160
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,960
a little crazy.

1161
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:20,520
But now they got like a video studio with a 4K Blackmagic camera and LED lighting, yeah,

1162
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,160
like a physical set and all of that.

1163
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,160
It's very impressive.

1164
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,200
One other just thing before we completely move off of the Thunderbolt doc, I'll just

1165
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,600
a little quick mention.

1166
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,680
You do want to go learn Bolt.

1167
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,280
I don't know, Wimpy, if you have any Bolt advice, but this is going to be specifically

1168
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:39,800
Bolt CTL, the command line client that you can use from any desktop environment to authorize

1169
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,920
your Thunderbolt doc.

1170
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
So I've got a question.

1171
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,680
Yeah, you do need to learn to use Bolt.

1172
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:50,240
There's another tool that was also developed by Intel, but Bolt is the better option.

1173
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,960
Answer me this.

1174
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:57,760
When you said your computer locked up, was that after you ran Bolt to authorize the device?

1175
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,960
It must have been because it was just almost immediately after I connected it.

1176
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,960
Yeah.

1177
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:07,800
So what I've found is if you've got a GPU in a Thunderbolt doc and you authorize the

1178
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:14,560
device, then it hangs the system because you basically just thrust a GPU into the PCI lanes

1179
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,520
of the computer.

1180
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:23,020
Now if you've got an external GPU enclosure, like some of the ones that I have, the way

1181
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:30,280
I do this is I pull the GPU out of the GPU enclosure, plug the external GPU in with no

1182
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:36,160
card in it, authenticate the device that way, and then shut it all down, disconnect it,

1183
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,160
and then plug the card in.

1184
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:42,320
Because you're not authenticating the graphics card that's inside the doc, you're authenticating

1185
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,720
the doc itself.

1186
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:48,260
Now in your case, you don't have that luxury because the card is fused into the doc.

1187
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:53,120
So yes, unfortunately, that first run is a bit hairy scary.

1188
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,760
And yeah, I have encountered that.

1189
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,000
Just make sure you run sync on the command line before you do that.

1190
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

1191
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,560
Yeah, get everything flushed.

1192
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:07,360
I've got another command line, luv, which is sort of a GUI luv for you.

1193
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:15,200
If you want to do that prime switching, but with GUI, if you run nvidia settings dash P

1194
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,920
and then space and then all in caps prime, it will open nvidia settings on the prime

1195
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:27,200
profile selection page, which has got the toggle to switch between Intel and nvidia.

1196
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,200
Killer tip.

1197
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,200
Thank you.

1198
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,200
Thank you, Wimpy.

1199
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,200
That's great.

1200
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,360
I will probably just use the command line version.

1201
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,620
But that's good for anybody that just wants to avoid the command line.

1202
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,320
Some people make it their mission.

1203
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,840
And while I think that's a little cray cray, I say embrace the command line.

1204
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,920
And you're using Linux, come on.

1205
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,240
You heard him say it there, too, they have tips like that all the time on the Ubuntu

1206
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,240
podcast.

1207
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,240
Go check it out.

1208
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,600
Ubuntu podcast.org.

1209
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,560
Get more wimpy poppy and mark two over there.

1210
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,560
Yeah, so docs, I have the big thumbs up for it.

1211
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,760
All right, let's keep going.

1212
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,600
Let's talk about this new automation system.

1213
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,840
In fact, Wes was plugging away at a new phase of our automation system.

1214
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,860
And it's going to be a beast.

1215
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:09,400
It's going to eventually when all is said and done, the process will go from editing

1216
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,200
into the system, which has yet to be named.

1217
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:17,240
It'll be rendered to MP3, it'll be rendered to video files, it can be rendered to multiple

1218
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,280
formats, really.

1219
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,540
It'll be distributed around the internet, it gets rendered to a particular visualized

1220
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:27,560
type of video, it has text, it'll have artwork that it creates.

1221
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,560
Chapters.

1222
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:33,480
It'll add the chapter markers, it'll publish it to the RSS feeds, it'll eventually publish

1223
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,480
it to the website.

1224
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,000
I mean, these have yet to arrive, but it is a system.

1225
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,200
And the idea is once you submit the work from the editor, everything's basically automated

1226
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,320
from editing to the publishing.

1227
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,320
Everything's automated.

1228
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,240
Between the final edited WAV file and the show notes that we prepare, that's it.

1229
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,680
You can't automate Joe.

1230
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,680
But everything after Joe, you can.

1231
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,680
We're trying really hard.

1232
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:59,080
All right, so we have launched a straw poll to see what the hell we should actually name

1233
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,080
this thing.

1234
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,880
The community submitted a ton of names.

1235
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,840
I did not actually count, but it was hundreds.

1236
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,520
Let's just say thousands to make them feel good.

1237
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,480
It was one of the larger spreadsheets I've ever had to sift through.

1238
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,200
And which two names do you think, wow, people could vote for two names.

1239
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,720
Wow, look at Angel letting them go.

1240
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,360
Which two names work best for the Jupyter broadcasting automation system?

1241
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:28,880
We have Autopod, Podpublisher, Podmaker, Jupytercaster, Castablasta, which, oh, that's a little bias

1242
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,880
for me.

1243
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:30,880
It is.

1244
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,280
Yeah, that's for people that have been listening for a really long time.

1245
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,680
Yeah, that's Castablasta.

1246
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:38,660
They publish, OpenPublishMe, which I kind of like that one.

1247
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:46,780
But I guess it's kind of generic, Bylove, Autopody, Podpublisher, JupyterPodcaster,

1248
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,580
and Podblisher.

1249
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,580
You can't have Podpublisher.

1250
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,580
I know.

1251
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:52,580
That's off the table.

1252
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,580
I know.

1253
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,580
Was Podpublisher in there?

1254
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:55,580
Oh, yeah.

1255
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:56,580
No, Podpusher.

1256
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,580
It was Podpusher.

1257
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,160
And Podpublisher, you said.

1258
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,920
We've got some software called Podpublish, so let's not get those clattered.

1259
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,740
It was Podbilish, but I agree.

1260
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,240
We don't want any name collisions.

1261
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,520
You and I are on the same page, though.

1262
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,080
Because my vote really is, I probably shouldn't say what my vote is.

1263
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,220
What about Autopody?

1264
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,520
Did you say that one?

1265
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,520
I think I did say Autopody.

1266
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,520
Yeah, I think I did.

1267
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,520
Because that's a good one.

1268
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,080
All right, I'm making my votes.

1269
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,080
Let's see here.

1270
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:30,120
Oh, Castablasta is coming at 21% right now, Autopod, and then Jupytercaster, and then

1271
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,120
Podpusher.

1272
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,240
But we'll keep it open for a while.

1273
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:37,760
And if you voted before, this is a new link, so make sure you go listen to this episode.

1274
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,360
If you're listening, go vote again.

1275
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,360
Refine.

1276
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,360
A refined...

1277
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,340
A better selection of the best suggestions from the wonderful community.

1278
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:50,800
We have 99 votes right now, so you are very much still in that phase where you could move

1279
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,800
the needle.

1280
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,920
And remember, if you don't vote, you can't complain.

1281
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,880
And boy, I'm looking forward to see where that goes.

1282
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,720
All right, we got another email into the show, this one from Albert.

1283
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:06,720
He says, howdy, I just switched to my Dell 17-inch Core i3 laptop to elementary OS from

1284
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,720
Windows.

1285
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,720
Oh.

1286
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,920
I love all of the OS to a point.

1287
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:17,960
But recently, I got my wife her first MacBook, and my question is, is there a YouTube app

1288
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,960
or Linux snap?

1289
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,700
Because she's got one, and I would like to have a desktop YouTube application.

1290
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,700
No web browser.

1291
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,940
He says he's used something similar on the Mac in the past.

1292
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:29,720
He's been listening to the podcast for about a year.

1293
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,720
Keep up the great work.

1294
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,240
Albert from West Fargo, do we have any YouTube desktop applications?

1295
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,960
Now I'm going to just mention the obvious one here, because I'm sure this is on the

1296
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,280
tip of everybody's tongue.

1297
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:46,080
You could just use YouTube DL, which is a package in your local repo that will just

1298
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:51,100
give it the URL of a YouTube file and a video, and it will pull it down into pretty much

1299
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,580
any format you want.

1300
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,280
And there are graphical front ends to that.

1301
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:58,600
I'm not sure if they're in the elementary app store or app center, but they're definitely

1302
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,600
in the larger repository.

1303
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:05,280
I will also say that MPV, just if you have YouTube DL, it'll integrate and you just paste

1304
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,120
that YouTube link there and hey.

1305
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,520
Just MPV and then the URL to the YouTube video.

1306
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,520
And you're good.

1307
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,960
There was also, there also used to be like Minitube.

1308
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,960
Minitube's out there.

1309
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:14,960
I'm linking that right now.

1310
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:15,960
So that's one option.

1311
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,080
I haven't, I haven't used it.

1312
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:22,060
But anybody in the, Mr. Drifter, do you have like a YouTube app that you use to watch videos

1313
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,540
without the web browser?

1314
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:27,040
So I'm actually on board with you, I generally just use YouTube DL.

1315
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:32,520
But I had one of my buddies point out, it's an app for, from NPM, it's called Natafire.

1316
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:37,800
And essentially you can pass it any URL and it will make it a electron app.

1317
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,400
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1318
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,400
That's another way you could go.

1319
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,360
And then you just make yourself like a YouTube application.

1320
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:47,280
It's a web app, but it's, it's an own standalone thing independent from your browser.

1321
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,620
You could have it logged into a separate Google account.

1322
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:52,900
So there could be some real advantages to doing that.

1323
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:56,480
And if you have one, yeah, Minitube, okay, great, yeah, Minitube, which is, boy, that's

1324
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,480
a weird URL.

1325
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,480
We should probably throw that in the show notes.

1326
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,480
Already done.

1327
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,480
Thank you, sir.

1328
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,740
You are on top of it today.

1329
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:05,080
Show notes, again, linuxunplug.com slash 276.

1330
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,200
Here's another app that we're going to have in those show notes.

1331
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,300
It's called WebTTY.

1332
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:13,700
You can share a terminal session over WebRTC.

1333
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,760
Years ago, I talked about something similar to this, but it wasn't using WebRTC.

1334
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,880
This is the differentiating factor here.

1335
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:27,560
You essentially use this built-in browser technology, you pair with a friend, and you

1336
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,780
don't need a proxy server.

1337
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,440
You can do it behind NATs.

1338
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,680
It works just in browser.

1339
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:38,160
And there's a great GIF that shows you the person who has a local session on their Linux

1340
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,720
box and then the web browser for somebody who's watching on a Mac.

1341
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,060
This just made me think about your friend again, like similar situation where you could

1342
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,480
easily share something with your friend.

1343
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,080
He could just go to a URL on his Mac and start watching.

1344
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,540
It's not very complicated.

1345
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:53,720
It's easy to share on social media if you want to do like a demonstration.

1346
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,400
I will say it had a little bit of trouble.

1347
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,460
I used it in some, let's say, exotic environments, but anywhere where you might have like a double

1348
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:04,640
NAT, like I ran it in a couple of containers that were behind on my LAN.

1349
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,040
But running it on like a droplet works no problem.

1350
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:14,520
And the pasting, the big blob of data between each other, it works pretty well.

1351
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:19,280
That seemed like, okay, so they kind of tout working behind a NAT here, but you're saying...

1352
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,800
No, it does, but it basically works as well as like your typical WebRTC implementation

1353
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,280
because that's what it's doing behind the back.

1354
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,280
Sure.

1355
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,280
Yeah.

1356
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,280
Okay.

1357
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,280
That makes sense.

1358
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,120
And then some of us just refuse to accept the death of Unity.

1359
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,120
It's too hard.

1360
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:35,160
You know, got a few things right.

1361
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:39,160
And when Mark Shuttleworth announced the end of the Unity desktop and the transition to

1362
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:42,560
GNOME, since then, you've had so many people come out of the woodwork saying, well, I kind

1363
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,560
of liked Unity.

1364
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,560
I loved it.

1365
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,560
I thought it was kind of great.

1366
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,320
Can I still use Unity?

1367
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,320
Is there a spin?

1368
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,320
I don't know.

1369
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:54,520
I think there is, but there is maybe something that's a bit of a middle ground.

1370
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,440
It's a GNOME Shell extension, everybody.

1371
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,500
It's Unite Shell, a GNOME Shell extension, which makes a few layout tweaks to the top

1372
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:06,160
panel and removes window decorations to make them look like Ubuntu Unity Shell.

1373
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:10,600
It's like when you maximize, like the close buttons go up in the title bar up top.

1374
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,080
That makes sense.

1375
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,080
Yeah.

1376
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:17,320
Anybody have any thoughts on this Unity Unite Shell extension?

1377
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,320
Yeah, it's funny.

1378
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:22,920
There's so many of these ways and means in which you can make your desktop look like

1379
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,920
Unity.

1380
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,920
There's, you know, Michael Tunnel has done a whole guide for how you make KDE look like

1381
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,920
it.

1382
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:33,680
We've got the thing that makes GNOME look like a bit like Unity and Martin's got Mutiny.

1383
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:41,520
And then this Linux on Dex thing that Samsung made has the GNOME flashback session or whatever

1384
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,520
it's called.

1385
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,520
Right.

1386
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,520
Oh, yeah.

1387
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,520
Right.

1388
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,880
There are a lot of people who said it was terrible and awful.

1389
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,040
There are a lot of people who are trying to make their desktops look like it.

1390
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,480
Yeah, I have noticed.

1391
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,240
And when I saw that, I was like, that actually looks kind of good.

1392
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,240
We like the design.

1393
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,240
We just don't want canonical to make it in-house.

1394
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,240
Yeah.

1395
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,240
Yeah.

1396
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,240
I guess so.

1397
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,280
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

1398
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,640
Well, we'll have a link in the show notes if you want to check it out.

1399
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,360
But it's obviously it's on the GNOME extensions website.

1400
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,360
So you can just go grab it.

1401
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,240
I'm kind of tempted, but I don't have...

1402
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,240
There's no harm in trying.

1403
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,240
Actually, you know what?

1404
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,240
Fedora right there.

1405
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,300
I was just thinking that.

1406
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,120
We should totally do it on the Fedora box.

1407
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,880
That would love that.

1408
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,880
That would be so great.

1409
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:21,880
All right.

1410
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:25,320
Well, that wraps up this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1411
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,320
There's just a few left.

1412
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,400
Like I said, towards the top of the show, our predictions episode is coming up soon.

1413
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,400
So join us for that.

1414
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,400
We'll be talking about that.

1415
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,400
Yeah, I'm thinking about what's going to happen in 2019.

1416
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,280
Maybe you can blow our minds with something.

1417
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,280
Blow our minds!

1418
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,120
And I'm looking forward to the holidays.

1419
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,640
We got Turkey Day coming up here in the States.

1420
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:43,160
So happy Turkey Day to everybody out there that does celebrate it.

1421
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,320
Don't forget that Black Friday sale.

1422
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,320
It's a hell of a deal.

1423
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:49,040
If you've signed up recently to support these shows, why not take advantage of the Black

1424
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,040
Friday sale?

1425
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,040
Why not?

1426
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,240
Or if you're a student, or you want to get into something, do it.

1427
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,240
Anyways, I'm at ChrisOS.

1428
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,240
I'm at Westpacne.

1429
01:06:55,240 --> 01:07:22,640
We'll see you back here next Tuesday!

1430
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:39,640
There we go.

1431
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,640
There's a show.

1432
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:45,280
You know, you were just asking in the chat room during the outro, Drifter, about Barrier,

1433
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,720
which is a Synergy alternative.

1434
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:51,600
We haven't tried it yet, just because this is my first Tuesday back in studio.

1435
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:56,440
But I think it's probably on our list to kind of consolidate down to one keyboard and mouse

1436
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,160
and still have, we'll have one.

1437
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,640
We got to synergize the studio.

1438
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:04,280
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven screens in front of us.

1439
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,360
You can even like set it up so we could actually place one of our ThinkPads in there.

1440
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,440
Yeah, and then have eight screens.

1441
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,440
Yeah.

1442
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:11,440
Yeah.

1443
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,760
So yeah, that is something we want to play with and then do.

1444
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,080
We got a couple of segments in the works too.

1445
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,460
We're working on some WireGuard stuff.

1446
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:21,240
We still have some more projects we're going to be open sourcing.

1447
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:26,320
And then when we get some breathing room, we also have some announcements we want to

1448
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:28,720
make around like contributions to open source projects and stuff.

1449
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,720
So there is much in the works.

1450
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:35,520
But right now we're doing a whole bunch of backend stuff, trying to get our ducks in

1451
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,560
a row.

1452
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,440
And then we can get into new shows.

1453
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,920
It turns out there was a lot of dust we needed to sweep up sitting behind things.

1454
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,360
Stuff that we never had resources to take care of before.

1455
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,680
And now we have the resources to clean house a little bit and make things the way they

1456
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,680
should be.

1457
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,160
So we want some of our processes to reflect the professionalism that we're trying to aspire

1458
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,160
to.

1459
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,760
And so some of those things just had to be changed.

1460
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:58,440
Plus, there's a whole bunch of backend like business processes stuff that we're working

1461
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,440
through.

1462
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,080
But yeah, the whole merging still.

1463
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,080
Yeah.

1464
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,080
It's still lots of stuff out.

1465
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,360
Yeah, but it's getting so close to being done.

1466
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:08,960
So we're working on new, we're starting to work on new projects.

1467
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,760
We're starting to make plans for next year's contributions.

1468
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:15,760
Like we're setting up like goals for our department to make sure that we reach a certain level

1469
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,440
of contributions and stuff like that.

1470
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,600
So we'll be talking about all that stuff soon.

1471
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:49,440
So that barrier, WireGuard, our automation system stuff, still a lot to come.
