00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
You guys see this TechCrunch is running the story about Avast did this report this morning

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,720
that reveals a new form of malware on the Google Play Store, which begins to display

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,460
advertisements disguised as warning messages to end users when they unlock their Android

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,240
smartphone.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,240
So like, I guess it waits?

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:24,040
Wouldn't that be just a different version of like any other website than just on mobile?

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,440
Because I remember like some websites try to freak you out and just...

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,480
Well, I think the particular one here is that you're not opening an app.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,400
It's just happening as soon as you unlock the device.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,400
That's what it says.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,680
They show a card game that it's embedded in, an IQ test game, a history app were also found

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,680
to be infected.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,360
Well, yes, it's like as if people haven't learned by now, don't install random IQ test

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,360
apps.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,360
Well, I think they haven't.

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,360
Yeah.

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,360
So here's a video of it.

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,360
Let's see what happens.

19
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,360
Let's find out.

20
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,400
So they got an Android device here and they say, okay, now I'll unlock it.

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,160
Oh, when they say unlock it, they don't mean unlock the phone.

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,760
They mean unlock the screen.

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,480
So when you unlock the screen, it brings up you an urgent prompt to do something at the

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,240
Google play store and then it gets your stuff.

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
Okay.

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,840
So I misread unlock is actually like unlocking the device, but they just mean disabling the

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,000
screen protection.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,060
That is much more, that is much, that, okay.

30
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,060
That's a bigger problem.

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,060
That's going to hit a lot more people.

32
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,120
I'm slightly confused with the difference between unlocking the phone and unlocking

33
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
the phone is.

34
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,480
Well, unlocking the screen just to wake it up versus like unlocking the phone to move

35
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,000
it to a different carrier or like rooting it.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Right?

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Right.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So it's just when you enter your pin code.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Or slide a little thing, it comes up and yeah.

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah.

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hmm.

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,360
I didn't know that Google ever had urgent warnings or something.

47
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
No, I don't.

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
I guess it's all.

49
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
I need to update software.

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,680
It normally just shows up as a notification.

51
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,200
I guess users probably wouldn't know that though.

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
I just can't fathom.

53
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,480
I mean, I, I don't know what it is, but I just can't fathom why people switch distro.

54
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,000
I mean, I get it if you're a distro reviewer, I get it if you are, well, I get it if you've

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,680
got ADHD or some other medical condition that forces you to like must have change, must

56
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
have change.

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,160
I get that, but I can't for the other 90%, I can't understand why people do it.

58
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,840
I know a lot of people change distros because of the experience they had inside of a distro.

59
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,520
I don't know, I can't change so much that I, yeah.

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,200
Distro hopping makes no sense to me.

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
It's got to be.

62
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,680
I always try to settle on a distro, but if something happens, then I might switch.

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,280
It's got to be the grass is greener thing.

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,080
You know, you get frustrated or something just isn't quite right.

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,800
It's not quite how you want it.

66
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,760
You know, in this case, Unity is great, but now Eric's having problems with compiz and

67
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,040
maybe he keeps having problems with compiz and something wears him down.

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,680
He starts thinking, gosh, you know, I'd really like to try this.

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,760
And so I think it's like a grass is greener kind of thing.

70
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,080
It's partially that, but for me, it's also a matter of, okay, there's something not working

71
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,320
right in this case, but it works right over here, so let me try that for a while, see

72
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
how I like it.

73
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,460
Right, but in your house, if you didn't like the wallpaper in the bathroom, you don't knock

74
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,160
the entire house down and build a new one and then wallpaper the bathroom.

75
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
You don't?

76
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,160
You fix the wallpaper in the bathroom.

77
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,440
Well, no, I just switch out the furnace.

78
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:17,960
I find that it's because the current distro I'm on doesn't actually reach my expectations

79
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,760
and I just want to move to another one.

80
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,600
The other thing with me is I just like to try it out, see what it's like, basically

81
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,080
because, and that's one of the things that is cool about being a distro hopper and being

82
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,840
a producer for this network, I can offer a lot of valid input based on a plethora of

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
knowledge.

84
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,600
Here's the undisputable facts, all distributions have little wiggle points that people don't

85
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,000
like that drive them crazy and make them want to use a different distribution.

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,040
Ergo, everyone should just use Arch, fix the problems that don't work for them, and enjoy

87
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,360
the master race distro.

88
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:03,160
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's jonesing for that new Raspberry

89
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
Pi.

90
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,320
My name is Chris.

91
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
And my name is Matt.

92
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,120
Hey there Matt, I'm not normally the guy that gets into these really small gadgets, but

93
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,920
when they're talking three to six times the performance, maybe I could throw Mate on that,

94
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,920
you know, maybe even go, I'm just thinking, you never know, so now I kind of want one

95
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
for 35 bucks.

96
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,400
We're going to talk more about it in the second half of the show.

97
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,880
It looks like a pretty cool gadget, and of course we've got folks in the mumble room

98
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,680
that are all about them Raspberry Pis, so we'll get their take on it.

99
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,240
But before we get to that in the show this week, we're going to get a little recap of

100
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Fossdom.

101
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,160
Unfortunately, and maybe this will be the last time, I don't know, I'll see after I

102
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,560
get the report.

103
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,280
We weren't able to make it out to Fossdom, but that is across the pond, and it is a great

104
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,660
open source conference, and Poppy and others in the mumble room made it, and they're going

105
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,000
to give us their update.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,560
I think I'm going to be totally jelly too, so that's cool.

107
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,520
I think that's going to make me go next year, but we'll find out.

108
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,240
So I think it's going to be a good show, Matt.

109
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
Nice.

110
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,080
We've got a lot of stuff to cover, and we also got some surprisingly great feedback this

111
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
week.

112
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,680
I was like, I don't know, I don't know if I really want to do feedback, and then I saw

113
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,720
this stuff, and I was like, okay, we've got to talk about this.

114
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,760
So before, just to make our first email a little more poignant, I want to talk about

115
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,260
a development that's recently occurred, and it's been talked about in our Linux action

116
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,260
share subreddit a bit.

117
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,920
It's not technically Linux news, but you'll see why I want to bring this up, but it's

118
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,140
come out that Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are reportedly paying the ad block extension

119
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,840
that you might have in your browser to allow their ads to pass through ad blocks filter

120
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,840
software.

121
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,100
The confidential details were conferred by the Financial Times in a paper that came out

122
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,840
on Tuesday that we were recording this.

123
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,760
So I mention that because that brings us to our first email.

124
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,080
So to cover our first email, let's bring in our Mumble Room.

125
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Hey, Mumble Room.

126
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Time appropriate greetings, guys.

127
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
Hello.

128
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Hello.

129
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
Hello.

130
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,200
There's lots of people.

131
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
I'm hungry for pie.

132
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
It is a lot.

133
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,720
So yeah, we will get the pie.

134
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,440
So guest one wrote in specifically addressing the Mumble Room.

135
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,120
It says, hello, everyone reading this email.

136
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,660
During Linux Unplugged 77, the Mumble Room commented that ad block is heavy, and I'm

137
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,660
here to present you with a solution.

138
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,840
It's called uBlock, pronounced uBlock, and it's a you-decide-what enters your browser.

139
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,840
uBlock supports Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari, and it's licensed under the GPL3.

140
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,040
And he links us to it on GitHub.

141
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,880
So I just wanted to pass that along to the audience.

142
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:32,280
I'm not a big fan of ad blocks because A, people have got to get paid, and B, if that's

143
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,140
how people want to represent their work and their website, then I think I should be able

144
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,960
to take that into my judgment about their property.

145
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,400
And when I block the ad, sometimes I don't see some of that, and I don't see some of

146
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,580
the decisions they're making from a content standpoint.

147
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:51,240
And so I make maybe the incorrect judgment, not to point out and single out our buddy,

148
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,840
Mr. Michael, over at Ferronix.

149
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,760
But I had been a user, I've been a reader of Ferronix for a while with, sorry Michael,

150
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,160
but with ad block turned on, and I kind of had a rethinking of this, and I thought, boy,

151
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
I really shouldn't do that.

152
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,880
You know, the man deserves to eat, and I'm reading his stuff.

153
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:15,400
So I disabled my ad blocker on Ferronix, and I was so taken aback by pop-up ads and cover-up

154
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
ads.

155
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,000
I really haven't gone back much anymore, just because it was so off-putting.

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,600
And I felt like that gave me a different impression of the website when I had ad block on versus

157
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,160
when I had it off, enough that it changed my opinion about visiting the site.

158
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,240
Well, I can kind of give you my perspective on it, both as a publisher and as someone

159
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,440
that visits websites.

160
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,000
So I've worked with, so I guess the long and short of it comes down to this.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,440
I will take ad block and whitelist any site that I plan on visiting on a regular basis.

162
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,680
I want to support them, I dig them, they're great.

163
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,040
Now if it's a website that I want to visit on a regular basis that is going to pollute

164
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,680
me with crap, then that gets a little sticky.

165
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,560
I may, in fact, just ad block them and figure, hey, I'll support them in other ways that

166
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,680
we'll find something else to have happen.

167
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,460
Maybe I'll promote them or talk about their stuff or some other way of supporting them.

168
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,800
But ad blocking software is a tool that allows us to choose how we want to interpret our

169
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
content.

170
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,320
The problem is that, especially in the tech community, ads like banner ads and AdSense

171
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,920
ads and things like that aren't terribly effective.

172
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,240
They're historically not.

173
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,600
They're very effective in non-tech circles, but in tech circles they're pretty, it's pretty

174
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
hit and miss.

175
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Right.

176
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
I kind of just tune them out.

177
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Yeah.

178
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
People want engagement advertisement.

179
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,880
I mean, well, they don't necessarily want advertisement, but they tend to respond better

180
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
to that.

181
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,640
So anytime you've got something on a webpage blinking at you, especially with pop-ups,

182
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
I mean, come on.

183
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Right?

184
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
Yeah.

185
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Nobody needs that nonsense.

186
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
No.

187
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
It's a bad experience.

188
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
So anything you can do to block that.

189
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
Yeah, let's get rid of it.

190
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
Get it out of here.

191
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
Heaven's Revenge, you had some comment on the uBlock project itself.

192
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Yes.

193
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,520
I've been using uBlock ever since it was coded up.

194
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
I love it.

195
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,440
It uses half the RAM of Adblock Plus, and it gives a lot of preset block lists in their

196
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,760
configuration.

197
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,560
And it actually helps pages load a couple of milliseconds, maybe 150 milliseconds faster

198
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,960
than when you're using Adblock Plus.

199
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
No kidding.

200
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Yeah.

201
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
I'm going to check that out.

202
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,520
They say, here's their philosophy, uBlock is not an ad blocker, it's a general purpose

203
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
blocker.

204
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,280
uBlock blocks ad search support of the Adblock Plus filter syntax, but it can work with custom

205
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
rules and filters.

206
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
That's really interesting.

207
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,120
Yeah, it's completely compatible with all the Adblock syntax, and I recommend it here

208
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
quite often.

209
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
Wow.

210
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,280
It actually says that the overall memory footprint is less than with no blocker running.

211
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,760
How can they claim that?

212
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,280
It's because when you actually go and you block things, and it isn't triggered by it.

213
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Oh, sure.

214
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
Doesn't have to load it.

215
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Makes sense.

216
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Yeah, exactly.

217
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Yeah, right.

218
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

219
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
And way less CPU usage, too.

220
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,520
Yeah, well, Adblock has gotten big.

221
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,680
I'll give you that.

222
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
So uBlock it is.

223
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,520
Well, not only that, but it sounds like they've completely sold out for what they were trying

224
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
to do to begin with.

225
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
Yeah.

226
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,520
And these guys got lots of graphs, lots of statistics.

227
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
Yeah, they do.

228
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
I'm generally a bad person.

229
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
I just block everything.

230
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,960
Well, I just installed it, and I'm really impressed.

231
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
This is, wow.

232
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,800
It's also really easy to block things.

233
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
You don't have to right click on loads of menus.

234
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,960
You just have to click on that giant power button, and it blocks that site.

235
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,600
It stops blocking that site for you instead of you having to go through all these settings.

236
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,080
So uBlock sounds like it's a hit.

237
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
It's a little bit unusual.

238
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Oh, this is awesome, dude.

239
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Yeah, you got to check this out.

240
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,280
If you want to create your own custom filter, you'll get used to it.

241
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,720
It's really different when you make your custom filter.

242
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
But other than that, it's good.

243
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Tyler, I wanted to give you a chance to chime in.

244
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Oh, I recommend it anyway.

245
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Oh, yeah.

246
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,760
I just wanted to add, you know, sometimes I feel you don't even need an Adblocker to

247
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,520
get rid of the annoying stuff.

248
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,440
Just block Flash from the get-go and block certain scripts.

249
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,240
That's not a bad catch-all for sure.

250
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Yeah.

251
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,000
All right.

252
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Christian wrote in.

253
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Check this out, Matt.

254
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
How cool is this?

255
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,200
And then he says, I'm from Vivaldi, and I want to talk.

256
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,360
We were talking about the Vivaldi browser last week, because I'm a long-time Jupyter

257
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,600
broadcasting fan, which is super cool.

258
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,720
And I listen to all your tech shows as soon as they come out the door.

259
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,160
I also happen to work for Vivaldi here in the US, although I'm a Norwegian.

260
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,980
We're a company with developers and business people all over the world, but I'm located

261
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,400
outside of Boston with a couple other employees of Vivaldi.

262
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,220
Before Vivaldi, I worked in Opera since the end of the last century, which is also when

263
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,320
I installed Linux for the first time, and I've never looked back at any other OS.

264
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,920
We are, of course, very excited about launching Vivaldi, which is the browser we hope Opera

265
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,080
would become.

266
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,360
And Linux is important to us as both as other OSs some people use and our own.

267
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,000
Keep up the good work, and make sure to be always supporting Linux.

268
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,200
How cool is that?

269
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
That is so awesome.

270
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I love that.

271
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,320
And I love the fact that he reached out like that.

272
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Yeah.

273
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,880
Christian, we'll see if we can't sync up and maybe have you on a future show to talk about

274
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,380
what you guys are doing.

275
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,320
And maybe if you can, talk about some of the interesting things about developing the browser

276
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
for Linux.

277
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,400
I'd be pretty curious about that.

278
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
So I'm really glad to email this.

279
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
I'm glad I caught it, too.

280
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
It's awesome.

281
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Because you never know.

282
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,720
And, of course, we want your emails, too.

283
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,360
Go over to jupyterbroadcasting.com, click the contact link, and choose Linux Unplug from

284
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
the dropdown.

285
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,840
We have one more quick email and then two shout-outs to get to, but first, I want to

286
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,680
tell you about something amazing, and that's Linux Academy.

287
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,060
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplug to get our special Linux Unplugged discount.

288
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,320
They want to give the Linux users a special discount because they're super passionate

289
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Linux users.

290
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,400
That's where they were Linux Unplugged got started.

291
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,360
It's a resource for you to use to further your own education, and the reason why I think

292
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,020
Linux Academy is something specifically for our audience to consider is because if you

293
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,780
are going out in the field of anything around Linux or any major open source technologies

294
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:31,040
like OpenStack or even AWS, there's training in a lot of places, but none of them are like

295
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,920
Linux Academy because Linux Academy was created by Linux users themselves who are crazy passionate.

296
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,640
They considered launching a podcast network and then decided, well, Jupyter Broadcasting

297
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,920
has got that down.

298
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
So let's do something else.

299
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,480
Let's do education, and they have developers that they brought in and educators they brought

300
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,480
in.

301
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,200
In fact, they have live streams with the educators, which is a great experience.

302
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,280
You can ask those questions in real time.

303
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,560
They have so many amazing courses for you to take.

304
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,540
I like to talk about some of the newer ones because I think they're really on the cutting

305
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,280
edge of the latest, coolest technology in Linux, the stuff that you probably want to

306
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:03,080
keep your skill set fresh on anyways, which is another really great benefit of Linux Academy,

307
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,400
but what I'll talk about, what I've started doing is I just started taking the Ruby on

308
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Linux courseware.

309
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,640
And that's another thing I love about Linux Academy is a lot of the online educational

310
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,940
resources out there, you could go learn Ruby from other places, right, and what's it going

311
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,940
to tell you to do?

312
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,760
It's going to tell you how to set up your Mac to do Ruby development, but that doesn't

313
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
apply to me, right?

314
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,160
But Linux Academy is designed by Linux users for Linux users.

315
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,960
So everything's for Linux users.

316
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:37,380
So it's getting set up and developing in Ruby on the Linux desktop, right?

317
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,800
That closes that gap.

318
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,360
That makes it so much more useful for me and I look at that and I say, okay, well I'm going

319
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,600
to take five and a half hours to learn Ruby.

320
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,920
I can wrap my brain around that.

321
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,240
I get that.

322
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,660
That is an achievable goal, something that I can attack.

323
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,400
It's not this big nebulous thing, how the hell am I going to learn Ruby?

324
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,380
Oh, I'm going to learn Ruby because Linux Academy has coursewares on it and it's going

325
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,000
to take me five and a half hours.

326
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,560
That's how I'm going to learn Ruby.

327
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,640
That is kind of the confidence and direction that I need to actually get off my butt and

328
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
do it.

329
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,920
And they have learning plans where you can set your availability so depending on how much

330
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,200
time you have free, the courseware will automatically adjust to that and send you reminders for

331
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
that.

332
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Think about that.

333
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
That's crazy.

334
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Cool.

335
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,520
And you can download the study guides on the go so you can read when you have a little

336
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,440
bit of extra time including like the walkthrough stuff so you can listen to it as a podcast

337
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,280
which is really handy if you're in the car.

338
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,240
Why not spend some of that time when you're done listening to your JB content, go into

339
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,680
education mode.

340
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,560
Switch from one type of Linux content to another type of Linux content.

341
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,640
Your brain's already going to be in that gear.

342
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
It's a really cool service.

343
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,800
I want you to go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

344
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,400
We got that special discount for you.

345
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,160
You'll see why you want the discount once you check them out.

346
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,520
Go try out some of their courses.

347
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,640
You can pick from seven plus Linux distributions.

348
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,980
The courseware will match that distribution.

349
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,360
The labs when they spin up virtual machines for you which is a really cool system.

350
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,240
I got a little bit of the inside scoop on how it works too so I'm pretty impressed from

351
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,600
like a system administration design standpoint too like how they have some of this stuff.

352
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,280
It's damn impressive because they're really passionate about it.

353
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
So I can respect that.

354
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,680
I know like what I love is like okay the courseware, guess what?

355
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,020
You need a virtual server, they just spin it right up on whatever Linux distribution

356
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,020
you chose.

357
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,020
It's good to go.

358
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
You get an address on there.

359
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,020
You can SSH from your desk.

360
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,840
You know so you get really great performance while you're working in the lab environment.

361
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,560
It's crazy cool because they get you and they get Linux.

362
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,080
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the

363
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,040
Linux unplugged program.

364
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,480
Love hearing the success stories too so keep sending those in as well.

365
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Those are great.

366
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
All right.

367
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,080
So I wanted to just cover one more email.

368
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,200
It comes in from Chuck and this is kind of exciting.

369
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,360
We've been kind of kicking back and forth.

370
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,840
Different production software for Linux and of course Ardour gets mentioned all the time

371
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,560
as Audacity, Okan Audio got mentioned.

372
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,540
But something really high-end, multi-track, do mixing, do audio like a music kind of stuff.

373
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,200
So Chuck writes and he says you mentioned Ardour being a little cumbersome.

374
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
He says I agree.

375
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,620
I've used it for years but when you need to do high-level production, you can't beat the

376
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,760
latest offering from Bitwig and he links me to it and I'm going to bring this up here

377
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
in a second.

378
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
He says it's amazing.

379
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,320
It's like cleaning up podcast, making production music, live DJ sessions by piping mix into

380
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,680
it and piping that out to IDJC.

381
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,320
Just something worth checking into.

382
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,080
It does have a hefty price tag.

383
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,120
I thought okay, this might be interesting.

384
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:21,280
What kind of, is this like some sort of like weird old like XUI kind of app for audio editing

385
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,640
and because I hear a lot of this.

386
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
I hear a lot of this.

387
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,920
Oh, you got to check this one out.

388
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,600
It's really, it's a good one.

389
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
And then it's never.

390
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
It looks like 1995.

391
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Yeah.

392
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
It's never a good one.

393
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
No, man.

394
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
This is a good one.

395
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,760
I'm checking out.

396
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,520
They have a blog post up about their next version.

397
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,200
The UI looks amazing and there's a little bit of a video here I'm going to play and

398
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,520
I'll just play just a little bit for the audio listeners.

399
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
Don't worry.

400
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
It won't go too long.

401
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
But it's pretty cool and it gives you an action.

402
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,720
If you're watching the video, it gives you a chance to see the UI in action which is pretty

403
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
sweet.

404
00:16:50,720 --> 00:17:02,040
So it's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, it's called Bitwig Studio.

405
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Now here comes the UI.

406
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:10,880
So there's the recording UI.

407
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,320
Now you got, I don't know for those of you watching the video version, this is a super

408
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:20,960
pro level UI that easily, easily matches Pro Tools or Apple's Logic easily.

409
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
Wow.

410
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Wow.

411
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
That's actually, wow.

412
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,240
I actually want to look into this.

413
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Yeah, me too.

414
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
I'm geeking out right now.

415
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,720
Yeah, this is, I'm looking at some of the audio stuff.

416
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,120
It's just so sweet.

417
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,000
So Bitwig Studio.

418
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,600
This looks like one of the coolest audio editors I've ever seen on any platform.

419
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,480
So I'm going to give it a look probably later this week.

420
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,200
Do they have a demo?

421
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,360
I hope so.

422
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
I'm sure they do.

423
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
Yeah.

424
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
There's a demo on the page.

425
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
Yeah.

426
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,080
Anytime, any big ticket item like this in software always has a demo.

427
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,440
They just have to to survive.

428
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
But that's just, wow.

429
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Take my money.

430
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Yeah, take my money.

431
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
I know, right?

432
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Should we see how much it is?

433
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,000
Let's see if we can find out.

434
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Let's see.

435
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,120
Oh, it's on sale.

436
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
So let's take a look.

437
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
Let's see.

438
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
It's on sale, guys.

439
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
Jeez.

440
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,960
Oh, actually it's doable.

441
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,360
You know, for a high end piece of production software, $300.

442
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
I guess.

443
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
No, that's actually less than I figured.

444
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
I guess it's on sale.

445
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,360
So I don't, I don't know.

446
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
That's about what I figured.

447
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,080
So the demo worked out and everything.

448
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,520
I mean, honestly, $300 for really high end audio production, a software that has a good

449
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,320
solid UI on Linux.

450
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Exactly.

451
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
And cross platform too.

452
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
Yeah.

453
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
I mean, I'm all for it.

454
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
Yeah, of course.

455
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
I will keep watching.

456
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,640
I would keep watching the open source software too, but this seems like a really nice piece

457
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
of software.

458
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,240
But this illustrates a real defining point of, I love using open source apps, but honestly

459
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,080
I'm going to use the tool on Linux that works.

460
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
I'm sorry.

461
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,080
I just am.

462
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
You know?

463
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Yeah.

464
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
That's just me.

465
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,400
So here's what we have going in the Linux action show subreddit and we could use your

466
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,680
input.

467
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,840
Number one, first up, producer Q5Sys created a thread.

468
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,440
Your help needed coming up with a list of the best GNOME tweaks and extensions.

469
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,240
And this will have linked in the feedback section of the Linux unplugged show notes.

470
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,800
It's also currently sticky to the top of the subreddit.

471
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Now here's the thing.

472
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,480
We've gotten a lot of extensions, which is cool.

473
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,520
Like I'm totally trolling it and like adding a few more extensions to my GNOME, which you

474
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,960
know is a great idea.

475
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,320
But we haven't gotten a lot of straight up tweaks and hacks.

476
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
Now don't freak out.

477
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,840
We're not going to try to say, hey, this is great ways to break your GNOME.

478
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,760
But if we were going to have a little fun, like if we're just hanging out and having

479
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,840
some fun, what are kind of things that you do to GNOME to make it more better beyond

480
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
just an extension?

481
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,960
Now extensions are welcome too, especially if they're not well known.

482
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,200
We'll have it linked in the show notes.

483
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,280
There is some future content coming down the road that may use your answer.

484
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,720
I'll just put that out there.

485
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
Q5, anything you want to...

486
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
Did he leave?

487
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
No.

488
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
Not really.

489
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
He's kind of still here.

490
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Yeah.

491
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Well, he can chime in later if there's anything he wanted to add to that.

492
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,040
No, I just dropped into another channel because of mic issues.

493
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Oh, okay.

494
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Yeah.

495
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,640
Is there anything you wanted to add to my coverage of your thread there?

496
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,780
Is that good?

497
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,880
Just basically, yeah.

498
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,560
We're looking for more than just extensions.

499
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
Yeah.

500
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Okay.

501
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,080
If that's other applications or other things that work well with GNOME that make you enhance

502
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,920
the desktop experience, we want to know about it.

503
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
I've got a hack.

504
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
It's called Cinnamon.

505
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,320
I was going to say, made in material.

506
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Okay.

507
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,160
The next thread I want to give a little attention to, which AUR helper do you guys use?

508
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,000
I wanted to give a link out to this because we might do a roundup of this very soon.

509
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,440
And I wanted to kind of get everybody's input.

510
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,600
Right now, pack AUR is leading the pack.

511
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,640
I'm surprised how many people are saying your word, you masochist.

512
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,240
So go over to there and put your comments in there.

513
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,360
Any other kind of like Pac-Man tricks and techniques you have?

514
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
Yes.

515
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
I know it's arch-specific.

516
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Don't worry.

517
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
Don't get...

518
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
We're going to do it for other distros too, but we're just experimenting with it because

519
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,720
XOO started up and I thought, Hey, you know what?

520
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
Let's do this.

521
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,000
So we're going to do a roundup of some of the tips and advice people give in there.

522
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,280
And then we'll do it again for future distributions as well.

523
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,600
So don't worry.

524
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,160
I'm sure next up on the list will be one of them Debian based distributions.

525
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
I hear those are popular.

526
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
I hear people like to use those.

527
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,040
No, it's a myth.

528
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Aren't you on 14.04 Ubuntu Mate edition right now?

529
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,520
I am and I'm proud of it.

530
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
Yeah.

531
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
I'm actually quite happy with it.

532
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
Yeah.

533
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,520
It's definitely different.

534
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,840
Do you count to how many PPAs you have set up right now?

535
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,840
On this machine.

536
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,840
This is my...

537
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
I think maybe two.

538
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,560
I just don't use that much stuff.

539
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
That's not bad.

540
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
That's not bad.

541
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Yeah.

542
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
You know?

543
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Yeah.

544
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
Maybe three.

545
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
Maybe three.

546
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
I'll be generous.

547
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
So I guess...

548
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,760
Seriously, here was my most recent run with an Ubuntu based machine is I did 1504 alpha

549
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,720
two or whatever it is to get the latest KDE Plasma and I had about three or four PPAs

550
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,600
and within about two weeks of using it I was getting a 404 on one of my PPAs.

551
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Uh-oh.

552
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
I don't know.

553
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,680
That just drives me crazy.

554
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
It's a small complaint.

555
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,680
It's not a big deal.

556
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
But it's a great OS.

557
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,680
Yeah.

558
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,360
And it's something I would like to see evolve because I'd love to see the PPA system evolve

559
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
into something better.

560
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
I'm definitely open to that.

561
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
That'd be awesome.

562
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,080
What I find to be pretty interesting is I don't know if you saw that Dell's going to

563
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,000
be shipping a couple of Linux laptops.

564
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,360
And one we knew about and another one that's a larger laptop and on both laptops they're

565
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,120
going to use Ubuntu 14.04.

566
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Not surprised.

567
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,100
I mean, because a lot of times people when they're buying a system, if they're buying

568
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,200
it pre-installed, they probably don't give a rip about bleeding edge.

569
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,920
They probably just want it to work theoretically.

570
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
Yeah.

571
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Yeah.

572
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
And so that makes sense from and from a support perspective.

573
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
But here's what's interesting about the decision.

574
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,080
The kernel in 14.04 doesn't have Thunderbolt support.

575
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,680
So the laptop will be shipping with an unusable Thunderbolt port that may get updated later

576
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,480
in 14.04.

577
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,960
Again, thinking of the fact that it's who's buying the laptop and what their general audience

578
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
is.

579
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
I just think it's interesting.

580
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,120
I think it's still, yeah, I think it's something that hopefully they disclose clearly because

581
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,440
that could definitely be a real problem if they're boasting the port and then it doesn't

582
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
work.

583
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
That's a big no.

584
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
I think it means 14.04 is a clear winner.

585
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,160
I think, I mean, I guess they couldn't really ship with 14.10 really, but yeah, I just...

586
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,760
Well, and how does Dell do that?

587
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,560
So it's like, okay, so they're presenting this new laptop.

588
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,020
They've got this port they're probably talking about.

589
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,680
Do they disclose that in their materials?

590
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
They must, right?

591
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
They must.

592
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
I would hope so.

593
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
Just hope so.

594
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,720
Wizard Jed, you wanted to toss in, if you found yourself in this position, there is

595
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
an option, right?

596
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Yeah.

597
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,920
I actually had this problem itself.

598
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:16,280
I needed 3.16 and I could not go and use the kernel that was in 14.04 itself.

599
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:23,520
And anyway, so to go and get it, there's actually backported kernels themselves inside of every

600
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,400
single LTS for every version above it.

601
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,240
I didn't know about that, but that's something you got to go and read the Ubuntu Wiki about.

602
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,920
Ah, well, here's good news.

603
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,360
And I was wondering if this is true.

604
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,800
I knew they were going to do hardware enablements for 14.04.

605
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,140
Well, JBLive, who just joined the chat room, said that there's going to be a hardware enablement

606
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,880
stack in 14.04.2, which will be released in a couple of days.

607
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
So that works, right?

608
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,760
So pretty much by the time anybody gets their hands on these, the update will be out.

609
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,280
So once you get your machine and you install an update, you'll be okay.

610
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,280
It's not so bad.

611
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,280
There you go.

612
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Yeah, you reboot and you have Thunderbolt.

613
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
Hey, isn't that kind of magic?

614
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,880
See, 14.04, I tell you, it's a pretty solid release.

615
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,640
All right, Matt, well, hey, guess what?

616
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,000
We're going to do a recap of FOSDEM, a conference that I think this is almost, I'm almost going

617
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,200
to run out of excuses why I can't go, especially since I'm going to be going to Canada soon.

618
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,840
But first, I want to tell you about the great folks over at DigitalOcean who are now rocking

619
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,560
FreeBSD, CoreOS, and a bunch of other great distributions.

620
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,800
Head over to DigitalOcean.com right now to spin yourself up your own server up in the

621
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,280
cloud that you get root access to in less than a minute.

622
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,780
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

623
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,700
simple way to spin up your own server.

624
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,840
It feels like I am the master orchestrator of my own data center.

625
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,720
And here's what you get in less than a minute for $5 a month.

626
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Let's go over there.

627
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,840
It means crazy, right?

628
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,840
Think about that.

629
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,560
Less than a minute and for $5 a month, 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU,

630
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,040
and a terabyte of transfer.

631
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,700
DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

632
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,640
and London, like I always mention, if you're like me, I'm not even kidding.

633
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,480
I like data center porn so much that I really do, and that's why I always mention the DigitalOcean

634
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,440
as the pictures of their data centers up on their Instagram and their G Plus feeds.

635
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,400
So here's how I am.

636
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,640
I went over to, there's a brand new hotel that just opened up here in Smokey Point,

637
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,340
and I kind of wanted to check it out because I think we're going to be sending the host

638
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,600
there when they arrive.

639
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
I'm not sure.

640
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,840
We might move hotels, right?

641
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,280
Because this is brand new and it's fun for when people come in out of town to stay in

642
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
a new hotel.

643
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,280
That's a nice thing, right?

644
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
And so I've got to go check it out.

645
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
I've got to check out the Wi-Fi, right?

646
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,120
I've got to go make sure the crew is going to be taken care of when they come in for

647
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Linux Fest Northwest.

648
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,720
These are the things you do as a podcaster apparently.

649
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,920
So I go over to this Best Western, and I'm walking around and I'm kind of getting the

650
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
lay of the land.

651
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,040
I'm looking at what the conference centers were, and the guy, the manager who's running

652
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,520
the place, he happens to walk out, and I started asking him questions about the infrastructure.

653
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,040
I say, hey, can I see your server closet, and he actually lets me in.

654
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:56,320
I mentioned I used to work in IT, so I'd warmed him up a little bit, but I'm so interested

655
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,440
in how people have their setups.

656
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,200
It's just the coolest thing to see how different people do their configs.

657
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,600
So I got him to show me the server room, and I'm like, okay, this is pretty great.

658
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
It's not exactly what I expected.

659
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,680
I'm like, you're not managing all your telco and Wi-Fi equipment here, right?

660
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
That must be in a different room.

661
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,160
He's like, yeah, it's upstairs.

662
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,760
And so we go up, we ride the elevator up a couple of floors, and I go look at their telco

663
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,120
closet, and I was like, this is awesome.

664
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,240
That's why I'm always over the DigitalOcean page checking out some of their pictures,

665
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,480
because not only do I appreciate the fact that all their technology is running on Linux,

666
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,200
which I love, sitting on top of KVM, which is the boss, all on top of those SSD drives

667
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,080
that DigitalOcean invested, and then they connected to tier one bandwidth in those data

668
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,560
centers all over the world with this interface, right, this super simple, intuitive interface,

669
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,240
which is really simple.

670
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,120
I mean, it's so amazing how you can move a machine between data centers, back it up and

671
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,080
restore that snapshot, create a machine based off another snapshot, do DNS management, set

672
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,440
up SSH keys, HTML5 console, like, but it's like crazy in your face easy, and on top of

673
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,920
all of that, all that power, like if you want to get nitty-gritty, can be replicated with

674
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,040
their straightforward API.

675
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,520
And people will just be building apps like crazy for that, so you can take advantage

676
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
of that, too.

677
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,440
So go check out DigitalOcean, but here's the thing, this is what you got to do, you got

678
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,080
to support your favorite unplugged, right, this is your favorite talk show, Linux Unplugged,

679
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
you got to support that.

680
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,480
So use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, and I'll give you a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean,

681
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,960
which is really nice, too, and I like this a lot, is you can kind of get started without

682
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,920
even having a credit card, because you can just apply in a balance, so if you got a couple

683
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,400
of bucks in your PayPal account, you just pop that into your DigitalOcean account, but

684
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,520
you can get started for free with our $10 promo code, try out the $5 rig, two months,

685
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
$5 rig.

686
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
That's awesome, right?

687
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,120
DOUNPLUGGED, go build our own cloud, go play with CoreOS, go try out BitTorrent Sync, why

688
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,880
not do SyncThing, I mean, GitHub, or GitLab, Ghost, I mean, the list, I mean, the crazy

689
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,320
list goes on, and there's a bunch of one-click deployments, too, I could just go on about

690
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,120
how great it is, and how it's, for me, like, whenever I just know I need, okay, I need

691
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,020
a Linux rig to do something, I just spin it up right there.

692
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,040
I'll tell you, and when you're running something for clients, and you're like, okay, well,

693
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,240
I don't necessarily want to run anything on their stuff initially, I want to run it on

694
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,360
mine, transfer it over, makes transfers easy.

695
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,760
DigitalOcean.com, DOUNPLUGGED, all lowercase one word, when your face is over at DigitalOcean,

696
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,160
and a big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring our faces.

697
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,840
So FOSDEM15 wrapped up a free software event for developers to meet, share ideas, and collaborate.

698
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,320
They say every year, thousands of developers of free and open-source software from all

699
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,160
over the world gather an event in Brussels.

700
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,600
I wish I was there.

701
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,120
But Popey was there, and I've been, Popey's been trying to tell me about it all morning,

702
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,400
and I said, Popey, save it for the show, don't tell me anything, Popey.

703
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,800
So Popey, I've got to start, I'll ask Alan's question, did you see the BSD people at FOSDEM?

704
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,360
Nope, not a single one.

705
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Sorry, Alan.

706
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,680
I probably did, I probably did, I probably bumped into them in the corridors, it's absolutely

707
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,400
rammed, the places that you say.

708
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
Thousands?

709
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Is it really thousands of people?

710
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:49,760
So the biggest room they have is a lecture hall, it happens at university in Brussels,

711
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,280
and the biggest room they have holds officially 1,400 people, and it was pretty rammed on

712
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,640
more than one occasion, and all the other rooms get full as well.

713
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,360
So yeah, there's a lot of people there, it's a very, very busy conference.

714
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,360
So it was-

715
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,960
Yeah, like I was just looking at it, and you know, the conferences I'm used to, they're

716
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,160
at most four talks going on at once, and I think there are 24 happening at FOSDEM at

717
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
a time.

718
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,160
Wow.

719
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,920
Right, yeah, so they have it split up into a number of tracks, so you've got like a

720
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:24,360
desktop track, distributions track, internet of things track, Go track, you know, you've

721
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,440
got developer, separate developer rooms for Mozilla, for Java, MySQL, you know, it's all

722
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,360
grouped nicely, so you can, you know, you know where to go, because a room is dedicated

723
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,200
to a particular topic, so if you're MySQL heavy, you would go to that room, and if you're

724
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,720
interested in most of the Mozilla talks, you'd go to that room.

725
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,400
But they have an app that you can put on your Android or iOS phone, and a website where

726
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,480
you can see the entire schedule, and you can bookmark the talks you want to go to, and

727
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,880
then your phone will, you know, ping you when that talk's coming up.

728
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
This is really impressive.

729
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
This is like the best-

730
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
It's unbelievably well-organized.

731
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,200
Yeah, this is like the best system we've ever seen.

732
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Look at this.

733
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Look at this.

734
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
This is incredible.

735
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:15,000
I'd schedule, I'd put in my bookmarks on the way there, what I wanted to go and see, and

736
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,360
the app updates over the air and lets you know, you know, when talks are going to be.

737
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,140
I haven't been for like five, six years, and this is my first time for a while, and it's

738
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:31,240
just as I remember it, it's, you know, information dense, there are a lot of very detailed talks,

739
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,280
there are some high-level ones, like a little introduction to what, you know, some project

740
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,000
here or there is doing, but there are some detailed ones, and they cover a really wide

741
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
gambit.

742
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,640
You don't have to be focused on just one topic, there's so much there.

743
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,080
So I went to, I'll give you a few highlights of what I went to.

744
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:54,920
One was one from fWatch, which is a GPS watch made from free software, free hardware, 3D

745
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,760
printed case, components you can buy off the shelf to make your own GPS watch, make your

746
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,800
own apps, to have a thing on your wrist that you have total freedom over.

747
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
That was cool.

748
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:11,160
I went to a talk from the Tizen, not Tizen, Yola guys actually, both the Tizen talk and

749
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:20,240
a Yola talk about both had a talk about porting their platform to other devices, which was

750
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,300
good to see.

751
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,200
One about, there was a there's a legal room, which was surprisingly busy, a bunch of lawyers

752
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,880
standing talking about the intricacies of licensing was, you know, pretty rammed.

753
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,440
That room was pretty densely packed all the time.

754
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:42,040
And that was interesting to listen to their interpretation of upcoming laws in both EU

755
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,640
and the US and whether they will impact the validity of the GPL, which obviously is going

756
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,560
to have an impact on lots of people at a free software conference.

757
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,320
So that was that was pretty interesting.

758
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,200
And there was also one on in the legal room, there was one from Bradley Coon, who gave

759
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:05,720
a retrospective of a GPL violation that he had to deal with.

760
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,120
And it's a very interesting talk.

761
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,520
And it's called fighting a GPL violation by coding instead.

762
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,680
So instead of suing someone, they fork and, and continue developing under a different

763
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
name.

764
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,720
And the good news is that the FOSDEM organizers videotape all of these, I say videotape, and

765
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,880
I sound like I'm from the 80s, but they actually record it onto SD cards or some brand new

766
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,280
technology I haven't ascertained yet.

767
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,280
And they put them online.

768
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,600
So you go to the FOSDEM website, you can see a lot of these.

769
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,400
But there's so many awesome talks.

770
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,320
The one I think one of the most oversubscribed that I couldn't actually get into the room,

771
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:45,120
the room was full was Lennox talk on system D 2015.

772
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,920
What's new in system D, it's been reported on in the press by people who were there.

773
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,720
People were like live tweeting, Lennox talk.

774
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,880
What does that make you think when you hear that, right?

775
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,640
Like here's a here's somebody who live blogged it.

776
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:06,040
And he notes that there was no slides, none whatsoever, no presentation, he just talked.

777
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,160
Right, he had notes on his phone in front of him, I think.

778
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,480
But yeah, no, no slides, he can just, you know, he's a bit of a superstar, isn't he?

779
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,640
You know, when we go to somewhere like FOSDEM, where there's, you know, 1000 or more people

780
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,640
who want to get into a room and listen to this guy talk about something that's very

781
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,720
fundamental to the platform that they're developing on or developing for.

782
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,880
Of course, they want to listen to it.

783
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,720
It's it's like our equivalent of queuing up around the corner to an Apple Store to get

784
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,880
a you know, a new iPhone, you queue up to listen to Lennox talk about what's coming

785
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,720
in a piece of software that he's developing.

786
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,040
I think it's much the same thing.

787
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,520
I had a couple of just not to derail you because I'm loving the cover.

788
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
Sure.

789
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,140
I had a couple of quick things that he did talk about because I know you didn't make

790
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,520
it in the talk, so I just wanted to call out a couple of things.

791
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,720
Console D, support for higher DPI screens on the console, systemctl cat, systemctl edit.

792
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,260
You can cat the config file of any unit so you don't have to know where the actual config

793
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:03,000
file is, but you can do systemctl cat Apache 2 and it will just cat Apache 2's config

794
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,480
file wherever it is on the file system.

795
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,000
That's something that's coming.

796
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,240
Ping gateway, automatically resolve the gateway of all interfaces and ping them.

797
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,240
Very useful for network troubleshooting and questions like, am I online?

798
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,600
The ping gateway gets resolved automatically, so you actually just type ping gateway at

799
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,760
the command line and it will ping your gateway for you to see if your network is up.

800
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,640
Here's a big one.

801
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:30,840
Network D, because networking is such a basic function of the US, Lenart believes it should

802
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,040
be part of system D, so they want to roll that in.

803
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,240
Auditing, improved application auditing, he says it was for the NSA, can log all system

804
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,000
calls made to etc password, etc to the audit log.

805
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,440
Network D adds support for multiple resolvings, DNS cache per interface.

806
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,760
Journal D remote, so a whole new remote system for the journal D. The binary logger now gets

807
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,640
remote support via HTTP.

808
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,040
Journal D has a pull and push model, pull HTTP get and request for JSON streams from

809
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,600
the journal.

810
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,760
Push model pushes via an HTTP post request to the remote journal D instance, allows for

811
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,600
simple implementations of programs like via PHP and Ruby to send data to remote journal

812
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,120
D endpoints, since it's just an HTTP post.

813
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,960
They're talking about the log here, people, that could replace this log.

814
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,680
Time sync D, the idea it's not to run NTPD on every device.

815
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,880
It's very simple, trivial, not a server, as simple as possible, NTP client built into

816
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:32,960
system D. Automatic GPT partition table discovery, even if you don't have an Etsy FS tab, which

817
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,000
is sometimes absent on stateless systems, a lot of things going into system D for stateless

818
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
systems.

819
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm giving you the highlights here.

820
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You can read more on the page.

821
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
But it'll do auto discovery of GPT, discover swap devices, and root partitions even without

822
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,480
any flags in the Etsy FS tab.

823
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,360
Also I'll tell you that the thing that's most exciting in that list for me is high DPI port

824
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
in the console.

825
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
Yeah.

826
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:01,160
You know, being able to run Linux, Lynx web browser and high DPI mode on a TTY, it's just,

827
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,480
you know, I've been wanting that for years.

828
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
Finally, right?

829
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,280
The last one that's getting some controversy in our mumble room.

830
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,200
They are discontinuing read ahead.

831
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,960
They say in the age of SSDs during boot, they don't really have it.

832
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,440
None of the system D developers even have spinning hard drives.

833
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,080
All system D developers have SSDs, so nobody really wanted to support it anymore anyways.

834
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,500
And they say the read ahead bits needed during the boot process aren't really needed with

835
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,020
SSD drives anymore.

836
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,020
So I'd agree with that.

837
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,320
What about those of us who have spinning hard drives still?

838
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
It's still so minimal.

839
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,380
Well, technically they kind of pointed out that, yeah, it didn't make enough of a difference

840
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:42,920
to bother maintaining it even, you know, despite the fact that it was, there are people that

841
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,760
are still going to not have SSDs.

842
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Yeah.

843
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,560
The main problem was is that it was read ahead only really gives you a bonus when the, whatever

844
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,320
application that is benefiting from read ahead is programmed poorly.

845
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,200
So as people went and actually fixed the applications, it became less and less important.

846
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,200
Yeah.

847
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,280
So Popi, how was the, what was the culture like?

848
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,360
Did you guys eat a lot?

849
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,800
Was there a lot of beer or a lot of eating?

850
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,360
It happens in Brussels and Brussels has a reputation for having lots of beer.

851
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,000
And in fact, the conference starts on the Friday evening, really everyone meets up at

852
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,600
a bar called Delirium and you need to get there early if you want to get a table, otherwise

853
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:25,840
it's standing room only and they have loads of different beers, many, many different types

854
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,800
of beer and it's all delicious.

855
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,120
And it's great because there's a great atmosphere in there and you get to see all the famous,

856
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,280
you know, free software luminaries who all go there for a beer.

857
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,200
And in fact, it's so busy that I had to queue to get out of the bar.

858
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
It was that busy.

859
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Oh boy.

860
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Oh boy.

861
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,680
It's, it's, it's completely rammed inside and rammed outside.

862
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,400
And there's bars at Fozdem as well.

863
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,760
So once you get to the actual venue at the university.

864
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,600
There's bars at the university?

865
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Oh yeah.

866
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Loads.

867
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,600
Oh hello, hello.

868
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Yeah.

869
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:04,160
So there's street vendors selling Belgian waffles and you know, other kinds of food

870
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,760
and then yeah, there's, there's bars all around the place so you can have a couple of beers

871
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,200
while you're, while you're watching a talk or at the end of the day, you know, relax

872
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:18,960
and digest, you know, I just wanted to mention a couple of, yeah, it's a very different culture.

873
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,760
It's one of the reasons it's part of the culture of Fozdem is, you know, it's, it's very information

874
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
dense in places.

875
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
That's great.

876
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
Equally.

877
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Yeah.

878
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
So it's a very, very social.

879
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
Yeah, I love that.

880
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
Social meetup.

881
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,040
So I just wanted to mention a couple of other things that are worth looking up if you can,

882
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,120
if you find the videos.

883
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:41,880
One of them was a talk that I, I was surprised I, I didn't think would be spun out for 25

884
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
minutes.

885
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,440
I thought, wow, it's gonna be five minutes and we're going to be out of here.

886
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,100
And it's by a guy called Daniel Stenberg and he's the author of Curl.

887
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:56,800
You may be aware of Curl, the command line tool that allows you to communicate with servers.

888
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,280
And it was really interesting because I didn't realize how widely Curl was used.

889
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,280
Oh, sure.

890
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,880
And what it could do.

891
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,880
Yeah.

892
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,420
And you know, there's millions and millions of installations.

893
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,840
Every company uses it.

894
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,480
Probably every person in the room in his, in the guy's talk had a device that had Curl

895
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
or libcurl on it.

896
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,440
That was, it was quite interesting to learn, you know, the ubiquity of something like Curl.

897
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
Right.

898
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,480
And the final one that I wanted to mention was a guy called Ryan McDonald who gave a

899
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,680
talk called Living on Mars, a beginner's guide.

900
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,520
And it was the closing keynote and the room was rammed with over a thousand people, I

901
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
would say.

902
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,440
And it was all about how he's applied for a position on the Mars One mission to go on

903
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,200
one way trip to Mars.

904
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,960
And he talked all about the plan and the preparation and some of the pitfalls, but also how they're

905
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,240
using open source in the whole project.

906
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,240
Cool.

907
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,580
It was brilliant.

908
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:53,360
It was, if any video you should look up, look up that one.

909
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:58,360
It's very, it's very positive, very forward looking, actually made me think that mankind

910
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,160
isn't completely living on Mars.

911
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,080
I will have it linked in the show notes.

912
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,080
I just found it.

913
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,160
Good one, Poby.

914
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,200
So that was that, was that your favorite keynote?

915
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,160
Yeah, that was one of them.

916
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,000
I mean, they were all brilliant and I've got so much to think about and I took loads of

917
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,440
notes and I learned lots as well.

918
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,240
So and I, I took on board lots of information from other communities as well.

919
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,720
So it wasn't just sat in the Ubuntu room all the time.

920
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,160
I learned a lot from Tizen, from Yola, from Mozilla and from lots of other projects as

921
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,160
well.

922
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,080
So it was, it was totally worthwhile and I'd highly recommend anyone goes.

923
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,160
If that was on the West Coast, would you travel the distance to go to it on the West Coast

924
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,920
here in the United States?

925
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,920
If someone else paid?

926
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,920
Yes.

927
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,920
Okay.

928
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
Somebody else paid.

929
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,480
That's always the trick, isn't it?

930
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,480
Yep.

931
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Well, that's, I really want to go.

932
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,160
And so they do a course every year.

933
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,160
Yeah.

934
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,680
But it's in the beginning of February, it gets announced kind of mid, midway through

935
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,440
the year, like August time or something like that.

936
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,960
And everyone starts booking their hotels or their train or their, their plane journey

937
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,080
pretty early on.

938
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:07,920
All the public transport in, it's funny, you're going to stand at a bus stop in, in Brussels

939
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,520
and it's just nerds everywhere.

940
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,320
And it's quite amusing when they get on the bus, they're all trying to figure out how

941
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,200
to use the ticket machine and you can spot the newbies who are getting on the bus at

942
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,200
the wrong end.

943
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,200
That kind of stuff.

944
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,200
That would be me.

945
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,200
That would be me.

946
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Hilarious.

947
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
Yeah.

948
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
Yeah.

949
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
It was me as well.

950
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
Well, good.

951
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,440
I, geez, I, uh, I hope that more of the videos come out.

952
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,360
I, I, when I looked around on YouTube this morning, I saw a, uh, a lot of, uh, from 2014.

953
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,720
I haven't seen a lot from 2015, but I did see a couple.

954
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
Right.

955
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,600
Well, I mean, as Alan said, there's so many tracks, so much video content they've got

956
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
to get online.

957
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,640
I would think they're, you know, just about now, a couple of days later, having a hangover

958
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,600
recovery and, uh, they'll start getting them online soon.

959
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,640
Uh, so before we, uh, totally move off, uh, just one quick SystemD thing, uh, there's

960
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:56,260
also a blog up, uh, on how, uh, Plasma Desktop will use SystemD and in short, they're going

961
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:02,120
to rely on Lognd for a lot of things, uh, and including, uh, device management, uh,

962
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,280
and the inhibitor locks that Lognd offers where, uh, devices can get root, uh, something

963
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,280
like the login manager can get root access to the keyboard and mouse without making it

964
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,280
available to other applications.

965
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:16,160
Uh, they'll probably take advantage of time, date, D, uh, and other things, so user units,

966
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,400
so quite a bit of things coming, uh, in down the road for KDE relying on SystemD, too,

967
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
so 2015.

968
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah, and they, the KDE stand was, um, was quite busy.

969
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,720
There's a bunch of stands, obviously, exhibition area, and, uh, they had a few, uh, PCs out

970
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:34,080
with, um, the latest version of Kubuntu with Plasma on it, and I had a little play with

971
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,080
that.

972
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,080
Nice.

973
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,240
Um, it was nice to say hello to them and all the other projects that were there.

974
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,240
It was really good.

975
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,240
Did they recognize you?

976
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,240
Uh, a couple of them did, but, you know, I keep a low profile, try and wear a funny hat

977
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,240
or something.

978
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,240
Did people recognize your voice?

979
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,240
Like, once you open up your mouth, they're like, oh, are you Popey?

980
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,240
No, I'm not, I'm not as well known as you think I am.

981
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,240
Oh, I don't know.

982
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,240
I don't know.

983
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,240
I bet.

984
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,240
I bet.

985
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,760
I was waiting for Alan to flip a table on that SystemD with KDE stuff.

986
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,960
Well, they're working on, they're working on their, uh, shim.

987
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,960
You know, they got a shim.

988
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,960
Yeah, that's true.

989
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,960
That's true.

990
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,960
Uh, all right.

991
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,280
Well, Popey, that was, uh, that was a great update.

992
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,280
Thank you very much.

993
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,320
I'm a totes jelly.

994
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,320
Totes jelly.

995
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,320
Uh, all right.

996
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,120
Well, uh, so I know something that's on the, been on the back of my mind all week.

997
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,120
I don't know.

998
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,120
It's got me especially kind of excited.

999
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,680
I'm also curious to see what producer Q5 says, thanks, uh, cause he's a big Raspberry

1000
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,680
Pi fan.

1001
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,840
The new Raspberry Pi 2 is out and we're going to talk about it here in a second, but first

1002
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,840
I got to mention my buddy's over at Ting.

1003
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,200
You know, I got a Ting device now for like two freaking years and it's unbelievable how

1004
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,200
much money I've saved.

1005
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,200
It's like $2,000.

1006
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,280
Uh, I should take that savings and buy Bitcoin right now while it's on.

1007
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,080
Isn't Bitcoin on sale right now still?

1008
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
I think there's still a Bitcoin sale going on.

1009
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,080
I think it is.

1010
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,080
Yeah.

1011
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,080
So I could take some of my Ting savings.

1012
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,080
Yeah.

1013
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,080
Buy up some of them Bitcoins.

1014
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,880
Uh, Ting is mobile that makes sense and the reason why I say that is because they're finally

1015
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,280
doing it right.

1016
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,280
There's no contract and you just pay for what you use.

1017
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,080
It's, so you pay for a $6 just to have the line.

1018
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,080
That's it.

1019
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,080
Just $6.

1020
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,080
$6.

1021
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,080
Okay.

1022
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,080
And then it's just your usage on top of that.

1023
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,080
You turn on hotspot, you just pay for the data.

1024
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,080
It's not a big deal.

1025
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,920
Uh, and they have a great dashboard so you can manage all of it.

1026
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,960
I like that a lot too because that's always been sufficient for me, but they even have

1027
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,800
no whole customer service if the dashboard won't do it.

1028
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,800
Here's what I want you to do.

1029
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,520
Go to linux.ting.com.

1030
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,280
Not only do you get to put Linux in your URL bar, which is always good for your internet

1031
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,400
history and you know it, you know you need to sanitize that by putting some tech stuff

1032
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,400
in there.

1033
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,400
linux.ting.com.

1034
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,400
Okay.

1035
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,720
That'll give you $25 off your first Ting device.

1036
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,540
Oh, you got a Ting compatible device because you checked their BYOD page.

1037
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,540
Good news, my friend.

1038
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,320
They'll give you a $25 credit that will probably pay for your first month.

1039
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,320
It did for mine.

1040
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,240
Uh, I've got three devices right now.

1041
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,200
I think my bills are on $35, $37 usually.

1042
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,200
It's great.

1043
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,200
It's great.

1044
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,720
Go to linux.ting.com and go check out their blog too.

1045
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,480
They've always got some great stuff over there.

1046
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,440
I'm, you know, as somebody who's a Ting fan for a long time now, I'm always like, is Ting

1047
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,440
feeling the heat?

1048
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,440
Well, guess what?

1049
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,360
People have been wondering that and Ting answered.

1050
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,160
So I thought we'd play a little bit of that.

1051
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:59,720
Kyle asks, is it easy being Ting and do you feel heat from the other carriers for being

1052
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,720
different?

1053
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,960
Well, I think there's two things there.

1054
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,000
One, it is incredibly easy being Ting.

1055
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,480
You know, I think what would, what we can't imagine is how hard it would be to be one

1056
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,840
of the big traditional telecoms.

1057
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,680
For us, all we're trying to do is save people money and make them happy.

1058
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,280
That is really, really easy to do.

1059
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,040
Sort of trying to trick them, fool them, not provide great value.

1060
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,040
That would be hard.

1061
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,440
And the good news is we're still well small enough that they don't notice us at all.

1062
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,560
I think that we certainly do get noticed for some of our innovation, but we're not threatening

1063
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,560
anybody yet.

1064
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:49,040
We have to get many times bigger before that's true.

1065
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,680
Go to linux.ting.com, it's linux.ting.com.

1066
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,920
That's actually the lyrics to that song, Matt.

1067
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,920
Did you know that?

1068
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,920
I thought it was.

1069
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,840
I mean, the jingle just gets stuck in your head and I'm humming it all day long.

1070
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,840
Linux.ting.com.

1071
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,840
Exactly.

1072
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,280
Thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

1073
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,280
Guys, go check them out.

1074
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,160
I'm really happy for a long time and they're adding GSM support soon, which is going to

1075
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,560
be making them like the mega carrier.

1076
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,560
That is so exciting.

1077
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,800
It's going to be interesting to see who basically says, oh, hey, wait a minute.

1078
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,800
I got one of those phones.

1079
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,800
Yeah.

1080
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,800
I ran it through the compatibility thing.

1081
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,800
That's right.

1082
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,800
Hey, this could work.

1083
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,800
Hey, yeah.

1084
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,880
In fact, they're also giving out some, which, oh God, this is the phone I want so bad.

1085
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,240
The Moto X2.

1086
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,080
It's the new Motorola X with the five inch screen.

1087
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,280
They're giving out some of those for people who sign up for the Ting GSM beta.

1088
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,600
You can find out more on their blog.

1089
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,600
Ooh.

1090
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,600
Ooh.

1091
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,600
They're feeling so bad.

1092
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,600
No kidding, right?

1093
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,600
Hey, Matt, did you see that there's a new Raspberry Pi?

1094
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,560
Oh man, I see it.

1095
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,560
I've been living it.

1096
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,680
I've been like trying to come up with use case scenarios on why I should just buy it.

1097
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,680
Well, here's what we know.

1098
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,680
Okay.

1099
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,680
So it's still going to be the same $35.

1100
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,980
It's still the same about shape and size as the Raspberry Pi.

1101
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:58,260
It's got a quad core 900 megahertz ARM A7 CPU.

1102
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,160
They say about six times the performance.

1103
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,320
I've heard speculation otherwise.

1104
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,520
One gigabyte of memory.

1105
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,180
It's a 2X improvement over the previous model.

1106
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:11,600
And it is totes compatible with the Raspberry Pi 1 as far as the GPIO pin layout goes.

1107
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,240
And because you got yourself an ARM 7 process in there, you're going to get yourself a lot

1108
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,080
more serious things like Ubuntu snappy core, more different versions of Android.

1109
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,800
And ladies and gentlemen, wait for it.

1110
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,840
You guessed it.

1111
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,840
That's right.

1112
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,840
Windows 10.

1113
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,840
And proprietary software is not ethical.

1114
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,840
Yeah.

1115
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,840
It's going to be able to run Windows 10.

1116
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,840
Ooh.

1117
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,840
That's going to sting a little bit.

1118
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,840
Yeah.

1119
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,840
A little bit.

1120
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,840
But you know.

1121
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,840
And then I think people will be like, oh, this is horrible.

1122
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,840
Look at this UI.

1123
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,960
I get my, I get my Raspberry.

1124
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,960
It's too much.

1125
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,220
They got too much going on and they released the B plus not that long ago and now they

1126
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,220
have this one.

1127
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,220
I don't, I mean, whatever.

1128
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,220
But.

1129
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,400
Well, it'll be Windows 10 chump edition, obviously.

1130
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,200
I mean, that's probably what it's going to be on there.

1131
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,200
So.

1132
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,200
Bentley, I'll open the floor to you, sir.

1133
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,200
Yeah.

1134
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,800
I, like I said on Coder Radio, I don't like it.

1135
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,880
I think the having Windows on it was awfully not good for open source and it seems like

1136
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:05,960
the first step in Microsoft's whole, um, the three years I'm not remembering off the top

1137
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,960
of my head.

1138
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,960
Embrace.

1139
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,960
Extend.

1140
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,960
Extinguish.

1141
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:10,960
Yeah, exactly.

1142
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,960
Uh, yeah.

1143
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,960
I guess so.

1144
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,960
I don't think so.

1145
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,960
I think it's actually going to make Microsoft look like a chump.

1146
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,440
I think it's going to be a clown show.

1147
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,980
They're going to show up late to the party.

1148
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,600
They don't even have shipping code right now.

1149
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,600
Right?

1150
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,600
Linux has already had shipping code for years.

1151
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,600
They have a totally mature ecosystem around it.

1152
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,280
Uh, Windows is going to come to the party.

1153
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,660
Is it even going to have a GUI?

1154
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,040
Do we even know if it'll have a GUI or is it just going to be a command line version

1155
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,040
of Windows?

1156
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,040
What's it going to run?

1157
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,400
What apps is it going to run?

1158
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,880
Who's going to make apps for Windows on an, on one arm device?

1159
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,000
Now it's not going to be one arm device for long, but let's be serious.

1160
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,820
It's like Raspberry Pi is running Linux or production ready to be like the glue that

1161
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,260
holds the internet of things together or like this weird web server that runs your coffee

1162
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,400
machine or like this thing that's your XBMC media entertainment system.

1163
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,280
We've been there for a while now, right?

1164
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,880
Windows 10 showing up way late.

1165
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,880
It's like everything Microsoft does.

1166
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,040
They're just way late these days and it's, it's going to, you know, a few people will

1167
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,040
use it.

1168
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,160
It'll probably show up at few high schools for, you know, a few high school teachers

1169
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,460
will use it and you know, students will, it's fine.

1170
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,460
It's fine.

1171
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:05,760
But it's not, it's not serious.

1172
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,760
I'm not worried about it at all.

1173
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,240
I think it's going to be a joke.

1174
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,880
I do like the irony of the fact that you're pointing out, Hey, Hey, has it even got a

1175
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,880
GUI?

1176
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,120
Isn't it just a command line version?

1177
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,120
Which is exactly what they used to say to us.

1178
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:22,440
Well, here's why I bring that up because there is an expectation with windows, right?

1179
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,440
With Linux.

1180
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,720
That's maybe the advantage on a raspberry PI is no GUI, but with windows, like you tell

1181
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,560
me I can run windows 10 on it while I'm starting to get a picture of the modern UI and my start

1182
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,560
menu.

1183
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,440
Like I'm starting to visualize or windows.

1184
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,440
Yeah.

1185
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,120
But people are using the raspberry PI for the wrong thing.

1186
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,200
They're using it as a cheap computer, cheap desktop computer, and that's just not what

1187
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,800
the raspberry PI was about.

1188
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,560
It was about teaching people how to program, teaching people how to code.

1189
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:50,520
It's not about running a desktop operating system and browsing Facebook on a cheap computer.

1190
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,520
Yeah.

1191
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,960
No, I guess that's what a stream PCs and Chromebooks are for.

1192
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,640
Mr. Q5 Sys, you're a resident raspberry PI fan.

1193
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,520
What are your thoughts on the new fancy raspberry PI?

1194
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,120
For me, it's too little too late.

1195
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,520
As I mentioned in Coder Radio, I don't see why anyone would go out and buy this if they're

1196
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:14,120
actually looking for a decent system other than if you're just already a raspberry PI

1197
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,880
fan.

1198
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,340
The raspberry PI 2 specs are actually less than what you can get if you get the Odroid

1199
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,720
C1 and they're the exact same price.

1200
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,080
They're actually even the same form factor.

1201
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,240
You can use the same cases and accessories between them.

1202
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:32,480
The raspberry PI 2 does come with the quad core 900 megahertz chip, which people have

1203
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,240
claimed will reach 1.1 with a mild overclock.

1204
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:43,600
Whereas the Odroid C1, it comes at 1.5 gigahertz, still a quad core, but it's been overclocked

1205
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,920
to 1.7.

1206
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,000
For me, the biggest drawback on the RPI 2, the raspberry PI 2, is that it's still a hundred

1207
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
megabit networking.

1208
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,160
The Odroid C1 has gigabit.

1209
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,800
Now it's not a full absolute hundred percent gigabit.

1210
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:05,880
I actually reached out to Jason, the lead developer with the Arch Linux ARM port and

1211
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,920
talked to him and he's talked with the hard kernel devs.

1212
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:13,480
He was trying to get me the actual throughput from them before today's show, but kind of

1213
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,760
had a communication disconnect.

1214
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:22,800
He said that in his recollection that with iperf that the Odroid C1 will do 400 megabit

1215
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,480
up and 900 down.

1216
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,480
The NIC is a big thing.

1217
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,040
It seems like the NIC is the full gigabit, it's just the processor can't handle the

1218
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,040
event stuff.

1219
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,820
There might be some optimizations you can do there, some tuning that can happen later

1220
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,640
on that might improve that.

1221
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,440
The biggest question that's been going around in raspberry PI circles itself is, why did

1222
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,540
they drop this raspberry PI 2 just a few months after they dropped the B+, because we all

1223
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:52,120
went out and just bought the B+, because it was the newest one and now, oh look, there's

1224
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:56,360
another one and this is what we wanted to buy, but they didn't give it to us.

1225
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:01,220
Here's where some good old conspiracy bacon comes in, because there's two prevailing theories.

1226
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:05,080
One is that they took a page from Apple's handbook and put out the B+, so everybody

1227
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,080
went out and bought it.

1228
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:10,520
Then when everyone realized that it had shortcomings, they then released the actual item which everybody

1229
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,600
wanted, so everybody would go out and buy it the second time.

1230
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:19,600
The second theory is that the raspberry PI 2 was actually slated for a later release,

1231
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:25,960
either later this year or early 2016, and the reason that the raspberry PI foundation

1232
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:31,240
pushed it forward was to try to actually take back any market segment that Odroid would

1233
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,120
claim with their C1 device.

1234
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,320
Hmm, I mean, I don't know-

1235
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:41,120
I imagine the B+, was probably later than intended, and then because of other things

1236
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,720
like, you know, we saw the BeagleBone and there's like a hundred of these little devices

1237
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,160
now that they decided to try to rush the-

1238
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,160
Yeah, and I mean-

1239
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,120
I don't buy it at all.

1240
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,200
The PI 2 has been under development for a while now.

1241
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:59,520
They've been working on that with Microsoft and with other partners as well for some time.

1242
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:08,200
I don't buy that there's a significant competition from the Odroid at all.

1243
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:14,240
I think Odroid is big in geek circles, but Raspberry Pi have a massive mindshare in the

1244
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,520
educational sector, which is where they target.

1245
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,520
Well and I just want to-

1246
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,520
Yeah, and I think-

1247
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,400
I want to just mention, we're not talking about $400 iPads, we're talking about $35

1248
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,400
Raspberry Pis.

1249
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,960
Yeah, and I think that is why Windows is kind of getting involved, is because they're looking

1250
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,600
at this as something that they can bundle and package for education.

1251
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:37,780
They can get a bunch of them, have a Windows version for it, and sell thousands and thousands

1252
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:43,280
of them direct to school boards, school systems as, here's something you can deploy, instead

1253
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:49,080
of going buy these units by yourself and then you go ahead and set them up and do all that.

1254
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,000
That's where I worry about Microsoft coming in, because they've got the money and resources

1255
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,960
to kind of do a complete package like that to sell them and market them in mass quantities

1256
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:02,000
and they can work with a reseller and that's a little bit harder for the Linux side.

1257
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,120
But I think when you look at the momentum where Linux is the platform that runs across

1258
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,440
all these different devices, not just Raspberry Pi, it's got the years of development ahead

1259
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,440
of Windows.

1260
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,960
Just the momentum there will keep the Raspberry Pi running Linux in the majority forever,

1261
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
I think.

1262
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:16,960
But I agree.

1263
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,840
I think there are going to be some areas that are susceptible to Windows running on the

1264
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,960
Pi because of Microsoft's ability to organize those kinds of things.

1265
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,600
Well it does seem like it's something that's old platform.

1266
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,240
The integration with their platform, there will be developers out there who are already

1267
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:38,640
.NET developers using Visual Studio on Windows and they want something which is a portable

1268
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,860
embedded system and the first place they turn is Windows.

1269
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,400
So for them it's perfect.

1270
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,080
For people like us where the first place we turn is, right, what can I find that runs

1271
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,080
Linux?

1272
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:53,640
They'll go, you'll go Odroid, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black and a whole bunch of others

1273
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,560
and we've got a lot of options.

1274
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:59,520
Raspberry Pi seems to be the only option if Windows is what you want.

1275
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,520
For now at least.

1276
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,520
I can't imagine that'll last.

1277
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:06,600
Well then there's the Intel Minnow board and a couple of others but there's not a huge

1278
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,880
selection, nowhere near as huge a selection as we have.

1279
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,960
We have a lot more choice there, which is ironic really.

1280
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,440
I think that this is just the first step since Nadea has come on board with Microsoft.

1281
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,000
They seem to be back in their habit of looking to the long term goals and not just the short

1282
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
term things.

1283
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,240
And I think that on the Raspberry Pi 2 that this is Microsoft's perhaps their first step

1284
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,600
into the ARM market.

1285
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:34,080
I fully expect them to create more trimmed down versions for some of the older Raspberry

1286
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,840
Pis and I wouldn't be surprised if they don't actually put out a version for some of the

1287
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:43,800
stronger ARM boards out there like the new NVIDIA TK1 that has the Tegra CPU and a hundred

1288
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:48,480
and ninety two CUDA cores and it's, you know, system on a chip, small board, small form

1289
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,480
factor.

1290
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,160
Could be, yeah, could well.

1291
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,720
All right Colonel Linux, you have something you wanted to add.

1292
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,640
I just wanted to get in there that every other time in history when Microsoft has tried to

1293
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,760
scale Windows down, they've always seemed to fail.

1294
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,640
Like when they try and put it into like Windows CE or Windows Mobile, those kind of things

1295
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,640
don't seem to work.

1296
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:12,540
Whereas Linux has always been, because it by nature it exists very, very small and we

1297
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,880
scale it up to meet needs and that has always seemed to work very well but when we need

1298
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,360
it to remain small, when we need it to be able to fit on a small embedded device, it's

1299
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,640
always done very, very well.

1300
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,640
Very true.

1301
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,800
It seems to be, you know, the fundamental way Windows is built.

1302
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,480
They have to tear it down to make it work whereas Linux, you build it up, you build

1303
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,480
up.

1304
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,480
Right.

1305
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:37,400
And that approach is even apparent like I definitely noticed that as a difference in

1306
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,920
philosophy when I switched from Windows administration to Linux administration full time and the

1307
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,760
security model back then on Windows was sort of open by default, secure one by one by going

1308
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,160
through a checklist of group policy settings and all these kinds of things and on Linux

1309
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,780
it was ports are closed by default and you open them up when you need them and those

1310
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:54,780
kinds of things.

1311
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:58,000
It's the same kind of philosophy only in how the whole system is built.

1312
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,840
We'll see.

1313
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,740
So I'm not too worried about it but guys, any other thoughts on the new Raspberry Pi

1314
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:06,540
or Windows running on Windows 10?

1315
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,540
Not even out here.

1316
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,160
I've ordered one so I'll let you know when it arrives in a couple of days.

1317
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,160
I want one too.

1318
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,160
I was tempted by it too.

1319
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,120
I'm just not sure what I would use it for.

1320
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:19,800
The really nice thing about the whole thing is that the VC4 driver that so much work has

1321
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,240
been pushed into is going to work on the Pi 2 because that is the one thing that when

1322
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,320
I heard the Pi 2 I thought, oh my goodness, I hope that they don't just throw all that

1323
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,680
work that someone did reverse engineering the Pi's graphics for nothing and it's going

1324
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,320
to be there.

1325
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:39,120
So it's improved graphics though but it's just the same driver?

1326
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,120
It's a free graphics driver.

1327
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:46,920
The VC4 is the reverse engineered open source graphics driver that was made for the Pi.

1328
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,200
Well, if anybody out there tries it with Windows 10 let us know how it goes, I guess.

1329
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,200
Go to jupyterbroadcasting.com.

1330
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:56,200
Hey, that would be a good spot to send in any kind of feedback for the Linux Unplugged

1331
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,200
show.

1332
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,200
Just go over there.

1333
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,200
Send it in to us.

1334
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,200
That's a good idea.

1335
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,680
I kind of want one, Matt, but maybe if I could come up with a good segment idea.

1336
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,360
I think that $55 isn't bad.

1337
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,280
It's not bad and I think honestly you want to set it in front of people that aren't geeky,

1338
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,880
that perhaps are thinking, yeah, you know, I could use a new computer but I don't have,

1339
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,840
you know, $500 to spend, if you can park it in front of someone that really gets value

1340
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,720
from it, that would be really cool to see.

1341
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,040
If it really is six times the performance, too?

1342
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,440
Well, how many cores did it?

1343
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,440
It was like...

1344
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,440
Four, yeah.

1345
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,440
Four, yeah.

1346
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,440
At 900 megahertz.

1347
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,680
Yeah, I mean, it just depends on what kind of a desktop environment you're running and

1348
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,680
how you're rocking.

1349
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,920
Yeah, yeah.

1350
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,920
And how it launches the browser.

1351
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,800
Yeah, that's how Facebook pages load, right?

1352
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,800
That's what's going to be...

1353
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,800
That's right.

1354
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,480
But I look at this and I think, you know, the Pi itself was already a pretty competent

1355
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,480
media machine.

1356
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,680
You give it something more performance, I think that could be something really interesting

1357
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:49,680
here.

1358
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:54,200
Well, and you bundle that with YouTube switch to HTML5 from Flash, thank God.

1359
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,200
Yeah.

1360
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,240
You know, it's like a little bit easier on the arm side, doesn't it?

1361
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,240
It does.

1362
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,240
Yes, it does.

1363
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,240
Interesting.

1364
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,240
Well, there you go.

1365
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,240
All right.

1366
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,320
So if you'd like to help contribute to any of our shows, there's a couple of ways you

1367
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,400
can do it and we'd love to have you help.

1368
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,680
Something I don't mention too often on this show, but as we are spinning up the How To

1369
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,880
Linux show, we'll be funding the launch of that via our Patreon.

1370
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,840
We decided initially that we're not going to do sponsorships on the new show.

1371
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,240
We've had offers too, which is super rewarding to have sponsors just sort of preemptively

1372
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,760
say, hey, we'd love to sponsor that.

1373
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,800
But what we've decided to do is be genuine to just as tight of a focus on the content

1374
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,080
as we can initially.

1375
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,000
And we have some runway because of our Patreon model.

1376
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
This is...

1377
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,760
The Jupiter Broadcasting Network is sort of multi-funded.

1378
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:38,440
We have sponsors and then we have the audience funding.

1379
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:43,760
And that gives a sort of leverage to opt not to have sponsors or be picky with the sponsors

1380
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,480
and sometimes launch shows without sponsors.

1381
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,680
And we could do that even more if we have more support.

1382
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,960
We're kind of getting to a point where we need a little more help from the community

1383
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,680
to take on some of the future expenses like How To Linux.

1384
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,760
And we may eventually, depending on how that show goes, if it really sees a lot of traction,

1385
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,740
spin that off into its own Patreon just so that way that's sort of easily distinguished

1386
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:04,740
all on its own.

1387
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:07,760
But initially, as we sort of get things going and we take that cost on, we could use your

1388
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,760
help over at patreon.com slash today.

1389
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,000
You have the Tech Talk Today video on there, but this funds all of the shows on the network

1390
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,360
and Tech Talk Today is a daily tech show that I do to sort of say thank you to the patrons.

1391
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:22,180
There's also behind the scenes videos over there, including the death of the last Hackintosh

1392
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:26,360
in the Jupiter Broadcasting Studio is available to people who support us over at patreon.com

1393
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,360
slash today.

1394
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,420
So that's one way, direct value right there.

1395
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,260
That's obviously another way you can...

1396
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,680
That's like the most direct way you can support us.

1397
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:37,520
You can also help content-wise, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1398
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:41,160
Submit links, app suggestions, comments, and votes.

1399
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:45,900
That feeds both the Linux Action Show and that feeds Linux Unplugged and in some ways

1400
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,000
it also is going to be feeding How To Linux.

1401
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,960
So that's a really important nexus point you can go that helps contribute to all of the

1402
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,720
shows, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1403
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,760
You can also join us live.

1404
01:00:54,760 --> 01:01:00,280
We do the show live Tuesdays, Pacific over at jblive.tv and you can go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

1405
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,800
slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone.

1406
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,000
I'd love to have you join us.

1407
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
We have an open mumble room.

1408
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,840
We call it our virtual lug and it's available to you to come take advantage and tell us

1409
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,280
about the things that are on your mind in the Linux ecosystem.

1410
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,860
We also do pre and post shows where it's just kind of an open mic and we chat.

1411
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:19,640
So jblive.tv, you can go in there, get the mumble room information and join us.

1412
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,660
Also hang out in the chatroom, help name the show.

1413
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,920
It's a good experience and it happens every single freaking Tuesday.

1414
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,480
We'll do episode 79 next week, Matt.

1415
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,480
Are you feeling like 80 around the horizon?

1416
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,700
I'm feeling it a little bit.

1417
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,200
It does feel like it.

1418
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,720
I have days to where I feel 80, but it'll be nice to celebrate 80 in a more positive

1419
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,720
light.

1420
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,720
Oh wait.

1421
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,720
Nope.

1422
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,720
You know what?

1423
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,720
That was a little gas.

1424
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,720
I'm sorry.

1425
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,720
I thought that was 80.

1426
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,720
That was just a little bit of gas.

1427
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,720
All right, everybody.

1428
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,720
Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1429
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,720
Go over to the contact page, send us in your feedback.

1430
01:01:46,720 --> 01:02:05,320
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1431
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:23,040
Okay, chatroom, it's your last chance.

1432
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,040
Go bang suggest.

1433
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:27,360
Get your title suggestions in there while you still can.

1434
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,960
We'll go boat here in a minute.

1435
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,960
Go boat.

1436
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:31,960
Go boat, everybody.

1437
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,880
Hey, I saw a really cool video.

1438
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:38,600
It doesn't work so well in audio, but Popey, I don't know if you're, are you still here?

1439
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,600
Yep.

1440
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,920
So I saw this great video that makes me want an Ubuntu tablet real bad.

1441
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,920
Hang on.

1442
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,880
I'm just, I'm not actually watching the livestream, so that's okay.

1443
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:48,880
It's all right.

1444
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,240
It's a, so, uh, pop pop you sore in or whatever, pop you sore in whatever his name is.

1445
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,240
Oh yes.

1446
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,240
Yeah.

1447
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,240
Uh, he made a video.

1448
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,240
Uh, let's see.

1449
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,200
When did he post this on the video?

1450
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,200
Yeah.

1451
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,200
Yesterday.

1452
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,200
Yeah.

1453
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,200
This is really great.

1454
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,200
So watch those of you watching the video version.

1455
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,200
It's it will be linked in the, if you're on the audio, but he sort of fades in.

1456
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,040
He realizes running on the desktop and then he expands the app out and I'll just kind

1457
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,040
of re expands.

1458
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,040
I like it.

1459
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,040
It's nice.

1460
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,760
It's still a little touchy, but it's a nicely edited video.

1461
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,760
Actually.

1462
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,560
It gets me fired up states of the app.

1463
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,560
Yeah.

1464
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:20,560
That's good.

1465
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,440
That's exactly the kind of advocacy you need because people, you know, they can wrap their

1466
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,440
brains around it.

1467
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,440
It looks really good.

1468
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,800
There's basically two guys who wrote that app, but that music app, Andrew and Victor

1469
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,680
wrote that with some designs from the design team.

1470
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,000
It's I just love what they're doing.

1471
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Yeah.

1472
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
That is really good.

1473
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,160
So I will, uh, I'll have a link to that in the post-show show notes.

1474
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,160
If people want to watch that and I'll drop in the chat right now.

1475
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,160
All right.

1476
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,160
Okay.

1477
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,160
JBtitles.com.

1478
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,160
We got a vote on this thing.

1479
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:55,160
Chris, that bitwig demo is a 145 megabyte depth file for Ubuntu, just so you know.

1480
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,160
I'm sorry.

1481
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,160
Did I laugh out loud?

1482
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,160
My bad.

1483
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,160
No, I'm sure it's an upstream.

1484
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,160
Probably arch it up.

1485
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,160
Pretty easy.

1486
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,160
Oh yeah.

1487
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,480
Uh, okay.

1488
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,480
So pie to win.

1489
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,480
That's not too bad.

1490
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,480
FOSDM nerd herds.

1491
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,640
That's not bad.

1492
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,640
Straight out of FOSDM.

1493
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,640
Oh, I kind of like that.

1494
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,640
Yeah.

1495
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,640
I got to get a beat going.

1496
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,640
I kind of like that.

1497
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,640
That's kind of straight out of FOSDM.

1498
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:14,640
A little bit of NWA going on there.

1499
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,640
Yeah.

1500
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,640
Yeah.

1501
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,640
I could see that.

1502
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,640
All right.

1503
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,640
Go over the titles.

1504
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:20,640
Go vote, everybody.

1505
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,640
We got to get you a grill.

1506
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,640
Got to get you a grill.

1507
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,640
There we go.

1508
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,640
Mm-hmm.

1509
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,640
Yeah.

1510
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,640
It's going up to the top of the charts right there.

1511
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,640
There it is.

1512
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,640
Very nice.

1513
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,640
Very nice.

1514
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,640
All right, guys.

1515
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,200
Well, I think we're going to go with that.

1516
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,080
Boy, that was one of our easier titles.

1517
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,240
That was really easy, actually.

1518
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,240
Something I didn't mention there.

1519
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,760
Have you ever seen a key signing party?

1520
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1521
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,480
They do those there?

1522
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,840
Yeah, that was a massive key signing party.

1523
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,000
It was going for like two hours.

1524
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,480
I went into a talk and came out and the people were still there.

1525
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,480
They're standing in a line.

1526
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,480
Yeah.

1527
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,480
Right.

1528
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:57,000
So imagine like two lines of people facing each other, like some kind of weird country

1529
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,840
dancing thing, right, where they're facing each other and they've all got these little

1530
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:05,240
notepads and they've all got their government issued ID and they've all got their like printouts

1531
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,840
of their keys and stuff.

1532
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:12,280
And when they've done, when they've done someone, they just moved down the line to the next

1533
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,280
one.

1534
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,240
And they were just there for ages and ages, all these people signing each other's keys.

1535
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,240
It was amazing.

1536
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,240
Yeah, that's a good way to do it.

1537
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,560
I wonder if Keybase.io would help with that.

1538
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,560
Yeah, maybe.

1539
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,560
All right.

1540
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,560
Well, I guess it's time to put my pants back on.

1541
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:25,560
Yeah, that'd be a good time.

1542
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,560
Yeah.

1543
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:27,560
All right, guys.

1544
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,560
Thanks very much.

1545
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,560
Good show.

1546
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,560
Cheers, Chris.

1547
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:42,640
See you next week.
