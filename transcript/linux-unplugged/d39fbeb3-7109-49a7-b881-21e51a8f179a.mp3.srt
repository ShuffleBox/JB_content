1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Utopian.io, I'll go look for it, yep.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,240
Yeah, okay.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,720
And they basically take open source projects, okay,

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,280
and they induct them into the Steemit blockchain

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,200
or Steemit blockchain and build up a community around them.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,200
And people who actively contribute back to the project

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,560
can get rewards back in cryptocurrency.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,000
So it doesn't have to be code necessarily,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
it could be things like translations or manuals

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,520
or graphics or anything else.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,000
And it builds this idea around the open source project

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,400
if you're making money direct

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,440
from people who are contributing to it.

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,840
It's a very interesting point.

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,080
And your comparison there would be something

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,820
maybe for content creators too.

17
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,820
Well, no, I mean, the point is that Steam also has Dtube,

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,040
which is decentralized tube, and DLive.

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,640
And they basically work in the same way.

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,000
So you put content out in Dtube

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,720
and you're earning money in cryptocurrency

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,080
by people upvoting your videos.

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,280
So the bottom line is, okay, right,

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,840
the popular ones get upvoted

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,620
and you earn money from being popular.

26
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,760
So you put out good content, you make money.

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,080
Hmm, hmm, that also could,

28
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,820
I can't, how does that not turn into Clickbait 2.0 though?

29
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,760
Yeah. Ooh.

30
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,600
This is the cool thing about it.

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,760
Okay, so the whole idea about upvoting people

32
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,760
for good content is that it's community-managed

33
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,120
about the weighting of the content.

34
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,200
So you have to have so many people, okay, right,

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,040
of sufficient steam power to be able to upvote your content

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,360
to say it's legitimate content.

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,320
So you earn the steam power

38
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,320
by being a good person to the community.

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,480
More steam power you have, the more your vout counts.

40
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,360
Interesting, ha, ha, ha, ha.

41
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,440
That's particularly interesting.

42
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,360
That's a really interesting take on that.

43
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,320
The problem with Dtube is it just sucks

44
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,720
at delivering video, that's the problem.

45
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,520
I get to see a single video actually play.

46
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,960
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 245.

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,080
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

48
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,720
that's running the numbers, looking at the distros,

49
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,120
and watching all of the projects.

50
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,960
My name is Chris.

51
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,120
My name is Wuz.

52
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,720
Hello, Mr. Payne, it's good to be with you again

53
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,240
on episode 245.

54
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,960
Coming up in this week's episode,

55
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,640
we're gonna do all of our traditional community news,

56
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,800
as well as some new project releases, some app picks,

57
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,760
and some development sprints.

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,400
But then, towards the end of the show,

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,120
we're gonna talk about Microsoft's new Linux powered devices

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,440
that will be coming to the market soon.

61
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,960
It's all of the news this week,

62
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,960
and it's part of Azure Sphere,

63
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,520
which is an overall, large, three-stage,

64
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,720
three-component effort that Microsoft's putting on

65
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,960
that may just wind up dominating IoT.

66
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,040
And we'll tell you how Linux is playing a role,

67
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,280
what component of this is Linux-based,

68
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,040
and what you can expect in the pretty near future.

69
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,720
Wes and I got on a phone call

70
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,440
with one of the core creators and developers from Microsoft.

71
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,640
They took the time to get the team on the phone with us

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,080
before the show, and we asked them all of the hard questions.

73
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,280
We got the specifics about what they're running

74
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,560
on these devices, and we'll share what we learned with you

75
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,960
later on in the show, straight from the horse's mouth.

76
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,680
We couldn't have gotten better people

77
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,880
to describe the tech to us.

78
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,800
It was really pretty awesome.

79
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,400
But before we get all of that,

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,880
there's like news, community stuff,

81
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,120
and a mumble room to bring in.

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,960
So let's do all of that right now.

83
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,360
Time-appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,200
Hey.

85
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,040
Hey.

86
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,640
Wow, that kind of made me hungry, actually.

87
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,600
Now I have a bit of an appetite.

88
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,080
Well, guys, we have much to cover today,

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,360
and I don't really know where to start

90
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,600
other than maybe with Linus.

91
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,000
That just seems like the appropriate place right now.

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,480
Linus Torvalds on the Linux kernel mailing list

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,520
announced plans that you should not be excited about

94
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,360
and mean absolutely nothing,

95
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,960
so would you please stop talking about it?

96
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,800
Except for Linus keeps talking about it.

97
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,280
So he says, the next release doesn't really seem

98
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,760
to be shaping up to be any particularly big release,

99
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,960
and there is nothing particularly special about it either.

100
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,360
The most special thing that happened

101
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,800
is just sort of a numerology thing.

102
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,880
The Linux kernel has passed the six million

103
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,200
Git object mark, and this, he says,

104
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,080
is reason enough to call the next kernel version 5.0.

105
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,400
This version is completely meaningless.

106
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,760
It should mean that it's just silly

107
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,400
and that maybe I won't even switch to it

108
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,440
because even numerological rules would be a silly reason,

109
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,640
so I may not do it, and it may just surprise you,

110
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,240
but 5.0 will happen someday,

111
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,920
and it will be and should be meaningless.

112
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,960
You have been warned.

113
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,800
I like it.

114
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,640
I can't wait.

115
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,480
Yeah, right?

116
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,320
I can't wait for it.

117
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,160
I have no reason to be excited.

118
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,880
I am really looking forward to Linux kernel 5.0

119
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,160
for no reason at all.

120
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,000
I thought, okay, all right.

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Thank you, Linus, thank you.

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,280
So that's how we start the show out today,

123
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,920
but let's talk about something

124
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,000
that's a little bit higher up in the kernel stack,

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,600
and that's the user interface,

126
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,480
and Mr. Martin Wimpress tooling away like a soldier

127
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,720
at Ubuntu MATE's high DPI support,

128
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,880
and it was almost a year ago that Wimpy came on here

129
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,520
and told us about the first steps

130
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,800
of bringing high DPI support to Ubuntu MATE.

131
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,980
In fact, I'm looking at the post right here

132
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,840
from April 2017, where it's a screenshot

133
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,800
that Wimpy took on his XPS 15 4K screen,

134
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,080
and with a few dirty hacks, with Ubuntu 17.04 as a base,

135
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,720
we had a high DPI.

136
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,220
So fast forward now about a year,

137
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,080
where are we at with all of this, Wimpy?

138
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,240
We're all done.

139
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,000
It's all high DPI to the max in all the right places.

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
So I think I last spoke to you about this

141
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,860
maybe five or six weeks ago,

142
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,320
and I said I wouldn't talk about it again,

143
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,760
but I'm lying because I'm going to talk to you about it now.

144
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,720
So what's changed since then is we had a few bits

145
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,760
that weren't implemented.

146
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,320
So one of the big changes is now that Marco,

147
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,400
which is the window manager for the MATE desktop,

148
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,040
that now all of its window controls and everything,

149
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,780
all of those scale and work correctly.

150
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,880
So where before, when high DPI was enabled,

151
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,400
we were standing up compers underneath

152
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,360
in order to fill that gap,

153
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,040
we don't need to do that anymore.

154
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,880
Wow.

155
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,120
So the behavior is just like what you used to have.

156
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,120
You can either choose to run Marco or compers,

157
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,320
and it's not constrained

158
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,720
by whether you're using high DPI or not.

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,960
So that's one of the big changes.

160
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,720
And then Kaja, the file manager,

161
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,280
has now had the full high DPI treatment.

162
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,120
Ah.

163
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,600
And in terms of user facing changes

164
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,580
that are going to be obvious there,

165
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,780
that's really sort of,

166
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,420
we've made sure that the icons are all using vector icons

167
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,260
and what have you.

168
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,560
So it all looks a bit crisper.

169
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,720
Very good. And nicer.

170
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,920
So, yeah.

171
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,160
And there's been a few tweaks and touches

172
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,880
all the way through to just improve things.

173
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,420
So there's some improvements

174
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,960
to the way that font DPI scaling works.

175
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,800
So it gives you the ability

176
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,580
to sort of do pseudo fractional scaling

177
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,440
by having a scale desktop

178
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,520
and then manipulating the font DPI.

179
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,720
So yeah, it's all looking really good now.

180
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,280
And all those patches have landed in 1804

181
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,440
as of about a week ago,

182
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,400
all being tested, looking in good shape.

183
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,520
So our high DPI journey's finished.

184
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,400
And interestingly, you said it was a year ago,

185
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
we had that first discussion

186
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,640
about here's a rather shonky setup.

187
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,720
But the actual journey started a year before that,

188
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,640
just after 1604 closed.

189
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,160
We embarked on our journey towards GTK3.

190
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,440
So this has been two years in the making.

191
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,280
Wow. Yeah, good point.

192
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,320
And congratulations.

193
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,140
Let me start there.

194
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,460
Let me just say congratulations.

195
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,680
And then also work well done.

196
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,760
Really nice to see this.

197
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,680
We were just talking on the pre-show

198
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,580
about how there's just a few systems right now.

199
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,760
I can't really decide like if my next rig

200
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,840
is gonna be high DPI.

201
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,340
And so I'm really happy to see this getting pushed forward

202
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,800
by more and more desktops.

203
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,940
Yeah, I think the state of high DPI in general

204
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,880
is in a good place for Linux now as well.

205
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,400
Yeah, I can remember some,

206
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,440
I think when you got your XPS,

207
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,480
I think that was the third gen.

208
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,760
So that was about two and a half, three years ago,

209
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,400
I think you got that laptop.

210
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,240
Correct.

211
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,060
And, you know, you were saying,

212
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,280
well, you know, these applications don't scale.

213
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,320
And I think Firefox and Chrome both didn't scale

214
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,160
at that time.

215
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,980
Yeah.

216
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,360
You know, these days, and it's not just, you know,

217
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,480
it's nice, obviously that the desktop

218
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,920
that I am involved in now has high DPI scaling.

219
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,760
But when I install lots of other applications,

220
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,320
I see just about everything scaling.

221
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,920
Now, you know, the one obvious standout

222
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,700
that doesn't scale is GIMP,

223
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,160
which is disappointing and they're getting there.

224
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,160
They've got some cheeky workarounds in GIMP 2.10,

225
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,040
which is still based on GTK2,

226
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,760
but they do some magic to use larger icons

227
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,720
and bump up the font scaling

228
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,840
to sort of fill the gap in the meantime.

229
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,720
But other than that,

230
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,040
there isn't a whole lot that I run and think,

231
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,360
oh, this isn't high DPI scaled.

232
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,420
It has gotten better.

233
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,000
It could be, the story could be a bit better still

234
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,520
on the plasma side of things.

235
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,840
There's still three or so places you have to go

236
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,760
to really get it all working.

237
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,400
But Cheese Bacon asks an interesting question,

238
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,720
and I don't know if you have the rough idea,

239
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,400
but just from like a raw numbers standpoint,

240
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,160
do you have any idea of roughly how many assets

241
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,140
had to be touched to get to a high DPI version

242
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,800
or had to be replaced, like icons and things like that?

243
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,640
Oh, crikey.

244
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,200
Thousands, thousands, every icon.

245
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,920
Those were retouched by Daniel Foray.

246
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,920
He did an icon rework for us in 1704.

247
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,720
Michael Tunnell did all of the small assets

248
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,600
to provide scaled versions and recolored them.

249
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,000
So that's everything from like the check boxes

250
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and the outlines around the buttons,

251
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,880
cause all the buttons are styled and themes.

252
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,040
So, and then all of the CSS at the backend

253
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,820
for the GTK3 stuff, whole chunks of that had to be adapted

254
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,600
so it knew how to apply styling

255
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,560
when it was in a scaled mode.

256
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,000
So, you know, when I say it took two years to get there,

257
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,440
just building on top of GTK3 is only one of those steps

258
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,600
and, you know, reworking all of the themes

259
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,800
to understand how all of these assets scale

260
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,420
and are provided, you know, that was a whole chunk of work

261
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,840
and there were numerous themers and digital artists

262
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,360
involved in that endeavor.

263
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,080
So yeah, thousands and thousands of assets

264
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,600
have been touched along the way.

265
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,160
Wow, well, I'm glad you guys are doing the hard work there.

266
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,040
So that'll be all good to go in 1804.

267
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,520
So when I get the final 1804, I'll have that.

268
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,640
Yeah, I think there's one teeny tiny thing

269
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,640
we're gonna fix post-release regarding high DPI,

270
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,760
but it's so insignificant I'm not gonna mention it

271
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,960
and nobody will notice it.

272
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,440
Okay then, don't pay any attention over here.

273
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,280
Well, thanks for the update.

274
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,720
Yeah, it's misdirection.

275
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,680
Yeah, we're good.

276
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,000
You know, while we're on the Ubuntu vein here,

277
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,800
Eric, I know I saw news about a week ago, I think,

278
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,280
about the Ubuntu studio project rebasing

279
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,520
or making big changes.

280
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,640
Can you fill us in on that?

281
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,360
Yes, so we've got some great things going on.

282
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,080
First of all, we established a council

283
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,840
so that we can take some load off of the project later,

284
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,240
which is really a good thing.

285
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,400
But what we're doing is we are trying to do something

286
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,200
such as replace our metapackage installer

287
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,640
with something like the Ubuntu MATE welcome,

288
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,800
which I guess has also been forked to Budgie.

289
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,640
Cool.

290
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,640
And so we're going to be including that

291
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,080
to let people tailor the experience the way they want.

292
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,840
And we're also considering perhaps

293
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,820
a change of default desktop environment

294
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,960
and perhaps add additional desktop environments as options.

295
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,600
So there's a number of things we're kind of brainstorming

296
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,640
and working on.

297
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,560
We definitely want to get Ubuntu Studio out of the stagnation

298
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,520
it's been in for about the past two years.

299
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,920
Well, I look forward to seeing how that goes,

300
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,320
because I've used it on and off.

301
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,640
It's a pretty solid distro for people that maybe want

302
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,400
to get into podcasting, as an example, or something like that.

303
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,240
It's pretty great.

304
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,960
So Ubuntu Studio will have some change.

305
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,160
When do those start landing?

306
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,520
So it sounds like the council stuff is already in place,

307
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,200
but other changes, is that a release or two away?

308
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,240
We're aiming for 18.10 for the first of the big changes.

309
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,480
But 18.04 is really just going to be iterative.

310
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,680
And the only thing about 18.04 is for us,

311
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,120
it will not be an LTS just due to load manpower.

312
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,800
OK.

313
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Yeah, I think I remembered hearing that.

314
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,560
Well, great.

315
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,000
Thank you guys for the updates.

316
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,680
And definitely keep up the good work

317
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,120
and keep us posted on how that goes.

318
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,760
I love watching them projects.

319
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,360
And it's always cool to see that kind of stuff.

320
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,240
It's just so darn great.

321
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,320
You know what else is great?

322
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,840
Ting.

323
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,240
Linux.ting.com.

324
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,760
It's smarter than unlimited, because if you use less,

325
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,400
you pay less.

326
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,240
It's just a base $6 for your line,

327
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
and then your usage on top of that for your minutes,

328
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,720
your messages, and your megabytes.

329
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,440
That's it.

330
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,280
So if you only get a dozen text messages a month,

331
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,920
you don't need to pay for 500 text messages.

332
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,480
If you can download podcasts and listen to music via Wi-Fi

333
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,080
and cache it locally, you probably

334
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,600
don't need 12, 15 gigs of data.

335
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,120
So just pay for what you use.

336
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,560
And if you want multiple devices, like a Mi-Fi

337
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,960
or a cell phone, or if you want a backup phone,

338
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,880
it's great for that.

339
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,640
Because at $6 a month, you can afford

340
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,280
to be really, really flexible.

341
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,600
And they combine that with a great control panel,

342
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,240
fantastic customer service, and ton of devices

343
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,120
that are ready to go.

344
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,920
And maybe the most important thing about Ting

345
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,120
that I don't talk a lot about, because it's just obvious

346
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,600
to me now, is they don't have a strategy to get into media.

347
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,800
They don't have a streaming service.

348
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,640
They don't have a Ting app store.

349
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,280
They don't have a branded experience with partners

350
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,280
that they want to push down to my phone.

351
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,560
They don't do any of that.

352
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,080
They don't care how you use the service.

353
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,680
They just want you to have service.

354
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,720
And you can pick from CDMA or GSM.

355
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,600
And they don't have some sort of Ting ROM

356
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,680
that you'll have to install.

357
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,360
So they don't get in the way of updates.

358
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,160
If you've got a phone that gets frequent updates,

359
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,520
like the Pixels, and the Nexi, and the Motos,

360
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,680
they don't get in the way of that.

361
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,440
You get the updates as soon as the vendor releases them.

362
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,600
That's, by far, one of my favorite things about Ting.

363
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,560
And embarrassingly uncommon in the US

364
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,200
when you buy devices from carriers.

365
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,000
But there's so many other great things about Ting.

366
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,880
The customer service, like I mentioned, is bar none.

367
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,520
The control panel, always the best, and much, much more.

368
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,720
Start by going to linux.ting.com.

369
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,280
Take $25 off a device, or if you bring a compatible device,

370
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,800
$25 in service credit.

371
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
linux.ting.com.

372
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,440
Big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the unplugged program.

373
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,800
linux.ting.com.

374
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,840
Wes, you found this cool, cool terminal app

375
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,920
that, for once, isn't powered by Node.js,

376
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,600
but it's still super cool.

377
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,280
It's written in Go, actually.

378
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,960
And how would you ever know it's named GoTop?

379
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,160
Yeah, exactly.

380
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,480
You've got to make sure you know.

381
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,240
And it's another terminal-based graphic activity monitor.

382
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,040
And it's so epic.

383
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,320
First of all, because it's in Go, it's really simple.

384
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,200
It's a small little thing, no big deal.

385
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,920
And it has a colored end cursor,

386
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,240
it has a colored end cursor's graph,

387
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,960
and it has boxes of memory usage in your process list,

388
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,000
and it boxes everything out into individual segments.

389
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,240
It's the exact kind of thing if your boss is walking in

390
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,200
and you want to have something grayed up on your screen,

391
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,040
and you could just have this up in an SSH terminal,

392
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,960
and you just tab over to that when your boss walks in.

393
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,440
Oh, yeah, just pulling down some metrics off the old server.

394
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,800
Meanwhile, you're watching YouTube on another tab.

395
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,480
Yeah, right, probably also in a terminal,

396
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,080
but in the other team works pane.

397
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,800
Yeah, actually, you did have a pick

398
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,440
for bare minimal YouTube this week, too,

399
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,400
that almost made it in the show,

400
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,880
which could go nice with this.

401
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,360
Minimal YouTube, do you want to check?

402
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,960
Check your link, see if you have it,

403
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,280
because we should almost bust that out.

404
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,320
It has a light and dark mode,

405
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,160
and the installation is just dead simple.

406
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,600
You just get, clone it down, you run the shell script,

407
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,640
you've got it to go, and of course,

408
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,840
it's in the AUR, too, as gotop-bin.

409
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,680
Where was it?

410
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,400
Oh, yeah, yeah, so it's minimalist YouTube.

411
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,160
And if you go to tube.quinzel.tech,

412
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,880
it's Q-U, put a link in the thing.

413
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,720
Put a link in the IRC for that one.

414
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah, we'll put a link in.

415
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,720
That is like the Google search page for YouTube.

416
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,320
It's just nothing, it's just blank, it's minimal.

417
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,200
So simple. It's easy, clean, yeah.

418
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,000
It just gets you the video.

419
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,560
It's a great way to use YouTube

420
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,800
if you just want to go watch a video,

421
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,240
but you don't want all of the rest of YouTube.

422
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,520
So yeah, West will drop a linkskies

423
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,360
in the irc.geekshed.net.

424
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,080
Anyway, so this is called gotop,

425
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,600
and gotop is a super slick looking terminal

426
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,120
that we wanted to point you guys to,

427
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,320
so you have an app to download this week after the show.

428
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,080
And then a call out to a project

429
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,120
that used to make or break my day, it's Clonezilla.

430
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,800
And Clonezilla got a good update this week, version 25538.

431
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,840
And the most interesting feature

432
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,000
is a new massive deployment mechanism

433
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,280
based on BitTorrent technology.

434
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,720
So the machines that you're imaging

435
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,640
become part of the distribution network.

436
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,560
Well, that is just slick.

437
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,000
It's obvious, too, really, if you think about it.

438
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,720
Now, it does require some additional disk space

439
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,640
to do this, but I've worked on some large networks

440
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,280
where you're imaging 30, 40, 50 systems or more,

441
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
and this could be so useful.

442
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,960
It's such a neat, neat thing.

443
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,800
They're also baking in some part image support,

444
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,360
some additional part image support,

445
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,640
and the ability to change Windows 10 host names

446
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,280
when you restore an image in Clonezilla, yeah.

447
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,200
In Clonezilla, they just keep on going,

448
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,640
and it works so well.

449
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,840
I'm so appreciative, it's not something I use frequently,

450
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,680
but I am so appreciative.

451
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,880
Every time you need to, right, it's just boom.

452
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,760
And there's a live CD that has now been synced up

453
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,440
to Debbie and Sid and running Linux kernel 4.15.

454
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,760
So it's a pretty modern, pretty recent live environment

455
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,920
to run Clonezilla from, and then they're baking

456
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,040
in that BitTorrent distribution.

457
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,400
I gotta play with that sometime.

458
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't have any need for that, but I gotta play with that.

459
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,640
It just sounds so cool.

460
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:57,240
And then to round out sort of an app pick-ish section,

461
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,840
Font Finder is a GTK3 application.

462
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,960
Yes, I'm still talking about GTK applications.

463
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,280
That is a really easy, smooth front end

464
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,400
to browse Google's free font archive from the comfort

465
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,840
of your Linux desktop.

466
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,640
And it's super straightforward.

467
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,320
It's exactly what you'd expect, but at the same time,

468
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,200
it's pretty nice.

469
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,040
You can search for the font you want.

470
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,280
So say you want to go get Google's Robo font,

471
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,320
or Roboto, I think it is.

472
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,000
So you put in Robo, and then it'll

473
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,080
show you Roboto, condensed, monoslabbed,

474
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,400
all the different fonts they have.

475
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,800
And then in the client-side decoration header bar thingy,

476
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,360
it has a nice install button.

477
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,040
It'll pull that font down from Googles

478
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,120
and load it into your Linux box.

479
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,400
Bob's your uncle.

480
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,800
Robert's your father.

481
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,880
Now you've got a font.

482
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,520
I like it.

483
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,840
Simple, easy, and we'll have a link in the show notes

484
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,440
for that, because it's up on GitHub.

485
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,600
So that's Font Finder.

486
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,480
I did notice there, Chris, it was, did you pick it,

487
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,520
because it was Rust?

488
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,560
Is that why?

489
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,720
Your little favorite?

490
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,760
It actually did.

491
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,000
That was legitimately what pushed it over.

492
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,120
You know me so well.

493
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,460
That was totally it, too.

494
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,160
I was going to make a Rust joke about it,

495
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,080
but then I just got to let it go.

496
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,120
But yeah, you caught me.

497
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,160
You caught me.

498
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,120
Saree was going to join us from System76,

499
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,000
but Mumble is off-putting if you don't use it

500
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,200
on an ongoing basis.

501
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,160
So I think they had some audio troubles.

502
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,560
I might try to grab him later on in the week

503
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,520
and just have an offline chat with him about it.

504
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,720
System76 is joining the Gnome Foundation Advisory Board.

505
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,120
And I believe it's actually Saree from System76

506
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,800
that'll be doing this.

507
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,360
And I find this to be a fascinating move,

508
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,560
because while the advisory board isn't super influential

509
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,800
over what Gnome does, because at the end of the day,

510
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,680
some developer has to do the work.

511
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,720
And it's not like they have a lever they pull on,

512
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,600
and then a developer comes out the other side.

513
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,880
So it can definitely set directions and things like that.

514
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,040
But it could also, my understanding,

515
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,000
I was going to ask Saree about this,

516
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,400
is it can be sort of a sounding board

517
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,760
for organizations that are using Gnome,

518
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,480
or groups that are using Gnome for different projects.

519
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,000
That seems like a super sweet position for System76 to be in.

520
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,760
It makes sense, right?

521
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,280
To be able to get sort of a wider industry data collection

522
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,600
of how people are using Gnome,

523
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,560
when they're building Pop OS on top of Gnome,

524
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,360
it seems really, yeah.

525
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,920
You're part of the conversation in the community.

526
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,200
Yeah, so good for them,

527
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,760
System76 joining the Gnome Advisory Board.

528
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,600
Boom, how about that?

529
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,760
It's a rapid fire set of app picks and news.

530
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,280
That's what we do here on the Unplugged program.

531
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,720
We busted through that quicker than I expected,

532
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,560
even with a bonus app pick.

533
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,560
Linux right to the brain.

534
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,680
Man, man.

535
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,200
If we could just hook it up to your eyeballs,

536
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,040
it would be even better.

537
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,160
Just suck it right in through the neurons in your eyes.

538
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,720
Coming next week.

539
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,560
Yeah, we're working on that, aren't we?

540
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,080
In fact, maybe I'll mention a couple of things.

541
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,960
So there is a new mysterious operator behind the scenes.

542
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,880
I can't say more than that,

543
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,200
but I don't know if you guys remember,

544
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,720
but many, many weeks ago,

545
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,840
I announced around episode 250,

546
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,800
we'd be making some changes to the Unplugged program.

547
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,640
Yes, we did.

548
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,040
I think I might've mentioned it around 200.

549
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,400
I don't know.

550
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,760
Well, they arrived a little early.

551
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,080
And so we've been, for about a month and a half,

552
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,560
we've been every week,

553
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,200
there has been small incremental changes

554
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,120
for the better behind the scenes.

555
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,280
The poor folks on YouTube have it the worst,

556
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,920
but the folks on the podcast version have it the best.

557
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,000
So it's been a mixed bag,

558
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,720
although we are adding new features to our YouTube video.

559
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,760
We're trying a new experimental encoding

560
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
that will post the video on YouTube

561
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,640
and in the show description section,

562
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,680
include time links for the different chapters of the show.

563
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,520
Slick.

564
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,120
Yeah, that's something we're working on for a bit.

565
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
So we've been making changes for a few weeks

566
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,920
on the Linux Unplugged program.

567
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,080
And the core of it is,

568
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,640
if you haven't updated your RSS feeds,

569
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,480
it'd be a good time to go to linuxunplugged.com

570
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,240
and slash RSS is the feed directly,

571
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,360
linuxunplugged.com slash RSS.

572
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,720
Subscribe to that new feed,

573
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,560
let us know what you think,

574
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,040
and start sending in your feedback about it

575
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,240
at the slash contact.

576
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,880
So you can go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact

577
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,840
and let us know what you think.

578
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,040
Because it's been a slow edit of change

579
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,720
and we're going through another change.

580
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,040
So we'll have,

581
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,080
we've hired someone to do the editing for a bit

582
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,360
and see how that works and see what you guys think.

583
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,200
So I have been editing the show for the last few weeks.

584
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,680
I'll be pulling back a bit.

585
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,040
I'll still be involved with all that stuff,

586
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,800
but more changes are coming, but they're starting now.

587
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,760
We're sort of at the end of it all.

588
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,400
So it's a good time to kind of take stock

589
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
and see what everybody thinks.

590
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,000
And if you're on the YouTube side of things,

591
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,080
just be patient with us

592
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,360
as we sort of retool some of that workflow

593
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,160
because that stuff is a changing.

594
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,520
But it's exciting times in the Unplugged universe.

595
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,600
Times would be a changing.

596
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,440
Yeah, yeah.

597
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,720
Oh, and also speaking of times changing,

598
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,080
Tech Talk Today is back on the air twice a week,

599
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,720
technology show, Tech Talk Talk Today.

600
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,560
Yeah, yeah.

601
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,480
With me and Ange predominantly,

602
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,720
but we're going to have folks in town

603
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
for Linux Fest Northwest.

604
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,480
So I'll probably try to get folks to jump on the mic

605
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,720
and hang out with us.

606
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,120
Special guest stars.

607
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,880
Yeah, I bet that Noah Chalaya,

608
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,080
I bet I could talk that Noah Chalaya

609
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,360
and that Alan Jude.

610
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,200
There you go.

611
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,040
Getting on the mic from time to time.

612
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,800
And then of course, we'll do a live,

613
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,400
we may do a live Linux Unplugged from Linux Fest.

614
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
I don't know.

615
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,880
I think we're also going to try to do a Tech Talk.

616
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,560
So we've got a lot we're good doing,

617
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,440
but you can just stay subscribed.

618
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,800
You'll get the best stuff there at linuxunplugged.com

619
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,120
slash RSS to get the feed directly.

620
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,000
All right, so let's move into a couple of final news items

621
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,840
for the day.

622
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,560
And let's also then get into the huge item of the day.

623
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,360
The one that I think people are still processing

624
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,400
and that is that Microsoft is now shipping a Linux product

625
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,600
based on the Linux kernel,

626
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,360
which I think has caught a lot of people by surprise

627
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,200
this week.

628
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,880
So we'll talk about that as well.

629
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,000
But first we'll mention DigitalOcean.

630
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,840
Here's that.

631
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,960
Hold on Wes, let me pull out the prop paper.

632
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,280
You ready?

633
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,360
We gotta be prepared for this.

634
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,560
This is serious business.

635
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,000
dio.co slash unplugged.

636
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,440
That's where you go to get a $100 credit.

637
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,760
dio.co slash unplugged.

638
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,480
Go there, sign up with a new account

639
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,880
and get a $100 credit for 60 days.

640
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,280
You can try out their new mix and match droplet there.

641
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,240
Flexible droplet for $15 a month.

642
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,880
You choose how much CPU and disk and memory you need.

643
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,800
You mix and match the different resources.

644
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,440
They also have CPU optimized droplets

645
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,760
with massive high-end, great, just huge,

646
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,160
just massively powerful.

647
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,480
And then if you want to,

648
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,200
you can just throw in a few hundred gigs of RAM.

649
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,760
Just throw in a few hundred gigs of RAM too.

650
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,440
I don't know what you're doing,

651
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,320
but damn, it's amazing.

652
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,000
I mean, they have a whole scale.

653
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,880
But for me, for my humble needs,

654
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,600
I have my favorite sweet spot at three cents an hour.

655
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,840
Fact, the rigs that I don't have at three cents an hour,

656
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,320
they got upgrades recently from Digital Ocean.

657
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,680
And now it's like, they're more than,

658
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,080
I was like, I already have them as like,

659
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,760
at $5 a month total.

660
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,600
Like that's plenty.

661
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,080
Cause they're just doing like metric collection

662
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,640
or they're like alerts or it's one's a bot.

663
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,320
And it's like, it doesn't need a lot.

664
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,680
But Digital Ocean recently adjust all their prices

665
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,160
and retroactively just upgraded my machine.

666
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,200
So my machines just got better recently.

667
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,040
It's so great.

668
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,880
You didn't do anything.

669
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,720
They're just better.

670
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,560
I love it.

671
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,120
Do.co slash unplugged.

672
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,240
You can deploy a system at less than 55 seconds.

673
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
Everything is using SSDs.

674
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,160
They have 12 data centers all over the world.

675
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,440
20 gigabit connections, 40 gigabit connections.

676
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,280
I don't know, it's gigabits.

677
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,720
I mean, they're just gigabits for days.

678
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,400
Plus private networking on the backend.

679
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,520
Block storage, they have available as well

680
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,720
as S3 compliant spaces, storage.

681
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,760
Very nice.

682
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,960
Network level firewalls, monitoring baked in

683
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,680
to give you metrics on your CPU, your disk

684
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,320
and graph it all for you.

685
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,400
It's a really, really, really compelling offer.

686
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,360
And you can get a hundred dollars of credit to play around

687
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,360
when you go to do.co slash unplugged, do.co slash unplugged.

688
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,600
Well, my favorite Linux video editor

689
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,280
is having a development sprint as we're on the air, I think.

690
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,160
Or it's at least in the next few days, if not that.

691
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,760
Their team is going to Paris

692
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,000
and they're going to dedicate the time

693
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,680
to discuss long-term goals,

694
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,520
review application workflow with professional editors

695
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,920
and prepare for the next major release,

696
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,040
which is labeled 18.08.

697
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,400
So the KDN Live team is going there.

698
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,000
And then after that, after that,

699
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,440
they're going to the Libre, at least a sub part of the team

700
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,240
is going to Libre graphics meeting

701
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,680
for a KDN Live workshop on the 30th.

702
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,960
So if you're going to be in Paris,

703
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,040
you can come say hi to the team.

704
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,880
If you're going to the Libre graphics meeting,

705
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,800
you can go say hi to some of the KDN Live team.

706
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,960
That's fantastic.

707
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,160
So a couple of weeks ago, I'm like,

708
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,600
who is using KDN Live?

709
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,160
Is anybody else using KDN Live in production?

710
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,760
And I said that Crazy Cast over at Linux Game Cast

711
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,440
and Van Stone was editing an open shot.

712
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,880
I have been corrected.

713
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,600
They are actually using KDN Live.

714
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,000
So yeah, another one of the books.

715
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm trying to keep track.

716
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,640
So if you know anybody out there,

717
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,160
a YouTuber or actually somebody

718
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,440
who's maybe not on YouTube too,

719
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,840
just somebody that's just making content

720
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,000
in some other capacity,

721
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,280
I'd love to know who is using KDN Live out there.

722
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,120
Me.

723
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,960
Who's me?

724
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,800
Who said that?

725
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,640
Popey.

726
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,480
Oh, Popey.

727
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,320
Oh, what are you using?

728
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,680
Popey is Ubuntu podcast video and I didn't even know it.

729
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,600
Well, it is, but we don't use KDN Live.

730
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,760
I used it just briefly today

731
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,640
because I wanted to record a video

732
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,680
and I needed to redact some personally identifiable

733
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,280
information and I didn't know how to do it.

734
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,320
And it turns out that I just Googled

735
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,960
blur credit card info or something like that.

736
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,400
And I found a tutorial.

737
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,360
And within under a minute,

738
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,240
I figured it out and added an effect,

739
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,600
drew a box around the thing that I wanted to pixelate

740
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
and it just did it, rendered it out, done.

741
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,800
It was so easy.

742
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,560
KDN Live is just awesome.

743
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,400
Really?

744
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,240
Wow.

745
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,200
So what about the fact that it was,

746
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,360
video's moving, right?

747
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,400
So the object kind of moves around in the frame.

748
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,280
No, it was a webpage with credit card info in it.

749
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,760
But it did show how you could move it.

750
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,920
But I didn't need to do that.

751
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,320
I didn't follow the rest of the tutorial.

752
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,240
I just went as far as,

753
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,280
oh, that's what I need to do.

754
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,160
That's enough, shut the video down.

755
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,480
I was, yeah, it was great.

756
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,600
Yeah, I've played with it lightly

757
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,520
and I like it quite a bit.

758
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,520
And I know that when you're working

759
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,680
with really long projects, that's sometimes,

760
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,560
that's why I was asking you like,

761
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,960
what is the Linux game cast using these days?

762
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,960
Cause when you're working with really long projects,

763
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,560
a program can get a lot, lot more crashy.

764
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,200
It's just totally makes a big difference.

765
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,520
If you ever watched him,

766
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,520
he sometimes live streams him editing his own shows.

767
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,360
I think on a Sunday afternoon, he does it.

768
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,280
My time.

769
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,240
And I've watched him on Twitch sometime

770
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,480
and he's just like chatting to people

771
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,160
and saying, does this music fit here?

772
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
What should I do here?

773
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,440
And you could just see him going over

774
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,480
and over and over the edit.

775
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,600
And I don't, I think I've seen Kaden live crash once

776
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,720
for him on a live stream.

777
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,600
But yeah, it seems to work for him.

778
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,040
Now I haven't seen it, I'm always,

779
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,760
that's usually probably when I'm recording LAN.

780
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,080
So I don't really have a chance, but yeah.

781
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,400
I've been experimenting on a couple

782
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
of behind the scenes projects just for like,

783
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,360
when we go to Linux Fest, if we have a camera with us,

784
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,200
how do I want to edit the resulting footage?

785
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,360
Because if I don't figure this out now,

786
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,120
it's gonna end up on a Mac.

787
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,440
That's what my thought process has been.

788
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,320
And I've also been experimenting with Reaper,

789
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,560
which is an audio editor.

790
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,400
Oh yeah, nice.

791
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,200
On the other end of things on Linux.

792
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,640
I think the situation with Apple and the Mac Pro

793
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,720
is the canary in the coal mine for Apple,

794
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,960
that they have no idea how to build high-end computers.

795
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,680
They have no idea.

796
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,080
The people that are making those computers

797
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,280
have obviously lost touch.

798
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,880
They don't understand thermal throttling.

799
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,320
They don't understand all of these things.

800
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,800
And it's just, I think it's too late.

801
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,320
Even if they ship something decent in 2019

802
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,440
by hiring a team of highly paid professionals

803
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,720
to tell them, yes, you're doing everything right, Johnny,

804
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,560
I think it's too late.

805
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,920
So it's just not a professional workstation anymore,

806
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,560
unless your workload is doable on laptops,

807
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,760
or laptop-like components,

808
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,640
or systems that are cooled like laptops.

809
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,920
So I think it's behoovent upon all of us,

810
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,360
if that's a word I can make up,

811
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,240
to try to replicate our workflow

812
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,560
or replace parts of our workflow as much as possible on Linux.

813
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,240
The only problem is KDN Live's getting better

814
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,480
for simple edits for me,

815
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,400
but Reaper is commercial software.

816
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,360
And so it's like, am I really any better off?

817
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,040
Because I'm just moving to another commercial solution,

818
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,560
but it needs to be sophisticated.

819
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,480
It needs to have certain support for industry plugins.

820
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,760
It needs to support multi-track.

821
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,160
I've got a mixer with ungodly amounts of inputs and outputs,

822
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,760
and my recorder needs to be able to read all of those

823
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,120
and bring us all in on our own track.

824
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,880
And it's stuff that just Audacity can't even do.

825
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
It's not even capable of doing.

826
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,040
So you have to have a certain level of software to do this.

827
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,880
It's a start, I think.

828
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
It tends to be commercial.

829
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,280
Yeah, at least it's on Linux though.

830
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Yeah, no one's trying to convince me.

831
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,720
I'm not so convinced yet.

832
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,920
So I'll be curious to see what comes out

833
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
of the KDN Live sprint.

834
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,840
When these things happen,

835
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,480
it seems to be pretty good for these projects.

836
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,160
Like the results that we get out of it

837
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,600
seem to be pretty, pretty positive.

838
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,960
You know, I don't think I've given it a shot yet,

839
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,360
so now I have a new something to play with.

840
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,360
You ought to do like a day in Seattle with Wes.

841
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,200
Yeah, totally.

842
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,120
And then edit it on KDN Live.

843
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,960
I think I will.

844
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,800
I would so watch that.

845
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,640
Yeah.

846
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,720
You could be a vlogger, Wes.

847
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,560
You could.

848
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,520
I would watch the Wes vlog.

849
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,360
Downtown Seattle of Wes vlog.

850
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,560
Is there any Seattle vloggers?

851
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,760
You could just own the market

852
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,160
and become the next YouTube star,

853
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,240
which sounds wonderful.

854
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,320
Yeah, great.

855
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,360
Yeah, I've been debating whether to talk about this on air.

856
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,760
And so I'm not gonna put links in the show notes

857
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,240
because I don't want to encourage traffic,

858
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,400
but I also feel like it's something

859
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,560
that we need to be aware of.

860
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,200
And so I don't know if you guys have seen,

861
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,880
and I really don't know much about it,

862
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,160
but what's been going on with Linux Deepin this week?

863
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,040
It's really, it's a disgrace, really.

864
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,920
So there was an unsubstantiated YouTube video

865
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,440
that goes live that says that Linux Deepin is spyware

866
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,680
and that it's spying on you.

867
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,160
And then the project, after it gets enough traction,

868
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,000
of course, because Reddit is a cesspool of de-bags,

869
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,240
it gets upvoted, it starts getting a lot of attention,

870
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,040
so it becomes on the Deepin Project's radar.

871
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,000
And they respond with a blog post,

872
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,400
and of course, there is a communication barrier here,

873
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,680
so there was a couple of things that are misunderstood.

874
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,040
And they come back and say, well, we're not really spying.

875
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,440
What we're doing is we're collecting the number of installs

876
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,080
and they list the three or four data points

877
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,200
that are pretty basic bitch metrics

878
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,000
that aren't really gonna offend anybody

879
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,400
unless you're looking to be offended.

880
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,560
And of course, then there's a follow-up video

881
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,560
that then sort of just makes hay out of their admission

882
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,080
that they are collecting some metrics.

883
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,680
And I told you, here's proof of the spying.

884
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,120
And then everybody in the Reddit comments,

885
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,760
oh, they're saying they're not spying,

886
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,880
but then they write a blog post

887
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,280
saying exactly how they're spying on us.

888
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,080
And it's just outrage after outrage.

889
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,080
And I think we have a problem here because,

890
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,120
and I won't go through the whole thing,

891
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,080
but you guys know I'm a big believer

892
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,880
that unlike the Windows admin community

893
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,240
or the Apple user community

894
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,440
or these different sub-sects of technology,

895
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,760
the open source community is vulnerable

896
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,800
to this sort of insidious infighting

897
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,400
in a way that I think is destructive

898
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,880
to people's motivation to contribute to open source code.

899
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,840
So I think it's worth talking about just really quickly.

900
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,680
I won't go into it

901
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,160
because there's episodes dedicated to it

902
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,880
if you wanna hear this.

903
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,880
But I think we have a particular problem with YouTube.

904
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,640
It is a toxic cesspool of clickbait one-upism.

905
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,560
And it's compounded by adpocalypse

906
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,160
and constant demonetization

907
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,280
that forces people to continue to pivot

908
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,240
to try to flail around

909
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,360
and find a new way to get people's attention

910
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,160
and prey on their emotions

911
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,240
so that way they can click on a YouTube video

912
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,240
and somebody can monetize that click for a penny.

913
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,280
At the same time,

914
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,400
there is competition inherent in the platform

915
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,720
because there's multiple people

916
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,160
that are trying to cover these topics.

917
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,480
You've noticed that probably if you are on YouTube,

918
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,160
you've noticed, oh, well, really since we ended last,

919
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,840
Jupiter Broadcasting has been significantly

920
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,480
pulling back on YouTube.

921
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,520
And the rationale has been because I think it's toxic

922
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,880
and I think it's damaging to the open source community

923
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,240
because of its inherent nature of how the system works.

924
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,320
It's designed to encourage clickbait

925
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,640
because of the way the YouTube algorithm works.

926
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,560
It's designed to encourage people

927
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,560
to try to elicit an emotional click.

928
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,840
But the other problem is,

929
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,960
and this is a secret that Google

930
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,480
doesn't really like to tell you

931
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,320
because it's really bad for ads,

932
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,480
but anybody who creates content for YouTube

933
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,320
for a little while,

934
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,520
and I've been doing it for about 10 years,

935
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,640
I've been posting to YouTube,

936
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,160
so I have some standing here.

937
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,080
A huge portion of the audience on YouTube is kids.

938
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,560
And I'm grateful you guys are watching.

939
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,880
This isn't me saying, hey, kids suck.

940
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,680
It's just saying the reality is

941
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,560
a huge portion of the YouTube audience is children.

942
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,880
Not all of them are logged in, but it's a huge percentage.

943
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,000
And especially on the large YouTubers,

944
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,440
like your Roman Atwoods, your Casey Neistats,

945
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,920
your large channels where they get hundreds of thousands,

946
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,120
if not millions of views,

947
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,000
a ginormous percentage of that

948
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,920
that Google does not want you to know about,

949
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,800
because again, that doesn't play well to advertisers,

950
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,760
is children.

951
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,360
When you remove the child metric from YouTube,

952
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,600
what's left, the adults,

953
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,960
well, you have to realize that now these people

954
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,480
that are making videos about Linux and open source

955
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,720
are serving to a very small niche of YouTube already,

956
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,560
the adults.

957
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,720
And then it's a niche within that niche

958
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,280
of people who care about Linux and open source

959
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,880
and are willing to watch production values

960
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,080
that tend to vary,

961
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,840
and people who tend to be varying presenters

962
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,880
talk about these topics.

963
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,280
That's like a super double, triple niche, right?

964
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,640
Now we're way down the stack.

965
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,360
And so these people that are creating these videos

966
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,600
are really fighting for a small number of audience

967
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,440
on YouTube.

968
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,640
And I would argue it's a number that is actually too small

969
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,680
for them to successfully monetize.

970
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,480
So we have this really toxic nature

971
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,200
where they're competing against each other

972
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,360
because you only have so much time in the day

973
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,600
to watch a YouTube video.

974
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,240
They're competing against an algorithm

975
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,160
that's a total black box,

976
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,440
and it drives clickbait nature of content creators

977
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,520
to put something out there that I just need you to watch

978
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,840
because I have to grow my audience

979
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,080
because unless I'm getting about 25,000 views per video,

980
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,720
I can't really monetize this,

981
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,840
especially if I'm living anywhere on either side

982
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,920
of the East or West Coast of the United States.

983
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,760
You gotta get around 25, 30,000 views per video

984
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,080
to make a decent living.

985
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,680
That's not accounting for ad pocalypse.

986
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,640
That's not accounting for demonetization.

987
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,000
So don't say a bad word.

988
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,840
It's a very, very difficult landscape,

989
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,720
and it pushes people to do things

990
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,320
like call a Linux distro spyware

991
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,680
simply because it's checking how many people

992
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,200
have installed Firefox.

993
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,520
And it creates this negative momentum

994
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,800
and this negative discussion and this confirmation bias

995
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,440
that you see then spread throughout discussion forums.

996
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,440
Do you think that Deepin was looked at more closely

997
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,880
because it originates from China?

998
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,720
Yeah, yeah.

999
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,200
And do you think that that betrays

1000
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,040
the content providers mentality?

1001
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,280
Yeah, and maybe the people

1002
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,480
that all got their pitchforks as well,

1003
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,480
although I could easily see it happening to Ubuntu,

1004
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,440
especially if Canonical hadn't been fully out ahead of,

1005
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,360
hey, in six months, we're gonna start collecting

1006
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,080
some basic metrics that we should have been collecting

1007
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,920
all along.

1008
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,960
If Canonical hadn't messaged that ahead of time,

1009
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,000
it would have, and you guys, that's why you messaged it,

1010
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,560
that's why Canonical messaged it, right?

1011
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,840
Because it would have been a huge controversy.

1012
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:07,840
Yes, but I just feel that there is a mentality

1013
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,120
which is because something comes from China,

1014
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,120
it should be eyed with suspicion first.

1015
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,240
Absolutely, I think that's absolutely true.

1016
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,320
I'm not saying I subscribe to that, by the way.

1017
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,760
I think that it's actually a rather dangerous position,

1018
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,720
a default position to have.

1019
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,760
But I feel that Deepin has been picked out

1020
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,360
in this way more than once in the past

1021
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,680
by a similar group of content makers on YouTube.

1022
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,440
There is a common theme that something that comes from China

1023
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,400
is like cheap Chinese rubbish.

1024
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,680
Yet what a lot of people forget is

1025
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,040
they also buy expensive Chinese stuff.

1026
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,000
Like, you know, they're very expensive device

1027
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,680
that they fondle all day, every day.

1028
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,760
It was almost certainly made in the Far East.

1029
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,760
That's okay, but it's the cheap Chinese rubbish

1030
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,520
that's terrible and decrepit.

1031
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,480
Decrying everything is cheap Chinese crap

1032
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,800
because they can buy something cheap on Alibaba.

1033
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,840
But it turns out it's actually cheap

1034
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,920
to manufacture something over there.

1035
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,000
That doesn't mean it's all crap, right?

1036
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,480
And the same goes for software.

1037
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,640
Just because there's a vast number of developers

1038
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,080
over there creating software at low cost

1039
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,280
doesn't make it inherently rubbish.

1040
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,920
Yes, they might make mistakes, so does everyone.

1041
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,600
Nobody in any of those threads on Reddit is perfect.

1042
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,640
None of them have ever not made a mistake in their life

1043
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,720
and never been found out and then everything's okay.

1044
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,920
Like, everyone makes mistakes, right?

1045
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,200
And these people made a mistake.

1046
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,480
There's a communication barrier

1047
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,240
between our Western YouTube friends

1048
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,880
and those guys over in the Far East.

1049
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,760
And I think there's a massive misinterpretation

1050
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,760
of basically what was in essence like Google Analytics

1051
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,000
that everyone has turned on

1052
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,920
unless they've got an ad blocker and everyone uses.

1053
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,600
Yet it's not okay for them to use it over there

1054
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,640
because they are them, that's why.

1055
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,280
Yep, pretty much that.

1056
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,680
It does feel, and you see it too, it's not just China.

1057
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,280
You know, a lot of people don't trust Telegram

1058
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,760
because it comes from Russia.

1059
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,040
And that's reason enough to be skeptical of it.

1060
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,720
But that's just as bad because it doesn't come from Russia.

1061
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,320
It's not like Russia is one amorphous blocker.

1062
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,280
That is how it is seen.

1063
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,120
Right, exactly.

1064
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,680
It's one guy who happens to be Russian who made that thing.

1065
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,520
Russia is a effing huge place with a lot of people in it

1066
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,800
that do lots of different things.

1067
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,600
One guy who happens to be Russian

1068
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
doesn't make all of Telegram bad.

1069
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,160
There are other things that make Telegram bad,

1070
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,000
but it's not bad.

1071
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,840
Yeah, I think, Bobby, you nailed it on the head right there.

1072
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,760
I couldn't say it better myself.

1073
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,000
And so maybe that's part of what gets me going about it

1074
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,080
is the sort of insidious thing that sort of creeps in.

1075
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,800
You don't even realize it's what's driving your motivation.

1076
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,920
And it just seems so damaging in the open source community.

1077
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,080
I guess part of it comes, I got another email this week

1078
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,080
from, I don't know if he's a well-known developer,

1079
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,600
but the project is well-known.

1080
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:56,240
And he's quitting because of just feeling

1081
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,680
like the most common thread in there

1082
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,640
is this awful sense of entitlement

1083
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,760
and this sort of inflexibility in respecting the fact

1084
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,320
that I'm a human being.

1085
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,480
And it's just really sad to see that.

1086
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,720
I can't agree more with that sentiment.

1087
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,120
You know, the other thing that some

1088
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,280
of these YouTube videos and other outlets on Reddit

1089
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,560
is this huge sense of entitlement.

1090
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,960
I'm just going to dog pile on this thing

1091
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,320
that you make in your spare time for the love of it.

1092
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,360
I'm going to criticize it like it's a professional project.

1093
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,360
I'm going to build my own profile off

1094
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,080
the back of shitposting about whatever Linux distribution

1095
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,800
or whatever application it is that you think you've

1096
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,760
got superior opinions on.

1097
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,400
And it is extremely demoralizing for the people

1098
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,640
that invest huge amounts of time in a positive way

1099
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,920
to actually try and create something for anyone

1100
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,640
to use free of charge in open source.

1101
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,120
And then to have it shit on by a bunch of monkeys in Reddit

1102
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,520
is really disheartening.

1103
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,480
And it does make you think twice sometimes.

1104
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,360
You know, I'm sat here this evening

1105
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,320
whilst we're talking in another window.

1106
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,440
I'm fixing the last of the bugs that

1107
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,520
are blockers for release next week.

1108
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,280
And I've been doing that to the early hours of the morning

1109
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,640
for several weeks now.

1110
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,760
And I'm pretty tired.

1111
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,280
And when you see posts like that in the corners of the internet

1112
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,280
where these discussions run, it really

1113
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,520
turns you off putting the effort in.

1114
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,920
Yeah, I find it super irony too.

1115
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,400
So people that are sort of stuck in this cycle of trying

1116
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,880
to create crazy content so that way they can build audience,

1117
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,200
so that way they can reach sustainability,

1118
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,320
it's sort of like pissing in your own well.

1119
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,080
And they have devastating consequences

1120
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,520
on people that are working on a passion project, that

1121
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,720
are doing something that fulfills them.

1122
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,720
And then these people come along and they just devastate them.

1123
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,160
And the irony is, how fulfilling must their work be?

1124
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,440
If they're creating content like this,

1125
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,320
that is just this shit content, these shit posts,

1126
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,720
they can't be proud of themselves.

1127
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,200
They can't be fulfilled by this.

1128
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,640
And so the very thing that's probably

1129
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,640
robbing them of fulfillment they use

1130
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,040
to take away from somebody who has found something that

1131
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,600
gives them fulfillment.

1132
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,560
It's sick.

1133
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,080
It's the smug attitude that you see

1134
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:26,000
in the comments and some of the content as well.

1135
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,400
I'm making a funny now by pointing out this thing

1136
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,160
that I've found.

1137
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,360
And it's just like, well, if that's

1138
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,000
the best you've got to contribute to open source,

1139
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,320
I'd rather you weren't a part of it and shut the fuck up.

1140
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,920
Yeah, I have found that it's not everywhere.

1141
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,960
And it's not like I wouldn't say most

1142
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,280
of these things about anyone in the Jupiter broadcasting

1143
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,800
audience.

1144
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,480
I have had so many wonderful interactions.

1145
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,240
I get notes from people that just say,

1146
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,320
thanks for working as hard as you do.

1147
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,400
Thanks for doing what you do.

1148
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,360
I get a lot of that.

1149
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,280
I mean, I get haters too, but I get a lot of that.

1150
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,440
But there are corners where it's really prevalent.

1151
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,840
And it seems to be areas where there's

1152
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,640
a lot of incentives around getting as many clicks

1153
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,840
as possible, whether it's upvotes or ad revenue.

1154
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,720
Wherever those dynamics come to play,

1155
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,040
it just seems to be really toxic for open source.

1156
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,560
I don't know.

1157
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,720
I think we've made this point enough.

1158
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,840
But it's something I've been thinking about watching

1159
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,040
this go down with Deepin.

1160
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,760
Because I see this go across my radar, and it's like,

1161
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,560
how do I treat this?

1162
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,720
Is this a news story?

1163
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,440
I don't want to even give this legitimacy.

1164
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,880
Now, if there was legitimately spying taking place,

1165
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,040
I absolutely would cover that.

1166
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,480
But when it's this sort of rough shot,

1167
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,160
no fact-based opinion stuff.

1168
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,320
It really breaks the trust that is oftentimes

1169
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,280
kind of the heart of the open source community.

1170
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,240
I kind of feel like we do this with stuff from Microsoft,

1171
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:46,720
too.

1172
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,600
It came from China.

1173
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,560
It came from Russia.

1174
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,680
It came from Microsoft.

1175
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,440
So therefore, we're automatically skeptical.

1176
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,600
And it was in full force this week

1177
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,400
when Microsoft announced Azure Sphere, which

1178
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,760
is a multi-part component.

1179
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,760
But the most headline-grabbing component

1180
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,920
is the fact that there's an OS involved

1181
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,880
that uses the Linux kernel.

1182
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,280
And I have seen everything from this is now everybody.

1183
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,120
Actually, the most common thing I've seen

1184
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,280
is this is Microsoft embracing and extinguishing Linux.

1185
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,760
They've begun the extinguish phase.

1186
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,160
And everybody's jumping to 11 on this one.

1187
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,760
So we decided, let's actually talk

1188
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,240
to the people behind the project and figure out what's going on.

1189
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,040
And so we discussed with a couple of folks from Microsoft

1190
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,040
that are involved in building the product, what it is.

1191
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,680
What's going on?

1192
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,480
What kind of Linux?

1193
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,960
What are they using it for?

1194
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,920
What's the hardware?

1195
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,840
All of that stuff.

1196
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,960
And so we'll share with you what we picked up.

1197
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,920
Does that make sense?

1198
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,880
We'll share what we learned.

1199
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,720
We got the deets.

1200
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,720
We got the deets.

1201
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,480
But first, let's mention Linux Academy.

1202
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,840
It's linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1203
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,000
You go there to sign up for a free seven-day trial

1204
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,400
and support the show.

1205
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,440
It's a platform to learn more about Linux.

1206
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,880
And once you sign up, you get unlimited access.

1207
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,080
And they're about to add a whole bunch of new stuff

1208
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,280
in the month of April.

1209
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,640
70 new courses, challenges, learning activities.

1210
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,320
It actually breaks down like this.

1211
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,120
20 new courses, as well as some content refreshes,

1212
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,320
50 new cloud assessments, hands-on learning activities,

1213
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,560
and new challenges baked in, as well as taking advantage

1214
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,480
of their new real-time grader platform

1215
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,640
so you can get feedback as you're learning.

1216
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,400
Ooh-ee.

1217
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,240
Isn't that great?

1218
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,000
That is.

1219
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,680
Yeah, so go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1220
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,520
Sign up for the free seven-day trial.

1221
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,680
You support the show.

1222
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,600
And then check it out.

1223
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,520
They got hands-on scenario-based labs.

1224
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,320
They spin up servers on demand.

1225
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,200
You pick the distro and adjust the courseware and the servers.

1226
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,200
They have full-time human beings that can help you

1227
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,280
if you ever get stuck.

1228
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,840
If you're busy, they've got a course schedule.

1229
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,520
It'll work with your busy schedules.

1230
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,000
And they got learning paths, which

1231
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,040
are a series of content and courseware planned

1232
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,200
by instructors for specific career tracks.

1233
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,080
Now, you combine that with all the new content

1234
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,720
they're rolling out in the month of April,

1235
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,680
it's never been a better time to sign up.

1237
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,120
You can also try out the iOS and Android app, the flashcards,

1238
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,920
which are forked by the community,

1239
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,040
and the tiny bits of wisdom that they call nuggets that

1240
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,760
go deep dives into single topics.

1241
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,240
Like, you want to learn file permissions on Linux.

1242
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,680
You want to learn firewalling.

1243
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,560
You want to learn basic networking and ports on Linux.

1244
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,600
They have deep dives into those specific topics.

1245
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,760
Other topics too, including some development ones

1246
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,240
at Linux Academy as well.

1247
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,560
I love me some nuggets.

1248
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,360
And MexiFries, because we had little MexiFries with us too.

1249

1255
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,000
Big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring

1256
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,920
the unplugged program.

1257
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,760
So help me not mistake the pronunciation

1258
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,160
of the primary gentleman that we spoke with.

1259
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,000
Was it Galen?

1260
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,760
Galen Hunt.

1261
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,720
Yeah, it was Galen Hunt.

1262
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,600
And Galen is the author of a whole line

1263
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,840
of publications of papers that came out of Microsoft

1264
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,320
that if you read them, would almost

1265
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,480
kind of give you a clue of where they

1266
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,680
were going with all of this.

1267
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,760
Like the hint was out there.

1268
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,520
Like the one that was published last year,

1269
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,920
The Seven Properties of Highly Secure Devices,

1270
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,200
or Challenges to Building Scalable Services.

1271
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,200
And the background is you could see

1272
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,560
that there's been a lot of thought that went into this.

1273
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,880
So Wes and I wanted to be able to talk

1274
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,580
on some level of authority of what Azure Sphere is.

1275
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,280
And how Linux is being used by Microsoft.

1276
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,720
And so Azure Sphere, think of it as something that

1277
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,880
really has three aspects.

1278
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,840
Overall, it's a solution for companies

1279
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,600
that are building single chip computer products.

1280
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,360
Devices that are often even smaller than a Raspberry Pi.

1281
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,880
You know, truly like the toasters and the hair dryers

1282
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,320
that haven't yet been connected to Wi-Fi,

1283
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,840
but are just about to be.

1284
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,640
Right, things that are running like just little micro

1285
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,120
controllers now, maybe real time operating systems,

1286
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,440
not big full featured things.

1287
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,760
Yeah, we were joking, but actually very realistically,

1288
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,160
things like those Bluetooth sous vides and whatnot.

1289
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,840
It's really happening.

1290
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,240
And Microsoft estimates that there's probably 10 billion

1291
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,520
units around the world like this.

1292
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,680
I think that might have been a yearly number two that

1293
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,520
gets sold.

1294
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,720
Lower end devices that you just don't traditionally think of,

1295
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,200
but they would sometimes have like a real time operating

1296
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,320
system on there.

1297
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,840
Azure Sphere is stepping in here.

1298
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,240
They're sort of making a product for these manufacturers,

1299
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,800
a full end to end product to run on these devices.

1300
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,060
So it's three aspects, and this is

1301
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,360
where it starts to make sense.

1302
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,240
You've probably heard of the new MCUs,

1303
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,640
these machines that are a system all on this one slab.

1304
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,880
It's part of a hardware solution that vendors

1305
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,760
will be able to use.

1306
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,040
It'll also be available as a dev kit later on.

1307
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,040
And they've built in some of the similar hardware checks

1308
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,640
that they have in the Xbox.

1309
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,280
They took that hardware root of trust.

1310
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,560
Each device has its own secured identity.

1311
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,600
It uses secure boot capabilities.

1312
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,760
It verifies that the device software installed

1313
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,680
is legitimate.

1314
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,560
And it's also possible to check them with the server

1315
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,000
and have server side and client side checks as well.

1316
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,160
Microsoft's going to be licensing that silicon.

1317
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,600
And I didn't quite get the license out of them,

1318
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,880
but it sounds like it's going to be pretty liberal.

1319
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,720
And royalty free.

1320
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,460
Yeah.

1321
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:11,960
Yep.

1322
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,920
And the second bit is, so this Azure Sphere is three parts.

1323
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,720
That's part one, the hardware part.

1324
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,080
The second bit is the OS.

1325
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,200
This is where Linux sits.

1326
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,360
It's a multi-layered OS.

1327
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,940
And the reason why they call it that

1328
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,880
is there's a lower level that's doing the hardware and software

1329
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,600
verification.

1330
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,640
The second layer is the Linux kernel.

1331
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,640
And we pushed them for some details on this.

1332
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,960
And they shared it with us.

1333
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,560
It's using Linux kernel 4.9.

1334
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,240
And Wes asked them specifically, are you

1335
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,320
going to be tracking upstream kernel releases?

1336
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,600
Is it based on another project?

1337
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,400
Is this a derivative distro?

1338
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,400
It is upstream Linux kernel 4.9.

1339
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,960
And they said they're going to be aggressively tracking.

1340
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,480
Aggressively.

1341
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,360
That was their term.

1342
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,800
Yeah, aggressively tracking upstream with that.

1343
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,960
And so I asked, so what are you using Linux for specifically?

1344
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,840
And they kind of shy away from this a bit.

1345
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,760
Because to them, it's just part of a three-part solution.

1346
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,100
I know that sounds so corporate.

1347
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,840
But that's really how they see it.

1348
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,540
Linux is sort of just like this enabling technology stack.

1349
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,280
It's not like this huge come to Jesus over the GPL.

1350
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,560
It's just practical.

1351
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,040
Yeah, it wasn't designed around Linux.

1352
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,880
Linux isn't a focus.

1353
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,720
Linux was just a tool that fit into the architecture.

1354
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,400
So we said, so how are you using Linux?

1355
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,540
And so they're using process isolation via the Linux kernel.

1356
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,720
And they're using sandboxes for all the apps.

1357
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,520
And they're using the kernel features built into 4.9

1358
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,360
for sandboxing.

1359
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,440
And of course, they're using the networking stack

1360
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,360
and the disk IO stack.

1361
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,560
So they're using the base elements.

1362
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,800
And I said, OK, well, honestly here,

1363
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,440
is this something that you guys just slammed in because you

1364
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,200
realized you couldn't get Windows down

1365
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,600
on these real-time devices?

1366
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,540
Or was Linux baked in from the very beginning

1367
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,600
when you started this project?

1368
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,360
And the answer was, we started this project four years ago.

1369
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:56,800
And Linux was, from day one, part of the solution.

1370
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,080
From day one, they were going to use Linux.

1371
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,160
And then so that's the second middle layer of Azure Sphere.

1372
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,760
And then there's the third part to Azure Sphere.

1373
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,600
And that is the part that actually is on Azure, really.

1374
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,240
It's the Azure Sphere Security Service.

1375
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,480
It's a cloud service that can reach out

1376
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,460
to every device that has a security Azure Sphere

1377
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,760
chip in it that's part of the MCU.

1378
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,840
It uses certificate-based authentication

1379
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,840
for authentication to the cloud.

1380
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,680
And it allows for device-to-device communication

1381
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,720
directly using these certificates.

1382
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,280
And it also includes the ability to collect

1383
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,360
crash metrics of applications, which Microsoft

1384
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,360
is planning to aggregate across the entire Azure Sphere

1385
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,120
ecosystem so that way they can, at large scale,

1386
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,600
see if all of a sudden a lot of devices

1387
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,000
are getting this port banged on, or this application

1388
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
is crashing on a lot of systems.

1389
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But on top of that, they can give those metrics back

1390
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,760
anonymized to the hardware manufacturers,

1391
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,900
and they can see how their devices are failing.

1392
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,000
And then the last part of the hosted part of Azure Sphere

1393
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,320
is a software update channel that Microsoft

1394
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,800
will host and manage for them.

1395
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,920
But the vendor will have a secure channel

1396
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,680
to ship software updates.

1397
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,880
And Microsoft will run support for 10 years.

1398
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,040
They will support these Linux-based IoT devices

1399
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,400
and give vendors a channel to ship updates

1400
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,640
and give them metrics for 10 years.

1401
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,360
They have an SDK coming soonish, probably like summertime.

1402
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,600
It's going to include a dev kit board, hooks up via USB,

1403
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,100
and then you can start banging on it.

1404
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,600
Even Visual Studio integration sounds

1405
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,000
like a pretty decent development environment.

1406
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,680
The core problem they're really solving

1407
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,560
is hardware manufacturers that, say,

1408
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,840
want to make a Bluetooth sous-vide,

1409
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,520
or a Wi-Fi sous-vide machine, or a Crock-Pot,

1410
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,320
they don't have to now build a whole server infrastructure

1411
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,080
to manage incoming requests, set up a REST API,

1412
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,000
set up push services, build out through data centers

1413
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,340
all around the world so that way they can have low latency

1414
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,160
connections, and then have an on-staff software team that

1415
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,520
ships out updates and looks and analyzes logs and ships out

1416
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,480
fixes, Microsoft is now doing all of that.

1417
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,040
They're figuring out the inner device communication security.

1418
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,360
They're figuring out how to push out the software updates.

1419
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,920
And they're even using a Linux kernel

1420
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,200
for the actual low-end hardware devices.

1421
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,840
It is truly like a, you want to make an IoT device product GE?

1422
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,320
Well, here's Azure Sphere.

1423
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,640
We'll take care of the silicon.

1424
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,280
We'll take care of the software updates.

1425
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,720
We'll take care of the metrics.

1426
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:37,160
And we'll take care of 10 years of support channel for you.

1427
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,680
You just have to figure out the product

1428
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,520
and figure out what you want to do with it.

1429
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,960
And we'll handle the back end stuff.

1430
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,960
Seems like that's going to be a big, big thing.

1431
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,000
And you tie it in with Azure, which is all over the world.

1432
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,520
Microsoft would probably price it extremely aggressively

1433
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,840
to get people to try it.

1434
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,760
Right, yeah, I'm sure.

1435
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,280
And then it's oh so easy.

1436
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,240
Oh, we'll just keep you a host of other things in Azure

1437
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,160
as well, of course.

1438
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,360
Yeah.

1439
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:05,360
And fascinating that from day one four years ago, Linux.

1440
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,040
I thought another part that was interesting

1441
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,080
was that a large part of that was that their vendors,

1442
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,920
their silicon partners, they already knew Linux.

1443
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,960
And Linux was open source.

1444
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,420
It was easy for them to experiment,

1445
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,000
to take Microsoft's code and iterate on it,

1446
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,840
make improvements, ship them back, share them.

1447
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,840
Kind of speaks to the things we like about Linux.

1448
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,000
I don't know if they would characterize it this way,

1449
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,440
but my personal takeaway from our call

1450
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,200
was they were surprised how much attention the Linux

1451
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,760
aspect has gotten.

1452
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,400
They didn't see that coming because,

1453
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,240
and kind of paraphrasing, they're like,

1454
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:41,200
well, we've been shipping Linux on switches in Azure,

1455
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,440
and Linux is a massively growing aspect

1456
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,800
for that end of our business.

1457
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,080
So when it comes to Azure, Linux

1458
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,920
has been part of their business for a long time,

1459
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,320
and it's totally normal to them.

1460
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,760
They're not even surprised by it.

1461
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,600
So they weren't quite expecting the amount of reaction it got

1462
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,880
because their mindset has been, well, yeah, of course

1463
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,680
we're using Linux, which was weird for us

1464
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,400
to kind of get up to speed on.

1465
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,560
Because they were like, I don't know why everybody's

1466
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,760
so surprised by this.

1467
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,520
I'm like, really, guys, you're shipping a Linux-based OS now.

1468
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,560
Like, yeah, well, this is the Azure team.

1469
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,600
This is what we do.

1470
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,120
Like, OK.

1471
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,240
Yeah, and from that perspective, it does make sense.

1472
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,840
Yeah, it fits.

1473
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,320
It was the right tool at the right time in the right place,

1474
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,440
and good on them.

1475
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,920
Yeah, I suppose so.

1476
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,360
And they talk about, so you'll hear in the announcements,

1477
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:27,920
you'll hear Microsoft has put certain Windows security

1478
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,640
technologies into their version of Linux.

1479
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,680
You may have read some version of that in the press releases,

1480
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,640
and we said, what is that?

1481
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,760
What are these Windows security techniques

1482
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,600
that you're now applying to Linux?

1483
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,600
And predominantly, it was around the crash reporting,

1484
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,160
the Windows crash reporter, tying that

1485
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,760
into their existing infrastructure for that,

1486
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,280
but also came down like a couple,

1487
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,600
the way they designed some of the permissions.

1488
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,440
You remember, there was like a third thing

1489
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,560
that they took from Windows.

1490
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,880
It didn't seem like a huge deal, but I didn't note it down.

1491
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,320
But the crash metrics collection, oh, oh,

1492
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,240
the way they're slip streaming the updates in

1493
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,080
to be low bandwidth so that way they can slip updates in,

1494
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,480
they're using that same system that they

1495
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,120
use for Windows 10 to do that.

1496
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,840
Yes, right.

1497
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,160
That's what it was.

1498
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,480
So anyways, kind of a compelling offer.

1499
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,880
I didn't ask them this, but when I first

1500
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,040
heard the announcement, I was a little surprised

1501
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,960
it wasn't based on an existing distro,

1502
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,160
like your Ubuntu core or something to that degree.

1503
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,800
I was a little surprised that they

1504
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,000
decided to roll their own.

1505
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,600
But when you hear about the other stuff,

1506
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,720
they've wrapped around it.

1507
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,360
I think I can understand why.

1508
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,840
Yeah, and it may be that these devices

1509
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,880
are special purpose enough that you

1510
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,920
don't need a full featured regular sort of user

1511
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,240
landing your tightly.

1512
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,360
Yeah, the kernel really sounds like an enabling piece

1513
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,000
of technology.

1514
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,200
It's not like the core aspect of these devices.

1515
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,640
It's just a sub-aspect of three parts of a component, really.

1516
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,440
But a big turn of events for Microsoft, either way,

1517
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,240
from where I said it seems like a big deal to me.

1518
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,360
And they went out of their way to make

1519
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,240
sure it was clear to us, including setting up

1520
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,000
a conference call.

1521
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,800
I think they said they were at a conference, at RSA callers?

1522
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,880
Yeah, they're at the RSA conference right now.

1523
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,080
So they grabbed a room, and they got a group of people

1524
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,800
from the Azure team in a room and got on a phone call with us.

1525
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,680
That's why we didn't do an interview.

1526
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,120
But they got on a phone call with us

1527
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,480
and let us just bang questions at them for a half hour

1528
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,200
about this thing.

1529
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,720
And I walked away feeling pretty impressed.

1530
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,320
I went in not really understanding

1531
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,840
what's going on, wondering, is this embrace and extinguish?

1532
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,720
But I walked out of it with, well, those takeaways

1533
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,760
that I just shared with you.

1534
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,800
Yeah, I mean, it really seems like they are motivated.

1535
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,560
They see the business case for all the terrible IoT

1536
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,240
things that already exist in the world

1537
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,720
and why that needs to be fixed.

1538
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,280
Whether or not it's going to be adopted, I don't know.

1539
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,400
But it might be a good thing if it is.

1540
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,040
I wouldn't be too surprised if Microsoft doesn't have success

1541
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,880
working directly with like fridge manufacturers.

1542
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,200
And they can do that big business to big business.

1543
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,400
And they're already in on so many different devices.

1544
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,640
And some of these devices have tried

1545
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,400
to ship versions of Windows embedded,

1546
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,760
and now they can just shift those hardware partners over

1547
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,720
to this, possibly.

1548
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,160
I don't know.

1549
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,440
Anyways, I was really thankful.

1550
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,680
And I extended them an offer to come on the show down the road

1551
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,720
if we have more questions.

1552
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,000
So if you have some questions or comments,

1553
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,240
leave it either where you're watching or linuxunplug.com

1554
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,000
slash contact.

1555
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,200
Is there anything from the Mumble Room

1556
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,920
that any questions or thoughts about Microsoft

1557
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,920
shipping a Linux distro?

1558
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,680
That's kind of a big development in itself.

1559
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,720
I mean, I guess it's not fair to call it a distro,

1560
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,320
but a Linux-powered product, I guess we could say.

1561
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,680
I think Linus Torvalds says he won.

1562
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,560
Yeah.

1563
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,400
Yeah, that famous quote, when Microsoft

1564
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,720
starts making applications for Linux, I've won.

1565
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,760
Yeah.

1566
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,560
And there was a real just practicalness in their mind.

1567
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,400
They just thought for these ROT devices,

1568
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,840
these really kind of lower-end real-time operating system

1569
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,880
devices, Linux was just a better fit.

1570
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,960
And then you have to wonder, would they

1571
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:48,480
have done this if the last few years of work on containers

1572
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,760
and sandboxing hadn't been going to the Linux kernel?

1573
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,320
Because those are some of the core features

1574
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,240
they're using to secure the applications that

1575
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,360
run on these devices.

1576
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:55,880
Right.

1577
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,800
I mean, you need a certain amount

1578
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,960
of those primitives available so that you can build.

1579
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,540
If you're trying to build a secure OS,

1580
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,600
you need to be able to achieve that goal.

1581
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,120
Yeah.

1582
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,920
And if those weren't there, they wouldn't have had that goal.

1583
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,600
Minimac, you have a point about sort of the future.

1584
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,360
Yeah, see, with all these changes

1585
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:14,480
they did, the last thing, meaning restructuring

1586
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,280
the whole company, it looks like they

1587
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,920
want to be a service provider in the future.

1588
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,920
So selling software is not that important.

1589
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,080
Selling services, that makes money.

1590
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,040
We've been talking on the Coder radio program, Coder.show,

1591
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,920
about Microsoft sort of becoming the new IBM.

1592
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,200
And it started about three weeks ago or four weeks ago

1593
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,520
when we did a retrospective look at Sun Microsystems

1594
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,440
and their influence on the IT industry,

1595
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,680
their influence on Android and Java.

1596
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,480
And that retrospective then got us

1597
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,200
talking about IBM, which we did last week.

1598
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,040
And at the end of our retrospective of IBM

1599
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,120
sort of at its heyday in the 80s,

1600
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,360
we realized that Microsoft is very much getting

1601
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,400
to a new version.

1602
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,640
My co-host, Michael, calls it a platonic ideal of what IBM

1603
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,040
wanted to be, is what Microsoft is becoming.

1604
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,000
I don't know.

1605
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,760
I'm watching this, all of these events.

1606
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,400
And you go into it with, at least I can't help,

1607
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,880
because I came up during the good old wars of Microsoft

1608
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,960
and Windows and Linux.

1609
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,280
I mean, that was the fire I was raised in.

1610
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,680
Yeah, exactly.

1611
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,400
So when I see these stories, that, oh, man,

1612
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,640
this is embrace and extinguish does go across my mind.

1613
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,920
And I have to really sort of just take a moment

1614
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,560
and be self-aware and go, OK, well, that's

1615
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,480
an emotional reaction.

1616
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,440
That's an emotional reaction.

1617
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,200
Be mindful.

1618
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,120
And what could this really be?

1619
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:43,120
And I think what's deeper is what we are witnessing

1620
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,520
is that Microsoft is going to become

1621
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,720
one of the handful of companies that has successfully,

1622
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,920
and I mean very successfully, monetized Linux

1623
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,200
and open source.

1624
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,600
And we have a hard time with that in the open source Linux

1625
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,720
community.

1626
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,120
We don't like people making money.

1627
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,760
You know, we have a few handful of blessed companies,

1628
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,920
like Red Hat, that will even celebrate when they make money.

1629
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,480
They're allowed to make money.

1630
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,360
But otherwise, you're not really allowed

1631
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,920
to make money in Linux.

1632
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,360
And so when Microsoft is becoming

1633
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,800
one of the clear leaders of people making a profit off

1634
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,600
of Linux and open source, I think

1635
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,700
it doesn't sit well with us.

1636
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,800
I think below all of this is, what

1637
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,040
if one of the companies, at the end of this war,

1638
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,320
everything we fought for, at the end of all of it,

1639
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,080
when all is said and done, the company that's

1640
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,720
making the most money off of Linux

1641
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,080
or making some of the most money is Microsoft.

1642
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,240
I think that's what's really bothering people,

1643
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,840
is they shouldn't be allowed.

1644
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,080
They fought us the whole way.

1645
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,720
They shouldn't be allowed to have this.

1646
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,720
This is ours.

1647
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,840
But they're a smart company with a lot of smart people.

1648
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,040
And they made some smart changes.

1649
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,920
And now they're going to be one of the number one moneymakers

1650
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:49,600
off Linux.

1651
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,320
You see, they don't have to destroy Linux.

1652
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,120
They don't have to take over Linux.

1653
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,160
They don't have to convince the Linux Foundation to slow down

1654
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,160
development or any conspiracy theory

1655
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,080
that people cook and bake and come up with.

1656
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,520
Because they can make money off Linux just the way it is.

1657
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,120
And they're making more money than ever.

1658
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,280
And the GPL will keep Linux Linux.

1659
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:07,920
That's done.

1660
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,640
The GPL is done.

1661
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,160
GPL too.

1662
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,560
Unless they convince Linus to relicense,

1663
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,240
I think we're pretty much safe here.

1664
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,760
And so what we really got to wrap our heads around

1665
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,840
is that Microsoft is going to be one of the biggest

1666
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,400
moneymakers off of Linux.

1667
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,440
And we've got to think about how that makes us feel.

1668
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,320
And maybe that's what's influencing our reaction

1669
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,120
to some of this.

1670
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,880
Are they better at Linux than we are?

1671
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,680
I mean, that's just it, right?

1672
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,280
Not to be Mr. Linux podcast psychologist here,

1673
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,440
but I think that's a play a little bit.

1674
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,640
Because it's unsettling.

1675
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,560
You're not allowed to make money off of Linux.

1676
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,480
You fought us on this.

1677
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,320
You called it a cancer.

1678
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:44,040
But we all know that things change.

1679
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,640
And this Azure Sphere, shipping Linux at the core of it,

1680
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,920
may be just the tip of the iceberg.

1681
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,840
Think about that for a second.

1682
01:02:53,840 --> 01:03:00,440
If.NET Core, Visual Studio Code, all of those things

1683
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,640
have been brewing in the background for years, four

1684
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:08,200
years, and then PowerShell Core comes out, another four years.

1685
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,280
And now we've heard of this, Azure Sphere

1686
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,680
using a Linux kernel, about four years in development.

1687
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,320
Something big happened at Microsoft.

1688
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,360
Well, we know what happened, but four or five years ago,

1689
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,440
all those stories about Satya taking over,

1690
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,960
we heard about the top echelon of management getting reorged.

1691
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,800
But just like how it always goes,

1692
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,520
the actual worker bees down below,

1693
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,160
people that got moved, fired, shuffled around,

1694
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,560
we didn't hear about them.

1695
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,800
But that's where some of this work started,

1696
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,720
down in the bowels of Microsoft, where lots of reorgs

1697
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,360
happened that didn't make the headlines.

1698
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,520
And that's the hard part, we're having a hard time

1699
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,560
wrapping our heads around when it comes to how Microsoft is

1700
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,440
behaving now.

1701
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,080
It's because we've seen Satya, we've

1702
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,480
seen the top layers, because those

1703
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,880
are people on their websites.

1704
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,960
And when they make changes, they got to update the website.

1705
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,280
They make a press announcement.

1706
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,720
But when you're 10 managers down the chain,

1707
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,800
and you're working on some prototype product,

1708
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,640
and that doesn't make headlines.

1709
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,280
So it's a different Microsoft, too.

1710
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:05,540
So it's a Microsoft that's learned

1711
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:07,500
how to make money off Linux and open source,

1712
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,440
and it's a different internal beast

1713
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,000
that we haven't really learned yet.

1714
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,600
We have so many decades of experience

1715
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,200
with the old configuration.

1716
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,160
But now we're dealing with Microsoft in a totally

1717
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,520
different configuration.

1718
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,920
They're not as static of an entity

1719
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,760
as we want to think that they are, right?

1720
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,180
I mean, I feel like an old version of Microsoft

1721
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,520
would have figured out a way to cram NT on this,

1722
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,240
or would have crammed some BSD that they didn't even

1723
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,960
have to name on there.

1724
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:32,240
There just would have been a hard line.

1725
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,280
It's clear something deep down changed.

1726
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,160
Right, yeah, clearly the leadership doesn't object.

1727
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,160
There's not this entrenched resistance,

1728
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,680
at least it doesn't seem to be.

1729
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,180
And it doesn't feel like it's the light of Stallman either.

1730
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,360
It's just simply.

1731
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,560
It's just practical.

1732
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,960
You've got to wonder if they're sitting around the boardroom

1733
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,560
going, I wonder if we can make more money at this Linux

1734
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,000
stuff than Red Hat.

1735
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:51,840
Yeah, right.

1736
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,920
Do you think we could make more money than Red Hat?

1737
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:54,760
Let's give it a go.

1738
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,200
You know, that's what's going on.

1739
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,440
It's good old capitalism.

1740
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,720
And then we're sitting back going, what the hell?

1741
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:03,080
A Linux kernel, embrace and extinguish,

1742
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:03,920
embrace and extinguish.

1743
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,760
It's just reactionary.

1744
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,160
But maybe now we'll be seeing, you know,

1745
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,000
security-related patches flowing from Microsoft upstream.

1746
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,840
Who knows?

1747
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,920
Yeah, weird, weird.

1748
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,240
Yeah, especially if they start shipping a lot of these things.

1749
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,200
Going to be a lot of Linux kernels out there.

1750
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,200
How are they going to do 10 years of support?

1751
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,280
That's a huge commitment.

1752
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,240
I guess that's just something else

1753
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,320
I'd like to follow up with them is,

1754
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,560
are they going to run their own internal forks?

1755
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:27,880
Because you're going to have to do your own LTS.

1756
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,440
Or are they just going to be updated a lot?

1757
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,640
You know, is this going to be like a continuous deployment

1758
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,480
style?

1759
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,480
So they'll be on 5.0 in a few weeks.

1760
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,280
Maybe not that current.

1761
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:37,960
I don't know.

1762
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,120
I guess we'll have to wait and see.

1763
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,080
We also don't know quite what the licensing's

1764
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,760
going to be around the silicon yet.

1765
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,520
We don't know, like, what the, because they're

1766
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,560
going to also release the specs.

1767
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,840
We don't really have a clear picture.

1768
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,680
They said royalty-free, but we don't really

1769
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,280
have a clear picture.

1770
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,040
And all that.

1771
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,400
Like, will you be able to even design applications

1772
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,080
for it from Linux?

1773
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,400
We don't know.

1774
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,080
We don't know.

1775
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,560
All that is still to be determined.

1776
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,800
But it was something.

1777
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,360
It was really something to see that.

1778
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,940
I did not expect that story this week.

1779
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:06,200
Did not see that coming.

1780
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:06,800
All right, guys.

1781
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,220
Well, is there anything else we need to cover before we

1782
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:09,960
get out of here this week?

1783
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,600
Mention the Ubuntu podcast.

1784
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,400
We've got to do that, Ubuntu podcast.

1785
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,320
Go get more poppy and wimpy over there.

1786
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,320
Good show.

1787
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,560
And yeah, OK, go get more Westpane, techsnap.systems.

1788
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,120
How about that?

1789
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:20,640
Bam.

1790
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,880
Should plug our own stuff, too.

1791
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,040
I like it when we do that.

1792
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:23,640
OK, everybody.

1793
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:24,680
Well, we'll get out of here.

1794
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,520
Thank you for joining us.

1795
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,480
If you want to join us on a Tuesday, you're more than

1796
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:27,800
welcome.

1797
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,960
We do this show live over at jblive.tv.

1798
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,640
Usually, the live stream kicks off around 1.30 PM Pacific.

1799
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,520
You can get it converted to jupiterbroadcasting.com

1800
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,440
slash calendar.

1801
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,080
Then you hang out.

1802
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,400
You join us.

1803
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,760
And then kick back and enjoy the Yatsunoa show, which comes

1804
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,880
just right after this show.

1805
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,040
Bonus show.

1806
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:44,920
And then go get more.

1807
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:45,720
Just go get more.

1808
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:46,480
Just more JB.

1809
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,000
Always, more, always.

1810
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,600
There's more shows, linuxunplug.com.

1811
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,280
There's more there, jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1812
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:50,960
There's more there.

1813
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:51,520
There's always more.

1814
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,400
Tech Talk today.

1815
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,840
Yeah, Tech Talk talk today.

1816
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,960
All right, thanks for being here.

1817
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:10,440
We'll see you right back here, next, to, who, who, who, who's

1818
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:33,640
up next.

1819
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,800
Oh, you know, ironically, I think most people catch the

1820
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,120
show like on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

1821
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,600
So I really shouldn't say see you next Tuesday.

1822
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,040
Just see you next week.

1823
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:42,760
See you next week.

1824
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,040
What do we call this thing, guys?

1825
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,080
We covered a lot of things.

1826
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,720
Thank you, everybody, for contributing.

1827
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,480
I really appreciate it.

1828
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,960
I enjoyed the heck out of the show.

1829
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,000
Extend and extinguish.

1830
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:50,960
Boom, done, title chosen.

1831
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,280
Extend and extinguish, huh?

1832
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,360
That's not bad.

1833
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:57,160
That is not bad.

1834
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,000
I'm sure that would get a few clicks.

1835
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,320
I'm going to submit it.

1836
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,840
JBtitles.com.

1837
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,200
Go vote.

1838
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,520
Can you give me a bit of YouTube consultancy, Chris?

1839
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,560
Sure.

1840
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:16,520
Can you create multiple channels under a single, like, Google account?

1841
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,800
Yes, I have it.

1842
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,360
How the heck do you do it?

1843
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:24,360
What I've done is I have different Google accounts, and then I have them all logged in.

1844
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,480
You know, you can use a little switcher.

1845
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,720
That works better for me.

1846
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:32,520
Because then you can just go in and add them as managers to the individual YouTube channels.

1847
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,000
But yes, that's how I do it.

1848
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,880
So I have like a Jupiter, I have Chris at Jupiter Broadcasting.

1849
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:37,800
I have my personal one.

1850
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,720
And then we have a couple of, like, behind-the-scenes channels.

1851
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,520
Those are all different Gmail logins.

1852
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,840
And then I've logged into the browser, and I just switch up in the little YouTube thing.

1853
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:47,360
OK.

1854
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,720
But I don't want another Google account.

1855
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,600
So what's your trick, Bobby?

1856
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,120
I'm trying to figure it out, because I did it a long time ago.

1857
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:57,880
And I can see them both there in the Creator Studio.

1858
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,960
I think there used to be a way to do it through Google+.

1859
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:00,960
And I don't think you can.

1860
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:01,440
I don't know.

1861
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,400
There's some functionality that they used to do through Google+.

1862
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,560
They've removed now.

1863
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,880
And they haven't replaced it, but I can't remember what it was.

1864
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,480
Azure goes Linux.

1865
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,120
That happened a long time ago, though.

1866
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,240
Azure as a service.

1867
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,760
How much Linux is in that Windows?

1868
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,280
The bonds of Azure.

1869
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,000
It came from Redmond.

1870
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,960
What did I submit on your behalf?

1871
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:21,320
I forgot.

1872
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:21,880
You had something.

1873
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,120
Oh, yeah.

1874
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,480
Embrace and Extinguish.

1875
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:26,640
Maybe one called Lindows.

1876
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,680
The end of Embrace and Extinguish?

1877
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:29,520
Maybe.

1878
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,920
There was a new snap that I saw recently that I was surprised could actually

1879
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,360
be a snap.

1880
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,480
And I thought it was something more like at the system level.

1881
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,760
But now I can't remember what it was.

1882
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,920
You guys, does that remind you of any bells?

1883
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,680
It was pretty vague.

1884
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,160
But there was some new snap I saw go across the news headlines.

1885
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,720
And it was like, that's possible?

1886
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,800
Notepad++?

1887
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,640
The Windows version of Notepad++?

1888
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,400
No.

1889
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,160
I'm not even kidding.

1890
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,800
That is the fastest growing snap right now.

1891
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:54,440
Really?

1892
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,480
I'll give that a go, actually.

1893
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:02,600
Snap install Notepad-the-word-plus-the-word-plus.

1894
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,400
It's pretty interesting that you can like.

1895
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,040
And I know the first thing everyone's going to shout at me

1896
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:12,800
is the Flatback guys did this with games

1897
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,160
and chucked them on the pirate bay, bundled wine

1898
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,920
and a game, dodgy pirated copies of games.

1899
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,520
OK, yes, I know they've done it before.

1900
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,840
But this is like the first time we've had a legitimate application bundled

1901
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,840
with wine in the Snap Store, because it's an open source application.

1902
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,720
It's not some proprietary.

1903
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,000
It's not like someone took Photoshop and bundled it with wine

1904
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,120
and shoved it in the store.

1905
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:35,200
This is a GPL application that's been bundled with wine

1906
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,240
and put in the store.

1907
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:39,320
It's a weird one, but it turns out it's a popular application.

1908
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,520
And so people install it.

1909
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:45,040
And it got me curious as to what Windows applications that you

1910
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:50,040
miss from Windows that are not proprietary, which is a tricky one,

1911
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:53,040
would you want available as a Snap?

1912
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,520
I can only think of commercial ones, you know?

1913
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,960
Because that's the only thing I use Windows for.

1914
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:01,120
If I want to use free software, I just use Linux.

1915
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,800
The lunatic in me thinks we should bundle wine and Steam inside of Snap

1916
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,600
just for the lulz.

1917
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,720
Yeah, totally.

1918
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,640
Yeah.

1919
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,400
Let me change topics here for a second, because I

1920
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,200
want to pick your guys' brain.

1921
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,760
I have a little birdie telling me that an XPS 13 review unit

1922
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,640
may land on my doorstep in the next couple of weeks.

1923
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,680
Is that now we've finished with it?

1924
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:25,520
Yeah, it's probably your used one, Poppy.

1925
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,080
I was very good with it.

1926
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:30,680
I polished it and wrapped it all up just like it was new.

1927
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,600
Actually, it may be.

1928
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,160
Like, is there any identifying marks on there I should look for?

1929
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,880
Was it a high DPI or a standard?

1930
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,680
I can't remember.

1931
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:37,760
I think you got the standard.

1932
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,800
Have you not listened to our amazing review?

1933
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,000
I did, but I seem to recall you got the standard DPI screen,

1934
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
but I don't remember for some reason.

1935
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
We got the best model, in my opinion.

1936
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:54,000
So we got the one with the 1080p screen, but with the 16 gig memory uplift.

1937
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:02,240
My personal opinion is on the XPS 13, that 13.3 inch display, 1080p, super crisp,

1938
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:06,680
and then you get the benefit of the enhanced battery endurance

1939
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:11,000
using that 1080p display rather than a UHD display.

1940
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,320
I think I should ask for that.

1941
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,280
This is a thin one with only USB-C ports.

1942
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,880
No, I think it has regular ports still.

1943
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,520
It just has USB-C in addition.

1944
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,360
They're not monsters.

1945
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:23,120
Well, I mean, there are more USB-C ports, and they're very, very thin.

1946
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:23,960
It is those things.

1947
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:24,480
That's true.

1948
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,000
Those are true statements about it, but I'm looking forward to it.

1949
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,840
I'm just kind of figuring, like, what's a new take on a laptop review?

1950
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:31,640
That's what I'm trying to think of.

1951
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,320
So if you guys have any ideas, let me know on a new take.

1952
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,240
I'll probably try all the different smattering of distros and different

1953
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,760
functions, but take it to the beach.

1954
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:40,560
Take it to the beach?

1955
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,000
Yeah.

1956
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,560
Take it to the beach.

1957
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,520
Work a day at the beach.

1958
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:43,960
Yeah.

1959
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,000
Definitely trackpad.

1960
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,120
Yeah, definitely trackpad.

1961
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:46,720
Yeah.

1962
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,280
I'm just curious.

1963
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,320
We have time to think about it.

1964
01:12:49,320 --> 01:13:05,360
I think it'll be a few weeks, but if people have ideas, I'd love to know.
