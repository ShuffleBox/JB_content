WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
Before we start the show we have been following this world without linux series that the linux foundation has been putting out

00:05.800 --> 00:10.600
We skipped a couple of episodes, but the last one that came through west this one. I think is a big deal

00:10.600 --> 00:13.480
I think this is the one right so let's play a little bit of this

00:13.480 --> 00:17.340
So this is that the world without linux episode 5 by the linux foundation

00:22.360 --> 00:26.680
Hello world, this is Annie coming to you from the International Space Station

00:26.680 --> 00:29.880
Follow me, and I'll take you on a little tour. Oh

00:30.680 --> 00:38.200
Boy here we go again as you can see we're having a few computer glitches. They're probably running windows running windows

00:40.560 --> 00:42.680
Through this door you'll see that

00:42.680 --> 00:54.680
I believe it Houston we have a problem our pod bay doors won't open copy. This is Houston try asking super nice, maybe

00:57.200 --> 00:59.200
This is embarrassing

00:59.520 --> 01:01.520
Open the pod bay doors Hal

01:02.160 --> 01:06.400
Please I'm sorry Annie. I'm afraid I can't do that

01:06.400 --> 01:11.880
a world without linux and in a world without exploration

01:11.880 --> 01:15.080
Listen, I'll upgrade your RAM and give you three bitcoins come on

01:15.080 --> 01:19.080
Wow, I'd like that a world without linux is hard to imagine

01:19.840 --> 01:22.800
Thanks to hundreds of thousands of individuals and companies who support linux

01:22.900 --> 01:28.320
We don't have to learn more and help support linux today one small step for mankind

01:28.320 --> 01:36.940
Hashtag world without linux all right, I think that's by far the best one yet. That was good

01:36.940 --> 01:41.580
I enjoyed that one a lot, and you know what else I like linux in space yeah

01:41.580 --> 01:57.180
This is Linux Unplugged episode 123 for December 15th, 2015

02:00.380 --> 02:06.260
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly linux talk show that already has your gift picked out. My name is Chris

02:06.260 --> 02:08.540
My name is Wes. Hey there Wes guess what?

02:08.540 --> 02:14.900
Big show. Oh big show today. My favorite 123 just it worked out great

02:14.900 --> 02:19.060
We have some great friends of the show they're coming on to talk about their projects and what they have going on

02:19.500 --> 02:26.580
Coming up towards the first half of the show. We're going to go through some major updates AMD huge new initiative

02:26.940 --> 02:29.580
Huge and we're going to break it down for you right here on the show

02:29.580 --> 02:34.540
I'm going to do a little bit of follow-up on my kde review, then we're going to get in and talk about ubi con

02:34.540 --> 02:39.820
What is that? What is it? Why is it exciting and why can you actually possibly attend?

02:39.940 --> 02:47.100
We'll discuss that and then later on in the show the Minecraft project has some big updates some official partnerships some nice hardware tweaks

02:47.180 --> 02:53.340
So we'll talk to Ryan from the Minecraft project to get it right from the horse's mouth about what's new and then towards the end

02:53.340 --> 02:55.180
of the show

02:55.180 --> 03:00.220
Ladies and gentlemen I am happy to announce the eventual death of Google Docs

03:00.220 --> 03:06.980
Libre office and own cloud have teamed up to bring us something we have all wanted for so long

03:06.980 --> 03:12.900
We're talking about that plus own cloud has a new hardware partnership coming up that may put own cloud in the homes of the average

03:13.020 --> 03:16.180
consumer a Western digital own cloud combo unit

03:16.660 --> 03:23.220
That's not the interesting part though the interesting part is you can get the prototype in your home built around a Raspberry Pi running Linux

03:23.220 --> 03:26.540
In the next couple of weeks, we'll tell you the information coming up in the show

03:26.540 --> 03:30.580
Big show today West huge show. Yeah, it's very exciting. So let's kick it off

03:30.580 --> 03:33.660
Let's bring in our virtual log time appropriate greetings mumble room

03:38.020 --> 03:42.260
Listen to that. Oh boy. That is a showing right there. Hello everybody. Hello

03:42.260 --> 03:46.860
Hey a couple of interesting things to get into real quick before we get into all the main content

03:46.860 --> 03:50.620
as a couple of threads we've been following over the year here in Linux unplugged and

03:50.620 --> 03:57.380
And one of them is my continued quest to get my freaking Librem 15 purism laptop

03:57.380 --> 04:00.060
Where the F is it? I don't know but they do have a news update

04:00.420 --> 04:07.860
Cubes OS will be shipping pre-installed on purism security focused Librem 13 laptop, which you won't get but if you did it'll be very secure

04:07.860 --> 04:12.740
I oh boy. I don't I don't know what to say. So let's start with cubes OS

04:12.740 --> 04:18.540
That's the security focused operating system that Snowden said back in November was his favorite distro of choice

04:18.540 --> 04:26.380
He's really excited about it. And this week the laptop maker purism says they'll ship their privacy focused Librem 13 notebook with cubes pre-installed now

04:26.380 --> 04:33.140
This is a distro that uses Zen to basically isolate each application into its own virtual machine and

04:33.660 --> 04:40.140
It supports vert fedora Debian and Windows 7 VMs and probably a bone too because they'd be crazy not to I mean

04:40.140 --> 04:42.140
How can you not right? Yeah, so

04:42.380 --> 04:47.180
It is an interesting idea West you got this super security focused laptop. They got a little video here

04:47.180 --> 04:49.180
I can play just a little bit to kind of give you an idea

04:49.220 --> 04:57.140
13 by purism a 13.3 inch laptop computer built chip by chip to respect and protect your privacy chip by chip

04:57.140 --> 05:03.400
You're ready and for you right now. You are vulnerable to adversaries stealing your personal data. I do not want that

05:03.900 --> 05:06.940
The laptop's goal is to keep you safe

05:07.220 --> 05:14.260
It marries the best software certified by security privacy and freedom experts with a slim and beautiful design

05:14.260 --> 05:17.820
All right, so let's break it down. Here's the thing that I don't like about this

05:18.500 --> 05:24.460
Two things right off the top of my head. Who's your target audience is your target audience the technical Linux user?

05:24.460 --> 05:25.700
Who knows what the hell?

05:25.700 --> 05:31.220
BIOS is and knows why a computer built around Linux is a good thing or is your audience the person going into Best Buy?

05:31.260 --> 05:33.700
That's heard about cyber hacking from CNN

05:33.700 --> 05:39.980
And and I honestly don't believe the second is their audience at all because the second is gonna be buying from name brands

05:39.980 --> 05:46.900
They've actually heard of before just the way the markets worked for the last 30 years no change there because that's no change in consumer behavior

05:46.900 --> 05:52.760
So this is obviously a product directed at Linux users, and that's why they're seeking the free software foundation certification

05:52.800 --> 05:55.740
That's why they're working on really targeting Linux users

05:55.740 --> 06:01.020
That's why they did a crowdfunding campaign because they know their audience is a technical audience and yet

06:01.020 --> 06:04.820
They pedal this stupid shit like cubes OS not that cubes isn't a bad OS

06:04.820 --> 06:07.100
But let's be honest if I'm your typical Linux user

06:07.100 --> 06:11.700
I've been using Linux for a couple of years and now I recognize the value of having a Linux focus laptop that's designed well

06:11.700 --> 06:16.260
I'm probably gonna want to run standard Linux distributions with standard Linux desktops

06:16.260 --> 06:18.100
So I can do my everyday job

06:18.100 --> 06:21.700
So first of all it doesn't really make a lot of sense to be investing in an operating system

06:21.740 --> 06:24.060
And they had purism OS before now

06:24.060 --> 06:29.020
They're doing cubes OS that doesn't make a lot of sense to me to begin with at this sales pitch

06:29.020 --> 06:31.340
They're doing where you are constantly under attack now

06:31.340 --> 06:37.540
You are vulnerable to adversary stealing your personal data for their game that's scare tactic to sell your product

06:37.540 --> 06:42.140
Which isn't gonna work to Linux users because Linux users already know they're not vulnerable to that kind of stuff in nearly the same

06:42.140 --> 06:45.500
Scale that we've already researched all of this. I mean yeah, they're target audience

06:45.500 --> 06:50.460
So I I continue to not quite get who purism is targeting and I continue

06:50.700 --> 06:56.500
after over a year in change and I honestly haven't looked because I will become enraged if I look but I paid the money and

06:56.500 --> 07:02.100
I still in December of 2015 do not have my laptop

07:02.100 --> 07:07.440
So what the hell how about you focus on shipping to the people that backed your project and you stop worrying about

07:07.700 --> 07:11.060
Creating some custom super ultra secure environment because newsflash

07:11.060 --> 07:14.420
You know what 90% of people are gonna do when they buy that laptop

07:14.420 --> 07:19.660
They're gonna format install Ubuntu or some other distro. That's what's gonna happen, so I

07:20.340 --> 07:22.100
I don't know wimpy

07:22.100 --> 07:23.660
I want to hand it over to you to hear your thoughts

07:23.660 --> 07:27.380
And I am I am I am now at a point now where I think maybe I've been scammed

07:27.380 --> 07:34.660
maybe I'm never gonna get my laptop and and I don't understand why the project is focusing on these things and the way they talk makes

07:34.660 --> 07:40.340
It sound more official than it really is and that makes me uncomfortable. I'm curious what you think if maybe I'm overreacting

07:42.680 --> 07:51.100
No, so I'm gonna try and underreact because I've been very skeptical about purism for a very long time and

07:51.100 --> 07:53.580
I

07:53.580 --> 07:55.580
Don't want to

07:56.260 --> 08:01.380
Sort of torpedo what they're trying to do because on the face of it. It's a good thing to do

08:01.380 --> 08:06.920
That's why I back sell cell free and open source software in order to a better protect

08:07.180 --> 08:13.060
Computer and and also to design really really nice custom built hardware for Linux

08:13.060 --> 08:19.060
Yeah, but that's the first thing so the custom built hardware. That's simply not true. There's nothing custom about the

08:19.060 --> 08:24.460
Librem computers. There are other OEMs that have been selling that hardware platform

08:25.340 --> 08:30.180
To customers that have got them in their hands that have been using them for nearly a year

08:30.580 --> 08:34.180
So that that whole chip chip to chip design thing

08:34.180 --> 08:38.680
I don't buy it and the other thing is is that if it was chip to chip

08:39.260 --> 08:44.620
Why would you choose chips that don't work with Linux like for example the Bluetooth adapter?

08:44.620 --> 08:51.060
So if you're getting a Librem don't expect Bluetooth to work because there's no kernel driver for the Bluetooth chipset that they've chosen

08:51.060 --> 08:52.980
Oh, that's little things like that

08:52.980 --> 08:58.940
Oh don't expect the trackpad to work or maybe expect the trackpad to work because I was good enough to point them

08:59.420 --> 09:03.940
at some source code for Linux kernel drivers, which by the way, they didn't contribute back to

09:04.540 --> 09:06.840
To the to the originating sources. Oh

09:07.340 --> 09:12.160
So there are there are things about purism that I'm not super enthusiastic about

09:12.160 --> 09:18.380
and I've been testing PureOS over the last couple of days and maybe anyone out there who has

09:19.080 --> 09:24.000
Purchased purchased backed. I'm not quite sure what the correct term is, you know

09:24.680 --> 09:31.280
Purism needs to go and try PureOS out and decide whether that's the operating system that you're going to go with when when your laptop

09:31.760 --> 09:33.760
Hopefully turns up

09:34.160 --> 09:35.480
hmm

09:35.480 --> 09:38.640
Yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't choose to run it as my day-to-day

09:38.640 --> 09:43.320
Well, I guess you know on the surface you're right wimpy though. Your point is valid

09:43.320 --> 09:49.260
I I really love the idea of something that is a genuine solution to some of the security problems

09:49.260 --> 09:51.260
We have an application isolation

09:51.280 --> 09:53.280
essentially protects you from application vulnerability

09:54.040 --> 09:58.960
Assuming the Zen hypervisor and the kernel that it's all running under are secure. It's at least more isolation

09:59.680 --> 10:06.620
But this wasn't something that was planned because there was no talk of using cubes a year ago

10:06.620 --> 10:08.620
Suddenly, there's a big interview

10:09.220 --> 10:16.620
With Edward Snowden about four weeks ago, and then a few weeks later purism are now working with cubes

10:16.620 --> 10:20.980
And I'm not saying that technically that is not a bad a bad idea

10:20.980 --> 10:22.980
I want to actually expand on your point there

10:22.980 --> 10:28.180
Don't try and introduce in that into your first generation project that you've been planning and working on for the last 12 months

10:28.180 --> 10:29.180
It's disingenuous

10:29.180 --> 10:33.180
Go with what you've got now and work with cubes in your next iteration

10:33.180 --> 10:38.980
Here's what it says in the Ars Technica article, which actually feels like rewriting history to me

10:39.540 --> 10:45.740
Purism has worked closely with cubes developers since before the laptop manufacturers successful crowdfunding campaign

10:46.580 --> 10:50.020
Really which raised a combined it goes into 80,000

10:50.020 --> 10:52.020
I'm sorry 800 thousand dollars that they raised

10:52.340 --> 10:56.940
Purism manufacturers own their motherboard and all of the chips are designed to run free software

10:56.940 --> 10:59.740
They'll even also ships with hardware kill switches for camera microphones

10:59.740 --> 11:06.460
Todd weaver purism founder who I've talked to many times personally says he has an uncompromised vision to offer free as in freedom laptops

11:06.940 --> 11:10.900
Now they but see the way they talk about this is they and I'm sure it's great for cubes, too

11:10.900 --> 11:14.340
And I I have massive respect for Joanna and everybody who works with cubes

11:14.340 --> 11:19.980
Yes, I mean, I mean I deeply have a like some of the people I respect the most in in the industry, right?

11:20.420 --> 11:22.660
But I and I'm not deterring

11:22.660 --> 11:26.240
I'm not taking away from cubes at all because I think it is really cool

11:26.240 --> 11:33.040
But what I don't buy into and what I am taking issue with is this sort of sales pitch in this Ars Technica article

11:33.040 --> 11:37.120
I'm not blaming ours either because Todd's Todd is Todd's great to talk to

11:38.440 --> 11:41.080
It basically says that they've been working with cubes since before

11:41.960 --> 11:46.960
The the crowdfunding campaign was even successful. Well, if that's the case then why was there ever purism OS?

11:47.160 --> 11:49.800
Why was that ever you haven't heard about this before? Yeah

11:50.640 --> 11:52.320
It just doesn't it just doesn't add up

11:52.320 --> 11:56.100
I'd love you know, and Todd has a has an open invitation by the way to come on the show

11:56.100 --> 11:58.100
He's been on the show before living so unplugged. So

11:59.640 --> 12:01.880
Todd if you'd like to come on explain it to me, especially somebody

12:02.520 --> 12:07.040
Here's my understanding when I talked to Todd at OS con a year ago

12:07.980 --> 12:13.520
He told me that he he personally knew where my laptop was and he personally knew I'd beginning in November

12:14.360 --> 12:19.800
That was in person at OS con is what he told me face to face. So I it's December

12:19.800 --> 12:24.800
It sounds like you need an update and I could really really use that laptop and I don't have the money to buy a new

12:24.800 --> 12:28.040
One and yeah, Mark's you've been wanting to jump in on this. Go ahead

12:29.400 --> 12:36.680
Yeah, I mean I've been kind of watching this in the background for a while and the feeling that I've always got from from

12:36.680 --> 12:39.840
Librem is that they basically when they launched the crowdfunding campaign

12:39.840 --> 12:45.920
They thought the problem is that no one is investing money in getting the the firmware

12:45.920 --> 12:53.040
support that you need for these chips in in an open source way and all they needed was to raise the money and then they

12:53.040 --> 13:00.600
Could get it all sorted and they'd have all of the the code you needed written or convince the manufacturers to write it

13:00.600 --> 13:02.160
Yeah for them

13:02.160 --> 13:06.080
but basically it's turned out that it's harder than that and now they're kind of

13:06.760 --> 13:09.680
Floundering a bit and trying to save face and not say no, it's impossible

13:09.680 --> 13:13.700
They're still putting out these videos and saying oh now you need to look out for your privacy

13:13.700 --> 13:16.480
And we're the only ones who can protect your privacy and you know

13:16.480 --> 13:22.320
the reason that you're now you're feeling like you're being scammed because you've not got what you've paid for but

13:22.600 --> 13:28.880
They they I suspect they probably thought that they would genuinely be able to give what you were paying for

13:28.880 --> 13:31.340
Sure, and now they found it's harder than they expected

13:32.000 --> 13:37.240
So not to put you on the spot Ryan, but as somebody who's just recently gone through the crowdfunding thing

13:37.280 --> 13:42.400
Do you feel an intense pressure to deliver on exactly what you committed to or do you feel like there's room to communicate?

13:42.400 --> 13:46.800
With your backers who are passionate about your project that things are harder than you expected

13:49.680 --> 13:56.160
Okay, so the deal from the beginning was we said that we were going to instead of opt for

13:56.720 --> 14:00.480
Putting things too far forward so that we had to keep pushing it back

14:00.760 --> 14:04.020
We were going to put it at a date that we were pretty comfortable with

14:05.640 --> 14:10.260
Hitting even if we had delays, so we built in a delay

14:10.260 --> 14:12.260
into our

14:13.060 --> 14:15.620
Schedule for when we'd get mycroft out to people

14:16.260 --> 14:18.260
We have a saying of

14:18.500 --> 14:20.500
under promise over deliver

14:20.620 --> 14:24.460
Thoughts on like oh man something comes up and now you know

14:24.460 --> 14:28.620
We've got a we've got a we've got to kind of just roll with it. And now we have to communicate this

14:28.620 --> 14:30.620
What what are your thoughts on?

14:32.100 --> 14:36.540
Immediately be upfront about it. Yeah, no pressure says Michael. Yeah

14:36.540 --> 14:43.620
um we would probably immediately go to every avenue that we had to communicate because we

14:43.940 --> 14:48.620
Have to as a new company and as an and we already took people's money

14:48.740 --> 14:53.300
We have to be as upfront as possible or else that would be the end of us

14:53.300 --> 14:56.820
I think here's the disconnect for me and the purism project and other projects

14:56.820 --> 14:59.100
I've backed in the past if you are sir

14:59.100 --> 15:01.820
If you're going to a certain technically affluent audience

15:01.820 --> 15:09.260
Then that audience also generally is able to recognize the scope of tasks you are trying to take on and that is at the core

15:09.260 --> 15:15.700
Of the very reason they are giving you money because they recognize holy shit. You are trying to do something. That is incredible

15:15.820 --> 15:17.660
Let me give you money, right?

15:17.660 --> 15:20.800
That's a big thing and so those are people who are deeply

15:21.060 --> 15:28.140
invested in the future of that project and it seems likely to me that those would also be the people most likely to best receive

15:28.140 --> 15:34.620
Hey, this is way harder than we thought but we're still totally working on it. We apologize. We can't meet the expectations

15:34.620 --> 15:41.020
Let us reset those for you and we will continue to clearly communicate those expectations that that is really what it seems like it takes

15:41.020 --> 15:46.820
To successfully manage a project that has been crowdfunded that is slipping a little bit because the very people that are backing you

15:46.980 --> 15:48.900
Acknowledge the fact that it's a difficult task

15:48.900 --> 15:54.300
I think that's more of it right there is that there's been this disconnect between and they promise so much freedom, right?

15:54.300 --> 15:59.420
And it the PR it sounds really good. That's what the casual Linux user wants home free BIOS

15:59.540 --> 16:04.180
But you're marketing to an audience of people who like researches this stuff, right and we can see like well

16:04.540 --> 16:07.860
That's really the same firmware. It's still closed and and that's fine

16:07.860 --> 16:11.420
Like if you can make a more free laptop if you can progress towards that goal, that's great

16:11.420 --> 16:16.060
But it's the same kind of like you need to understand your audience and you need to be clear with them at all steps

16:16.060 --> 16:20.120
Yeah, can I give you a little bit of a shout out to the purism crew?

16:20.120 --> 16:27.580
I would recommend that it that it's probably exactly what you described Chris and they've come across some technical challenges

16:27.580 --> 16:29.580
That are much harder than they anticipated

16:30.380 --> 16:32.380
What I would tell them to do is take your advice

16:33.020 --> 16:39.500
explain that to the community that's following them and then they might be just surprised to find that somebody within the

16:40.220 --> 16:45.780
Has a wealth of knowledge in that area in which they're hung up on it. If that is the case. Yeah

16:45.780 --> 16:51.980
I think we all want to see more well-designed Linux laptops. Definitely. Yeah, that's that's why I backed it

16:51.980 --> 16:56.700
We all want to see that and so if the answer is turns out it's a harder job than we thought that's a great answer

16:56.700 --> 17:01.820
Because that means you're really working super hard on it and you're not cutting corners. So I'd love to hear that answer

17:02.320 --> 17:05.640
Okay, so wimpy. I know you want to jump in here as we wrap up. Go ahead

17:07.220 --> 17:12.460
Yeah, I agree, you know, I I'm conflicted about purism I

17:13.300 --> 17:15.300
I

17:15.300 --> 17:18.380
Identify with their goals and objectives. I'm

17:19.260 --> 17:21.980
I've not seen anything to convince me that

17:22.700 --> 17:29.540
Something's not quite right with the way they've gone about this. There's a number of issues that they've not been upfront about

17:30.260 --> 17:36.020
But I've been testing out pure OS and the one thing that does stand out is the pure browser. Oh

17:36.700 --> 17:38.700
Which I think is really

17:39.380 --> 17:41.620
Quite good. So it's a rebranded

17:42.460 --> 17:44.460
Firefox that comes

17:44.460 --> 17:46.180
pre

17:46.180 --> 17:48.180
configured with a number of

17:48.540 --> 17:50.540
privacy enhancing

17:50.900 --> 17:57.540
Plugins and extensions so it is something you could you know create for yourself, but as an out-of-the-box experience

17:58.220 --> 18:01.180
It's quite nice. Well, let's be honest

18:01.180 --> 18:05.140
That's a huge that is a huge thing because a lot of us would love to be able to say buy this

18:05.140 --> 18:07.140
Yeah, and it's gonna be a great desktop for you. I

18:08.660 --> 18:11.880
Didn't say that I said the pure browser is very well, okay

18:11.880 --> 18:16.720
That's the goal though, right is we would love to be able to recommend a hardware desktop combo

18:17.240 --> 18:19.800
You know and and it's not that this isn't being accomplished today

18:20.200 --> 18:26.320
System 76 does it and you work with they start with an e I'm blanking for intro where enter aware

18:26.320 --> 18:31.320
They also create really great out-of-the-box Linux desktop machines. This is Dell is working on it now

18:31.320 --> 18:36.160
I mean, this is already beginning to happen in a big way and I think that that's the distinction between

18:37.720 --> 18:40.880
Simply providing Linux compatible hardware

18:40.880 --> 18:44.920
Versus a privacy and security focused

18:46.380 --> 18:52.840
Complete package there are people out there that are making Linux compatible hardware and selling

18:53.700 --> 19:00.920
Various flavors of Ubuntu and other distributions on it so you don't have to you know mess about you just get the full package delivered

19:01.160 --> 19:05.860
Purism are trying to go a step further with having the whole operating system

19:05.860 --> 19:11.940
Augmented in such a way that it is it is geared towards protecting your privacy, which is great

19:11.940 --> 19:12.260
Yeah

19:12.260 --> 19:19.660
and I think that maybe they should have focused on that part of it more than the whole operating system from the outset just

19:19.980 --> 19:26.300
Get the privacy components, you know button down because pure browser is a good example of of where they've done it, right?

19:26.540 --> 19:30.380
yeah, and I I you know, I would love to talk to somebody at

19:30.380 --> 19:36.340
At cubes because I wonder too if for desktop implementation if containers

19:37.340 --> 19:41.160
Might make more sense than entire VMs for applications

19:41.380 --> 19:45.460
We've reviewed cubes before on the show and the performance is pretty incredible if you have the right

19:46.060 --> 19:51.120
You know hardware the I7 or i5 stuff with the VMX and whatever whatever, you know

19:51.120 --> 19:56.820
Whatever that stuff is I forget now the VT D and VT DC and VT X so you can actually get direct access to hardware

19:56.820 --> 19:58.820
You can really have some serious performance

19:58.820 --> 20:00.380
but

20:00.380 --> 20:06.940
That does not the same as container ization and sandboxing which the other thing about that last thought and then I do want to move on

20:08.380 --> 20:12.980
Well, all right, is that unidentified is that is that Alex who's that who keeps coming up as identified?

20:12.980 --> 20:16.480
Let's talk about cubes because we should probably give cubes a mention. It is a badass. Go ahead

20:18.900 --> 20:20.900
Go ahead

20:22.140 --> 20:26.820
No, all right, maybe we just do it, you know what maybe we just do a whole thing on a whole segment on cubes

20:26.820 --> 20:29.940
That's fine. That might be interesting because I do want to move on because I want to get to

20:30.340 --> 20:35.100
Both of the con and the mycroft update. So we will you know what? Let's do this

20:35.260 --> 20:38.860
Let's continue this conversation in the post show if you remind me will you help me?

20:38.860 --> 20:40.260
I'm sure yeah. All right

20:40.260 --> 20:44.020
So I want to talk about something really huge that AMD has announced this week

20:44.340 --> 20:49.820
That is going to make it possible for developers that are currently creating application. I'm sorry games. I'm ahead

20:50.580 --> 20:54.780
Creating games for things like consoles like the ps4 that runs an AMD GPU and others

20:54.780 --> 21:01.700
I they they are creating an open-source technology that should theoretically make it possible for them to essentially have that type of experience

21:02.220 --> 21:05.900
Across the PC with access to the code projects up on github

21:05.900 --> 21:09.420
So I I am not because I don't follow this stuff very closely

21:09.420 --> 21:12.220
I am not familiar with what the hell they're doing and why it's a big deal

21:12.420 --> 21:17.020
so what I'm going to do and please apologize for a bit of the side diversion is

21:17.500 --> 21:22.220
I'm going to play a little bit about Nvidia game works because Nvidia game works is

21:22.220 --> 21:29.740
essentially a set of technology that developers can write to that works across the Nvidia cards things like physics and you know being able to

21:29.740 --> 21:34.500
Make certain particle effects that you can know you write to this and it's gonna work on all these Nvidia cards it gives them

21:34.500 --> 21:41.680
Essentially like an API to have effects across all this range of machines AMD is working on open source version of game works essentially

21:41.680 --> 21:44.960
We're gonna tell you more about that, but just so you kind of understand why it's a big deal

21:44.960 --> 21:52.580
I do want to play a little bit of Nvidia's video because it explains. Why this technology is awesome in

21:52.740 --> 22:00.420
Video game works pushes the limits of gaming providing a more interactive and cinematic game experience enabling next-gen gaming for current games

22:00.580 --> 22:07.900
We provide technologies like physics visual effects optics and a core SDK as well as game and graphic sample code

22:08.180 --> 22:12.740
We also provide tools to debug profile and optimize your game and graphics code

22:12.740 --> 22:15.020
Here are some of our latest technologies

22:15.660 --> 22:19.660
Nvidia flame works enables cinematic smoke fire and explosions

22:19.780 --> 22:24.940
It combines a state-of-the-art grid based fluid simulator with an efficient volume rendering engine

22:25.140 --> 22:31.260
The system is highly customizable and supports user-defined emitters force fields and collision objects

22:31.980 --> 22:37.940
Nvidia face works provides shaders for realistic skin rendering enabling skin subsurface scattering

22:37.940 --> 22:45.700
Which means that light not only reflects off the skin, but it also transmits through the layers of skin below the surface in addition

22:45.700 --> 22:50.340
We also support deep scattering simulating light transmissions through thin membranes

22:51.300 --> 22:59.260
Nvidia wave works allows realistic ocean simulation for interactive applications with full control over the look and feel from gentle ripples

23:00.040 --> 23:03.340
To a heavy storm-tossed ocean based on the Beaufort scale

23:03.340 --> 23:09.500
The energy-based surface foam simulation is locked to and driven by the underlying spectral simulation

23:10.420 --> 23:15.300
Physx flex is a particle based simulation technique for real-time visual effects

23:15.740 --> 23:22.740
It'll be introduced as a new feature in the upcoming physics SDK version 3.4. All right, so you get it, right?

23:22.740 --> 23:25.980
It's a series of stuff that developers can expect to just work for them

23:25.980 --> 23:30.060
And I thought who said it in the chat room. Somebody had just nailed

23:30.060 --> 23:34.020
I think it was like techno techno dragon says Nvidia deliberately cripples their drivers

23:34.020 --> 23:40.460
He says he hates Nvidia and game works as a stranglehold on gave on the game development community, and it's disgusting

23:41.100 --> 23:48.280
Well, his passion is exactly what I've been feeling as I've been doing some research into this so today our AMD announced GPU open

23:48.280 --> 23:51.660
And it's their open-sourced gaming development now

23:51.660 --> 23:54.480
This is actually pretty nice as part of AMD's recent

23:54.480 --> 24:01.920
Summit the company released information about a new initiative to help drive development and evolution in the world of gaming called GPU open as

24:02.040 --> 24:05.560
Name implies the idea is to use open source mentality for drivers

24:06.040 --> 24:11.600
libraries SDKs and more now the idea here is the developers look at direct access to code and

24:12.280 --> 24:20.040
It's the the promise is to solve the problem of developers wanting to write their games for multiple platforms multiple systems

24:20.040 --> 24:25.840
AMD believes that many developers are sick of black box development environments

24:25.840 --> 24:29.760
They're having a negative effect on the PC gaming environment the black box mentality means that developers

24:29.760 --> 24:36.560
Don't have access to the source code of some of the packages and thus cannot tweak performance and features to their liking

24:37.240 --> 24:40.320
GP open is going to be direct access open software

24:40.800 --> 24:42.600
using industry standards

24:42.600 --> 24:47.960
AMD's GPU open is the solution to the problem offering unprecedented access to the GPU through API's and SDKs

24:47.960 --> 24:53.920
Starting and cultivating open source software suite that includes effects tools libraries and SDKs and inviting participation

24:54.440 --> 25:01.440
From other hardware and software vendors to add and modify all parts. They're going to have code up on github in January

25:02.840 --> 25:07.000
Which is very awesome? They're going to include a bunch of like different things like Nvidia has in game works

25:07.760 --> 25:10.400
like Liquid VR and Tres VX

25:11.480 --> 25:14.200
Firebase SDKs for impressive fire demonstrations

25:14.200 --> 25:20.880
They are specifically calling out that these are open source initiatives including a headless 64-bit Linux driver a

25:21.920 --> 25:23.760
driver that is

25:23.760 --> 25:30.200
Particularly particularly advantageous to Steam OS machines. They have a great graphic of the new AMD Linux drivers back this chart

25:30.200 --> 25:34.600
They specifically spent time in the presentation talking about their Linux drivers stack

25:35.480 --> 25:40.400
Their plans are basically this they have a revitalized take on the Linux software

25:40.400 --> 25:44.680
They say they're going to have broader out of the distro box support whatever the hell that is

25:44.680 --> 25:47.040
But that's actually what they call it out of the distro box support

25:47.440 --> 25:49.440
accelerated implementation of new products and features

25:50.120 --> 25:53.300
And will include community built innovations and improvements

25:53.300 --> 26:00.540
The AMD GPU package will be unified in both the closed and open source mode drivers keeping support and feature sets for all Linux users

26:01.120 --> 26:06.420
Seems like pretty big stuff now Wes. I'm curious because I am NOT a big AMD GPU user today

26:06.420 --> 26:11.540
This kind of s though makes me think well, maybe down the road I will be and when you look at this

26:11.540 --> 26:13.540
What stands out to you? What jumps out at you?

26:14.060 --> 26:17.740
Well first it's a lot of promises right? It's a lot of stuff will be delivered

26:17.740 --> 26:18.780
We'll see the code in January

26:18.780 --> 26:23.400
But you know they already have done a lot of stuff a lot of AMD GPU support has been merged into kernels

26:23.400 --> 26:26.740
You know that stuff is is coming along and I think that graphic is great

26:26.860 --> 26:33.380
Just kind of showing you that at least they're moving to a model where the core part in the kernel that that parts open source

26:33.380 --> 26:38.260
And they are working with the open source community on the open source open GL implementation

26:38.260 --> 26:38.580
Yeah

26:38.580 --> 26:39.060
Yeah

26:39.060 --> 26:45.380
on the open is the open source AMD GPU base graphics the open source UMDs for open GL multimedia and open CL and

26:45.380 --> 26:49.060
All of the kernel and runtime stuff is going to be all open

26:49.060 --> 26:51.320
Then they're gonna have a professional gamer driver

26:51.340 --> 26:57.300
Which you know what I think that's an interesting way to call it right and they're gonna. I think that's it so essentially

26:58.260 --> 27:00.700
If I'm understanding what their effort here is

27:00.700 --> 27:06.860
You could have a really great AMD GPU experience out of the box a year or so from now and maybe not even need to load

27:06.860 --> 27:11.100
The proprietary stuff right unless you have a specialized workflow. You know you're doing lots of scientific computations

27:11.100 --> 27:14.580
You're a high end gamer who wants you know 4k resolution right now

27:14.580 --> 27:21.020
I think that the 2d graphics on AMD in my experience they support multi monitors very well video acceleration works great

27:21.020 --> 27:24.500
You know you can get it installed x11 support out of the box and

27:24.980 --> 27:29.420
Now to see them working towards the future at they you know the the open CL and Vulkan drive

27:29.420 --> 27:35.740
Is gonna start closed source, but they say that they're gonna work to open source that so hopefully for the seizure with Wayland and Vulkan

27:35.740 --> 27:37.740
We'll have all open source. Yeah, but

27:38.260 --> 27:41.820
You know at least referring to this game work stuff. I think it's huge for the NVIDIA

27:41.820 --> 27:45.100
It really feels kind of like a micro an old-style Microsoft move right yeah

27:45.100 --> 27:49.700
Well the graphics hardware you can play the game on both, but oh you use our nice shiny libraries

27:49.700 --> 27:54.140
And you'll get all these nice effects for free, but only works on NVIDIA or at least only for four

27:54.140 --> 28:00.580
This is something that isn't you know isn't necessarily limited to AMD GPUs exactly let's go to the birthday boy, Mr. Westra

28:01.100 --> 28:03.900
You're sticking to Intel for best out-of-the-box support

28:07.620 --> 28:09.620
Mr.. West right, I'll hear you

28:10.060 --> 28:15.300
All right, well he's probably too busy eating birthday cake wimpy as somebody who's packaging a distribution

28:15.900 --> 28:18.460
This has to be appealing to you long term, right?

28:18.460 --> 28:22.380
Yes, I wish I was more conversant in the linguistics of

28:23.060 --> 28:24.060
Linux

28:24.060 --> 28:30.180
Video card drivers, but I'm not I just hope it all works and works. Well. Yeah, and that's what's important

28:30.180 --> 28:34.020
Yeah, I agree and that is exactly what my thinking is ww. I take it away

28:34.020 --> 28:36.180
I'm curious about your thoughts on the long-term

28:36.620 --> 28:41.220
You know looking back at somebody who's been messing with AMD drivers on Linux for a while and ATI drivers

28:41.220 --> 28:43.740
Is this got to feel kind of appealing to you?

28:43.740 --> 28:49.260
I think it is because as Tech Dragon said earlier in video

28:49.260 --> 28:57.020
It has a stranglehold on game works and on developers because their drivers have always been on point for game releases

28:57.020 --> 29:02.780
And supporting those games and optimizing them. That's why if it has such a stranglehold

29:03.420 --> 29:08.540
But in the issues have stemmed back to even before they

29:08.540 --> 29:14.780
ATI. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So and so even drivers back in the 90s were horrendous and didn't work

29:14.780 --> 29:21.100
Right all the time. So I'm hoping with what I saw about their crimson drivers for Windows and hopefully

29:21.500 --> 29:28.220
This will get AMD back on the right track with their video cards and maybe they'll be a lot more competitive than they are

29:28.220 --> 29:32.380
Now it's never been their hardware. It's been their software. That's been holding them back

29:32.380 --> 29:35.340
Yeah, and you know, I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing

29:35.340 --> 29:38.860
It's been their hardware. It's been their software that's been holding them back. Yeah, and you know

29:38.940 --> 29:43.420
Some people think that this is the prelude to AMD rolling out a totally new GPU

29:43.580 --> 29:48.540
Architecture and these drivers are sort of the building blocks you need and it could be super super cool

29:48.540 --> 29:54.220
Markz, I want to give you the last word as somebody who's also sounds like they've struggled with some package updates in the past

29:54.220 --> 29:55.820
What do you think?

29:55.820 --> 29:59.180
Yeah, I just hope that um that some of the uh the

29:59.900 --> 30:01.900
Not, you know, not the newest

30:02.100 --> 30:05.180
Like the ones they're just releasing when all this code is released

30:06.140 --> 30:09.480
Hardware is is supported in some of the new open source goodness

30:09.480 --> 30:15.240
And I really really hope that they the having this more stuff open source

30:15.640 --> 30:22.100
Allows them to sort out their their driver install an update process because at the moment it is just so painful

30:22.840 --> 30:28.460
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's that's true. And that's honestly if that is the best case scenario, then maybe I will start reconsidering

30:28.460 --> 30:31.860
ATR AMD video cards again, right?

30:31.860 --> 30:37.860
I mean if you can get great out-of-the-box open source support for like that'll work for 80% coverage at least right like right now

30:37.860 --> 30:38.660
I'm like Odyssey man

30:38.660 --> 30:42.820
I've been betting on Intel to just get better and better and better and better with the virus pro and hope for the best

30:42.820 --> 30:48.700
The the long-term computer user me who's been who's been building PCs, you know since forever now

30:49.300 --> 30:52.540
Since you could build PCs really which is kind of weird

30:52.540 --> 30:58.920
I know that the dedicated GPU in that entire history has always been more powerful and the

30:59.020 --> 31:03.700
That is always always going to be the case because that is a dedicated space for research development

31:04.220 --> 31:08.280
Implementation and you can modify you can replace without having to change your main CPU, right?

31:08.280 --> 31:10.220
Which just means over a period of years, you know

31:10.220 --> 31:11.460
You can interchange that part

31:11.460 --> 31:15.240
And so if that becomes the part that I can interchange is an AMD GPU

31:15.240 --> 31:20.140
That means it's easy for me to reload a machine. I get up and running very fast. I get my desktop effects

31:20.140 --> 31:22.700
I can play games it

31:22.700 --> 31:26.140
That's all it really takes for me to start buying AMD GPUs from here on out

31:26.740 --> 31:30.140
So like hardware's the hardware is perfectly capable. It's just you know

31:30.140 --> 31:35.260
Whenever I see an update is needed by hot sinks, and I know yeah a couple of hours

31:35.260 --> 31:38.140
Yeah, I'm messing around that has to change that has to change

31:38.140 --> 31:41.820
Yeah, only what 1% of users are willing to even consider doing that apparently

31:42.380 --> 31:46.060
Alright, so we can spend all day on this, but I do want to move really quickly

31:46.060 --> 31:55.340
so that way we can start talking ubi con I want to talk about KDE 5.1 or sorry 5.5.1, which came out today and

31:56.220 --> 32:00.620
Was it this is an amazing turnaround. So KDE plasma desktop 5.5.0

32:01.140 --> 32:05.100
Shipped like on Thursday last week and 5.5.1

32:05.660 --> 32:11.300
Shipped on Tuesday. So some seriously fast updates still running plasma 5 desktop as my main desktop

32:11.300 --> 32:16.620
we reviewed it in the Linux action show this past week lots of updates lots of fixes and

32:17.860 --> 32:23.020
Yeah, I'll keep running it for a bit and give you my take on it

32:23.020 --> 32:27.340
But yeah, they have I have I can't really think of another time where a desktop has been updated that quickly

32:27.620 --> 32:35.860
So there you go and interesting a bit of a dichotomy here, which I find to be perfectly exemplifies the Linux desktop experience

32:35.860 --> 32:43.700
without question if you want to be right up there with the latest stable plasma 5 desktop updates arch is a great

32:43.700 --> 32:45.540
distro to go with because

32:45.540 --> 32:50.660
Honestly 20 minutes after the news release that there's an update the packages are in arch

32:50.660 --> 32:57.100
I mean it is really something and and honestly, it's because I mean everybody everybody who's followed this for a while actually knows this a

32:57.300 --> 33:00.780
Lot of core devs for the plasma desktop are arch users

33:00.780 --> 33:03.900
So they are also the maintainers for the plasma 5 desktop packages

33:03.900 --> 33:10.980
So that's why it happens so fast just got its fingers kind of everywhere. Yeah, but it's it's funny because after I reviewed

33:11.700 --> 33:14.060
plasma 550 on an arch desktop

33:14.540 --> 33:17.300
Core devs came out and said oh, well, yeah, you're doing it on art

33:17.300 --> 33:23.180
So you're gonna have this problem and that problem and like really so the distro where you can get packages

33:23.320 --> 33:28.660
20 minutes after the release announcement is the distro where you get all of the weird oddities really?

33:28.660 --> 33:32.860
I mean, there's no great wiki those audit. I mean if the oddities are documented, yeah

33:32.860 --> 33:36.740
That's right. I mean then you know the one the one that really burns me that I I have

33:36.740 --> 33:38.740
I have gotten the most feedback on is

33:39.460 --> 33:41.460
under the plasma 5 desktop

33:41.700 --> 33:46.020
Ok, I'm just for those of you who don't like rants. This will be over about one minute

33:46.020 --> 33:49.300
I just got to write the timer this really upsets me and so I might get a little upset

33:49.300 --> 33:51.300
But I'm gonna try to keep it calm

33:51.980 --> 33:58.700
Ok, so the thing that really bothers me because it actually makes me want to crap my pants is on the plasma 5 desktop

33:58.700 --> 34:05.580
Applications keep changing my default system volume to 100% and I have seriously the world's loudest speakers

34:05.700 --> 34:07.740
Like they shake the house when they go off

34:07.740 --> 34:09.740
And so I'm death now

34:10.100 --> 34:14.780
Because every now and then I launch an application and then I go to close Kate or K right and I get it

34:14.780 --> 34:18.980
Would you like to save prompt and it is the loudest thing I've ever experienced in my life loads

34:18.980 --> 34:25.060
Yeah, it literally breaks glass it boom, right and everybody tells me hey Chris no bigs

34:25.060 --> 34:28.980
You just have to turn off auto leveling or whatever. It's called in pulse audio. It's a bug in pulse audio

34:28.980 --> 34:34.380
And the way the package maintainers installed it or the way they packaged it up. It's not actually a plasma 5 desktop issue

34:35.180 --> 34:36.400
Ok

34:36.400 --> 34:41.080
Completely except that I do not argue that fundamental fact at all

34:41.280 --> 34:46.300
Here's the thing and this is what I cannot wrap my head around and I get really upset

34:46.700 --> 34:49.220
Because like there's not a lot of things in my life

34:49.220 --> 34:53.540
I can brag about like I don't have a lot of things that like I can walk around and be like

34:53.540 --> 34:57.520
Yeah, I can tell I can I can say this, but here's one thing. I can't say heron. That's it, right?

34:57.520 --> 35:03.340
well that and the fact that I've literally used Linux on the desktop since the 90s and

35:03.700 --> 35:05.460
And I'm not on one computer

35:05.460 --> 35:10.540
But like on 12 computers and in certain periods of times hundreds of servers at a time

35:10.740 --> 35:17.180
Right across multiple different types of hardware architectures of multiple different desktop environments multiple different Linux distributions

35:17.580 --> 35:19.840
Since the 90s and then on top of that

35:19.840 --> 35:26.820
I have done two podcasts that closely follow the development of Linux software and one of them has been going on for ten years

35:26.820 --> 35:32.660
Like I'm not trying to brag but literally I am like super informed and super familiar with the subject matter, right?

35:32.660 --> 35:35.380
like hyper aware of the subject matter I

35:36.540 --> 35:39.460
Certify Chris I guess as a Linux desktop expert just for a second

35:39.460 --> 35:45.740
Like I I really don't know like there's probably only like I mean how many people literally have

35:45.740 --> 35:54.380
Years of experience like this. We're for ten years. You are on almost a weekly basis reviewing different desktop environments different Linux distributions

35:55.420 --> 36:02.680
Non-stop right and in all of these different configurations across multiple different hardware configurations and architectures across multiple different distributions

36:03.060 --> 36:05.180
multiple different desktop environments for

36:05.940 --> 36:09.660
1112 years. I don't know how long has it been since it's been 96

36:09.660 --> 36:16.500
How many years has that been you do the math? That's since pulse audio was ever shipped ever in a distribution ever

36:16.500 --> 36:20.180
I have used pulse audio since it literally ever shipped

36:20.180 --> 36:25.380
I have used it and I have never ever ever had this problem where my

36:25.620 --> 36:30.740
Applications automatically jack up the audio to a hundred percent while the application I'm presently using is using the volume

36:30.740 --> 36:34.820
I expected at so ie. I'm sorry. I'm getting upset, but it actually really does bother me

36:34.820 --> 36:40.580
I'm using Chrome and I'm watching a YouTube video and it's at 20% system volume which is about what I like to listen to

36:40.700 --> 36:43.500
because these speakers are very loud and then a

36:45.060 --> 36:51.540
Randomly, it feels like I go to close K right and it prompts me to close or save the document and the volume is

36:51.540 --> 36:53.540
at a hundred percent and it

36:53.980 --> 37:01.700
Devastates me and I do not understand why and I have never ever ever had this problem under any other desktop environment ever

37:01.700 --> 37:07.820
Except for the plasma desktop. I acknowledge there is a setting I can change in pulse config to turn this

37:08.540 --> 37:14.500
Leveling off I have never ever had to do that. So what I do not understand is the disconnect between

37:15.700 --> 37:20.620
Why I only experience in the plasma desktop and then when I go to talk about in a review everybody's like I've never had that

37:20.620 --> 37:24.740
Problem or I have it under every desktop like I if that is true

37:24.820 --> 37:29.140
This is fundamentally a problem with Linux. I cannot look at it any other way

37:29.140 --> 37:33.140
This is fundamentally an issue with developing desktop software for the Linux platform

37:33.140 --> 37:39.940
And if this is truly how end-users randomly experience different things that are completely unlike any other distro any other user

37:40.180 --> 37:43.980
Experiencing the desktop has ever seen that how the hell could you ever write an application for that?

37:43.980 --> 37:49.340
I can't accept that I have to accept there is something all of the other desktop environments are doing

37:49.540 --> 37:55.340
That plasma desktop isn't doing and because plasma desktop isn't doing it. I experienced the issue under the plasma desktop

37:56.020 --> 37:57.900
End of rant. I don't want to go on any further

37:57.900 --> 38:00.080
I don't want to talk about it. It's just

38:01.260 --> 38:04.500
Okay, I'm sorry big sigh Chris. Just get it all out. Thank you. Thank you

38:04.500 --> 38:08.440
It's just I I have gotten I've gotten like 130 emails about it

38:08.440 --> 38:12.440
There's like a huge threat in the Linux action show so I read it about it. I've gotten tweets about it

38:12.440 --> 38:17.760
I've gotten g-plus messages about it. I understand but what I'm telling you is I am coming from an

38:18.260 --> 38:23.420
Unfathomable amount of real-world experience that literally most of you out there that are telling me you don't have this problem

38:23.420 --> 38:29.820
Can't likely have unless you have been hosting the Linux action show for ten years and reviewing distributions at desktop environments on a weekly

38:29.820 --> 38:37.060
Basis and I doubt I doubt that is you and I'm just saying I have some standing in this and I am telling you it

38:37.260 --> 38:42.220
Only happens under the plasma desktop and I acknowledge that it is a core issue with the way the pulse

38:42.940 --> 38:48.520
Software was packaged for wherever I installed it under any distribution. I installed under I acknowledge that but somehow

38:48.520 --> 38:56.320
Those clever sons of bitches over at Gnome and an XFCE and open box and and all of the other desktops

38:56.600 --> 38:58.600
Are somehow?

38:58.680 --> 39:00.360
Solving this problem

39:00.360 --> 39:02.600
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. That's

39:04.120 --> 39:07.880
Now, you know, I'll just take those speakers off your hand if that might be the easy

39:08.640 --> 39:13.200
The reason why I got so upset as I thought I don't think I can ever review the plasma desktop again

39:13.480 --> 39:18.320
Because I just there is such a disconnect from my experience and the rest of the audience's experience

39:18.320 --> 39:23.060
That I feel like a d-bag at the end of it because like I I apparently

39:23.440 --> 39:27.920
Experienced stuff that nobody else really runs into and then like there's like two people and throw like oh, yeah

39:27.920 --> 39:34.040
I have that same problem and like but everybody else including core developers of KDE and everything or plasma stop by and tell me I'm

39:34.040 --> 39:36.040
wrong and it I don't know how to

39:36.560 --> 39:38.740
to match those two things up because I

39:39.520 --> 39:44.200
Just I'm apparently unqualified to review the plasma desk. You shouldn't even be allowed to run the plasma

39:44.200 --> 39:50.340
Apparently, so I I remove so here's what I'm gonna do if I ever if I ever review the plasma desktop again

39:50.400 --> 39:53.920
Please disregard all my thoughts on it and don't listen to that episode

39:53.920 --> 39:58.580
Okay, cuz that's that's just the only way to solve that problem apparently and that's all I have to say on that

40:00.760 --> 40:01.920
All right

40:01.920 --> 40:05.960
Now let's let's change gears. Let's let's move on to something more positive

40:05.960 --> 40:09.320
I just I'm not gonna I'm not gonna continue that thread in the Linux action show

40:09.320 --> 40:14.920
So I had to get it out here and and I didn't want to rip in anybody in in on the internet where people could quote

40:14.920 --> 40:18.800
My words I'll do it right here in the show. If you look at take my I mean no one listens to this anyway

40:18.800 --> 40:24.680
No, no bill ever hear this. So I'm safe to do here. This is a safe space. You know, it also is a safe space digital ocean

40:24.680 --> 40:29.340
That's where I want you to go to create your own droplet digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most

40:29.340 --> 40:34.780
Intuitive and easy way to spin up your own Linux written rig in the cloud, but use our promo code lat no not last

40:34.780 --> 40:41.420
Wes not last not last. I mean you could last digital you could that's fine. But then Noah gets so much credit

40:41.420 --> 40:45.100
Yeah, I can't I can't have that guy lives in Grand Forks. What's wrong with him?

40:45.180 --> 40:48.620
You got to use the promo code do unplug that'll give you a $10 credit

40:48.900 --> 40:53.920
You can try out their $5 rig two months for free. Yeah, $5 rig and you can start unless than 55 seconds

40:54.380 --> 41:00.360
You get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte. You say a terabyte a terabyte

41:00.360 --> 41:05.560
Here's here's what I'm thinking West. Oh, I don't know. I use 300 gigs maybe and you know what I do with the rest of

41:05.560 --> 41:06.440
that

41:06.440 --> 41:08.920
And torrent the latest Ubuntu Mate release. Oh

41:09.600 --> 41:13.840
Yeah, I give them a little extra help. I help them out, you know for $5

41:13.840 --> 41:17.880
You can get more than the Comcast caps that they're starting to put roll out around the country

41:17.880 --> 41:22.400
Don't start on Comcast and talk about a great way to work around things like caps, right?

41:22.400 --> 41:30.840
You know, I was I was following Cassidy the guy who works on the elementary OS project works at system 76 and he had a

41:30.840 --> 41:33.760
System he had a post on G plus

41:34.440 --> 41:37.040
About a new UI that digital ocean is rolling out

41:37.800 --> 41:42.440
To like Matt to create multiple droplets at once. Oh, it is so

41:42.960 --> 41:48.320
So cool. It is so nice. You know, the elementary OS project is

41:48.320 --> 41:52.360
Backed by digital ocean. I think they I did not know that. Mm-hmm

41:52.600 --> 41:55.840
So that's probably why he was up following what they're doing. They're working on some really cool stuff

41:55.840 --> 42:01.440
They have a very nice interface that allows you to manage your different Linux boxes and set them up and move them around the world

42:01.440 --> 42:05.280
And back them up and deploy applications take advantage of Docker containers

42:05.280 --> 42:10.900
They got the latest versions of Ubuntu fedora sent OS the Debian core OS

42:12.840 --> 42:18.100
Don't tell Alan I don't think he knows I don't I don't think he knows that man

42:18.100 --> 42:22.920
I love that interface, but what's really cool about the interface is the API. Here's what here I put it

42:22.920 --> 42:25.280
I asked here's the thing I need

42:26.240 --> 42:28.240
Go make a digital ocean

42:28.960 --> 42:30.960
manager applet thingy for the gnome desktop

42:32.160 --> 42:35.480
Use a digital ocean API once you make that I'm gonna switch back to know

42:36.560 --> 42:41.360
Yeah, cuz their API is super straightforward. It's well documented. There was a thread in the Linux action show subreddit saying hey

42:41.360 --> 42:45.520
Is there a thing cuz like for the unity desktop and for Windows and for Mac?

42:45.520 --> 42:50.480
There are little like you know like the little indicator little status bar icon

42:50.480 --> 42:50.760
Yeah

42:50.760 --> 42:52.840
You can get those for like Ubuntu and you can like

42:53.120 --> 42:59.040
Snapshot stop and restart and all that kind of stuff your digital ocean droplets because they're just using that API the gnome desktop doesn't

42:59.040 --> 43:01.680
Have that I got extension to do all kinds of zany things

43:01.680 --> 43:06.280
But you know if they don't do they don't manage my droplet so I ask the audience somebody go make that and then I'll switch back

43:06.280 --> 43:12.240
To know we're starting the countdown now. Let's see how long it takes the community mm-hmm digital ocean calm use the promo code

43:12.240 --> 43:16.000
Do unplugged go check them out go create a Linux machine up in the cloud. It's super fast

43:16.240 --> 43:22.820
And they got data centers in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam London in Germany and a brand new kick the NSA and the balls

43:22.820 --> 43:24.820
Data center right up there in Toronto

43:25.020 --> 43:30.440
Which I that's not it. That's not digital ocean saying that I'm just kind of surmising that based on the fact that it's

43:31.080 --> 43:35.400
Geographically it's in the north, but it's and it's on the same continent

43:35.400 --> 43:40.520
But yet it's outside the legal walls of the United States of America, and it's brand new so it's got

43:40.520 --> 43:49.080
Sweet pipes 40 gigabit e connections to each hyper visors their fastest SSDs yet because they're all SSDs digital ocean comm use the promo

43:49.080 --> 43:52.160
Code do unplugged and a big. Thank you

43:52.680 --> 43:54.680
to digital ocean for sponsoring

43:55.120 --> 43:56.200
Linux

43:56.200 --> 44:00.200
Unplugged man those guys whoa all right, so now let's talk to mr.

44:00.200 --> 44:03.160
Michael Hall community manager over there at canonical to tell us about

44:03.800 --> 44:09.080
Ubuntu's event of the year, and he brought along a whole cohort of compadres mr.

44:09.080 --> 44:12.440
Hall welcome to Linux unplugged and if you would introduce who you brought with you

44:13.240 --> 44:15.320
Well, thank you for having us on with me

44:15.320 --> 44:19.600
I've got Nathan Haynes and Richard Gaskin who are from the California local community

44:19.600 --> 44:25.000
And they've actually been the ones who have been running the ubu con in California for several years now

44:25.480 --> 44:28.120
So I'm actually I'm gonna talk a little bit about

44:28.440 --> 44:33.000
Ubu cons in general, and then I'm gonna hand it over to them to talk specifically about the big event

44:33.000 --> 44:35.640
Yeah, I mean I've heard I've been to the Ubuntu

44:35.640 --> 44:39.920
I've been to like the Ubuntu one summit way back in the day where it was like paired next to OSCON

44:39.920 --> 44:45.160
I've heard of virtual Ubuntu online summits. I'm not familiar with ubu cons

44:45.160 --> 44:50.280
So what is ubu con and is it only happening in California or is it something that's bigger than that?

44:51.400 --> 44:53.400
So if we go all the way back

44:53.400 --> 44:59.540
Um the Ubuntu community used to have two events every year called the Ubuntu developer summit these were big in-person events

44:59.560 --> 45:03.600
They have people from canonical people from the community all gather in one place

45:03.600 --> 45:08.560
We did that for several years. It grew really big really expensive got expensive so

45:09.240 --> 45:13.400
So a few years back we decided that we were going to take it online

45:13.640 --> 45:19.880
We're gonna do it all online over Google Hangouts and IRC and YouTube and whatnot so that everybody can participate

45:19.880 --> 45:22.040
And it doesn't cost us millions of dollars anymore

45:22.600 --> 45:29.440
That's a brilliant it worked really well for development planning which was on the surface

45:29.440 --> 45:35.140
What UDS was all about sure? But what we've lost was that human connection that social network?

45:35.360 --> 45:38.320
That you get by being in the same place with and Michael

45:38.320 --> 45:45.000
Don't you think like that was sort of like you only really figured that out by trying the virtual conferences because it's it's so easily

45:45.000 --> 45:50.100
You know you think today in in nearly 2016 with Skype or Hangouts, right?

45:50.100 --> 45:56.380
And and Google Docs and real-time collaboration with own cloud all these things make it possible to be really hyper connected

45:56.380 --> 46:00.640
So we can all meet in virtual space from our from our bedrooms with our webcams

46:01.200 --> 46:05.920
It's something we've tried here at JB and we discovered yeah, that's good at a certain level

46:05.920 --> 46:09.440
But there is nothing like the collaborative environment that happens in person

46:10.840 --> 46:17.940
Yeah, it's something we started calling the hallway track because it was you know the communications that happen in the hallway between sessions or over

46:17.940 --> 46:19.440
lunch or at the bar and

46:19.440 --> 46:23.440
It turns out that there was a lot going on there outside of you know the regular

46:23.440 --> 46:27.280
Track sessions that we had that we were missing out on when we went online

46:28.040 --> 46:34.560
Sure sure yeah, and so is ubi cons sort of replacing these online dev summits is it supplementing? What's going on there?

46:35.080 --> 46:41.700
So ubi cons have actually been around before we went online ubi cons have been something that the community has been doing for a long time

46:41.700 --> 46:48.120
They're not canonical events. They're all grassroots from our local community. Okay, so these popped up like I said, Nathan

46:48.800 --> 46:52.020
Richard I've been working on the one in California for quite a while now

46:52.020 --> 46:54.020
there's been one in

46:54.220 --> 46:55.880
Europe and in

46:55.880 --> 47:01.460
South America and we've got some now in the southeast US they're usually co-hosted with other conferences

47:01.460 --> 47:05.740
So we get like a room in a day that we can dedicate just to a bunch of presentations

47:05.940 --> 47:11.580
Right, and you can also take advantage of folks that maybe already gonna be in the area for that other event, too

47:11.580 --> 47:14.580
Which is which is kind of brilliant from a budgeting standpoint for attendees

47:15.700 --> 47:18.380
Exactly, so these became kind of regional events

47:18.380 --> 47:22.660
They augmented the local team events which were per state or city or something like that

47:23.060 --> 47:27.740
So they're drawing a little bit bigger of a crowd and when we did take UDS online

47:27.840 --> 47:32.800
They really started to grow to fill that void that was left from not having those in-person events

47:32.800 --> 47:38.420
Sure, and so we've watched them grow in locations and in size. Also the one in California is getting really really big

47:38.820 --> 47:42.540
so we were talking with Richard and Nathan after the

47:42.540 --> 47:49.460
Ubu con from 2015 at scale about doing something much much bigger taking it up to to a big new level

47:49.700 --> 47:57.580
Getting more canonical involvement and more canonical resources to help grow that so that's what's become what we're now calling the ubu con summit

47:57.580 --> 48:01.540
So it's one big event where we're again pulling in people from all over the world

48:01.700 --> 48:04.380
We're sending a bunch of canonical employees there to talk

48:04.860 --> 48:09.760
Mark Shuttleworth is gonna have a keynote there. He's gonna be there for a panel also on the second day

48:09.760 --> 48:13.040
And so it's gonna be a lot of what we had at UDS. It's not going to be

48:14.000 --> 48:16.520
The development discussions. We're not going to be planning

48:16.520 --> 48:22.520
You know a bunch whose development because we still do all of that online much more frequently than we can do in person

48:22.760 --> 48:26.680
But it's gonna regain a lot of that human connection that we used to have. Yeah

48:26.680 --> 48:31.520
So let's talk about the actual event itself and Michael. I don't know if you you can you can pass this off

48:32.280 --> 48:34.200
but my question is

48:34.200 --> 48:37.240
What was it like getting something scheduled near scale?

48:37.240 --> 48:42.840
And what was the what was the basic logic there and what should people expect and let's start with why?

48:42.880 --> 48:47.960
Why near scale and the logistics in it and Michael maybe you can punt that to somebody from the yeah

48:47.960 --> 48:52.240
I'm definitely gonna put this to Nathan and Richard because they know all of those logistics a lot better than I do

48:52.240 --> 48:57.400
Yeah, great, and Nathan was the starter. So let's start with Nathan perfect Nathan taken

48:58.560 --> 49:01.280
So I was asked a few years back to sort of

49:01.280 --> 49:08.560
Start at this this EB con was a new new concept and I was asked to be one of the first people to do it

49:08.560 --> 49:11.480
as a sort of a mini convention all-day thing and

49:12.040 --> 49:14.340
so we approached scale since they're the

49:15.280 --> 49:21.680
Base, they're this little regional conference, but they're really the largest sort of first the year conference and

49:22.320 --> 49:27.160
they were really approachable and they said sure no problem got some sponsors paid for the room and

49:27.160 --> 49:32.780
We've got some people in there and I landed speakers and before I knew it

49:34.440 --> 49:37.500
You know the room filled up and then we had the hotel bring

49:38.000 --> 49:40.440
What that was sponsoring the conference or hosting conference?

49:40.440 --> 49:44.960
We had the hotel bringing more chairs and then those filled up me more chairs and then we were standing room only

49:44.960 --> 49:52.920
It's been a been a hit ever since and do you think do you think it's so I noticed the ubi con attendance 100% free

49:52.920 --> 49:57.520
But you guys are asking for folks to register. We'll have links in the show notes if they want to register

49:58.120 --> 50:02.060
But what I think is really smart here and I kind of want to get you to talk about this a little bit

50:02.060 --> 50:04.960
Nathan if you would is I mean, why why is it now?

50:04.960 --> 50:11.800
Why why write the day before a day or so before scale? Why is it so close to scale? And what's the goal there?

50:14.080 --> 50:16.080
Well scale is such a large

50:16.760 --> 50:19.320
Wonderful example of the open source community

50:19.320 --> 50:22.960
So you're basically the logic is it's bringing a lot of people to that area

50:24.720 --> 50:27.240
Well, that's part of it but the skill

50:27.960 --> 50:35.000
Atmosphere is really friendly. I like to say that scale is the best of a fan convention and a trade show all mixed into one

50:36.240 --> 50:40.240
So that I mean it the talks are fantastic. There's beginner level talks

50:41.040 --> 50:47.720
There's advanced sys admin talks. There's a youth track where you know kids and teens host the talks and

50:47.720 --> 50:49.720
hundreds of

50:49.800 --> 50:54.520
Exhibitors there. There's really something for every everyone and we wanted to do the exact same

50:55.640 --> 51:01.560
Environment and feel for EBC on as well because that really does sort of embody the you being two communities that everyone's welcome

51:02.120 --> 51:06.560
No matter sort of what you your focus is or what your skill level is. And so it was a

51:07.680 --> 51:09.680
Because skill had so much

51:10.440 --> 51:15.400
Experience running the convention. They were able to basically handle all the logistics for us early on

51:15.400 --> 51:18.960
So that we didn't have to do anything. It was really

51:19.560 --> 51:20.720
Wow

51:20.720 --> 51:25.680
They continue to amaze even even this year coming up for the next next about that's really great

51:25.680 --> 51:28.600
That is really awesome to hear them sort of doing that for you

51:28.840 --> 51:35.400
And I don't know maybe Nathan or somebody else who might be better to answer this but as a non day-to-day Ubuntu user

51:35.400 --> 51:38.000
I mean, I absolutely use Ubuntu on some on a few droplets

51:38.000 --> 51:41.480
I've got a few Ubuntu machines here, but you know as a non day-to-day Ubuntu user

51:41.880 --> 51:43.880
What would maybe I expect?

51:43.880 --> 51:47.180
Attending the summit what what would be sort of appealing to me?

51:49.240 --> 51:53.720
We have two tracks so depending upon your tastes we have something for you

51:54.440 --> 51:55.600
This year at Ubicon

51:55.600 --> 52:00.240
We're splitting it into two tracks where we have a track for users and a track for makers mostly

52:00.480 --> 52:02.800
application development and other types of DevOps stuff

52:03.480 --> 52:09.480
So you can look at the schedule we have and you can pick the tracks that fit your interests and there's probably something for everyone

52:09.960 --> 52:13.720
What a great idea. So it's like it's I mean

52:13.720 --> 52:21.200
Obviously, it's people making things and probably using Ubuntu, but it's like if you want to accomplish this goal this task make this thing

52:21.200 --> 52:23.600
Here's how you can do it under Ubuntu my tracking

52:24.520 --> 52:26.680
exactly, yeah, we have this maker track for

52:27.320 --> 52:32.920
Application development for desktop and mobile and snappy and now that that's rolling out that'll be over there

52:33.120 --> 52:39.240
But we also have a lot of community support Ubuntu. Ubicon rather has historically just been a community event

52:39.240 --> 52:44.000
Of by and for the community and we have a lot of people there who are fairly new to Ubuntu

52:44.000 --> 52:48.280
So we have the user track to help them get started find help resources and those sorts of things

52:48.640 --> 52:55.680
So how official of a canonical event is this this is not truly is this more of a loco kind of official event?

52:55.680 --> 53:03.320
Or is this a is this a canonical sanction aka sponsored or perhaps financed event? Mr. Halby's that may be better answered by you

53:03.320 --> 53:08.960
I think we both answer that so it is a community led event still it is still you know

53:08.960 --> 53:12.120
Richard and Nathan who are spearheading this we are

53:12.680 --> 53:19.440
Giving some financial support. We're also looking for some external sponsors to help pay for like the rooms that we're taking from scale

53:20.080 --> 53:22.240
The coffee breaks that we're gonna have during the day

53:22.920 --> 53:28.000
But we are we're investing more in it and it internally in canonical. It's an official event in that

53:28.000 --> 53:33.120
Engineering managers can send employees to it using their travel budget

53:33.120 --> 53:39.600
so we're gonna have I think somewhere around 30 canonical employees that are being sent to this either to speak or just to you know

53:39.600 --> 53:41.320
be there for the

53:41.320 --> 53:43.800
Unconference sessions that we're going to have also cool

53:44.400 --> 53:48.840
So if I want to attend I have to show up how many days before scale?

53:50.600 --> 53:51.880
You have to

53:51.880 --> 53:57.760
You should show up on the 20th because we're planning on doing a social event that evening of the 20th for people who are there

53:57.760 --> 53:59.920
The actual event starts on the 21st

54:00.160 --> 54:06.520
Okay, and you guys have like an Ubuntu promo code to get some some change off the scale full access pass, right?

54:06.880 --> 54:10.200
Yes, if you go to our registration page on ubucon.org

54:10.480 --> 54:12.880
There'll be two buttons one to register for

54:13.240 --> 54:16.000
Ubucon just so we know how many you know drink tickets and stuff

54:16.000 --> 54:21.200
we need to have at the parties and then another button to register for scale and if you use the

54:21.880 --> 54:26.020
Ubuntu and it's missing a letter because of their promo code system, but it's on the page

54:26.020 --> 54:31.580
You use that promo code and it's 50% of a mission to scale itself. I love it

54:31.580 --> 54:36.780
I really do everybody coming to ubucon to please register for scale. It helps support them, you know

54:36.780 --> 54:39.700
They're doing a lot for us. So we want to support them plus

54:39.700 --> 54:43.260
It's really an amazing show if you if you go to ubucon and you don't miss scale

54:43.340 --> 54:48.340
You're really missing out on something. But did I hear there's gonna be party a party because that

54:48.980 --> 54:52.580
That might be the censure for me Chris can never resist. I think I'm gonna have to go

54:52.580 --> 54:56.900
I think I'm gonna have to drive from Washington State to California to party. It will be

54:57.460 --> 54:59.460
takes to convince you you should definitely

55:00.580 --> 55:06.520
I've been going to scale. I've been going to scale for many years and I like to think of it as a vast learning party

55:08.460 --> 55:13.980
There are intense sessions from some of the finest minds in open source and at night there's parties

55:13.980 --> 55:18.340
There's game night on Saturday night at scale and then with ubucon

55:18.340 --> 55:23.500
We have the reception party Wednesday night and then another ubucon party Thursday night

55:24.020 --> 55:27.740
There's and you'll be meeting a lot of friends. You'll be making your own parties in between. I

55:28.420 --> 55:32.240
Like it. I like it. It is a good it sounds like a fun experience, you know

55:32.780 --> 55:38.300
Boy, I would love for some of you guys to also consider coming up to Linux fest Northwest because that is a it is

55:38.300 --> 55:42.380
A great show and one of the great things about Linux fest Northwest. It's getting really big

55:42.380 --> 55:48.460
But it's it hasn't tipped yet. So it has a genuine one-on-one community

55:48.460 --> 55:55.300
Like you can oh you talk you talk to the guy at Debian who is working on X or you talk to the person at Facebook

55:55.300 --> 55:59.420
Who's like the btrfs developer like it's just it's such a unique experience

55:59.820 --> 56:04.180
So I want to give a plug for Linux fest Northwest, but I'm thinking I'm thinking I should go

56:04.180 --> 56:06.180
What do you think West you think I should go to scale?

56:08.580 --> 56:10.580
For you a little bit more

56:10.580 --> 56:15.780
Both Ryan cipes from my crop and Alan Pope are going to be there. Yeah

56:16.260 --> 56:23.180
Yeah, you know actually being poppy being there alone is almost is almost enough to make me go actually poppy

56:23.420 --> 56:27.340
Are you planning to go to any other events throughout the year yet in the US?

56:27.920 --> 56:29.920
No, that's the only one I'm going

56:31.540 --> 56:33.540
I'm afraid. Oh

56:33.860 --> 56:39.820
Man, oh man, the pressure is on, you know, here's what I'm gonna do West is cuz I can't make up my mind

56:39.820 --> 56:40.620
You know

56:40.620 --> 56:45.180
I am I am horrible at making my mind I because I can bounce back and forth because part of me feels like I could

56:45.180 --> 56:48.580
Go to all the other conferences throughout the year and get what I would get at scale

56:48.580 --> 56:53.220
But then other part of me feels like this is actually with ubi con and the fact that everybody's gonna be there

56:53.220 --> 56:57.900
This is actually gonna be kind of a special thing. So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna let the audience decide

56:57.900 --> 57:02.780
I just valuable resource the audience. I just put the link in the IRC straw poll dot me

57:03.340 --> 57:07.340
sixty two seventy eight four seventy seven if you're not in the chat room and

57:07.340 --> 57:13.180
straw poll dot me sixty two seventy eight four seventy seven you go boat and

57:14.140 --> 57:19.540
Let me know what you think. You think I should go down to scale and cover ubi con and also scale itself

57:19.820 --> 57:25.720
So Chris, this is a promise, right? So if I say yes, that means that Linux fest northwest coverage will not be sacrificed

57:26.340 --> 57:28.340
There might be some

57:29.020 --> 57:34.140
New ones on this page. I'm just curious there doesn't mean there won't necessarily be patreon milestones that are established

57:34.140 --> 57:37.340
But yes, you know actually before we go any further

57:37.340 --> 57:44.060
This is legitimately a good time to mention that if you had a successful patreon payment in the month of November

57:44.060 --> 57:47.860
And you should I'm serious here. Then you should go over to the show notes for episode

57:48.380 --> 57:50.380
123 we had a

57:50.940 --> 57:55.580
We'll have a swag link in this episode. So we've been giving away swag for the holidays

57:56.140 --> 58:01.300
And like we just gave away this awesome. Look at that beautiful you ever listen on filter. I do the red book

58:01.300 --> 58:04.840
That's the official red book right there. I'm gonna have to ask you about where you got that made

58:04.840 --> 58:08.780
That is a lovely little it is super awesome. We just gave it to a viewer Lucas, too

58:08.780 --> 58:11.660
we have been working on a whole bunch of swag for the holidays and

58:12.280 --> 58:18.740
We just gave away a coda right coda radio mug with a beautiful green handle it in and a green man and you yeah

58:18.740 --> 58:25.740
Yeah, yeah, right there. We gave that to Adrian. He got that and of course also we gave a really nice beer coaster

58:25.940 --> 58:30.660
Big thick piece of glass with the Linux action show circular logo in there to Brandon's go all out

58:30.660 --> 58:33.620
Yeah, this is beautiful. We have a Linux unplugged

58:34.340 --> 58:39.100
Specific swag they'll be given given away from episode 123

58:39.100 --> 58:39.980
There'll be a link in the show notes

58:39.980 --> 58:46.100
The only catch isn't because we need your help and I really need your support is you do have to have a successful patreon payment

58:46.100 --> 58:52.180
Now a little bird and I cannot I can't come on here and I cannot disclaim who that little birdie is

58:52.180 --> 58:58.820
But a little birdie told me that will probably likely also include

58:58.820 --> 59:00.980
a successful December patrons

59:00.980 --> 59:06.340
So if you go to patreon.com slash today or unfilter and you want to back either the whole network or the unfilter show specifically

59:06.500 --> 59:12.140
You'll be you'll be entered and it's easy. I mean patreon makes it so so anyway audience go vote away

59:12.560 --> 59:17.720
Let me know straw poll dot me and let me know if I should go to scale and if you also think I should go

59:17.720 --> 59:19.720
To scale maybe you should consider going to page

59:20.100 --> 59:24.940
Today because I still want to do Linux vest Northwest like a boost. That's the thing if I go to scale

59:24.940 --> 59:30.720
I don't want to scale back on Linux vest Northwest. So that's sort of the agreement. We're gonna reach anyways

59:30.720 --> 59:32.100
Let me move on before we go any further

59:32.100 --> 59:32.580
I got it

59:32.580 --> 59:35.340
I got to pay the infrastructure bills the things that keeps the lights on the thing that

59:35.620 --> 59:37.820
Literally keeps the payments on the studios possible

59:37.820 --> 59:40.500
That is Linux Academy go to Linux Academy comm slash

59:40.540 --> 59:44.720
Unplugged to support the show to support the whole damn network to keep the lights on and to learn

59:45.020 --> 59:50.020
More Linux Academy is a platform designed by Linux users for Linux users full stop

59:50.860 --> 59:53.740
Legitimately, that's all you really need to know, isn't it? It's not a half-assed

59:53.740 --> 01:00:00.100
Implementation of some feature set because they have a online learning platform and Linux is something that people talk a lot about

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:04.820
So we should probably have some courseware on it. It's not that it's people who are like

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:10.940
Fanatics about open source and Linux. It's people like your very host here who are dedicated

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:15.620
Talking about Linux and open source all of the time only instead of doing podcasts

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:24.000
They did a whole training infrastructure and honestly one that has a revenue model. There's much more obvious and straightforward jealous, but

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:26.860
Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:33.260
I I really love them because they have followed the most important open source trends for a long time now uncreated tutorials

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:40.780
Instructions, I mean we're talking stuff almost 2,000 comprehensive study guides that are just brilliant with instructor help available on-demand

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:44.660
You videos you can watch downloadable comprehensive study guides

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:50.000
And I gotta say it a several. I gotta make sure I say it several times a spot read

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:56.260
Instructor help is available when you need it with these self-paced courses

01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:00.160
That is huge because if you're like good at just doing it on your own then guess what?

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:03.900
You almost got 2,000 videos where you can get going 2,000 self-paced courses

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.860
You're good to go blast through that stuff

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:11.320
Go ahead and be Superman if you get stuck and you need a little help though back that instructor help is a huge deal

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:16.460
And it's very unique because these guys are you know Linux experts like that's a big deal

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:21.140
Not only that they have scenario based labs. You have real-world experience with this stuff

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:24.020
You really know what it's like to implement it. They have nuggets

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:26.500
So if you don't have a lot of time because the holidays are coming up

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:34.420
You can still get value out of your Linux Academy subscription with these nuggets. They have self-paced availability planners. You know what I got

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:39.900
Look, you can go at Linux Academy. The holidays are coming up. I got a little bit of time on Monday

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:44.700
What do you got for me? It will automatically generate courseware that matches your availability

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:49.780
They've got nuggets that are two minutes to an hour long deep dive into a single topic like backing up your Linux box

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.380
Sinking your Linux box

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.860
managing your firewall managing SSH keys

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:59.420
Bash aliases all this stuff and the list is really extensive

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:04.460
Just a couple of minutes long maybe an hour long like just go there when you just want to do a little bit of learning

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:10.580
It's a really cool resource and here's the best part because Linux Academy has been supporting Jupiter broadcasting for a while

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:14.420
The community is stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:19.980
We're all there and so it's like your peer group who likes the same things you like who are trying to accomplish the same things

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.980
You're accomplishing to help you along the way

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:26.780
This is sort of like any time I've ever tried to exercise and stick to it

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:31.740
The only way I can do it is if I can talk either a significant other or a friend into doing it with me

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.980
We'll guilt you. Yeah, when you're too lazy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and and

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:40.740
Really it does work. It is motivation. Well, so-and-so knows it is literally motivation

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.980
It's a good head game to play with yourself to keep you working and on top of all of that

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:50.660
They take the best current technologies that utilize open source or Linux and they make it quantifiable in an actual time commitment

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:56.740
You go in there and you see this concept like Ruby or Python that I've been trying to learn

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.340
It's gonna take me five hours

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:03.880
So it's not this nebulous idea of oh, I want to learn how to do Python

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:09.360
It now becomes I need to dedicate five hours to this and I will know how to write Python

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.280
If you haven't done it before that shift is

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:19.600
Fundamentally awesome because it allows you to just sit back and learn and it gets you off your butt

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.580
No more procrastinating because it's such a big nebulous thing. It is six hours. It's five hours

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:30.620
That is so freeing to let you just sit back and learn Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and a huge

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:36.660
Thank you the Linux Academy for the support of the unplugged show and for creating such a kick-ass system. It's awesome

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:38.660
Yeah, Linux Academy comm slash

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.360
unplugged

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.680
Speaking of kick-ass systems. Holy smokes. It is time. We talk about a kick-ass system

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:53.040
Ryan joins us from the mycroft project with a really great update this week that I looked at this and I thought alright

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:58.900
They are really thinking about the end-user experience. They're really thinking about the details Ryan. Welcome back to Linux unplugged

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:00.900
How the heck is the mycroft project doing?

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.760
We're doing really good. We're we're coming up against the end of

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:09.740
December which was when we talked about having our final design done

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:16.520
and so we've really been rapidly developing on on the hardware side of things and then on the software we're really beginning to

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:22.360
know exactly, you know, what components go where and how to utilize those and

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.520
I'm kind of crunched on time

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:27.120
So if if I can't finish out this conversation

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.840
I'm going to turn you over to our sys admin Aaron who happens to have his fingers and all the parts of this project

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.880
As well, so yeah, I know you do have to go very soon

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.680
And so Ryan one of the things I wanted to touch on with you is it looks like you've been taking a lot of input

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.240
From backers the hack me port the rear mounting plate

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:48.800
The new even the silicone feet anything you can kind of touch on on that like what kind of feedback you guys been getting?

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.000
And what kind of change has been made overall to the project?

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.600
so when we first started

01:04:53.800 --> 01:05:00.040
We had a couple of different perks on the Kickstarter and what we noticed was that like 90% of the people who backed

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.720
We're getting the extended version of mycroft

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:08.640
Anyway with a lot of the ports exposed and a lot of different ways that you can interact with it and hack it and so

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:15.200
When we got that feedback in in the way of that stuff, you know, those people making those orders

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:18.480
we decided to pivot and kind of

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.400
adjust

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.920
mycroft design to

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.560
accommodate them even more and so once we started getting pictures of people who wanted to like

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:32.720
Included as a head for their robot and other things like that. We thought let's not make it harder for them to do this

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:37.680
let's make it easy and let's let's really target this at making it the

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:43.400
The simplest possible to enhance mycroft and to and integrate it into your yeah

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.760
Why not right and Ryan before you run?

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.200
one last thing maybe you want to touch on before we get into some of the other stuff is

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:53.480
Any any notes you want to touch on within with the official Ubuntu partnership?

01:05:54.200 --> 01:06:00.320
Yeah, well, we actually we're talking to Martin who's kind of a part of there

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:05.240
He's like a senior vice president of their IOT. He's got a really long like 16

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:10.480
And so that's important probably the Ubuntu guys could tell you a little bit better but

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:17.000
He was talking about how there's a lot of interest from certain groups about

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.000
voice enabling their appliances and these embedded devices that they ship out the door and so

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.440
He thought mycroft would be a really neat way to do that

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:31.120
and so after some conversations they decided to make it official and put a ring on it and

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.600
and so now

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.320
We're we're a canonical partner and we are so very happy

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:42.620
To be working with them because they're they've just been really awesome to us every step of the way

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:49.440
Yeah, and I can't I I love this this idea of open source companies coming together working together

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:54.480
Yeah, something that really I think we can do better than the proprietary

01:06:55.040 --> 01:07:00.960
right, you know products in this area and so it actually tugs on my heartstrings to

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.520
To have them talk to us and want to work with us on this and I think that's just awesome

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:13.120
They bring a lot of not official endorsement, but you know, they've existed for a long. Yeah brand as a successful

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:17.400
Yeah business for a long time and that can only be I agree. I think the concept is solid

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.160
I think the brand support is good and I think it's smart for

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.880
Canonical or aka Ubuntu to want to work with you

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:29.640
So Ryan, thanks a bunch for coming on and I really like these weekly updates to are you are you going to continue doing these?

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:32.400
I know there's a video series now, too. What's the plan there?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.600
Okay. Yeah, so one thing that I was gonna talk about this a little bit in regards to purism

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.600
but actually I got a shout out on

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:46.400
Google Plus from somebody who was asking if the project was dead because they hadn't received an update in a couple weeks and

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:52.160
They were and they were talking about how the our web server before we moved it had a hiccup

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:56.840
And so the website went down for an hour and so they were like, oh my god

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.560
Did I just get scammed, you know my crop took my money and now their websites down

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:04.080
And so we decided to become more frequent about our updates

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:11.120
It's easy to get so down in the trenches with a project and forget to like share out what's happening

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.720
And so we've just made that a part of our workflow

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:18.920
So we try to take everything that we're doing put it in a document and then I read through that and turn it into

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.720
human readable format

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.440
I think that goes a long way it does because now you're getting coverage here on the show and

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:27.120
Hundreds of thousands of people are gonna download the show and listen to it

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:30.200
So, I mean it is I mean, it's hard to quantify the value of it

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.600
But here we are you and I are having this conversation and I think we all understand, you know

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.600
So you want to be polished you want to look good?

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:40.460
but I think people are very accepting of like well you just put this out and you gave us more information and even if they're

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:47.120
Like some typos and there's you know, whatever mistakes. Yeah, just the fact that the communication goes along so Ryan before you run

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.680
will you introduce me to your co-worker there and

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:52.480
Let me know what we can talk to him about

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:58.480
Well, let me pull him in Aaron is here and he is a giant fan of the show

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:05.520
He's smacking his head because he doesn't he's so he's been nervous about talking to to you Chris

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.520
but I he is a

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:14.920
Master when it comes to our infrastructure and he has set up so many awesome tools and he could probably spend an entire episode

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.400
talking about just the tools that we've utilized and

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.280
he's his face is turning really red and

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.080
so

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.220
I'm going to leave him in right you

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.520
Him in or you and his capable hands, okay

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.600
And he probably will have a lot to contribute in the way of other things you talk about on the show today. Great

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:36.700
So Aaron you want to say hi to the Linux unplugged crew?

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.760
Welcome welcome to the show. Thank you for joining us Aaron

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:47.200
I want to play a little bit of this video and maybe you can take over the you can take the main position on the

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:51.200
Mic there while I play a little bit of this weekly update. It's called Netflix and chili

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:02.160
Text message is asking if you want to get something to do tonight Netflix and chili and here's Ryan

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.240
Look at Ryan getting the hugs in the video nice nice

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:13.000
So what do you want to watch tonight? I think I have some ideas

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
My

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:20.400
Crop Netflix and chill Oh Netflix and chill not chilly

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.840
Yeah, I guess I do actually on the brain

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.160
Yeah, you see you get the idea so the my crop device next to the TV

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:36.080
Starts a laser show with lasered pointers, dude. Holy crap. This is freaking awesome

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:44.160
Oh, this is legitimately awesome lasers all over the place and

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.500
See I got a new theater of the mind for the audio listeners

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.720
Mycroft the ultimate wingman

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.640
Mycroft just sitting there smiling

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:06.640
But it doesn't tell anyone about this right? Yeah fit that you don't get there's no notification. Here's my Ryan though

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.640
Here's the bloopers

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.560
Awkward

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.880
Oh

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.920
Ryan

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:29.760
Oh, man, I mean Ryan doesn't need game because my crops got game

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.800
No, so here's here's

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.800
Here's

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:55.520
What I love about this it's very legit it feels very honest and genuine that's great that is super super great

01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:00.920
All right. So hopefully it would give you guys enough time to swap around microphones there. I was it was Aaron

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.440
Was that what it was? What's Aaron? Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. Aaron. Welcome to the show and

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.120
Were you involved in the shooting of that video there?

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:13.400
I wasn't involved in that shooting but I was in the drone video I guess as the sketch

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.400
I first one. Yeah. Oh very

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:20.520
Very nice. So Aaron, I'm looking at this update here and I'm seeing some really impressive stuff

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.280
But one thing that's not

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:26.680
Clear to me is like it sounds like there is some sort of official partnership with Ubuntu

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:31.040
Is that Ubuntu snappy is Mycroft officially using Ubuntu snappy for its base OS?

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:34.720
Not necessarily what

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:40.600
They were able to talk to Ubuntu about a partnership in regards to IOT products

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.480
They already have a relationship about the possibility of voice control via Mycroft

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:51.080
we're talking about the idea of how Mycroft could be loaded onto other appliances and embedded devices and

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:54.520
Yeah, oh

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:58.080
so I don't want to put words in your mouth, but things like

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.080
okay, I

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.040
Don't want to say it because I don't want to activate it but and hey

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.280
You know like there's there is a lot of devices out there, you know, you know what I'm talking about

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:13.560
I do. I don't want to activate people's phones, but I get you good. Maybe you do. Maybe you do. Hey, hey, Harry and

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.000
Okay

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.060
Galaga, you know are activated like these there are these there are smart devices out there or you could say devices that

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.400
pretend to be smart or devices that are

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:32.660
Convergent that have smart assistants like Windows 10 has Cortana iOS has Siri Google has okay

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.920
gooks and

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:41.680
This would be something that maybe would be missing from the Ubuntu touch platform. Is that kind of the smell you're putting out there Aaron?

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.840
exactly after meeting one of our stretch goal of having a

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:54.360
Mycroft work on the desktop as a launcher. I think that could be portable to many different platforms

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.940
interesting Wow, I you know

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.420
So it's basically you know

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.720
What I love about you guys Aaron is I have to be honest is

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:05.520
Even though you're really starting with the Mycroft hardware unit

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:10.040
You're not limiting the Mycroft AI or functionality to a particular hardware unit, correct?

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.800
That's correct. Thanks to our backers

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:18.600
Helping us meet our stretch goals. Well, that's now possible. I love it. That's that's beautiful

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.100
Could you imagine something like that built into the Linux desktop?

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:28.680
But something that's not just like a version of Clippy like Cortana is but something actually useful to interact with which we're gonna need in five

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:35.680
Years when people expect that in the desktop and or not just the your desktop is gonna be expected. Who is that?

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.440
Who's typing that? Mr. Hall again? Who's typing like crazy? Yeah, that's me again. Sorry you you working hard, huh?

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:45.520
What do you have? Let me guess you have your voice activation set to like ctrl or shift or something. Is that what it is?

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.720
It's

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:54.000
No, I love it don't go away I want you to continue like you I love you you can continue talking

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.440
Yeah, it's just I've done that myself. Yeah, so I know that one. I know that one

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:05.720
I love the idea though of actually creating something that is built into the Ubuntu desktop or the unity 8 desktop or unity 9 desktop

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:11.040
Or whatever right that is available on the phone that is available on the desktop that is available on the tablet

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:14.340
That is a Siri or ok googs like

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:23.200
Experience but a lot of open-source tech and be maybe actually more focused on integrating with other open protocols and standards

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:28.200
On your LAN right not so cloud focused, but maybe a little more I don't care about Hulu

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:31.340
Maybe I never want to watch that but maybe I wanted people to tie in the services

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:36.240
I already have right and there's a lot of protocols like ZigBee and others that work on your local network

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:41.320
That don't require you go out to a cloud service and and have you know some sort of NAT set up

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:47.000
And it's just it is there's a lot of appeal there. So Aaron, I've I'm kind of curious

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.120
What are your what are your long-term visions for something like this? What is what do you envision like say?

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.120
2017 2018

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.120
You look at the Ubuntu desktop. You're looking at Ubuntu phone experience

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:03.400
What would be your best-case scenario your dream your hope with Minecraft technology being integrated with that experience?

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:13.080
Well, I'd have to say that I hope that this project really goes smoothly all the way that far and that people the community

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:14.760
actually

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:19.000
Participate and create their own modules and and solutions for their own, you know

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.240
Whatever they like and since it's based on the open source platform that runs on Linux to begin with I think that

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:30.840
We could really have a vibrant array of applications for people to use

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:36.280
yeah, and and I I I obviously have been somebody who's

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:43.940
Maybe to maybe to a fault. I often I often worry that open source is falling behind in VR

01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:49.860
Especially Microsoft just won an image recognition award, right? Right. We see these things and they'll be locked away in their proprietary

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:56.700
Augmented reality. Yes, right and another one that is cropping up around us and really here before all of these other technologies is

01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:59.820
virtual personal assistants

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.860
You know, I have to be honest with you. I

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:06.100
Actually do find myself using them too

01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:13.060
Like I wish I didn't but I have a horrible memory and if I can tell a computer the moment something comes to me

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:16.660
Over voice command to remember it and remind me about it

01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:18.660
That shit is valuable

01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:24.500
Like it is it is it is the difference between me having a great show idea and me never

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:30.060
Having a great show idea like I I was out Christmas shopping this weekend Sunday

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:35.340
I'm out shopping buying gifts for my kids and all of a sudden a great idea hits me

01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:40.680
I'm and and and it all in in 15 minutes that idea will be gone forever

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:47.240
And if you were ever in the position of writing or creating content, you know, how valuable like once the idea comes to you

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:53.160
You think oh, it's so good. It's so good. I'll remember it again. It's like a dream. You don't ever remember like it fades

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:57.000
You don't you don't remember it again like 15 minutes trying to think about what it was

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:00.000
Yes, and like I brought around with me for a long time

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.920
I brought little pieces of paper that I could write on but I always forget the pen

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.160
17th century

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:13.720
So so being able to hold down a button say hey shlomo I want to remember this thing and remind me about it when I

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.720
get back to work is

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:19.420
Literally an invaluable tool and I I love it

01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:24.920
So the idea of building that into the Linux desktop would make the Linux desktop even more appealing to me

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:30.000
So I'm pretty much really integrated with people who understand open-source who understand that

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:34.320
Yeah, next up users have slightly different needs. Yeah Cortana users. Yeah. Yeah

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:40.240
so Aaron speaking of that like what is the long-term possibilities of other open-source projects just kind of hooking in with

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:47.640
Mycroft and kind of working with you guys working with the back-end infrastructure specifically the back-end infrastructure and sort of the back-end processing

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.980
What what are the opportunities there? Is there much?

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:57.960
Yeah, there is going to be a lot of opportunity there we're going to be open open sourcing multiple elements including the adapt

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.560
Intent parser here pretty soon

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:05.560
Um, so basically once we get things ironed out to the point where we can release it to the community

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:10.480
You'll be you'll have sort of an API to communicate with whatever you'd like. Oh

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:16.320
That's nice. I wouldn't be I'm curious and I I look at your comment in the chatroom

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:23.800
What would it take for you to make Mycroft integration with the desktop more than just a gimmick not clippy 2.0 to the open-source ripoff

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:28.800
what does it make what would it take for it to actually be a compelling feature for a user like yourself or or

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.800
Other users and you might have in mind

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:36.320
Well myself. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, go ahead for one being there and I'd be curious to hear your thoughts, too

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.040
But wimpy go ahead

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:45.240
It's something I've been thinking about for a while now that when a technology emerges in the open-source world

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:50.120
That I can leverage to have that seamless voice

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:57.520
Commands then that is something I would definitely be looking at integrating into Ubuntu Marte because like you

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:02.680
I have grown accustomed to using those convenience functions on mobile devices

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:06.840
And I absolutely know I want that on my desktop operating system as well

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:12.840
Yeah, and Aaron I'm curious. What were your thoughts on it? I bet as somebody who's very connected to the project

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.840
You must have thought about this a lot

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:19.120
Well to be honest with you. I basically started working with

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:24.960
I basically started working on this same concept right before I joined the team and my idea was initially that

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:33.120
There's a lot of dev ops teams that use chat rooms and chat bots to you to you know monitor monitor things and give

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:41.280
Commands, you know, like what is the load on this, you know cluster whatever and uh, I think that this is gonna be

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.880
really

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:49.700
It's gonna enable that sort of thing or you know, it could turn on your coffee pot or it could tell you

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:56.360
It could be anything from yo mycroft. What's the load on my third web server to hey mycroft turn on the coffee pot?

01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:59.760
Yeah, it could literally be anything because you could use

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.320
regex to

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.320
Create your own voice commands

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:11.040
That is so cool. Well Aaron, I invite you and of course Ryan to join us anytime any week

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.160
We do the show Tuesday 2 p.m. Pacific, right? Oh, yeah

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:18.880
Yeah 2 p.m. Pacific and I'd love for you to join us and share your thoughts on any open-source stories that we cover

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:21.560
But also just you know ping us with different interesting things

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.560
You're working on because to be honest with you

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:28.640
It's something that I think both Wes and I are really interested in and I too I am loving the future where I can be

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.600
Like yeah in mycroft play the next tech snap and it just shows up on my TV, right? Yes

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:40.040
That is the future. I mean, this is the near future. I hope so. So you have an open invitation sir to join us every single week

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:43.160
And that that of course extends to everybody out there

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:45.200
But I would love to talk with you more about this

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:50.360
but I do want to get into some of the groundbreaking stuff that own cloud and LibreOffice are doing that I think could

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:56.280
Not only be huge for education not only be huge for business and not only be huge for individuals

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:59.000
but hopefully you'll be huge for Jupiter broadcasting specifically and

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.600
We also have early results from our straw poll if I should go to scale or not

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:07.360
We're gonna talk about all of that. But first got to talk about ting. I

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:11.360
Love talking about ting. I do too. I tell you what Wes

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:15.680
There is something pretty neat about ting and it's something that you might not consider

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:19.040
Our viewer Tyler in the chat room. I feel bad for him

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:26.800
So this week Tyler's internet went out. No. Yeah, how do you listen to Jupiter broadcast? Well, this is I don't understand

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:30.920
This is the thing. So what he's able to do is because ting is pay for what you use, right?

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:35.680
No contract nor the termination. You just pay for what you use now this month

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:40.240
Tyler is gonna have a big ting bill. I mean it might even be like 125 bucks

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:40.760
I mean

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:47.160
it's gonna be a big ting bill because he's using a lot of data because it's the ISP basically for a family in his house and

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:55.240
I feel you know like oh that sucks man. And then I think about and I think you know, what's amazing about that

01:22:55.240 --> 01:23:02.280
Two things you can do that. You can just use as much data as you need one. No throttling. No throttling. No overages

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.640
nothing scammy like that like though

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:11.440
11 months out of the year. He's gonna have a bill around 50 60 bucks for the entire family one month out of the year

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:17.840
He's gonna have a high bill. Think about how that averages out before I switched to ting. I paid a hundred and twenty-five to 140 bucks

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:23.880
I can't even remember where for two phones two phones like six gigs of data. It was pathetic

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:30.120
It was pathetic. I switched to ting my bill for three lines 40 bucks 45 bucks if it's like a holiday

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:36.160
It is fantastic. And here's how you can get started to go to linux.ting.com. It'll take $25 off your first month

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:42.520
$25 of service credit if you have a ting compatible device, which they got CDMA and you just do I mean unless

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:49.740
Cell phone carrier that maybe I won't talk about newsflash cell phones aren't new right? Yeah, we've Adam. Yeah years 15 years

01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:50.960
I don't even know how long yeah

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:57.000
And so here the the pay for what you use model is really interesting because if you have one

01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.760
Heavy month like say I go down to scale. I don't know

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.960
I haven't looked at the results yet, but say I go to the straw poll

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.440
I look at the results and they say I should you just have to go

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:08.080
Well, the audience is voting. I mean they decide everything are they?

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:12.220
Well, I mean our masters we acknowledge quite literally that is true

01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:17.040
So here is what I figure if I got to go down to scale that week

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.120
Maybe I'll have heavier than average usage

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:25.720
Big frickin deal because the rest of the year I pay almost frickin nothing. It is ridiculous

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:30.880
This is what I love about ting is you can just be a little savvy and you really can nail this thing

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.800
I'm not trying to say you're gaming the system

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:38.400
But if you're just a little savvy you can really figure this out. No contract. No early termination fee

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.800
It's six dollars for the line. You got Wi-Fi. Let me tell you something

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.000
You're not gonna be paying much and they help you out

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.840
Kyra's got all of the app picks to help you like make your calls over Wi-Fi like all of those

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:53.480
And they got the fanatical customer support. You can call them. You talk to a real human being they got the

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.880
Unbelievable control panel that works across all of your devices

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:03.080
No special like active X or like flash or Java runtime required. It works on your Linux box. No problem

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:07.720
They also have companion apps for iOS and Android. It really is a great setup

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.440
You know, you can't say much that you can't say too much about that

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:15.360
Like it's one in the morning and you go buy a burner phone from a you know from Walmart and you need it to work

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:20.240
You go on to tings website ten minutes five minutes three minutes. I don't know but it works

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:24.080
I believe in January and I will have to double-check on this but I believe in January

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:31.280
I will be breaching breaching Wes the three-year mark of ting. No way. Yeah breaching the three. Is that the right word reaching?

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:35.120
Oh, yeah, I will be a little vulgar, but I like oh, okay

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.640
I think I could have been more I could have been more vulgar

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:41.920
I think actually cuz penetrating for the new year penetrating for the new year. I'm thrusting into that

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:47.720
Oh, okay. Anyways, I believe I'm going into my third year with ting and a couple of things that are big with ting since then

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:51.320
They got these SIM cards you can get now for nine bucks. They're on they're on Amazon

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:55.840
You just pop them into anything like a Raspberry Pi module to a phone and you got ting service

01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:01.080
So it's like wow just data wherever I need it anytime GSM or CDMA. That's mind-blowing

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.960
You just check that out

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:09.400
But also one of the other things that has really struck me about ting over the almost three freaking years now that I've been using

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.660
ting

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:15.240
They continue to have a great selection of devices that are unlocked. You just buy them outright

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:21.920
They also have an early termination relief program great blog post all of it Linux dot ting calm Linux dot ting calm

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.920
Go check them out support this show

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:28.640
And you know, this might actually be a way to give somebody in your family or your small business

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.080
Connectivity without costing you an arm and a leg

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:36.480
Linux dot ting calm and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged. Love you guys

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.640
All right, Wes. You ready for the results of this Linux?

01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:43.120
This live here on the on the spot

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:45.720
unedited

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:47.720
Umpul, are you ready lay it on me? All right, here we go

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:56.000
Chris go to scale and I'm gonna refresh right now as we play it. Oh

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.920
Wow, wow, yikes

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.760
And I'm equivocal

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:07.080
94% say I should go to scale 6% say no, I'm curious why the people who said no. Yeah speak up

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:13.400
Yeah, yeah, that was me. Sorry Chris. Yeah, he doesn't want to run into you. He doesn't have to see you or talk to you

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:19.600
Wow, your face offends him. Yeah open to but I haven't opened two browser sessions to get two votes in

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:27.520
Hold on now. Hold on now. What day is this scale actually happening on? Is it on a Tuesday because if it is

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:30.440
We can do that makes unplugged in person. Oh

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:36.440
Could you imagine how much like a Thursday evening to Sunday? Yeah, Sunday's kind of quieting down usually

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:42.520
Well, you know what? Maybe it's Popey's opportunity to come on Linux action show because we'll be doing that on Friday. Yeah. Yeah

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.080
Maybe I could talk Noah into hosting the whole thing from OBS

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:52.920
I think the said the second you start with maybe I can talk Noah. Yes. He's just he's gonna do it. So

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.840
Wow

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.480
94% of the votes. I think I have to go I have to go I have to hear some idea

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:03.640
Look at what Jumba says in the IRC here Chris last I don't want you to go

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:08.960
I want Rekai, you know, and all Rekai special. How about I got this Rekai and Ang

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.200
I'll send them both down there and I'll stay here and they can Skype in and tell me how good it is

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:17.320
I think that's I'm I'm in I'm in support of this. There's the thing. That's not what people voted for

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:21.560
I actually this I should have thought about this ahead of time, but I said should Chris

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:26.360
Should Chris be in results are invalid. Yeah should Chris go to Chris?

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.360
Going

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.160
Yeah, I think I'm going to scale I think I'm going to scale I think that's the only way around that one

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.720
I think I got to go to scale. Holy crap

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:41.080
Let's talk about own cloud and LibreOffice working together everybody

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:45.920
it is it is like the best of both worlds today December 15th own cloud Inc and

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:51.560
Collabra have just announced a partnership to bring new tools for LibreOffice and own cloud users

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:57.680
Based on the LibreOffice online project and the robust open source own cloud server. You will have a self-hosted

01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:03.640
Real-time doc editor based on LibreOffice. You got an ODF you got you got it. What do you got?

01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:05.920
You got it. What do you got Rekai? What do you got Wes?

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:07.400
Here's the big thing

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:12.200
I might take away the main difference between LibreOffice online and other offerings that are available

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:19.240
Is that LibreOffice online uses the same rendering engine? Yeah, and that actually is you know, you know what you're gonna get

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:24.000
It's not different. It's not a different stack. I think that's probably as far as

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:28.880
I'm gonna drop this into a corporation or a school district or what's that whatever?

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:32.680
I mean, that's a huge thing for document users is you want yeah want to be able to make something?

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:38.920
But you want to be able to send it to people who can use it. Yeah, and I I look at this and I so I think

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.480
the UI

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:44.520
Holds up which is what I was really worried about right is the UI to me

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:50.600
It is so it's a little big you go into your web browser of choice and then you got you got your own cloud header

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:55.600
And then below that you have a LibreOffice header and then below that you have the actual document

01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:58.120
But it is it appears to be

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:04.600
Pretty much everything you would expect from LibreOffice embedded in the web browser. I

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:07.200
Don't I don't know if that's really the issue

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:12.920
What I think the issue is gonna be is how good is the collaborative editing right? How real-time is the collaborative editing?

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:19.240
Second that's a secondary issue though because the I the concept here is a small business an open source project

01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.200
An individual with you know a family whatever it is

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:26.960
this you could just be somebody listening to this show and

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:32.680
Decide I'm gonna set up an own cloud server with this LibreOffice plug-in and now the family has

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:39.560
Somewhere for the wife and husband or the husband and husband the wife and wife to make shopping notes, right?

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:44.080
I prefer exactly for groceries lists, right? You have somewhere for the kids to do their homework

01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:49.080
Centralized spot to the homework like all this stuff that can now be shared in one family

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:50.800
It doesn't have to be a large enterprise

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:57.720
It could be but it doesn't have to be a large enterprise for this to be relevant and I find that to be really exciting

01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:04.920
it's the technology of LibreOffice and the technology of own cloud coming together in something that

01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:11.000
Will essentially boil down to a plug-in and I feel like it's a big boost honestly for own cloud

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.460
I think that LibreOffice brings a lot of stability a lot of

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:20.760
They have delivered a number of times, right? Yes, exactly and nothing against own cloud

01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:23.960
But I feel like we've seen some instability some growing pains in the past

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:27.480
I I trust this a lot more than own clouds own

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.080
implementation of a

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:34.160
Fact that LibreOffice is willing to work with them that they're endorsing this plug-in that it's kind of you know

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.320
Maybe the future

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:36.160
That's a big deal

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:38.260
So wimpy you say that

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:45.560
Collabora are really bringing it these days with LibreOffice and it seems like if they truly are responding to user demand. What are your thoughts?

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:49.840
Well, yeah, I mean Collabora have been a great

01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:56.800
organization for adoption of open source technologies, but just recently they've been involved in

01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:03.280
You might remember earlier in the year or was it last year the UK government announcing they were going to support

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.560
open

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:07.720
Document formats rather than proprietary for don't rub it in

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:15.460
Yeah, that was that was followed up a month or so ago with the fact that the UK government are going to start

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.040
using Gov office

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:22.400
Which Collabora are working on to actually augment LibreOffice

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:28.800
Oh rebranded version called Gov office, which the UK government are going to be using. Thank you for that clarification

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:31.680
not only open

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:38.160
Standards and open document formats, but also the open source version just rebranded to become

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:43.140
So easy a way to transition people over to not to not to get lost in the nuance here

01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:45.880
But just as somebody who didn't quite follow this

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:53.220
So Gov office is LibreOffice just focused on the needs of government institutions, but it's essentially the same code base

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.760
Yes, okay

01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:59.720
Oh, there you go Gov office West is bringing it up right now. There you go

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:01.800
I see very mean that tagline right there if you

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:06.480
Professional LibreOffice for the public sector. There you go. Yeah. Okay. Thank you Wimpy

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:10.760
I didn't so not to interrupt but I just kind of wanted that clarification because I didn't quite follow that before

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:16.280
No, that's all I had to say is that you know Collabora are

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:19.920
LibreOffice contributors, I think they're one of the larger

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:24.200
LibreOffice contributors and they're really following up that

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:29.880
Development angle with the whole advocacy outreach and implementation

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:35.480
So when you look at Gov office and what they're doing with own cloud, they're they're really doing a fine job

01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:41.560
I think so Jumba you had the big question on on probably the tip of a lot of listeners minds

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:43.560
Who've been listening for a while? Go ahead?

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:50.320
Jumba this is like the episode where I throw to the mumble room and like like half of them don't answer

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:54.960
Yep. Yeah, this is like this this it's like it's like a great episode except for the fact that half the time

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.800
I thought the mumble of nobody answers other than that. It's a solid episode

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:00.160
And so Jumba wanted to know

01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:05.880
If this makes own cloud sort of more appealing in my view if it sort of turns my point of view you have been

01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:10.720
Own cloud critic is too harsh and own cloud. No, I invested you know

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:18.120
That is a tough that is a tough thing for me because I personally know and talk to people and you're a huge supporter of

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:24.520
I mean almost all open source projects. Yeah, and and I have absolute respect for Frank

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.720
I see Frank all the time

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:31.080
I like I died I can it is a hard thing for me to criticize a project

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:34.120
Why literally the guy who runs the project I run into all the time?

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:37.680
so the thing about own cloud is I

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:44.040
Also have nearly lost entire episodes to own cloud where it would have it would have lost an entire

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:49.920
Week's worth of two people's work and if you have ever worked in a small business and know the cost of two people's work

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.360
Being completely lost

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:54.520
It's the other part is that you work in a job where if you make a mistake

01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:59.960
Alan will tell you that you should have been using ZFS and right how many times can you do that a week God?

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:03.440
Thank you, Wes. Thank you for understanding. Thank you for you know what?

01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:09.760
I really appreciate you taking a moment and actually truly understanding my pain. Welcome to BSD unplugged your weekly BSD talk show

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:15.240
That's too busy getting actual work done to care about what your silly display server. My name is Alan

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:19.320
You know speaking of Alan we had a really good episode of tech snap. Yes. Oh, that was a great episode

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:22.120
So people should check that check it out. Yeah, I okay

01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:28.440
So this is something obviously I have struggled with quite a bit and I think you know

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:36.680
Thinking of a talking about Alan it's like how many times can I make that excuse right? So I am I am passionately interested in a

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:38.640
recognizable

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.320
trustable company

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:47.400
Coming in and working with own cloud and it it really makes sense with where Frank the the guy behind own cloud

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:52.280
The the main project lead wants to take own cloud is he wants to make it more legitimate

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:55.640
So he looks at all of these small businesses out there that are using

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.920
hosted solutions like Google Docs and Google apps or

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:06.200
Microsoft's platforms or any of the many platforms like Zimbra even our platforms out there that are hosted platforms for

01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:10.120
Businesses and and he says, you know what with a Linux box and own cloud

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:14.000
You could do all that stuff and keep it on premises. Keep it on your land

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:20.840
Man, that is an idea. I completely am behind and so I love love love that you can take LibreOffice

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:25.180
You can create a document on your PC and you can know that when you open it up on the web

01:36:25.180 --> 01:36:28.680
It's gonna render exactly like it should render on your PC. That is

01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:33.700
Fundamentally a big issue for basic end-users. I think that's great

01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:36.780
Wimpy, did you want to add anything else to the that to wrap this discussion?

01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:45.660
Well, I think that you've cited file sync difficulties with own cloud and I yeah, I'd go along with that

01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:49.300
That's what I've experienced. But yeah with the rest of own cloud

01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:57.500
the the fundamental syncing of contacts and calendars and online collaboration that stuff works very well, so

01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:02.860
This LibreOffice and Collabra involvement with own cloud is all very great. And

01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:10.380
The other thing we need to look at is that Ubuntu 1 got open sourced and has been forked into a new project

01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:13.060
And maybe 2016 we'll see that

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:21.460
Evolve into something that maybe own cloud could work with and integrate in order to replace their

01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:27.780
File sync back-end. Yeah, so, you know, let's just watch this space. Yeah, I think that's it

01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:30.660
I think that is actually a really good comment as the sync

01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:35.340
So I want to I want to make sure I just want to make sure people understand what Wimpy is saying is I've never

01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:40.460
Really had an issue with any of the web-based services that own cloud offers

01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:45.180
And in fact, I continue to use own cloud for CalDAV and CardSync

01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:48.020
Probably the best open source option for those and I do it

01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:55.260
I don't I thought yeah, so I I really think it excels in some areas and like when I want to so, you know, like

01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:57.660
Thanksgiving

01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:03.580
Halloween and like doing Christmas shopping with the kids Angela and I are sharing albums albums through own cloud

01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:05.260
It's perfect for that kind of stuff

01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:10.340
I still today use own cloud on a digital ocean droplet to do a ton of stuff the one thing

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:14.740
I'm no longer using it for and what Wimpy is touching on is my my primary file sync

01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:18.660
Right large numbers of gigabytes that kind of stuff. And I know I think on the back end

01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:20.100
I use something called like CSync or so

01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:25.460
I know it's based on a good solid open source syncing solution, but it's just not holding up for me Wimpy

01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:31.620
That's a great point and and that's why I am legitimately able to a criticize own cloud for some things and be

01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:37.140
Be excited for the integration of some things like LibreOffice in their web experience

01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:41.460
And I just cannot wait to the day I can come on the air and say Jupiter broadcast

01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:45.300
You no longer uses Google Docs to prepare for these shows. I hope that they also allow

01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:48.900
External right like I hope that yeah supports stuff like well

01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:52.580
Whatever you use to happen to get these files if you can stick a bunch of LibreOffice

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:57.540
Documents ODTs right on your server. Yeah, and own cloud will just read them. Let you edit them, etc

01:38:57.540 --> 01:38:59.540
That would be perfect. Yeah. Yeah, that really would be

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:04.260
And you know it is getting to a point where and I I think this is real

01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:09.140
Like there's a lot of products out there that are open source projects that get sort of put out there

01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:17.140
That are open source projects that get sort of productized right and they don't feel like they're quite ready for end-user adoption

01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:19.140
They're just not

01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:23.700
Fun if you want to have a few problems you want to fix them and if you're just if you're a little educated

01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:28.180
You know how to solve problems. You know how to do a good Google search. You don't mind a hiccup in your workflow, right?

01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:30.260
It's good for you. Everyone is there, but yeah

01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:37.300
So this is why I think but I think own cloud is close to technology that is actually totally ready for the end-user experience

01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:40.180
It just needs that out-of-box experience

01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:43.700
And this is why I'm really excited about something the own club project is announcing today

01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:48.100
Western digital and own cloud have teamed up to bring own cloud to home users

01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:54.300
And I think this is really neat. And what I really like about it is you don't have to be an own cloud contributor

01:39:55.020 --> 01:40:00.540
You just have to basically have a little bit of enthusiasm and skill sets and you can get involved in this right now

01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:07.980
Weston digital labs has teamed up and contacted own cloud to work together on an offering as a self-hosted device running own cloud

01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:09.940
pre-installed out-of-the-box

01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:13.680
Their end goal is to provide a solution for non-technical end-users

01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:18.140
Something we're something that will be very easy to set up doesn't require a lot of skills

01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:23.820
So Noah could set it up. So something somebody like Noah could set it up. Why are we being mean to Noah?

01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:26.220
Well, he just loves Western digital. Oh

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:32.540
Good callback West Wow Wow, right? I mean if this will if this will support the same sort of stuff

01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:37.700
I know I'm just playing now does I'm just impressed that you had an inner show reference that I didn't even get and I host

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.780
All the shows like why you have to keep me around. Yeah, nice nice

01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:47.540
So a Western digital labs is working with these guys over at own cloud and they say here is the thing that is applicable to our

01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:49.020
audience

01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:53.040
Western digital has provided own cloud with ten early prototypes to get started with

01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:59.240
They would like to send them out to the community members who are serious about helping home users run their own own cloud server

01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:05.320
That's awesome. If I didn't do these shows that would I mean, man, I I honestly I wish sometimes before people ever

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:09.800
Presented something to consumers. They would let me look at it because I would just tear it apart

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:15.080
the prototypes contain all the parts to set up a small server including a Raspberry Pi 2 a

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:19.560
1-terabyte hard drive all the cables as well as a

01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:24.200
fast SD card pre-installed with an own cloud image

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.880
berry boot based and

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:32.320
A small manual and the idea is sort of create something use it and let them know and here is what I find

01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:36.920
Frickin fascinating about this is I think with this what this is betraying and

01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:40.680
Maybe I'm wrong and I I mean I could be totally wrong

01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:44.560
But I think Western digital is going to ship a product based on a Raspberry Pi

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:51.040
Because why send it out as a prototype if you're not gonna use essentially whatever the pie is as your base of the product

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:54.920
And if you're Western digital and you want to send out a Linux based product running own cloud

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.280
Why not just ship it with a Raspberry Pi?

01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:05.560
Wouldn't that be interesting if in early January or early April we hear about a Western digital powered Raspberry Pi device

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:07.360
It has own cloud

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:08.920
That would be this

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.920
So here is the cool bits you guys

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:15.120
You can get it on this s you listening to the show can get in on this s

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:17.960
You've got until December 17th to write a proposal

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:24.240
Earlier is better. So do it fast. I mean I would I would really freak out do it today

01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:29.720
But if a JB member got in on this and then they could join us in the mumble room and you would be priority

01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:35.200
Oh, you don't have to be a well-known own cloud developer or active in the community. It's open to everybody

01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:39.440
They're gonna pick the best proposals and send out the packages on December 19th

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:45.720
They're hoping to get them out before Jesus's birthday. So hurry up and by the end of January

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:51.160
They'll get in contact with you and work together on getting a blog about covering your results of your project

01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:53.420
They want you to try this thing. They want you to build this thing

01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:58.080
They want you to use this thing and they really want you to tell them why it's not gonna work for an end-user

01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:03.540
This is where I think I could come in. Yep is they should just make you're good at criticizing things. Yes

01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:09.360
I am and and so there you go. Oh, sorry kids and I got the birthday thing wrong. Well, it's on December 25th

01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:12.880
They're gonna try to get them to you before December 25th. I I'm sorry

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:17.240
I don't follow it that closely so you guys can check it out. We'll have a link in the show notes

01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:22.280
I think this would be great. It's exciting to see like something as big as Western Digital, you know

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:24.280
They're pretty big in the storage community

01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:24.360
Yeah

01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:30.240
Like well and chaotic mentions that the Western Digital has bought SanDisk so Western Digital and SanDisk saying that's a huge

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:37.840
That's a huge conglomerate. Wow. Yeah, and wouldn't you love to see them start shipping think like and contributing upstream to own cloud?

01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:43.380
Like yeah, you can you know, you buy a couple discs. Maybe it's a little raid thing. Who knows you own clouds on it?

01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:46.760
It manages your home infrastructure. That's great, man

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:52.600
Wimpy have you heard a little birdies talking about other interests that Western Digital has had with open source projects. I

01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:56.880
May have heard that this might be the start of Western Digital

01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:01.120
courting other open source projects and releasing other

01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:08.240
other devices built around the Raspberry Pi 2 so what did they just all of a sudden realize the Raspberry Pi 2 was like

01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:11.160
this awesome platform pre-built for them ready to go and what's

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:16.720
What what has been all of a sudden the big change here? I don't know what the big change is

01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:21.440
I just know they've been reaching out to open source projects and finding out what the

01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:27.560
capabilities are and pitching ideas about how they could use those projects and the Raspberry Pi 2

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:35.320
Combined with their storage to deliver new solutions at a low low price point. Yeah, that sounds pretty obvious

01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:40.160
I would invite Julie over at Western Digital to email Chris at Jupiter broadcasting.com and

01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:44.840
That's Julie Weiss and you want to speak to Julie hmm

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:48.520
Well, if anybody knows Julie let her know I want to talk to her because I got a few thoughts on this particular thing

01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:52.560
It's a long-term own cloud user now. I've been using own cloud since like version 5 so

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:58.800
I'll hook you up. Thank you. Wimpy. That would be great. Yeah, also a special shout out to

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:05.800
Remy in the chat room or Remy. I always get that wrong. I'm sorry who emailed both wimpy and I about p wiki

01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:07.560
It was that what it was wimpy?

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:13.680
P wick. Yeah, he wick. Thank you about with the sort of Google Analytics replacement. That is open source in nature

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:15.720
Mmm, the open source persuasion

01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:21.080
So we may see that coming out to the JB site soon and you may see wimpy trying that out soon, which is pretty cool

01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:23.640
Very cool. Yeah, it's very nice. So I

01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:29.640
Appreciate that too. And if you have any feedback or comments Linux action show dot reddit.com. Yeah, I know I know

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:31.640
It's his Linux action show

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:37.580
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa, that was home at town folks. I've never installed

01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:44.840
Get it out of here. So here's the thing if you have any feedback for this show go over to Linux action show dot reddit.com

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:49.680
Let us know that yes, it does say Linux action show in the URL. You can blame West for that

01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:55.480
That was my that's my bad. Yeah, I apologize West everyone years ago like a hundred and

01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:02.420
Whoa, I just realized hold on. This show has never missed a single week

01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:08.000
That's because we're perfect. I haven't been here that long, but I'm just gonna say what I was gonna say

01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:10.640
124 weeks ago. Thank you, Matt

01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:15.000
You came to me and you said I got an idea for you and I said, who are you and you said?

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.320
Don't make a separate subreddit and I said, okay, that seems like a good idea

01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:24.840
So Linux action show at reddit comm I I honestly feel like this show is been particularly kick-ass this year

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:26.840
And we don't get enough engagement in the subreddit

01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:30.600
Like we don't get the upvotes right and we don't get the comments and I'm like

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.400
Have you heard how badass this show is?

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:37.320
It is a super badass show and yet and it's the show where you got opinions man. Come on

01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.640
Yeah, and I want to hear them

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:38.880
Yeah

01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:44.440
And and also sometimes we drink beer and we get into horrible rants that we wouldn't normally get into that if we were actually sober

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:48.840
Wouldn't have said on air JB Rah, where else you gonna get that got the unplugged experience

01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:53.920
So go over to Linux action show at reddit comm give us a little bit of love. Check us out. Also next week

01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:57.720
124 I think it's the best retrospective on the network

01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:03.280
We talked about some of the big topics we covered throughout the year for Linux unplugged and we followed up on them

01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:08.940
Played some clips. It was good. So 124 will be coming out in the holiday week. We won't be live next week

01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:11.060
So don't bother going to JB live TV

01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:15.120
This is where this is the spot where I plug JB live TV and I'm like you should totally go to Jupiter broadcasting comm

01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:18.020
Slash calendar and get in your local time zone. I'm not gonna say that though

01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:21.140
I'm not gonna say that cuz we're not live next week because it's the holiday week

01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:26.680
But what I am gonna say is if you subscribe to the RSS feed or you go to the Jupiter broadcasting website or you're on

01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:32.300
Channel there's an MB channel. Yes. Anyway, really, you know you do how you do you do how you do

01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:37.640
You're gonna get yourself a really great episode. I know you're busy next week. Let me tell you something

01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:42.840
I think it's one of the best retrospectives JB has ever done. I really do and it's because the mumble room was there

01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:48.360
I mean, it's not not not my doing it is the it is it is what this show has represented and

01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:50.640
124 is a perfect example

01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:56.760
We went into 124 knowing these are the things we're gonna talk about and we walked out with one of the best shows of the year

01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:02.600
So I invite you to join us for 124. It is a good show and then we will be back on the final week

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:06.600
So do you remember when you and I did that unboxing in 124? Yes, I do

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:08.600
Well, it turns out

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:11.640
Files copying in the chat room is the one who sent me that box

01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:16.760
No way, and I have in all of you will understand what I'm talking about when you listen to next week's episode

01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:22.160
I have invited him to join us in the following episode to tell us about the project and what's going on

01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:24.840
It's gonna be great. I am really excited gonna be great

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:31.640
So a 124 and 125 are gonna be fantastic Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar for live events

01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:37.880
Linux action show that reddit comm for feedback and of course Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact to send us email indirectly

01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:42.840
Anything else we got to cover this week West? I think this was too big of a show already too big

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:45.600
We'll have links to everything we talked about in the show notes

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.440
If you want to go to ubi con or you want to find out about the own cloud

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:55.320
Initiative or you're curious about mycroft and their updates all of that stuff in the sub are in subreddit

01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:59.720
Well, actually some of it does come from the subreddit, but turns out we still managed to come up with some of the stuff

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:01.800
On our own it's amazing and you can find links to it

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:07.680
Over at Jupiter broadcasting comm Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar and don't forget. We'll have a swag link in the show notes

01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:37.480
Thanks so much to this week's episode of Linux unplugged. See you back here next week

01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:09.680
Classy up in Linux

01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:18.360
That's feels better. All right, that's nice JB tells calm everybody. Let's go boat and I will we want to talk about something in the post

01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:20.880
Show I remember that much. Do you remember what it was West?

01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:26.760
I believe it was a follow-up on something. We opened up in the beginning of the show. Yes, it was

01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:31.160
Libra, yes. Oh, thank you. Yes. Okay. I know. Thank you

01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:35.320
Cuz I know people listening were like, oh my god, are you guys are really that dumb, but it's really are the worst

01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:41.600
Yeah, that's accepted. All right. So did I who did I cut off and who wants to pick up because I don't remember

01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:45.520
Anybody anybody

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:52.480
There's all the software you'd want is free and available on no way. All right, who is it?

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.360
Yeah, old cubes OS. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Go ahead. Oh

01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:05.480
Oh, well, you suggested that cubes might be interesting with the containers at least for the scenario

01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:07.120
cubes

01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:11.040
Provides you some tears wouldn't work because cubes also provides

01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:13.600
Windows

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.800
Software on top of the cubes, right?

01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:19.040
Then you'll be limited to something that supports the kernel you're running

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:21.840
Yep

01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:26.120
That's also I'm not sure if it's implemented in any

01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:27.600
container

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:35.760
Solution but what cubes does is also provide a way to identify which window comes from which?

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:38.800
from which

01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:44.600
Environment. Oh, that's handy. So so Alex how long have you been running cubes?

01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:54.880
Significantly I just researched it and I'm trying it out right now. Have you tried the windows support?

01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:56.880
No, I

01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:03.200
Plan to okay. Yeah, see like if the window support works really well, I could see that being a big plus for the Zen thing

01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:09.080
It would be really interesting to see a cubes version with maybe LXC support or you know

01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:14.000
You can run a window that's contained in Docker that said it might compromise some of the security

01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:19.200
Obviously containers are containers and security or an evolving topic. Let's say

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:22.520
Yeah

01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:26.920
What I would like to see in the future would be

01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:31.200
something like cubes, but based on gnode and

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:39.820
Since gnode uses the L4 kernel. It could also use the secure L4 kernel, which is

01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:42.480
provably secured

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:49.800
It was formally tested and I think that would be kind of the ultimate

01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:52.240
security

01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:53.680
OS

01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:56.520
yeah, yep, I mean I wonder how that compares to like the

01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:03.040
The library operating system trend today where you see like rump kernels and stuff being run in docker containers

01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:05.880
Where you have your application and a library and it just runs

01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:11.400
All right, so by the way Douglas says he loves us which is great

01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:15.120
And I want I want to go to kits in and then wimpy

01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:18.700
So let's I not to not to cut off but I don't want to cut this is already really long show

01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:23.180
I kits in you've been trying out the plasma desktop. What do you think?

01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:26.020
Yes, I did. I tried out

01:53:26.620 --> 01:53:33.180
Plasma on fedora, which isn't five point five. It's five point four. But meanwhile, I'm running five five one, bro

01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:37.020
But I did I did have a few

01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:40.580
Ideas as to you know, like

01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:44.200
What's going on here and everything? I think that

01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:51.500
At Katie East biggest problem is every time they're doing this like rewrite like with four and five. They basically end up

01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:56.320
basically creating the same thing just only shinier and

01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:02.040
That's that's my biggest problem I notice a tough criticism right because

01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:03.520
The you know

01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:08.920
You have to acknowledge the fact that they watch the gnome project sort of hit the reset button and in the massive backlash

01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:13.960
So in a way it I think and and and I don't disagree with you at the same time

01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:17.180
I think you're right, but at the same time I almost feel obliged to acknowledge

01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:19.880
the unprecedented

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:23.240
Task that they took on by

01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:26.160
recreating so much of the standard

01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:33.080
Plasma desktop KDE desktop paradigm in plasma 5 that you can actually make that criticism now

01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:34.620
I am NOT minimizing your criticism

01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:39.360
But what I'm trying to say is they so amazingly recreated the functionality

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:46.040
Productivity and workspace environment of their previous desktop that you can actually make the criticism that they didn't change enough

01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:50.920
Unlike gnome 2 to gnome 3. Do you follow my logic there? Oh, yeah, I that's actually

01:54:51.880 --> 01:54:57.200
My biggest complaint there is that not enough does has seemed to progress

01:54:57.960 --> 01:54:58.920
for instance

01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:04.760
Why is phonon which is your which is actually what's giving you your sound issues?

01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:10.840
Why is that still a thing right now? Why don't they just directly use pulse audio instead?

01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:16.600
Yeah, I follow you I do all right when but we got him with let's move forward

01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:19.840
Man, wimpy you want to talk a little about how Rami hooked you up. Tell me about that

01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:27.840
Yes, so he sent an email to both of us and said if we wanted to play with P wikis running a free server

01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:32.680
for open source projects and I said I've got a new project in the offing and

01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:38.520
He sorted me all out. So I've been having a play. It's really good. Really like like me

01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:46.560
Like podcast tracking tastic good. Yeah. Yeah, this is this is it's really terrific

01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:50.560
So I've had a little play I didn't have to set the back end up

01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:56.800
so I'm really grateful to Remi Van Elst for sorting that out and I've just been able to tinker with the front end and

01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:01.000
There the little bit of JavaScript that you invent in bed

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:08.640
Yeah, there are some tips and tricks on how you can augment that to suit your particular use case. So you can even create

01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:12.040
Specific URLs to track

01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:18.920
File extension types that aren't supported by the defaults and all sorts of good stuff. So oh, yeah

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:25.680
So you're so in other words you maybe could do potentially some podcast download tracking or ISO download tracking, right?

01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:29.160
It's things like that like actual distro tracks stats tracking. Yeah

01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:35.120
So I was interested in distro tracking. Yeah, sure and podcast tracking podcast trackings there by default

01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:41.560
Distro tracking is there to some extent but like torrents for example dot torrent file. Oh, man

01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:49.320
Almost on track of those but not the ISOs. Yeah, so by doing a little bit of research. I've been able to link

01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:56.800
P wick into a private torrent tracker so that I can do full torrent tracking and get better

01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:02.200
Benchmark, so I'm I'm suitably impressed. Yeah, so here's my only

01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:06.680
Consideration. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yes big props to Remy

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:11.360
Thank you, Remy listened to last episode and he emailed both wimpy and I and he set up a demo for us

01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:13.000
It was super cool

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:19.600
Here's my here's my only concern and this is something that we are debating internally at JB and I'm curious to hear your thoughts on it is

01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:23.480
Sometimes we need to be able to like

01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:27.320
Sometimes I'll say, you know 100,000 people are gonna listen to this episode, right?

01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:30.400
And but I actually have to prove that to serve it right

01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:30.600
Yeah

01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:36.320
And so do you feel like people would believe these numbers or because like it's kind of important to me to be able to

01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:38.680
Cite something that people trust

01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:44.240
So if you show somebody Google Analytics, they believe it because it's Google Analytics

01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:50.300
But not necessarily because of what you may have done to massage the numbers behind it

01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:52.140
these

01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:57.980
Statistics and then the project that I'm I'm setting up at the moment isn't live. So it isn't getting a vast amount of

01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:00.840
traffic through the site

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:07.260
But the information that is being gathered is far richer and far more useful and far

01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:14.360
Oh, really? Wow. Oh god. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That sort of seals the deal right there as into like the

01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:21.840
Distribution that you're using on your oh, I would love to know that. Yeah. Yeah, it's really it's really great. Oh

01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:27.880
All right, that almost there so so so the deepness of the statistics is you know

01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:31.680
That the kind of data you can expose is much more interesting

01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:38.140
So you are able to get genuinely important information without sort of contributing to a more broader surveillance system

01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:44.980
Yes, because although Remy is running this he's running it for open source and free culture projects

01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:49.980
So I'm very thankful that Remy has set this up and also for anyone listening

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:57.100
Remy is a first-class sysadmin who deals with reliability engineering and clustering and scalability problems

01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:59.020
So he knows what he's doing. Yeah, he's a frequent

01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:05.180
He's a frequent contributor to our tech SAP tech snap subreddit and has helped some he's he's contributed some great content to our tech

01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:09.980
Snap show and also to the Ubuntu podcast and alas, too. It's a last two

01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:14.420
He's one of his scripts has been a desktop app pick or a spotlight in the past, too

01:59:14.420 --> 01:59:20.300
He's been really good. Yeah, and he also wrote a utility to track. Let's encrypt certificate expiry recently

01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:25.140
Yeah, he's you know, he knows he knows his onions

01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:33.860
Now whilst I'm relying on what Remy has set up if I wanted to take that whole package and self-host it so that I wasn't

01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:40.100
Taking any data outside and therefore I didn't have to carry those. We're tracking you, you know cookie

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:45.140
Messages that you you have to do then you can do that. You can bring the whole thing in

01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:47.980
Into your own infrastructure and do it all yourself

01:59:48.620 --> 01:59:55.340
Yeah, and it sounds like it's actually pretty straightforward to do that too, which is yeah, and if you need an expert Remy knows what he's doing

01:59:57.380 --> 02:00:01.340
Yeah, I think I'm gonna reconsider now it's not current it's not like I can't do it right now

02:00:01.340 --> 02:00:05.140
But I'm thinking early next year. It might be something that we don't the roadman

02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:08.560
but if you've if you've got one of your because you've got lots of sort of

02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:14.500
Off-spin domains and things like that and subdomains like for example, I'm looking at

02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:20.100
JB bot dot Jupiter colony right and mumble dot Jupiter colony comm yeah

02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:25.100
If you were just to take a few of those and talk to Remy and just embed

02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:31.920
Tracking references into a few of those subdomains because you can run it alongside Google Analytics, which is what I've been doing

02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:36.080
so I've got both trackers in the code of my

02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:43.160
New domain at the moment to sort of compare the two and getting much better information out of P WIC interesting

02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:47.720
That's awesome more useful to me at least I would love to replace it across the board to be honest with you

02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:52.520
Yeah, but you can you can you know have a you know, suck it and see trial

02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:56.840
Yeah, you know in a small in a small way. Yeah, that is really thank you for letting me know

02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:58.900
I that is that makes me pretty excited to try it

02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:03.880
I was a little apprehensive so I'm kind of glad to get that real-world use. Yes. Yes

02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:09.160
All right. So there you go. And you know what? I think our title should be mycroft and chili. That sounds pretty good

02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:13.740
I mean doesn't it's great doesn't it calm the ubi con doesn't cover ubi con but it has have 21 boats

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.840
Versus 12 boats that seems like where we got to go. I may have gained that

02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:22.600
I'm not even mentioning the third option there Chris. I see what is the third of Chris last pronounces something correctly

02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:25.480
Yeah, I know that was a landmark event. Let's be honest here

02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:47.160
And Chris last at scale. Oh my god. Not bad either. Oh my gosh. I can't wait to tell Ange about that
