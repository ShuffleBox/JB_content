1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now, Wes, I know that you, maybe not home automation, so to speak, but you have found

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,880
a way to do a lot of little things with free and open source technology, right?

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,040
Like the open source Plex alternative.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,520
Are you familiar with anything that you might not think off the bat could be home automation,

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,640
but in fact could be?

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,640
What do you mean?

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
Say that again.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,240
So I think a lot of people wouldn't necessarily consider Plex to be part of a home automation

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,640
thing, but I would because it goes into the home theater, goes into the living room, goes

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,880
into the master bedroom, wherever, and then provides essentially automated media, right?

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,520
I can access my media on demand.

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,200
I would consider that part of my automation system.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm wondering if you know of any other, if you have any other suggestions or any other

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,740
ideas or anything else that you've tried like that, that one could use to free and open

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,920
source-ally automate one's home.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,920
Yeah.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, one I was just looking at is a, I know many people frown on it, but frequently I'm

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,920
faced with routers that use UPnP.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
Yes.

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,000
And, you know, some applications are UPnP aware and they will automatically forward

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,560
the ports, but some are not.

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,120
And sometimes, you know, maybe you're visiting a family member or who may not even know the

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,440
admin password to their router.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,080
You're in a situation where you don't have the freedom to open ports willy-nilly as you

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
see fit.

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,080
Right.

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,640
And for that, I found a nice little UPnP-C, it's called, or UPnP-D that have a daemon

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,440
and a client, and it lets you to interact with any UPnP-compliant router to specify

29
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,280
ports to forward or delete port forwards as you want, so you can customize it for whatever

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,020
application you're using.

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,020
That's awesome.

32
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,680
See, I do, as a network security guy, I do have some reservations about using UPnP.

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,400
You know, and I do as well.

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,140
But sometimes you're on a network where it's already enabled and you just have to work

35
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,140
with it.

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,140
You know, if you're...

37
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,140
Yeah.

38
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,140
So, I found it useful there.

39
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,140
I personally don't use it at home, but...

40
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,640
And it sure is convenient, isn't it?

41
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
Oh, yeah.

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
It's awesome.

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,960
You know, and they also have, they have like the project that's doing it, they have a user

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,240
space implementation, a lot of the BSD, TCP, IP stack, and so they also use that to provide

45
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
the daemon.

46
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,080
So, if you did want to use UPnP and you didn't have a device that used it, you can use their

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,100
daemon protocol to run it yourself if you'd like to have it stick it on your PFSense box

48
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,480
or anything else.

49
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,040
Why you would do that, I don't know, but you can.

50
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,800
That's the beauty of free and open source.

51
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,880
Why did you say that you think that some people frown on it?

52
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,600
Is it just the UPnP aspect?

53
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Yeah.

54
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,560
You know, I mean, I think a lot of people, and I know certainly Alan's talked about it,

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,280
but just that, you know, the idea of people opening ports in your firewall without your

56
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,760
express permission or especially apps, maybe you're running proprietary applications that

57
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,200
you don't, you know, you don't really have a handle on what it is they're sending.

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
Right.

59
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,840
So, that's a big problem that I see, you know, and that's why I don't use it on my own home

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,640
network, but I know like in my parents' house, they have a ISP provided router that is UPnP

61
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,040
and client, and well, I do have their, you know, admin password.

62
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,240
Sometimes it's just easier if you're not, you know, I'm not going to be there for a

63
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
long time.

64
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
I don't need to leave a hole in their firewall.

65
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,240
I can just open it up while I'm there.

66
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
Sure.

67
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,520
Well, that does sound really cool.

68
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,700
I'll have to check that out.

69
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,120
Maybe we can get a link in the show notes and then people can go check that out.

70
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,240
Have you heard of Icebergs.io?

71
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,520
I was just checking that out this morning, actually.

72
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Really?

73
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,620
So, I had not heard of it before, but apparently Icebergs.io, Ubuntu with an XFCE gives a

74
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,200
highly productive desktop experience in the browser with a quick and responsive on an

75
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
all-modern internet connection.

76
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,840
Now, they've actually optimized for touch devices, so you can run it on your phone,

77
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,000
for example, and you can access what essentially is a mobile operating system through a web

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
browser.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Do I have that right?

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah, absolutely.

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,080
You know, I just tried out the free account that gives you two compute hours a month,

82
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,840
and it also won't save, so anytime you're done with it, whenever you turn it off, it's

83
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
gone.

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,680
Whereas if you upgrade to a paid plan, then they'll be persistent.

85
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,320
How do they calculate a compute hour?

86
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
You know, I'm not sure.

87
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,080
I haven't looked into that yet, but that will be the sticking point because while they do

88
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,480
give you, the first paid plan I think is like $10 a month, and they give you two instances,

89
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,360
but you're also limited to compute hours there as well.

90
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,720
25 of them, if I'm not mistaken, right?

91
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
Yes, I believe so.

92
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,600
I think you can have multiple instances running, and each of those adds up to your compute

93
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
hours, but exactly how that gets built, we should check that out.

94
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
I was impressed though.

95
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,660
You know, it took a little bit to start up, but once everything was going, it was surprisingly

96
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,800
responsive and pretty easy to use.

97
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,640
Now for $9 a month, I could see this being really useful, and I've actually tried to

98
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
implement this.

99
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
I don't know.

100
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
Have you played with X2Go very much?

101
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Yes.

102
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Yes, I have.

103
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,240
You know, I frequently recommend it to people just because it's so easy to start using,

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,200
and it works a lot faster than most of the other alternatives.

105
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,000
So yes, I don't think I would...

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
For the price point of Icebergs.io, I'm not sure it's there for me yet.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,680
Oh, really?

108
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,040
Well, that depends.

109
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,720
That depends on how willing you are to roll your own solution.

110
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, that's true.

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's true.

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,920
Because if you already have the skills or the infrastructure to set up an X2Go server

113
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,680
with an environment of your choosing, provided you have enough bandwidth, then that would

114
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,120
probably be my preferred solution.

115
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,680
But I am intrigued by the idea of desktop Linux in the browser at a whim, kind of.

116
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
You know, so there are a couple of things that stand out to me.

117
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,160
One is, if you go with the service type solution, you're essentially cloudifying your existence,

118
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,880
and in doing so, you're losing control of your data.

119
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,400
One of the things I like about my X2Go machine is that it physically sits inside of my office.

120
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,400
I can go put my hand on it, and I know where that hard drive is at all times.

121
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,600
And there are some additional benefits to having that device physically located in a

122
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
place I can get to it.

123
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,520
For example, I have a little SATA hard drive reader that is plugged into my X2Go machine.

124
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,560
And so, if I have a lot of things off a staff member, they'll say, hey, boss, you know,

125
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,680
we're doing XYZ, and we're having a problem with it, and you know, I can't get this file

126
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,600
to open, or I can't get this file to do this, or I can't get these permissions done on this.

127
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,360
And I'll say, well, just take the hard drive and stick it into my drive reader.

128
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,760
And they can put it into the drive reader, and then from wherever I am, I can access

129
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
that data.

130
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,620
And then I can, you know, I can move it over to my laptop so I can work with it locally

131
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,800
if I need to, or 90% of the time, 99% of the time, I can get my work done actually on the

132
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,360
X2Go machine, provided I have a decent internet connection.

133
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,480
And that is, that's something that no matter how robust and how cool Iceberg becomes, I'll

134
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,520
always be missing that functionality, right?

135
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,040
So, it limits my ability to scale, I think, a little bit.

136
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,440
You know, I would, I would agree, and I think it ties into a lot of what some of our user

137
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,400
base, you know, a lot of the Linux user base has problems with a lot of proprietary software,

138
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,260
you know, one for maybe philosophical reasons, but also just because when you hit the edges

139
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,400
of things, you know, when you hit, you try to stretch something to a little bit different

140
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,920
purpose, or you need to customize something on a one-off thing, you're met with boundaries.

141
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,160
Whereas if you've rolled it yourself, you used free open source software, time is just

142
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,760
the limit for how much you can accomplish, you know, on the thing of the day.

143
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,520
Something though, that's interesting that it's like, it's kind of like a similar option,

144
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,240
but it's more of a app-based thing.

145
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,840
It's called RollApp, and it's rollapp.com.

146
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:23,720
And basically it does a server rendering of an application to your web browser, and it

147
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,680
also works on your phone too.

148
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,840
So in a way, like I've tested it and you can actually like use LibreOffice on your phone

149
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
through this service.

150
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
Wow.

151
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
Wow.

152
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
That sounds slick.

153
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,960
It's actually like $7 a month or something, and you get like unlimited usage or whatever.

154
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,800
And it's impressive.

155
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,360
Like it works on your phone, it works on your tablet, it works on your web browser, and

156
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,560
it does like all different kinds of apps.

157
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,920
Like I think their total count is like 200 or something, but I tested with LibreOffice

158
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,320
and it actually is like not the most latest version, but it is like the next latest.

159
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,680
So like 5.0.1 or something like that.

160
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Sure, sure.

161
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,560
But it actually works quite well, and they have like custom features built into the app

162
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,480
so that you have like double tap or two finger tap the phone to lay out a toolbar and all

163
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
kinds of stuff.

164
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,220
Like it's pretty impressive.

165
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,280
Can you give us an idea or an example of something that you've used with it?

166
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,760
I've just used LibreOffice with it so far.

167
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Okay.

168
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Okay.

169
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,200
Yeah, but actually even that alone, I could see tremendous use case for it.

170
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Yeah.

171
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
And it actually supports GIMP too.

172
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Oh wow, really?

173
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,000
You can do imaging and everything, yeah.

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,240
Can you imagine the practicality of doing that?

175
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,440
Can you imagine the practicality of like modifying this image, like especially with like a touchscreen

176
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
device or something?

177
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,720
I know people are already complaining about GIMP's UI and now we'll hear no end to it.

178
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Yeah, yeah.

179
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
Exactly.

180
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Exactly, right?

181
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,240
In this case, you could probably maybe if you had like the single window mode is what

182
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,040
is necessary for like desktop stuff, but maybe on the phone, the separate windows would be

183
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,360
better because you could like full screen on the phone each of the windows.

184
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,640
I don't know, it might be a better solution.

185
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,280
Yeah.

186
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,200
So when Chris was here, we did some electrical upgrades to the RV.

187
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,640
I don't know if some of you, if you're patrons, you got the email from it and he actually

188
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,640
recorded a video.

189
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
That's pretty cool.

190
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,200
But essentially what we've tried to do is get everything to run off of 12 volts and

191
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,560
the advantage of that DC 12 volt is that one is he can charge on the solar panel and two

192
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
is he can actually run all of his equipment then off of those batteries.

193
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,120
So he's not reliant upon AC power.

194
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,240
I don't know, Wes or Rotten Corpse, have you guys had any experience with self-sufficient

195
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
powering yourself?

196
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Not myself.

197
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,680
I have some friends who live on the big island of Hawaii and they're working on setting up

198
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,240
a hydroelectric system.

199
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,880
Oh, cool.

200
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,560
But before that, they were kind of reliant on friends' use of electricity to charge a

201
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,320
lot of the batteries they had, so they had already converted a lot of their infrastructure

202
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,120
to DC when they started playing around with this hydro.

203
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,360
So it was kind of interesting to see, you know, they had lots of, kind of the same kind

204
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,360
of modular setup, kind of plugging everything, every which way with those, they had the same

205
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,440
kind of connectors you were highlighting on the show.

206
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Really?

207
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Yeah.

208
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
The Anderson Power Bowls.

209
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Yeah, yeah.

210
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,880
They were, they were showing, I didn't remember the name, but when you, when you show that

211
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,480
on the show, I was like, oh, those, that's exactly what they had going on.

212
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,600
You know, I don't mean to go fanboyish, but I absolutely love Anderson Power Bowls.

213
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,160
If you're not familiar with them, they are genderless low voltage connectors.

214
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,120
And so essentially they'll handle up to like 30 amps, the small ones, they have bigger

215
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,340
ones that'll handle like up to 250 amps, but it's a different, it's a, it's a bigger version

216
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,960
of the, of the smaller Anderson Power Bowl.

217
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,800
But the 30 amp guys, they, you can put them on to, I've used them on 12-Aug wire, I've

218
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,000
used them on, I think I've used them as high as 10-Aug wire and as small as 18-Aug wire.

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,720
You have to fold the 18 over a little bit and use some solder, but the nice thing is

220
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
they're genderless.

221
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,040
So you don't have to decide, is this going to be a power receiving source or a power

222
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,800
providing source?

223
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,600
You can, you, they can, you can be interchangeable with it.

224
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,920
And that's the case when it comes to something like a battery, sometimes the battery is providing

225
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,040
the energy and other times the batteries is receiving the energy from like a charger.

226
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,460
And so it, it offers a tremendous amount of flexibility and because of the standardization,

227
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:18,280
it will hopefully the idea is that it will give Chris the freedom to plug things in willy

228
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
nilly.

229
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,360
If he has to make a change on the fly, that becomes, you know, very big, very easy to

230
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
do.

231
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,960
Now it's interesting that you say that they're using, that they're using hydroelectric.

232
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,840
And that's DC because if you're, you, if you start with DC, if you generate DC and then

233
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,880
you run it off of DC, you're not losing any energy in a conversion process.

234
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Right, right.

235
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
Yeah.

236
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
I think that's what they were going for.

237
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,720
You know, once they've got that running, they'll almost be self-sufficient except they, they're

238
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,960
still importing a large amount of propane for, for a lot of their utilities, but, but

239
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,760
other than that, they're, they've got their own farm going.

240
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
It's quite the project.

241
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Awesome.

242
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,200
Anything else we want to cover in the pre-show before we get started?

243
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,320
I mean, if you want to go back to the icebergs thing, you could mention that there's os.js

244
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,920
if you wanted to.

245
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,720
Tell me about os.js.

246
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,680
It's a JavaScript based operating system thing and it's not full fledged or anything, but

247
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,280
it is legitimately ran through the browser, like dependent on the browser.

248
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
Okay.

249
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,360
So it's, it's, it has got a few, it's got a, it's mostly web app based, but it has other

250
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
things too.

251
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,640
Like it can run stuff on the backend and it, you can like put it, you can, you can install

252
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:33,000
it on like a DO droplet or something and have a interesting operating system available at

253
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
any time.

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,040
It's not, it's not like X2GO or anything, but it's still interesting.

255
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,960
See that, anything that, anything that I can install on top of a droplet or anything that

256
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:48,040
I can install quickly and then access everywhere has, has huge appeal to me because I can think

257
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,040
of so many practical places of where I could, where I could use something like that.

258
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
Have you tried it?

259
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
Yeah, I've tried it.

260
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,200
I haven't, I haven't put it on my own droplet, but I've tried their demo and it's, it's interesting.

261
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,680
It actually has like its own custom UI and everything and it runs apps pretty fast.

262
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,140
I mean, if you have to have a pretty good machine to do it though.

263
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,600
But it's, all I can say is interesting.

264
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,760
It's not practical at all right now, but it is, it is fun to play with.

265
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,960
You know, the nice thing about having its own UI is I bet it actually runs a little

266
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,680
bit more efficiently inside of a web browser then, huh?

267
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
Oh yeah.

268
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,680
It actually has like, I mean, I can't really describe the UI, but it had like the menu

269
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,440
system it uses is similar to like a Gnome 2 style.

270
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Wow.

271
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,800
Do you know what the, the license is on that?

272
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
I'm pretty sure.

273
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
I know it's open source.

274
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,160
I'm pretty sure it's GPL'd.

275
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
That's that's awesome.

276
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,760
I, I, I'll have to take a look at that there.

277
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,160
My problem is when I run into things that like compete with something that is already

278
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,680
working so well, I have a hard time prying myself off of my current solution.

279
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,020
So for example, in this case, X2GO has worked for me so well and I've been able to get so

280
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,920
much done with X2GO that I'm having a really hard time.

281
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,400
I would have a really hard time prying myself away from X2GO to, to, to try something else

282
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,180
even if that something else is better and, and it wouldn't be the first time that I've

283
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:17,760
gone back and decided, oh yeah, actually, you know, XYZ worked a lot better the second

284
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
time around.

285
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,760
I just didn't know that it existed.

286
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
Yeah.

287
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
Okay.

288
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,680
So this one doesn't have, it's not GPL'd, it's a license that technically would be compatible,

289
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,400
but it's very limited in the license.

290
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:33,680
It's basically just keep the copyright there and then whatever else, you know, user your

291
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,680
own risk type thing.

292
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,080
But I wouldn't say that this was better than X2GO.

293
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,480
I think that X2GO is probably the best solution for someone who wants to roll their own cloud

294
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,800
based servers or desktop, whatever.

295
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,720
But I would say that if somebody wants just to kind of run stuff through the web roll

296
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,400
app is definitely worth looking into, especially considering you'd have like LibreOffice on

297
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,000
your phone and you could also roll it out to like hundreds of people and have the same

298
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,280
version available to all of them.

299
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
That's pretty awesome.

300
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,720
And you know, the thing is X2GO, I know that there are extensions that you go run inside

301
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,740
of Firefox, but primarily it's designed to be run inside of its own native client app.

302
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,740
It's not, you know what I mean?

303
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,440
It wasn't really designed to run, you know, in the browser.

304
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,720
So something that is, that is designed from the ground up to run in the browser, I like

305
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,600
again, I would think that would be a little bit more efficient, maybe have a little bit

306
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,040
more pleasant of an experience to it.

307
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:45,920
This is Linux Unplugged episode 112 for September 29th, 2015.

308
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,040
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux show that's being brought to you today by

309
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,680
nothing short of a freaking miracle.

310
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,680
My name is Nolan, joining me from the Seattle studio is Wes.

311
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,480
Hey guys, it's Wes, pleasure to be here.

312
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,960
Now it's my honor and privilege to step in anytime Chris is off exploring somewhere yonder

313
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,300
this week, as it turns out in Utah, in the Jupiter Rover.

314
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,620
By the way, did you know that you can get minute by minute updates and follow his adventures

315
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,120
over at JupiterBroadcasting.com slash Rover?

316
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,080
Some of you might be wondering what I meant when I said that the show is being brought

317
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,960
to you today by a miracle.

318
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,360
And the answer actually starts back on Saturday at the meetup.

319
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,940
So first of all, huge shout out to North Ranger, who's in our chat room right now.

320
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,560
And everyone else that made the meetup on Saturday in Grand Forks, following Chris's

321
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,440
arrival and then subsequently his departure.

322
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,680
We were sitting down, we're having pizza, and we started talking about what the rest

323
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,580
of Chris's trip is going to look like.

324
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,840
And it is going to be, he's going through Utah.

325
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,960
And so we laid out a map, a route for him to take, and we're all kind of figuring that

326
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
out.

327
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:55,960
And if he had the cellular connectivity over his planned route, he was not going to have

328
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
coverage.

329
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,840
And if he did have coverage, he would have to drive like 10 hours in between Koda Radio

330
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,160
and Linux Unplugged to make both shows work.

331
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
That sounds fun.

332
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
Yeah, it sounded great, right?

333
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
It sounds like a great one.

334
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,280
So Sunday, he figured that out and he goes, you know, would you mind stepping up and helping

335
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
do the show?

336
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,880
And I said, yeah, I would love to, because Linux Unplugged is one of my favorite shows.

337
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,520
I love the community aspect and I'm friends with a lot of the people in the mumble room.

338
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,960
So it's kind of fun that instead of just, you know, chewing the straw off the air, you

339
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:27,800
know, at two in the morning, now we can all be on air and have productive conversations.

340
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,440
But the studio wasn't really set up for that because when Chris got here, we had reorganized

341
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,340
the way the studio was set up to accommodate the shows that he wanted to do in the way

342
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,540
that he wanted to do them.

343
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,900
And then additionally, my studio isn't really set up for hosting shows with music coming

344
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,800
in and all of this other stuff.

345
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,680
So I ended up buying some more audio interfaces and some new cables and redid everything Monday

346
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,640
to make things just more smooth so that we could go on the air and do this today.

347
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,960
Tuesday I wake up and my first trouble call is not from a client.

348
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,660
It's from my own office and my staff calls me and they're like, hey boss, guess what?

349
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,160
The internet went out today.

350
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,520
And I'm thinking, oh no, this isn't good.

351
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Yeah.

352
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
No, we're an IT company.

353
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
We can't not have internet.

354
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
We have no access to emails.

355
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,920
We have no access to our SIP phone system.

356
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,380
We have no access to our work order system.

357
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,680
We can't get to the call center.

358
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,000
I have no idea what's going on in my own company and as I'm trying to sort that headache out,

359
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
it dawns on me.

360
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,860
Oh no, I have luck this afternoon.

361
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,260
So I immediately stop what I'm doing and I'm like, you guys fix the internet.

362
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,220
I have to get stuff ready so I can do love in a couple of hours.

363
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,220
So I start, I grabbed extra mixers and I'm grabbing audio cables and I'm grabbing cables

364
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,880
and microphones and I'm, I have all this stuff in my arms and I'm running down.

365
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,080
And Wes, have you ever done this thing where your arms are full and you start trying to

366
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,200
like fish your keys out with your pinky and you're like, you don't want to drop anything,

367
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,900
but you're, you don't, there's no real way to set a clump of stuff down.

368
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,280
Every moment knowing you're going closer and closer to everything on the ground.

369
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
Yes.

370
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Exactly.

371
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,420
So I'm doing that and I finally fish my keys out and I get the car unlocked and then it

372
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,000
dawns on me, where am I going to go?

373
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Where am I going to go?

374
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Because I can't go home.

375
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,600
My house is for sale and there's an open house today.

376
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,200
And even if there wasn't an open house today, people are looking at the house every couple

377
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
of hours.

378
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,740
And even if that weren't the case, I have two kids, two dogs and one wife, a Learjet

379
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,580
taking off is more quiet than my house is.

380
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,480
And so I decided I'm going to take over my in-laws house.

381
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,200
I'll just, I'll go over there and I'll set up all of my stuff and I'll just, I will do

382
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,280
the show from my in-laws house, all willy nilly like, and kick them out of their house.

383
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,680
That seemed like a good idea.

384
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
Easy peasy.

385
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
Yeah.

386
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,320
And thank God it didn't actually come to that.

387
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,400
Mid continent in their infinite wisdom was able to get the problem resolved very quickly.

388
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,540
Made a call with within one hour, they had an internet backup and I'm able to safely

389
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:42,240
do the show from my studio and we seem to have a working internet connection out to

390
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Seattle.

391
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,320
And so Wes can join me and thus this is Linux Unplugged and we have a cool show, I think

392
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
lined up.

393
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
Don't we?

394
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
Yes, we do.

395
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Oh man.

396
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
That is quite the story.

397
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
It's wonderful to be here with you.

398
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
And now I know all that.

399
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Yeah.

400
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,560
So I want to start out first with a, with a little bit of feedback.

401
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,840
Our first piece of feedback comes in from Mathis and he writes in with hi DPI versus

402
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
VGA.

403
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,600
And he goes, hi Wes and Noah, in three years I will still have my VGA ports for two reasons.

404
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,960
One, VGA will still be a superior connector and two, CRT monitors that will, that I will

405
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,360
still be using only have VGA, I think, and RCA.

406
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,840
Appreciate and love all your netcasts, Mathis.

407
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,120
I wanted to get your take on that.

408
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,160
Do you think that VGA is still going to be a thing in, in the next five years?

409
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,520
Well, we'll see.

410
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,100
I didn't think laptops with less than full HD would be a thing three years ago, but it

411
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
still is.

412
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,400
So I could see them still having VGA connectors.

413
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
I can too.

414
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,040
You know, and it, it's a decent form factor.

415
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,000
It does, you know, it's analog, so it just, just works even if it's not, you know, it

416
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
doesn't have fancy features.

417
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You can't really chain it.

418
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,600
It doesn't, you know, it doesn't have the, the kind of resolution that a lot of us would

419
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,880
like to see these days.

420
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,900
I imagine that at least some section of the hardware market will still contain VGA.

421
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,900
Will I be using it?

422
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,900
Huh?

423
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,900
We'll see.

424
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,900
I think so too.

425
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,000
I, I agree with him when he says that VGA is a superior connector, if only because of

426
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,200
the two little knobs on the side.

427
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Oh, I love the knobs.

428
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,000
Yeah, me too, because then you can securely connect it to the freaking computer.

429
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So it doesn't get ripped out.

430
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,120
It makes tons of sense.

431
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,400
I don't know why we went away from that.

432
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,800
And you know, the same thing could be said about serial versus USB the, the, the DB nine

433
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,200
connector had little screw things.

434
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,040
And like when you attach one of those puppies to the computer, it never crossed your mind

435
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,120
if the cable was going to get pulled out or become disconnected.

436
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,600
Like that just wasn't a thing.

437
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
It worked.

438
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Yeah.

439
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,520
If it was connected and it was tied down, it worked and you can trust that it was basically

440
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,720
as secure as having it on the inside of the computer unless of course somebody like tried

441
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,460
to climb up the back of the tower or something.

442
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,800
You weren't going to break it off.

443
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,920
And these days, like even before we started the show, I had to restart my machine because

444
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,880
my USB connector came unplugged from the, from the computer.

445
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,920
So I agree with you that it's, that it's a superior connector.

446
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,040
I think that the lack of screen real estate is enough to make me switch.

447
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,040
And I think it's going to be enough to make a lot of other people switch.

448
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,400
I also find it convenient even just when I'm short on, you know, maybe I don't have splitters

449
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,880
or I'm in a different situation and just, just having the extra VGA port that a lot

450
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,240
of computers do have means I can, you know, have an extra monitor that I might not otherwise

451
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,600
get without buying a specialty piece of hardware.

452
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,720
Very good.

453
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,880
Over at reddit.com slash r slash Linux action show, you can submit things of interest for

454
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,800
this show or for our big show every week, the Linux action show.

455
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,600
Twist X 77 writes in and he says, hi Chris, I've been a list, I've been a Linux tester

456
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,360
for more than 10 years, but I've never actually had the possibility to use Linux as my main

457
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
OS.

458
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,520
I have finally done that almost two years ago and I'm really happy with Ubuntu Gnome.

459
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,440
Well, I wanted to let you know that all my electronic devices today use an ACE that use

460
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,440
an AC, have an internal rectifier and a regulator.

461
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,960
So they end up using DC so many, so many times, just bypassing the rectifier part, you can

462
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,240
hook up 12 volt or 24 volt directly from your RV's DC supply.

463
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,880
I guess you probably, you guys already know that anyway, I'm an electrical engineer.

464
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,200
And so if you want to know how to use a soldering iron, I could help you bypass those AC devices

465
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,440
and use DC when possible.

466
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,560
So let me know if you need any help with any electronic related problems.

467
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,320
Last but not least, thanks for the great shows.

468
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,760
I listened to you guys when going to work almost every day.

469
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,680
Well thank you so much for writing and we really appreciate it.

470
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,800
Actually I do have an electrical question for you.

471
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Oh, perfect.

472
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Yeah, I did.

473
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Yeah, that worked out right.

474
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:31,440
So Chris has a compressor gate combo that runs on nine volt AC and I want to get it

475
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,760
to preferable, eventually I need to get it to 12 volt DC, but I can live with a nine

476
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,880
volt DC because I already have a step-down transformer from a 12 volt DC to nine volt

477
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880
DC.

478
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,160
You could help me solve that problem.

479
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,520
That would be a huge help.

480
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,080
Jupiter broadcasting.com click on the contact link, choose Linux unplugged from the dropdown

481
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,080
menu.

482
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,280
And if you have a solution for that, or you would like to help me come up with a solution

483
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,920
for that, that would be amazing.

484
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,440
At the moment, to my knowledge, that's the only remaining thing that he has in the camper

485
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,480
that he has to have on day-to-day production that isn't running on DC, so that'd be really

486
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,920
cool if we could get that solved.

487
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,480
Wes, have you been following Chris at the tracker?

488
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
Yes I have.

489
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,420
You know, it's a weird little voyeurism, but it's very enjoyable just to be able to kind

490
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,800
of creep along as he adventures across the West.

491
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,600
Did you watch him when he arrived into Grand Fork?

492
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Yes I did.

493
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,400
It was awesome.

494
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:31,380
I, it's been kind of funny because the tracker is actually in the truck, not in the RV itself.

495
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:37,360
And so when he goes to like the market or whatever else, it's kind of funny because

496
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,520
like people will come over and like knock on the door and say, oh hey, how's it going?

497
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
Or they'll come find us, or him rather.

498
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,960
In fact, I had even one of my employees took a selfie with the JB Rover.

499
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,040
Oh wow, that's awesome.

500
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,760
Yeah, he was trying to find me and I had left my phone at home.

501
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,720
So he's like, oh, I'll just use a little Rover thing and I'll go find Chris.

502
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
It was pretty neat.

503
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,840
You know, I actually, I was looking at the equipment that he was using.

504
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,920
Chris was showing me in detail how that Silver Cloud thing was working.

505
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:11,000
And I actually went over to Amazon and I found a box for 35 bucks that kind of does the same

506
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,880
thing where they will update your, where they'll update your status.

507
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,160
But instead of charging like a monthly like account that you have to put money into in

508
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:26,440
order to get a certain amount of updates, essentially you just provide your own GSM

509
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,800
card and then it will update.

510
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Isn't that kind of cool?

511
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
Oh, that sounds really neat.

512
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,560
Kind of roll your own service and as long as you can, as long as you can reach them,

513
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,120
they'll give you updates.

514
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
Exactly.

515
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,480
And I'm thinking I could get the cost down on this.

516
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,800
I'm going to have to run this by Chris, but if, if someone were to go to linux.ting.com

517
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,840
and you, you, the SIM cards right now are on sale for five bucks, so you could buy this

518
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,640
SIM card for five bucks and, but you get $25 of credit, so you could use the rest of the

519
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,640
$20 credit to pay for the first month of service.

520
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,560
And with Ting, you're only going to pay for what you use.

521
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,440
So in my case, what I'm talking about here is I would only be using data.

522
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,680
I would just be updating my locations.

523
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,680
I wouldn't be using text messages and I wouldn't be making phone calls.

524
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,480
And so I'm not going to pay for that service.

525
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,400
I'm just going to pay for the data that I'm using.

526
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Of course, if you do plan on sending text messages or making phone calls, they're moderately

527
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,040
priced and you, because it's no contract, you can cancel the service at any time without

528
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,040
any penalty.

529
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,200
So I'd suggest everyone go over to linux.ting.com.

530
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,920
Pick yourself out something nice and use that $25 we're going to get you for being a listener

531
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,240
of the Linux Unplugged Show.

532
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,720
A huge thanks to Ting for sponsoring the show.

533
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,240
And it just goes to show you that the limit of what you can do with those devices is limited

534
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,680
only by your imagination.

535
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,520
You know, Ting really saved my butt this weekend.

536
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,520
I just have to say.

537
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
Oh really?

538
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
Tell me about it.

539
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,960
You know, I was working from home there doing some construction in the office, lots of concrete

540
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,880
dust everywhere, nothing we wanted to be a part of.

541
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,680
And you know, just as my shift was coming to an end, my ISP's connection of course decided

542
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
to fail.

543
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,680
It starts with the letter C.

544
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,160
They planned that, you know?

545
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,400
Yes, I believe that they did.

546
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,320
It was just perfectly timed.

547
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,720
But thanks to Ting, tethering, you know, it just uses your data.

548
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
It's included in your plan.

549
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,800
You don't have to worry about it.

550
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
There's no fuss.

551
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:08,000
So I was able to just spin up my LTE connection on my phone and I was VPN back in in no time.

552
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
It was perfect.

553
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It saved my butt.

554
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
That's for sure.

555
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,520
If I think that I have found the limit of what I can do with Ting, I end up buying another

556
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
device.

557
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,280
Even when we were out, when we were out doing the meetup, I still get questions about that

558
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
little credit card phone.

559
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,680
Have I showed you that or have you seen it?

560
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,760
Oh yeah, that is so cool.

561
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,200
I'm thinking about just getting one.

562
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,360
They seem so handy and you can just, you know, just keep it when you need it.

563
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,400
And dude, they're 30 freaking dollars.

564
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
That's amazing.

565
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,600
Yeah, you can buy a brand new phone for 30 freaking dollars and you throw that $5 SIM

566
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,680
card in there, which by the way, you won't pay for because Ting's going to give it to

567
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:43,120
you for free by going to linux.ting.com and then you have $20 of service credit.

568
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,800
And if you're like me, that paid for, that paid for my first month of service.

569
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,280
And then if even with my wife and me and my son and my dad, who's all of which are on

570
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,560
my plan now, I would still probably get a good chunk of that month paid for.

571
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,760
Of course you can just buy a device.

572
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,160
We're going to run over to blog.documentingfoundation.org and they published an article titled today,

573
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,760
headline five years of LibreOffice, LibreOffice was launched as a fork of openoffice.org on

574
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,480
September 28th, 2010 by a tiny group of people representing the community in their capacity

575
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,580
of community project leaders.

576
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,560
At the time it was a brave, although necessary decision because it was rather clear to everyone

577
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,160
that openoffice.org was not going to survive for a long time under Oracle stewardship.

578
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,160
In fact, the group of 16 founders launched an independent free software project under

579
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,680
the stewardship of the Document Foundation to fulfill a promise made by Sun Microsystems

580
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,280
10 years before.

581
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,720
At the time, at the time of the first announcement of openoffice.org of the independent free

582
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,060
software foundation capable of pushing forward the free office suite to the next level.

583
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:50,480
After five years, LibreOffice is acknowledged in the marketplace as the sole Microsoft Office

584
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,500
contender based on sheer feature by feature comparison and on the number of successful

585
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,160
migrations.

586
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,360
Migrating to LibreOffice has never been easier thanks to the migration protocol drafted by

587
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,600
the most experienced people at the Document Foundation, which outlines the best practices

588
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,520
adopted by several large projects worldwide.

589
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,400
A success confirmed by the future of open source survey in 2015, which has put LibreOffice

590
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,200
amongst the most seven valuable open source projects based on the answers provided by

591
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,240
over 1,300 professionals worldwide.

592
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,160
It has been an amazing journey.

593
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,640
In five years, LibreOffice developers have not missed a single time-based release with

594
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,480
major announcements in late January and late July and minor announcements on a monthly

595
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,480
basis.

596
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,840
Thanks to the sustained pace, LibreOffice has reached a richness and feature and a level

597
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,120
of interoperability which are second to none.

598
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,200
I use Office on a daily basis.

599
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
How about you, Wes?

600
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Yeah, pretty much.

601
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,240
Pretty much every day.

602
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
You know what?

603
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,520
I was trained as a Microsoft Office user specialist.

604
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,520
So supposedly, I had these letters after my name that said I was supposed to know something

605
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,160
about an Office suite.

606
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,660
And as Microsoft Office continued to push newer and newer versions out, I found myself

607
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,060
literally getting lost.

608
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,280
And the most embarrassing thing, I think, to date that's ever happened to me in an Office

609
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:17,760
suite was I was giving a presentation, and the presentation computer had the newest version

610
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
of Microsoft Office.

611
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,480
And this is when they switched to Ribbons, right?

612
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:28,640
And I couldn't find a core function, and I had to look up to a group of IT professionals,

613
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
and I'm presenting.

614
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,300
So supposedly, I'm supposed to know something that they don't.

615
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,180
I'm supposed to be teaching them something, and I had to ask them to come up and show

616
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,960
me how to use a function of Microsoft Office.

617
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,360
And it was about that time when I realized I didn't want to be beholden to Microsoft

618
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,080
Office anymore.

619
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:50,020
And I switched to LibreOffice, and ever since then, every client that comes to my company

620
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:55,000
that is looking for help with an Office suite, we move them to LibreOffice as well.

621
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,600
Do you use LibreOffice as like a daily driver, or is it something that you use just to modify

622
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,040
a document or to write a letter or something like that?

623
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:10,360
You know, it's definitely more of the latter, but I kind of started back with OpenOffice.

624
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,460
I wasn't really a Linux user then, but to think about it, back in high school, my high

625
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,940
school actually had Linux on a lot of the workstations.

626
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:23,120
I remember getting in trouble for a long-running C program that I left running on the network.

627
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,400
But we started with OpenOffice, and then I migrated to Microsoft Office when I was in

628
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,620
college, and like you, I was also responsible for doing some training of people using those

629
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,620
suites.

630
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,620
Sure.

631
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,080
And I have just been continually impressed with what the Document Foundation and LibreOffice

632
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,080
have done.

633
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,520
You know, even if you ignore the elephant in the room of Microsoft Office, they have

634
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:51,320
just been able to create a standards-based, very usable productivity suite that if you

635
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,160
use it, especially internally, if it's a consistent deployment, you can pretty much do anything

636
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,160
that you would reasonably need to do efficiently, productively, and in a very pleasant environment.

637
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,760
And they seem very responsive as well, so that new features get added, compatibility

638
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,320
gets improved.

639
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,880
It's really like a testament to the open source software in general.

640
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,560
You know, Wes, I had a chance to head over to Red Hat, and when I was at Red Hat, I was

641
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:20,560
talking to those guys, and I said, how is it that a billion-dollar company, a billion

642
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,600
dollars, how is it that you guys manage to avoid using Microsoft Office?

643
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:30,560
And he said, honestly, when it comes down to it, the basic stuff that you do in an office

644
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
suite is there.

645
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,160
Like, all the functionality is there.

646
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,280
The way you go about doing it, sometimes the buttons are in little different locations.

647
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,280
Yeah, exactly.

648
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,520
Layouts are a little different, but the functionality is there.

649
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,560
And so I think that people that say, oh, I can't do that in open office, or I can't do

650
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,560
that in LibreOffice, I think those people, I think that's just a cop-out, and I think

651
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:55,800
that it's not that you can't do it in LibreOffice, I think that 99% of the time, it's people

652
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,280
just don't want to do it in LibreOffice.

653
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,800
Yes, they don't want to warn that new workflow, and you know, that's a barrier, but if you

654
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,560
get over it, it's a glorious thing on the other side.

655
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:12,880
And the other thing is, too, is what I see is you are trading the comfortability of Microsoft

656
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,320
Office for the known future of LibreOffice.

657
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,480
I don't know what changes Microsoft is going to make, only Microsoft knows that, if Microsoft

658
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,920
knows that, but when it comes to LibreOffice, I can have a voice in that conversation.

659
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,160
I can reach out to the developers and say, hey, you know what, this is a feature I'm

660
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,320
really looking forward to, and I do do that.

661
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,000
When I bump into those guys, and they are at most Linux fests, when I bump into those

662
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,440
guys, I tell them, I say, hey, this is the kind of feature I'm looking for, this is the

663
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,500
kind of functionality I really need, is that something that you can accommodate?

664
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,160
And most of the time, the answer is yes, sometimes the answer is no, and then usually with a

665
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,980
yes, they're able to give a timeframe of about how long that's going to take before that

666
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,980
functionality arrives.

667
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,980
How about the Mumble Room?

668
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,640
I kind of want to open it up to you guys.

669
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,980
We haven't really even said hello to you guys.

670
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,480
Time appropriate greeting, Mumble Room.

671
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:13,400
As far as LibreOffice, I mean, the only thing that it can't do very well is the Microsoft

672
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:19,280
Office formats, and it's still getting those much better in the recent releases.

673
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,800
So I mean, as far as like most of the time, LibreOffice is all you really need.

674
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
Yeah.

675
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,200
I guess I suppose I'll have to backtrack just a little bit.

676
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,480
I'll have to eat a couple of my words.

677
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:38,680
I suppose if you're doing something very, very, very, some very special formula in Excel-based

678
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:44,000
formula or something like that, I guess I could see a couple of times where it would

679
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,200
be a lot of work to use LibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office, and that didn't really

680
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:53,160
dawn on me until, Rotten, you had mentioned the concept of transitioning from one office

681
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,680
suite to another and keeping file consistency.

682
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,700
I have done that a couple of times, and 99% of the time it goes well, but you're right.

683
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,560
Every once in a while, if there's a Microsoft Office format and you try and open that up

684
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,520
in LibreOffice, something goes a little kiddy wonker, and then that causes some problems.

685
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:21,960
There's also big companies that have implemented large software solutions which only integrate

686
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,800
with Microsoft Office, and there's a big one that most large companies use, and that's

687
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,520
LibreOffice, and for a long, long, long, long time, and it may still be the case, I haven't

688
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,320
looked in the last three years, but while you're inside your SAP system dealing with

689
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,240
your customers, your HR records, your finances, your materials management, whatever it is

690
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:48,040
inside SAP, if you press any button that is export this as a document, the only thing

691
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,000
it will talk to is Microsoft Office.

692
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,520
You absolutely cannot integrate with LibreOffice or OpenOffice or any other office suite.

693
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,240
It just doesn't do it, because really, if you're implementing SAP, you're a Fortune

694
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,560
500 company and many more, and you could be pretty much guaranteed that the desktops will

695
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,000
have Microsoft Windows and they will have Microsoft Office.

696
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Exactly.

697
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,600
There's no point in them even implementing that kind of integration.

698
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,320
That may well have changed in the last three years, but I seriously doubt it.

699
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:22,520
How about letting that software export to Microsoft Office and then opening it with

700
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,520
LibreOffice?

701
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,000
Well, it's not just a case of exporting data out.

702
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,840
It doesn't spit data out as like an XLS file or a doc.

703
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:40,320
This is reaching into the Office install on your machine, placing calls into the application,

704
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,240
so it integrates tightly, and it might even embed.

705
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,680
You might be looking at a screen in SAP, and then you press a button that says, give me

706
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,640
a graph, and that reaches into your machine, downloads some stuff to your machine, and

707
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:59,600
then makes some system calls into Microsoft Office that then renders that inside the GUI

708
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,240
for the application.

709
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,400
And SAP is not the only one.

710
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,500
It's the one I've got most familiarity with, but there are plenty of these Office applications

711
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,180
which are used by large companies and which there is no way you're going to move these

712
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:16,200
people off of Microsoft Office, because they're dependent upon something which costs them

713
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,840
millions and millions in maintenance fees every year.

714
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,320
They're not just going to switch away from that.

715
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
That's just not going to happen.

716
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,160
So it's somewhat, I mean, for small and medium-sized enterprises and for the people who are doing

717
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,080
the basic stuff and home users, yes, LibreOffice is perfectly fine.

718
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,800
For education, yes, perfectly fine, but for the very large deployments, it's a lot more

719
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
difficult.

720
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,080
Now, do you think those companies are not taking into account a certain level of risk

721
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,640
by banking on the fact that their software is going to continue to talk to Microsoft

722
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:50,400
and that Microsoft is going to continue to provide Microsoft Office in a way that that

723
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
software can talk to it?

724
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,560
So for example, look at Office 365, a lot of businesses have switched to Office 365.

725
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:03,260
I would imagine that that to some degree changes the ability of a third-party software being

726
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,400
able to talk directly to Microsoft Office, doesn't it?

727
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,880
No, not at all.

728
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:14,440
All these large software companies have people who work for Microsoft embedded in the company.

729
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,160
They have people who work for Oracle embedded in the company.

730
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,320
They have partner status with them, so they get access to this stuff early on, and they

731
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:26,080
will integrate so that in the next release or the next release two years down the line,

732
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,400
remember, corporates don't tend to move super fast upgrading their back-end ERP systems,

733
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,160
and these people will say, coming in the next release or two releases down the line, we'll

734
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,840
have integration with Office 365, and that'll be fine because significant numbers of those

735
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,720
companies are still running on Windows 7 or some of them maybe even on Windows XP.

736
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,760
They're not itching to move on to the next release.

737
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,860
The reality is with Office 365, it is somewhat operating system independent.

738
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,940
I can run Office 365 inside of Ubuntu, and it works just fine.

739
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,360
Not necessarily recommending anyone should do that.

740
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:08,160
But I wonder how that SAP system would talk in if it can't talk to the operating system.

741
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,880
I bet that, would that screw it up?

742
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
It's a prerequisite.

743
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:18,200
I mean, if you were to try and install the GUI and you try and do something in the GUI

744
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,160
that requires Microsoft Office and the client doesn't have Microsoft Office installed or

745
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,800
it's not a Microsoft client, then that piece of functionality will fail.

746
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,960
And the net result of that is that employee can't do their job.

747
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,400
And if that employee can't do their job, then you're not going to migrate away from Windows.

748
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:42,200
So it's a lot more complicated than just what's the most complicated Excel spreadsheet you

749
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,200
can think of?

750
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,320
Does it happen in LibreOffice or what's the most cunningly formatted Word document that

751
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,920
makes sure it renders correctly inside LibreOffice docs?

752
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,560
Most of those things are covered.

753
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,280
Those bases are fine.

754
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,640
It's when you're dependent upon Microsoft system calls and things like that that you're

755
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,640
screwed.

756
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
You can't move away.

757
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
That makes total sense.

758
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
I stand corrected.

759
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:11,360
You know, I have obviously I have very limited experience with very, very large companies.

760
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,560
Certainly have even less experience with very large companies that have very large deployments

761
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,640
of Windows.

762
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,040
But and I say that unashamedly.

763
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,080
But there are certain things that I don't think Microsoft Office will ever be able to

764
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
compete with LibreOffice.

765
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,720
And one of them is, for example, the Document Freedom Day.

766
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:34,520
And it's this idea that we can celebrate and raise awareness for the concept of open standards

767
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,560
and I really wanted to participate in this last year.

768
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,960
I'm really looking forward to participating in it next year.

769
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,240
But and probably maybe you have have some insight.

770
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,480
Did you personally or did you at work support or have any involvement with Document Freedom

771
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,480
Day?

772
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,560
So the last time I was involved in this was when it was before Document Freedom Day, when

773
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,080
it was Software Freedom Day.

774
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,160
Many, many, many years ago, there was a Software Freedom Day and we decided to take part in

775
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,160
the UK.

776
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:08,840
And in London, we had a bunch of CDs that were provided by Canonical, the Ubuntu CDs,

777
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,040
and we had some leaflets that we printed out and we went for a walk.

778
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,240
We all met up in a park in London, we went for a walk through London, and then we met

779
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:21,440
up at a venue where we gave talks and talked about software freedom and all the all the

780
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,040
kind of topics that you'd expect to hear at a conference or an event about software freedom.

781
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,320
And as we walked through London, we were handing CDs.

782
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,480
And you know, you know, those people who stand in the street who try and like thrust something

783
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,280
into your hand and you really don't want to make eye contact and you don't want to talk

784
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
to those people?

785
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,840
Well, yeah, that was us.

786
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:46,240
And in England, you know, I'm sure it's somewhat different, the British reserved personality

787
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,560
where, you know, we'll do absolutely anything to avoid eye contact with you.

788
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,880
And we would we were testing, like, as we walked along different phrases that we could

789
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,040
use to get people to take the CD out of our hand like, you know, would you like some free

790
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,560
software?

791
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,980
And you know, free software, free culture or free, you know, we were trying all kinds

792
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,120
of phrases.

793
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,520
And some of them weren't better than others.

794
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,160
I documented those.

795
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,280
Yeah, well, we Yeah, we wrote up our, our, our event.

796
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,680
But one particularly memorable, we were standing outside a store that was like, you know, like

797
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,240
a Best Buy, like fries you would have over there as PC World over here.

798
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,920
And it was at a junction where there was some traffic lights and a big red London basketball

799
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,120
pulled up.

800
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:36,360
And one of the guys took the opportunity to walk up to the bus driver and handed him one

801
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,180
of the CDs and said, Hey, would you like some free software?

802
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,720
And the guy looked at it and said, Ah, is this that replacement for Windows?

803
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,360
And our guy went, Yes, that's exactly what it is.

804
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,200
But this was like, nearly 10 years ago, eight years ago.

805
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,480
And you know, people, some people knew about it back then.

806
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,040
But no, I haven't been involved in the Document Freedom Day more recently.

807
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,800
I know some people have, but I am.

808
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,960
I would love to get more, more involved with that.

809
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,480
And the stories that I've heard from people that have participated in are absolutely outstanding.

810
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,280
And you can actually get some funding, as I understand it, from the Document Foundation

811
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:17,560
for the Open Document Foundation for putting on a Document Freedom Day in your area.

812
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,280
That's definitely something I'm going to look into.

813
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,560
Anyone else in the mobile room have any experience with, with LibreOffice or enjoy using LibreOffice

814
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,160
or more to the point experience with switching people from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice?

815
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,920
Yeah, I've worked with several friends and family members that, you know, we just bypass

816
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:40,360
the whole Microsoft Office compatibility issue entirely when you're creating documents for

817
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,040
distribution, just save them as PDFs.

818
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,040
Yeah, totally.

819
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,040
That's a great option.

820
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,800
PDFs are great.

821
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,960
The thing that bothers me about PDFs is if, if anytime you need to edit something or change

822
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,760
something right, that becomes kind of problematic.

823
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,880
Wouldn't they have, didn't they have like an embedded format where you can embed a Open

824
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,880
Office or a Open Document format in a PDF or maybe it was vice versa?

825
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,040
Yeah, that could be.

826
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,000
If they're, I'm not, I'm not personally familiar with it, but North Ranger, how about you?

827
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,040
You know, I did not try that, but like the biggest example I had of, you know, distribution

828
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,040
was resumes.

829
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,040
Oh, sure.

830
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,040
Yeah.

831
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,040
Yeah.

832
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,400
The nice thing about resumes is that you can actually download a lot of the templates for

833
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,600
Microsoft Office, open them with LibreOffice and then go in there and, and, and just plug

834
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,120
in the information and it works.

835
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,280
And I've actually done that a couple of times or helped people do it a couple of times.

836
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,040
Never really run into a snag doing that.

837
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:39,120
There's also a Linux converter so that if it's just a command line tool that you run

838
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:44,120
it, you can convert a PDF that doesn't have editability or have any texts connected to

839
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:49,880
it and convert it into an editable format that is still PDF, but fundamentally lets you

840
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,880
change things.

841
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,880
Yeah.

842
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,240
I just see on LibreOffice's website here, they have support for hybrid PDF where they

843
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,680
do embed an ODF file.

844
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,480
So a PDF viewers will see the PDF, but if you open LibreOffice, it's a fully modifiable.

845
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,080
And I assume when you save it, then that's updates the PDF.

846
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,400
Oh, that's great.

847
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,400
Yeah.

848
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,800
That's absolutely fantastic because the nice thing about that is it requires people that

849
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,280
are, that the people that want to monkey with it are going to know how to monkey with it.

850
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,360
And the people that don't know how to monkey with it probably aren't the people we want

851
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,200
modifying the file anyway, right?

852
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,200
Yeah.

853
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,160
And there's no, there's no excuse with LibreOffice, you know, it's like you sent this document

854
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,160
and you do want to edit it.

855
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,360
Well, it's free software.

856
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,720
You can download it at no cost.

857
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,620
It's available for pretty much every platform.

858
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,640
So you know, perfectly interoperable.

859
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,640
Rotten Corpse, you want to jump in there?

860
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:39,320
Well, I was just going to say that there is actually another, there's a, there's a cloud

861
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,120
that this is not something you want to use if you care about like privacy of your stuff,

862
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,520
but there's this cloud converters system.

863
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,920
It's a service called a cloudconvert.io I think, and it, I've tested it in certain cases

864
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:00,280
where you can convert a PDF, no matter what kind of weird formatting it has to anything

865
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,280
you want.

866
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:07,400
Like I tried to convert a PDF to an HTML file just to see if it would do it.

867
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,400
And it did it perfectly.

868
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,000
It had all the pages, how the formatting, like everything was perfect and it kind of

869
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,040
blew my mind how like exact it did it, no matter what format I picked.

870
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,200
That's awesome.

871
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:24,400
It's worth saying for everything I've said about Microsoft Office, LibreOffice is incredibly

872
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:31,160
flexible and over the last couple of years it's being bent into different shapes that

873
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,460
you probably wouldn't have expected it to, or that you wouldn't have expected the same

874
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:40,120
code base from so many years ago that originated, you know, StarOffice, OpenOffice and now LibreOffice

875
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:47,360
that now, for example, there's a tool that's part of LibreOffice called LibreOffice Kit.

876
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:53,660
And with LibreOffice Kit, you could take an installation of LibreOffice with no GUI, so

877
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:57,200
you don't actually use LibreOffice on the desktop, but you could have an install of

878
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,960
LibreOffice say on a headless server and with LibreOffice Kit you can pass it any supported

879
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,640
LibreOffice document and it will give you back a bitmap of what that document looks

880
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,640
like.

881
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,640
No kidding.

882
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,640
It's amazing.

883
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,560
And we're actually using that on the Ubuntu phone.

884
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:19,040
So the document viewer has inside it a copy of LibreOffice and when you open a document,

885
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,640
it throws the document at LibreOffice through LibreOffice Kit, LibreOffice then renders

886
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,200
the document, throws it back a bitmap and we display that on the screen and you just

887
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,200
move that around.

888
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,640
So you're scrolling the document as you're moving a bitmap around the screen.

889
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,680
It's pretty amazing.

890
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,480
And it does this all this in real time.

891
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,480
Yeah.

892
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,640
But you can throw it a bitmap and say, show me this part of the document.

893
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,560
So if the user is zoomed in, you might want to show only the top left hand corner of the

894
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,560
spreadsheet or something.

895
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,960
So you tell LibreOffice Kit, here's the document.

896
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,040
Show me the top left hand corner of that document and it will throw you back a bitmap only of

897
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,040
that bit.

898
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,160
When you page down, it will render only the second page and when you page down, it only

899
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,160
renders the third page.

900
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,160
So it's incredibly flexible what you can do with LibreOffice and in some ways more

901
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,040
flexible than Microsoft Office.

902
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,720
And I think that's a good note to end on that.

903
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,080
Well, I guess this is another good note to end on.

904
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,120
LibreOffice 5.0 launched in early August and has been the most successful major release

905
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:17,520
ever, triggering an unprecedented 8,000 donations in just 30 days.

906
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,880
Of course, the success had been reflected in the number of adoptions, which has soared.

907
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,200
The icing on the cake has been the announcement of the Italian Defense Organization, which

908
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:34,280
will be migrating some 150,000 PCs to LibreOffice starting from October in 2015.

909
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,600
You know, I think it was last month or the month before actually we went over into a

910
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:42,560
clinic and we migrated their entire clinic over to LibreOffice.

911
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:48,480
We went in and systematically removed Microsoft Office and switched them all over to LibreOffice.

912
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:55,400
And along with LibreOffice, we had to move their database, their main medical database

913
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,400
over.

914
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,040
And it had been hosted on a seven-year-old server.

915
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:05,720
And the problem was it was slowing down and it was starting to crash or actually just

916
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,000
unexpectedly shut off.

917
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,240
And they didn't have the $2,000 plus to purchase a new machine.

918
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,080
And even if they did have the money, they didn't have an in-house IT staff, which would

919
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,200
have meant that we would have been quoting out either a service contract to come out

920
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,880
and replace hard disks when they fail or add memory when it goes off or bring up backup

921
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,440
internet when the fiber line fails and all those good things.

922
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,680
And we were actually able to solve all of their concerns for just $120 a year over at

923
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,680
DigitalOcean.

924
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,680
DigitalOcean, if you're not familiar with them, they're a VPS that does servers, Linux

925
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,320
servers in fact, on demand.

926
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,660
You might say it's like the McDonald's of fast food in the server world.

927
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:46,020
We move dozens of businesses over to DigitalOcean.

928
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,180
And just like when we move a business from Windows over to Linux or we move a business

929
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,680
from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice, they never look back.

930
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:56,820
In the two years that we've been moving people over to DigitalOcean, I don't think I've ever

931
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:01,680
had a client that has told me they want to go back to buying servers and paying a yearly

932
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,600
fee to maintain them.

933
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,000
Their intuitive dashboard makes spinning up servers or as they call them droplets, super

934
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,560
easy and efficient.

935
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:14,040
At least once a week, I try to spin something up just to play with something.

936
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,800
I try to start up a new droplet and try something new just to kind of keep myself fresh and

937
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,700
kind of keep myself exploring.

938
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,580
I don't have the time to install an operating system on a bare metal box.

939
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,580
It just takes too much time.

940
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,640
Now, I'll give you a pro tip.

941
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:33,480
If you go over and spin up a DigitalOcean droplet and you use the code DOUNPLUGED, DOUNPLUGED,

942
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,080
all one word, all lowercase, you're going to get a $10 credit.

943
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:41,680
That basically means you get the servers that I use all the time for two months for free.

944
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:47,140
That's a $5 droplet with a terabyte of transfer, a 20 gigabyte solid state drive, and 512 megabytes

945
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,140
of RAM.

946
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:52,080
If you know how to use Linux correctly, that gets you a long, long way.

947
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,480
I have EMR databases running on it.

948
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,960
I have a Mumble server running on it.

949
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,520
I have an Airtime instance.

950
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,300
I have my Quasocore running on it.

951
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:05,360
I have the chat server that we were using back when we were doing the video portion

952
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,600
of the Linux action show.

953
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,360
All of that stuff was running on a $5 droplet.

954
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:16,200
Head over to DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGED, DOUNPLUGED, all lowercase,

955
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:23,200
all one word, and you'll get $10 credit to spin up your own Linux rig for two months.

956
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,760
I want to move on and talk about the Ubuntu installer.

957
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:37,880
Now things are changing in the Ubuntu installer, and the installer is called Ubiquity.

958
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,880
Wes, have you seen this?

959
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,520
Yeah, I've used it a couple of times.

960
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,520
So they are changing the slide show, I understand.

961
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,800
Have you read about this?

962
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,560
I was just reading about it this morning, actually.

963
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:59,880
So the one thing that I have noticed is the first time I install a new distro, or the

964
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:05,700
first time I install what would be a new operating system, essentially, I'm paying attention

965
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,700
to what's on the screen.

966
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,120
I'm looking at how the UI elements are designed.

967
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:14,240
I'm looking at the screencaps that they share and stuff like that.

968
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:22,280
And I think it makes a lot of sense to update a lot of the stuff that's inside of the installer,

969
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,640
because I think that's the first impression a lot of people are getting with Ubuntu.

970
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,640
Would you agree?

971
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,640
Oh, yeah.

972
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,320
And that first impression is so important.

973
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,040
You really need to lay it home that this is a modern operating system.

974
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,880
It's uncompromising on all the kind of stuff that you would expect from it, that it's easy,

975
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,800
that it welcomes you, and that it's going to create a really good experience, really,

976
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,800
from the get-go.

977
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,800
Yeah.

978
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:50,960
So a couple of months ago, we were redoing Angela's MacBook, because we were selling

979
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:57,680
it on eBay, and one of the things that I noticed about it was it plays a video when you start

980
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,680
up macOS.

981
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:02,120
This is really one of the few times I've ever used macOS, but of all the things I didn't

982
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:05,280
like about the operating system experience, I thought that was kind of cool that it had

983
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,280
like this welcome video, and it showed like the hello in a couple different languages

984
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,280
and stuff like that.

985
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,280
Oh, yeah.

986
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,280
I'm familiar with that.

987
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,280
Have you seen that?

988
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,280
Yeah.

989
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,280
It is pretty slick.

990
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,840
It makes you feel like you're already using the computer, even though you haven't quite

991
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,040
finished installing it yet.

992
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,040
Yeah.

993
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,200
So I thought that was kind of cool.

994
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,680
But it was kind of like a welcome to your computer sort of a thing.

995
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,680
Exactly.

996
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:30,000
Since most of us are installing Linux, the installer and the images that come with the

997
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,680
installer are what is greeting us to the operating system.

998
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:40,480
And Chris had put some of the show notes together, so I'm not exactly sure.

999
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:49,000
I'm a little confused on a few of the details here, but I think that the graphical interface

1000
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
is really important.

1001
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I think it's kind of cool.

1002
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,360
Popey, do you have anything to add about Ubiquity and feedback that you guys get from it?

1003
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,360
Yeah.

1004
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,760
So this was a surprise to me as well.

1005
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:05,560
So the design guys, they mostly work in London, in the London office at Canonical.

1006
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:11,360
And if you ever go into the London office, if you're ever lucky enough to go in there,

1007
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,880
there's post-it notes all over the walls.

1008
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,880
They're big on post-it notes.

1009
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:21,520
There's loads of prototypes, drawings, and mock-ups of user interfaces that may be in

1010
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,340
the future or might have been if we'd gone on a different path.

1011
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:29,720
And one of the things about the installer is, I'm not sure I agree with you.

1012
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:37,920
I think the installer, it may well be the first impression that people see of the distro.

1013
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,560
I believe that it shouldn't be because users shouldn't be installing Linux.

1014
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:47,240
They should be buying a machine that has Linux pre-installed.

1015
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:51,600
And therefore, they wouldn't see the install process because it would come pre-installed.

1016
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,600
That's what happens with Windows.

1017
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,440
Nobody cares about the install process of Windows.

1018
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,400
Nobody cares about the install process of OS 10.

1019
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,000
Most of the time, the users see the install process of Windows or normal users.

1020
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,160
I'm not talking about not your listenership, but your average Joe, most that they're going

1021
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:12,600
to see the installer is looking over the shoulder of someone else doing it, and they don't care.

1022
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:19,320
Or if they're being super techy and someone told them to reinstall because their machine's

1023
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,280
completely hosed and that's the only way out.

1024
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:28,280
I'm not sure that the installer is the best thing as the showcase.

1025
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:33,480
However, what you will notice in the blog post that is on design.canonical.com about

1026
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,440
why the first impression matters, you'll notice that the screens that they've talked about

1027
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:43,240
changing are the ones that you see after an OEM install.

1028
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,520
So it's not the full install.

1029
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,680
It's not like the partitioning scheme and all that kind of wacky stuff that you and

1030
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,600
I know all about and can skip through nice and happily.

1031
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,720
It's the stuff that an end user would see.

1032
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,400
And the stuff that an end user would see on first run is, okay, what language do you want?

1033
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,800
What Wi-Fi connection do you want to connect to?

1034
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,440
What time zone are you in?

1035
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,640
Do you want to set a password and do you want the system to lock and automatically unlock

1036
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,640
for you?

1037
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,640
That kind of thing.

1038
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:17,040
And so I find it interesting that actually that kind of corroborates my perspective that

1039
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,480
the first thing that we should be showing people is a great experience out of the box

1040
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,640
when you buy a machine.

1041
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:30,800
Now I would love to see a funky video, like you say, or something pretty that we can show

1042
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,480
a user when they first take their thing out of the box.

1043
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,760
Because let's face it, when people do unboxing videos, they love these things.

1044
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:47,040
When the Nokia N900 prototype phones or early adopter phones were sent out, they came in

1045
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,920
a special box that had special buttons and you had to send code over a serial cable.

1046
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,320
And when the box opened, smoke came out.

1047
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,320
It was amazing.

1048
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:59,440
So that unboxing experience, it should feel special to everyone.

1049
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,320
I'm not saying we should provide like smoke and stuff inside of it.

1050
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,320
Sounds hazardous.

1051
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,320
Every laptop.

1052
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,320
Yeah.

1053
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,320
And somewhat expensive.

1054
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:11,040
Intel did with the NUC, so you open it and it has a little Intel sound.

1055
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,040
Yeah.

1056
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,040
Oh, yeah.

1057
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,040
Yeah.

1058
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:18,600
See that and the Exploding Kittens card game that was on Kickstarter, that when you open

1059
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:23,280
the box, you hear, you know, beautiful things that you get when you take the thing out of

1060
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,520
the box means you cherish the thing a little bit more.

1061
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:31,040
And I think that's one of the factors why people who tend to buy Apple products cherish

1062
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,200
them a lot more is because of that whole out of the box experience.

1063
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:40,600
It means you want to love it even more, like, you know, going and picking a kitten up for

1064
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,920
the first time when you when you've like got a kitten from a rescue center or something,

1065
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,520
when you pick it up for the first time, you cherish it even more after that first meeting.

1066
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,520
Do you know what I mean?

1067
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,520
Right.

1068
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,520
Yes, absolutely.

1069
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:55,600
Especially if it, you know, sometimes, let's face it, some people's first introduction

1070
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:00,040
to Ubuntu or Linux in general is met after several hours of troubleshooting.

1071
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,480
Yes, very much so.

1072
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,480
Right.

1073
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:07,080
So the worst thing is it is because then then then it is tainted and the trust for the operating

1074
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,060
system is almost lost a little bit.

1075
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:14,680
So I definitely I agree with what you're saying.

1076
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:19,440
Even the issues like like the Apple thing is a good point, like because the Apple boxes,

1077
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,880
they will just they'll they'll keep the boxes and display them because of just the way they

1078
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,520
present the out of the box experience.

1079
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:31,280
You know, if there was something like that for the the UI or I don't know, before you

1080
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:36,720
install something like maybe they should put like the Ubuntu has the demo where you can

1081
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,600
just like use Ubuntu in the browser for a little bit and kind of experience it that

1082
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,600
way.

1083
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,640
If they put that more give more attention to that.

1084
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:49,320
Well, in fact, it's interesting you should say that in China, I think you do actually

1085
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,960
get that out of the box.

1086
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:56,640
There was a there was a government directive, I believe, that in China many years ago that

1087
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,320
was, you know, when you ship a machine, you have to provide some kind of tutorial out

1088
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:05,840
of the box, because a lot of the people who are buying these things are farmers out in

1089
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,840
the middle of nowhere.

1090
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,240
And they've had met, they've never bought a computing device before in their life.

1091
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,440
And they've got no idea what to do when you turn it on.

1092
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:16,080
And that and that's not unique to Ubuntu, you know, any computer, they turn it on, and

1093
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,880
they wouldn't know what to do in the same way that a farmer from the middle of America

1094
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,480
or middle of UK wouldn't know what to do if they never touched a computer before.

1095
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:28,760
But, and so we did used to put I don't know if we still do the the web based tutorial

1096
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,240
on machines that were shipping in China.

1097
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:38,000
And in fact, Dell, I think on the XPS 13, I don't have one, I've never bought one.

1098
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,120
But I'm led to believe there is a funky little video at the start of that.

1099
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,920
And I believe Dell made that we didn't, we didn't create that and it doesn't ship on

1100
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,920
the CD.

1101
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,440
It's not on anyone else's, like if you buy Lenovo, you don't get that video.

1102
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:56,000
So there is a, you know, move towards making that whole out of the box experience a little

1103
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
bit better.

1104
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Well, that's good.

1105
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
That's good to hear.

1106
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:05,240
Now, I have been automating my home for some time and joining us in the mumble room, we

1107
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,800
have a very special guest.

1108
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,520
Ana is here.

1109
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,520
Good afternoon, sir.

1110
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,520
How are you?

1111
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,520
Good afternoon.

1112
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,520
I'm fine.

1113
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,520
Thank you.

1114
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,600
So tell me a little bit about CrowdStone.

1115
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:25,040
Yeah, so what we created here in Rotterdam, like one of the harbors in Europe, of course,

1116
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:32,720
is a little device that you can plug into a power outlet, which is completely open source.

1117
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:39,160
So can be hacked by anyone who likes a little bit of like the firmware hacking.

1118
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:44,600
And what it does is actually two kind of things at the same time.

1119
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,680
Of course, you can dim lights and you can switch devices and things like that, like

1120
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,040
the usable home automation stuff.

1121
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:57,040
But it also has proximity and indoor localization functionality.

1122
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,040
It does that by knowing how far your phone is.

1123
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,120
So it measures the distance to your phone.

1124
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,320
And at the same time, it also has device recognition on board.

1125
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:11,920
So if you plug in your TV or something else, it knows what the difference is between those

1126
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,720
devices using the consumption pattern over the day.

1127
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,720
Wow.

1128
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,720
Wow.

1129
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,720
That's crazy.

1130
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,840
It can identify the device, huh?

1131
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:22,840
Absolutely.

1132
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:23,840
Yeah.

1133
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,800
So we use multiple ways to do that.

1134
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:31,760
So one of the simple ways is actually just using the power consumption itself, of course.

1135
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,780
But you can also see the pattern over time.

1136
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,040
My background is robotics.

1137
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:41,600
So I use a lot of algorithms we have been developing over the time.

1138
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:50,480
And so if you use a collection of reclassifiers, they can use all kind of features, for example,

1139
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,480
temporal features or other kind of features.

1140
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,540
You can collect them.

1141
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:59,840
And collectively, they are able to distinguish a lot of devices.

1142
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,760
And there is a third way you can use.

1143
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:08,720
And that is, say, every device leaves a kind of a signature on the grid.

1144
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:17,360
So if you plug in a LED led light, you will have some signature that is different from

1145
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,200
if you plug in a normal light bulb.

1146
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,800
You can use that on a single sine wave.

1147
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:27,080
You can already see what the difference is between certain devices.

1148
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:34,160
Now, I understand that this device can actually recognize a certain form of rudimentary logic.

1149
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,160
So for example, if my TV, I don't unplug it.

1150
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,380
It just sits in the living room and stays there.

1151
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:43,880
So if I were to unplug my TV, that would be a bit unusual.

1152
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:48,080
How does your device respond?

1153
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,080
If you, yeah.

1154
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:53,620
So these are the kind of events we want to be able to register.

1155
01:02:53,620 --> 01:03:00,360
So if you would unplug your TV at night, it's probably kind of events you want to receive

1156
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:06,260
as the owner of the building or of the home or the apartment.

1157
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:13,320
If it's your microwave that gets plugged out, you probably don't need to know it.

1158
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,480
Tell me a little bit about how the child lock feature works.

1159
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:21,240
How does it know if there are adults in proximity or not know if adults are in proximity?

1160
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,120
Oh, yeah.

1161
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,040
That was a nice feature.

1162
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:33,480
I was actually, we had a group of 50 students that were working on our product, under covers

1163
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,360
to say, in Rotterdam.

1164
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:40,840
And one of those groups were coming up with this feature that was first like, yeah, but

1165
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:44,400
I don't want to have children carrying phones with them.

1166
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,760
But it was the other way around.

1167
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:50,880
So it was really parents that are walking around.

1168
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:57,040
And when they are in proximity, certain devices can be turned on.

1169
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:00,280
When they are not, they are not turned on.

1170
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:05,800
And the proximity detection is just by using the Bluetooth low energy signal strengths

1171
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,640
that are already on your phone.

1172
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:15,840
So basically by measuring kind of, say, between three or five meters, something like that,

1173
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,160
it should be on.

1174
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,080
If it's beyond that, it should be off.

1175
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,000
Now I understand that we're kind of in early days here.

1176
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,720
In fact, you have a Kickstarter over at crownstone.rocks.

1177
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,720
Is that correct?

1178
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,720
Yeah.

1179
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:33,160
So if you go there, yeah, you will automatically can go.

1180
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:37,200
You will have one go button and you can go down to the Kickstarter.

1181
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:42,720
Tell me at some point, will there be a way that I can integrate this inside of the box?

1182
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,680
Because I know one of the things I'm seeing right off the top of my head is I would be

1183
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:51,800
perfectly okay with this, my wife, however, is not going to appreciate a protruding object

1184
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,060
from the outlet.

1185
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:57,360
If this project takes off, maybe an iteration two or three, would there be a way that we

1186
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:02,760
can get this so it actually replaces the wall outlet itself?

1187
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,800
There is one version that you can actually put behind the power outlet.

1188
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:14,960
So yeah, so you should have enough space, of course, there is a little bit of space

1189
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:22,920
required in your junction box, but yeah, then for your wife or so, nothing changes.

1190
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:31,320
She can just turn on and off the lights and you can basically rule it over kind of by

1191
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:36,280
doing it wirelessly and then she will be like, oh, it's not going on, but she will probably

1192
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:42,120
flip it another time and then for her, not so much changes, she can still use the physical

1193
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,120
switch.

1194
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,120
Wow, that sounds fantastic.

1195
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,440
Now, you said that all of this was designed with open source in mind.

1196
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,680
Tell me how I can interface to this device.

1197
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:56,100
I get the little plug, I assume there's some way that I can program it to tell it, I want

1198
01:05:56,100 --> 01:06:00,320
you to act as a child locker, I want you to act as a motion detector, I want you to act

1199
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,320
in this way or the other.

1200
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,960
How do I go about actually programming the device?

1201
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:10,640
Yeah, we decided to actually put a lot of logic onto the smartphone.

1202
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:17,600
So first of all, we have open firmware, so you can do everything on the device itself

1203
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:26,040
if you want to, but that is a better device, so it's difficult to program for certain people.

1204
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:33,640
It has 16 kilobytes of RAM, it's like the radio takes up 10 kilobytes, so it's very,

1205
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,680
very little space you have on a device like that.

1206
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:41,160
You won't be able to run JavaScript or something.

1207
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:48,920
So our Bluetooth of Energy interface basically is an API that people can use from whatever

1208
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:56,840
kind of device they have, a laptop with Python scripts or Raspberry Pi or things like that.

1209
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:02,760
But the main advantage is also that we provide libraries on the smartphone, different ones,

1210
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:09,120
so Cordova-based and iOS and Android-based, so they can actually write applications like

1211
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:18,040
they normally do for smartphone apps and they can directly interface with those brownstones

1212
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,040
from their phones.

1213
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:28,800
Yeah, what's also different from normal or different Kickstarters, quite often they stream

1214
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:33,320
everything to a server like, for example, the Fitbit or something like that.

1215
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:40,320
You cannot actually get your own data out except for it via a REST API online.

1216
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:44,520
We decided to do it directly on your phone, so you really can get your own data.

1217
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:49,280
You don't need to go through a company server or something like that.

1218
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,280
Oh, that's awesome.

1219
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,760
So there's no centrally activated server.

1220
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,240
See, that would be my first line that would rule me out of your product, because if you

1221
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,920
told me, well, there's a little serial number and you have to go to our website and activate

1222
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,600
it and then use our web portal to program it and stuff like that, but you're telling

1223
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,320
me basically if I really wanted to, if I got needy and gritty, I could actually plug in

1224
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:12,360
with like a serial cable and program this thing with my laptop.

1225
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:20,440
Yeah, we will also add a pledge for developer edition with separate connectors, but at the

1226
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:23,800
moment you will need to do it over the air.

1227
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:28,880
So we have Bluetooth low end, yeah, so we have the MQ, yeah.

1228
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,200
How does the over the air programming work if I want to do it directly on the device?

1229
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:39,040
You spoke about being able to do that or the two mutually exclusive?

1230
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:49,360
No, so via wires you need connectors on it, but the default is that you can do it wirelessly

1231
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:56,600
and you can do it via say a standard application that's already on the market or you can do

1232
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:03,240
it actually also via shell scripts, Python scripts.

1233
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:08,040
Now there's a lot of home automation type equipment that is already prevalent in the

1234
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,040
market.

1235
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,400
So for example, universal remote controls or URC, they have templates on how to talk

1236
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:18,160
to other devices either via TCP IP or over RF.

1237
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,360
I assume because it's an open standard, that should be a pretty simplistic thing that should

1238
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:28,000
be a pretty rudimentary thing for me to tie your device into my remote control, is that

1239
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
right?

1240
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,040
Yeah, absolutely.

1241
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,520
Any kind of hub that exists that has Bluetooth low energy and it doesn't even need to have

1242
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:41,680
that because there are a lot of switch like little dongles available for only a few bucks.

1243
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:46,040
And then yeah, it's very basic to hook up to other stuff, absolutely.

1244
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:50,480
Wes, do you have any questions about this smart socket?

1245
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:54,640
I'm just really impressed with how open it appears.

1246
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,200
A lot of the other platforms that we're seeing in this kind of space are so closed off.

1247
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:02,160
A lot of them, if you download the SDK, you have to sign an agreement that you won't use

1248
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:06,000
it to create interoperability with other products.

1249
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,160
So the idea here that you could take something that you've already bought or maybe someone

1250
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:14,040
you're installing this for already has some sunk costs and then just create something

1251
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:19,000
to bridge it and take advantage of this is awesome and I think it's one of the best things

1252
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
going for it.

1253
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1254
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,760
The fact that it's open really appeals to me.

1255
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,760
How about our mumble room?

1256
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,360
Do you guys have any questions, comments, concerns?

1257
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:33,640
Yeah, if your laptop has Bluetooth, for example, can you use your laptop to interface with

1258
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:34,640
the device?

1259
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,640
Yeah, absolutely.

1260
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:40,480
Your laptop is fine as well.

1261
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:45,920
I'm only using Linux, so I don't know how it works on Windows, but he knows how to get

1262
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:46,920
our interest.

1263
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:47,920
Yeah, no kidding, man.

1264
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,600
You just earned yourself 10 character points.

1265
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,960
Yeah, yeah.

1266
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:59,600
And as a hobby, I have been actually backing a lot of Kickstarter projects and most often,

1267
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,120
if I cannot get to the data, I try to do it myself.

1268
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:11,920
So with the FitBit or the Mimoto camera thing or whatever, but I find it a pain that they

1269
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,760
make it so closed.

1270
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,200
So that's why we really wanted to make this product so open.

1271
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,280
It really shows.

1272
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,920
That's great.

1273
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:25,920
You really probably should check out that video where we go through the house and go

1274
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,200
through how everything works.

1275
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:32,020
One of the things I demoed is my scene selector in my house where I can hit the bedtime mode

1276
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:35,140
and it turns all the lights down so I can kind of wind down at night.

1277
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:37,920
One of the things I've done is I used to watch TV.

1278
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:43,400
I actually got back into Walker, Texas Ranger, the show from the 90s, and I liked that show

1279
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,400
because it was light.

1280
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,400
So I could watch it.

1281
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:49,400
I could wind down for a little bit and I would go to bed, is take for contrast 24.

1282
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:53,900
If you watch an episode of 24, you have to watch what happens to Jack in the next episode.

1283
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:57,280
And so what ends up happening is it's like seven in the morning and you're like, oh crap,

1284
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,640
I didn't sleep all night because I sat up all night watching 24.

1285
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:05,160
Really I have been winding down with a new hobby and that is I'm learning how to develop

1286
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,200
apps on Android.

1287
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,200
Very cool.

1288
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,200
Yeah, I know.

1289
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,200
I know.

1290
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,200
But here's the thing.

1291
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,200
I know what some people are saying.

1292
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,080
The chat room is about to freak out and the mobile room is about to freak out and say,

1293
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,080
no, you're not.

1294
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,080
You're not a, you're not a dev.

1295
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,080
You're a sysadmin.

1296
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,080
And I know that.

1297
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,080
Okay.

1298
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,080
I know that.

1299
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:24,540
But with a 33% discount over at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, I can't think of a more cost

1300
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,640
effective way to relax at night.

1301
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:31,760
And I've had a blast being able to go through those modules and you know, I'm, I'm a little

1302
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,680
bit ADD if you haven't picked up on that yet, Wes.

1303
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:39,120
And so I zone out every once in a while, like if I'm listening to somebody talk and I try,

1304
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,180
I mean like bless my wife's heart.

1305
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:42,760
She is so good at putting up with this show.

1306
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,920
She'll start talking to me and I have every intention of listening to all the words that

1307
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,960
come out of her mouth and then like three minutes into it or five minutes into it.

1308
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,100
I just, I like, I fade off and I just, I go into la la land and then then it's lost.

1309
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:59,380
And with, with Linux Academy, I can go back and rewatch some of that stuff that I missed.

1310
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:05,240
And Wes, I got to tell you, when I first got into IT, I remember how expensive things were,

1311
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,440
how expensive things were to get trained, how expensive things were to get certified.

1312
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,440
Yeah.

1313
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,440
It's a huge roadblock.

1314
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,160
If you're trying, you know, you're just trying to get started out in this industry.

1315
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,160
It really is.

1316
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:18,720
It really is because you're competing with a bunch of people that, that, that are on

1317
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,720
a different playing field.

1318
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,220
They're essentially on a different level than you are.

1319
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:25,960
And you can do that for pennies on the dollar over at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1320
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,360
Do you know what opportunity cost is?

1321
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:35,920
Opportunity cost is the price that you pay for not getting that job because you didn't

1322
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,880
have the training and you didn't have the certification because you're not at linuxacademy.com

1323
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:45,160
slash unplugged taking advantage of literally a third of the cost reduction.

1324
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:49,360
And you know, the cost isn't even all that expensive to begin with, even at full price.

1325
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:53,120
I think with the, I think with the discount, I think my whole month of training for Android

1326
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,160
worked out to be like 15 bucks or 16 bucks.

1327
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,160
Oh man.

1328
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,160
That's nothing.

1329
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,160
Yeah.

1330
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,160
Yeah.

1331
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,160
It really isn't.

1332
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,160
It's really cheap.

1333
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,440
And even without the discount, it was only like 25 bucks, I think.

1334
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:07,040
So I mean, this is the way, if you, if you're listening to the show and you're listening

1335
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,000
and saying, you know, I really want to do what Noah does.

1336
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,400
I really like the idea that Noah doesn't, doesn't ever have to troubleshoot Microsoft

1337
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,400
windows.

1338
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,640
I mean, I just don't do that.

1339
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:21,640
If you want to get yourself a career started with, um, in Linux or using open source and

1340
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,360
related technologies, this is the way to do it first.

1341
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:27,960
You have to get current with the technologies and there's no better way to do that by taking

1342
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,720
a professional online course.

1343
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:34,660
You know, you can do the YouTube thing where people were, you know, Joe Blow in his basement

1344
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:38,880
makes a little video with a handicapped, um, and you hear his baby sister crying in the

1345
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,540
background and his mother calling him up for dinner and the dogs barking.

1346
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:47,200
You can do all that, but don't spend a couple of dollars and get yourself some professional

1347
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,160
training and, uh, and then get certified.

1348
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:54,240
And they, uh, they offer, they, they really, really, uh, do a good job with someone like

1349
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,240
the red hat certification.

1350
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,040
So that's a great certification.

1351
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,880
I know that anytime I have somebody that sits down in my office and, and, and when the,

1352
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,800
when their resume slides across my desk and if I see that red hat cert, man, that cert

1353
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,360
means something to me because I know that they have practical skills.

1354
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:15,720
Uh, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, take advantage of that 33% discount while you can

1355
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:20,400
over at ZD article that is looking, uh, at open Seuss leap.

1356
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,280
Have you seen this West, you know, only just a little bit.

1357
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:30,440
So the, the current stable release of open Seuss is 13.2 and that came out on November

1358
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,440
4th of 2014.

1359
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:36,880
Um, the next release is scheduled to be available November 4th, November, uh, excuse me, November

1360
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,440
4th of 2015, exactly one year later.

1361
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:45,360
Um, and the new release will not be called 13.3 or 14 dot, you know, whatever, but rather

1362
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:50,160
it's going to be called 42 dot one, 42 dot one.

1363
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:55,060
And so appropriately they're codenaming this leap.

1364
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:58,280
The reason for the name slash number change and the extra attention that this release

1365
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:03,560
is getting is that they are making a philosophical change in the development and release strategy.

1366
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:08,240
The reasons for this change and the results of it are discussed on the open Seuss leap

1367
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:09,240
Wiki page.

1368
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:13,480
A lot of the discussion has been focused on open Seuss getting merged with Seuss Linux,

1369
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:18,260
enterprise Linux, but I think it's important to note, this is the author speaking on me,

1370
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:22,320
but I think it's important to note that this is more of a two way street than it is.

1371
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:28,560
In fact, as it is explained in the Wiki, what happened, which what enabled the merge was

1372
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:34,040
that SLE sources and maintained updates have been released to the open Seuss build service.

1373
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:42,000
Now, um, in theory, this is ideally what I, as a Linux desktop user have been waiting

1374
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:49,480
for a commercial enterprise Linux distro that is centered around the Linux desktop.

1375
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:56,320
Um, I, I seem to be stuck on, on two sides.

1376
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:00,400
Either I get bleeding edge and things aren't really ready for enterprise and I have problems

1377
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:06,060
or I wind up with really, really old outdated packages and there doesn't seem to be a middle

1378
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:10,920
ground and that seems to be what they're aiming to solve here.

1379
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:14,120
And I got to say their, their, their desktop experience in the past has been really good.

1380
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,480
So this, this gives me a lot of hope.

1381
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:19,680
Uh, you know, open Seuss in the past has been one of those distros that I know I can just

1382
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:23,680
install on someone's machine and they will have all the resources there that they need

1383
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:27,320
to use it and to explore and to, you know, in the same way that they could use windows

1384
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:31,560
that they'll be able to solve all the problems and make all the changes they might need.

1385
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:35,520
You know, Wes, I don't know if you've noticed this either, but when I move people over from,

1386
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:40,920
uh, from windows to Linux, a lot of times, um, for whatever reason, they are very comfortable

1387
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:46,640
in open Seuss as opposed to a lot of the other, uh, a lot of the other alternative distros

1388
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,800
out there.

1389
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:52,280
And I haven't exactly been able to put my, my finger on why that is.

1390
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:57,240
If that, if that, I, I suspect it has a lot to do with KDE, to be honest with you, I think

1391
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:00,840
that windows users kind of gravitate towards having a bar at the bottom where they click

1392
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,280
on a button that gives them a menu.

1393
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,280
Yeah.

1394
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,480
I think, I think there is something there.

1395
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,480
And yes.

1396
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:06,480
Yes.

1397
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:07,480
Goes a ways too.

1398
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,480
Yeah.

1399
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,720
And so I think that, uh, yas goes a long ways.

1400
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:15,560
Yeah, man, does it ever, especially if you are a, a former windows administrator.

1401
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,360
I think that's going to go a long ways.

1402
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:24,520
Um, but I'm looking at, uh, I'm looking at this open Sue sleep and the screen caps that

1403
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,280
I'm looking at are absolutely awesome.

1404
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:33,200
I am really looking forward to taking a look at some of this and, and playing with this.

1405
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:37,240
In fact, I have so much so that I've actually dedicated an entire machine to this and it's

1406
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,680
going to be my main machine for the rest of the week.

1407
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:44,480
And I'm going to take a look and see, um, what it is that, that open Seuss is offering

1408
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:49,440
and see if it appeals to me because like I said on paper as I'm reading it, this is what

1409
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,440
I have been waiting for.

1410
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:54,500
I mean, quite honestly, I guess I've kind of been waiting for red hat to do it simply

1411
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:59,160
because then I would have, um, you know, it would be like this nice, easy transition.

1412
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,160
Right.

1413
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,160
It's your home turf already.

1414
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:02,160
Right.

1415
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,160
Right.

1416
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,560
And then since I'm already administrating red hat servers and I just, it would make

1417
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,840
kind of nice, but this seems like they are, you know, they're really cracking down and

1418
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:09,840
aiming.

1419
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:10,840
I am their target audience.

1420
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:14,760
They're like, I am the person that this is, is reading that this is written for.

1421
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:19,520
And it also seems like they're also targeting, uh, arm guys, which is really, really encouraging

1422
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:24,440
because you're seeing those arm devices becoming more and more prevalent and lower and lower

1423
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:25,440
costs.

1424
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,040
Um, and I think that's a big deal.

1425
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,040
That's a huge deal.

1426
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,040
You know, it goes, it goes with the whole, the whole Linux way.

1427
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:36,000
If you can get a cheap, easy processor and you know that Linux will just run on it and,

1428
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,120
and open Seuss has got that huge build service.

1429
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:42,200
So you know that they are ready to, to build any open source software that can be for your

1430
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,200
platform.

1431
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,080
Then, you know, you can, you can build the whole solution on that.

1432
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,080
Yeah.

1433
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,080
That's the promise.

1434
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,080
Have you used the open build service?

1435
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,080
Yeah.

1436
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,560
You know, I, I think it's great.

1437
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:54,840
I've used it to find, um, supported packages.

1438
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,680
I've used it when I'm using open Seuss and then as well, you know, it seems to support

1439
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:58,960
other distributions as well.

1440
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,240
Uh, random projects that use it to supply, you know, to build different packages for

1441
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:03,240
all kinds of things.

1442
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,240
Yeah.

1443
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:10,160
So it builds for, uh, Ubuntu Debs, Debian Debs, uh, RPMs for both Seuss and Fedora and

1444
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,160
Magia.

1445
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:14,560
And it also builds for arch packages and a couple other things as well.

1446
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,560
Yeah.

1447
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,560
I love that arch package integration.

1448
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,560
That's, that's just great.

1449
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,560
Yeah.

1450
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,080
I've actually, uh, the only, the only thing is, is that it has a custom spec file you

1451
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:26,320
have to learn how to use, but so basically you build a script using their spec file and

1452
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:30,560
then it will upload your source to their servers and they build out everything for you.

1453
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,000
It's, it's pretty awesome.

1454
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,880
And I wish more people would use it.

1455
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:37,480
You say it's actually better than I think, uh, via Tumbleweed, could you expand on that

1456
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:38,480
a little bit?

1457
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,480
Yeah.

1458
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:43,040
And what I was saying is that, uh, people are thinking that it's, it's, it's more like

1459
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:48,360
a workstation thing, but it's actually a more cohesive sharing structure of what they're

1460
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,360
going for.

1461
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:55,120
So like they're having, uh, SLE has released all of their stuff for the OBS so that the

1462
01:20:55,120 --> 01:21:02,160
open Seuss can have, they can spend less time on open Seuss stable or, you know, the regular

1463
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:05,560
version and more time on Tumbleweed.

1464
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:10,720
And because of this, Seuss has like a deal sort of thing struck structured where open

1465
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:16,440
Seuss, uh, base is going to be based on SLE.

1466
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:20,000
Then open Seuss is going to do extra stuff on top of that to do, uh, you know, more up

1467
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,520
to date packages and provide a more user experience for the average user.

1468
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:29,980
But they're also doing Tumbleweed and Tumbleweed is the rolling release, like the arch thing.

1469
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:34,640
And in certain cases, um, you know, people always talk about how arch gets things faster,

1470
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,200
but Tumbleweed actually is getting stuff faster.

1471
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:43,280
I haven't tested for 318, but no, they got known 316 in before arch did and like staple

1472
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,560
and running and everything.

1473
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,760
And they're doing, they're doing things like that are really impressive in this sense.

1474
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:54,120
But another cool thing is that Tumbleweed is going to be the base for SLE in the future.

1475
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:59,380
So every three years or so, Tumbleweed is going to be like snapshotted and then that

1476
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:05,700
becomes SLE, which then comes back into the, you know, the, the, the workstation type structure

1477
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,760
for open Seuss for leap.

1478
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:14,080
So you'd get a Tumbleweed snap snapshot, then you get a SLE, then you take SLE stuff, put

1479
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:20,780
it into a leap again, and then it keeps this, you know, a whole cycling structure of open

1480
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:21,780
Seuss.

1481
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:26,440
Like just everything is shared between the enterprise version and the workstation and

1482
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,680
the rolling.

1483
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:35,300
So in certain cases, like for example, every year SLE does like a service pack that will

1484
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:39,560
also be instituted into the leap packages.

1485
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:46,680
So you even get a yearly update as well as just, you know, the whole, you know, stuff

1486
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,680
sitting on top of it.

1487
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:53,360
You're not getting just open Seuss editing things and giving you more up-to-date packages.

1488
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:59,240
You're also getting Suse enterprise updates as well as the open Suse updates and the Tumbleweed

1489
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,240
updates.

1490
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:05,800
That sounds various, like, like a leaner, meaner, Debian plus enterprise backend and

1491
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,320
kind of the best of all worlds.

1492
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,320
That's impressive.

1493
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,320
It does.

1494
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,800
It sounds like not only is it the best of all worlds, it sounds like somebody is sitting

1495
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:15,480
there going, what does Noah want as a Linux distro?

1496
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:16,700
And then that's what they're making.

1497
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,160
You don't think those people exist, Noah?

1498
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,160
Come on.

1499
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,160
Yeah.

1500
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,160
I'd like to believe that they do.

1501
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:26,800
I mean, on the, the, I just, I have a, I am comfortable in, in a multitude of different

1502
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,800
Linux distros.

1503
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:28,800
I am comfortable on Centos.

1504
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,800
I'm comfortable on Ubuntu.

1505
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:30,800
I'm comfortable on Fedora.

1506
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,800
I'm comfortable on Arch.

1507
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:38,040
Suse and open Suse is maybe the one, one of the, one of the few main distros that I haven't

1508
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,740
used extensively.

1509
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:43,360
And this article is really making me reconsider that like big time.

1510
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,440
I'm downloading the ISO at home right now.

1511
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,440
Yeah.

1512
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,440
There's actually something you should check out.

1513
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,880
Another thing that's going to, a lot of people don't even know about it, but it's open Suse

1514
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,640
have built the open RA system.

1515
01:23:54,640 --> 01:24:01,960
So it's like a automated testing structure and it's, that's the, I just put the link

1516
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,260
in the chat room.

1517
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:08,160
This is a cool thing because they're, they're tested, they're not only just doing leap testing,

1518
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:12,220
they're doing tumbleweed testing with this, they're doing, they're, they're working on

1519
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:14,440
sleet testing as well.

1520
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:18,400
And the coolest thing is that if you look at a test, I'm going to send you a link for

1521
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,680
that too.

1522
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:23,760
If you look at one of the tests, it will go through the process of automating it and then

1523
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:29,000
it shows you a screenshot of every single test and whether it passed or not.

1524
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,780
And this is a beta one, so there are a couple of fails, but this is one of the beta builds.

1525
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:39,320
So and it goes through like the entire installation process, the entire setting up Gnome, the

1526
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:43,640
running Gnome, testing different applications in Gnome, and it gives you this full automated

1527
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:47,040
testing thing and it shows you where it works and where it doesn't.

1528
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:52,900
And if that wasn't cool enough, they actually made a video version of it.

1529
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:55,200
So every single test has a video attached to it.

1530
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:59,560
You can watch the test just run.

1531
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,560
That seems awesome.

1532
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,960
It really does.

1533
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,400
I'm going to have to, I'm more of a hands-on learner.

1534
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:09,720
So I'm following 90% of what you're saying, but I think to really get the full scale of

1535
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:12,060
it, what I'm going to have to do is play with it.

1536
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:17,840
And so like I said, I actually have a laptop that is dedicated to trying all this out as

1537
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,720
soon as I get home tonight.

1538
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:24,400
And so I'm going to be playing with it the rest of the week and I'll have to report back

1539
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,720
in and tell you what you think.

1540
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:28,080
And Wes, you said you're considering doing the same, huh?

1541
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,080
Yeah.

1542
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,080
You know, I've been looking for a replacement.

1543
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:34,720
I've been using Linux Mint on my work workstation, mostly because that was one of the provided

1544
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:37,020
images when I was hired.

1545
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:41,520
But it's feeling a little, you know, I've got the distro hop and itch like many of us

1546
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,520
do.

1547
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:45,200
So I think this will be a great thing to try out and see if I can use it as my day-to-day

1548
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,200
at work.

1549
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,200
Yeah.

1550
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:55,040
Anyone else in the mumble room have any thoughts on the OpenSUSE situation, story, release?

1551
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,040
Anyone else going to try it?

1552
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:58,440
I mean, I'm already trying it.

1553
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:01,120
I've got one machine running, Tumbleweed.

1554
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:04,960
And I haven't tried Leap yet, but I do plan on trying Leap as well.

1555
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,840
But Tumbleweed is just impressive.

1556
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:15,240
And especially with OBS in conjunction with Tumbleweed, you get, like, it's not really

1557
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:21,480
like a PBA, it's not an alternative to PBA, it's not like an exact same thing, but it

1558
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:25,340
is very similar and you get a lot of packages up to date as well.

1559
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:28,420
So it's a really good experience.

1560
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:33,920
So you should try both if you're interested in just seeing what they're, what SUSE is

1561
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,720
doing with all this and OpenSUSE is doing.

1562
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:39,360
It is really cool.

1563
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:44,600
And another cool thing is that they have turned, like, you should look at their installer.

1564
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:49,600
Like their installer is nice, looks great, and it's all in Curses.

1565
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,040
Oh, really?

1566
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,040
I love in Curses.

1567
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,040
That's awesome.

1568
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,040
Yeah.

1569
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:57,840
It looks like a real, like a regular installer, like a GUI installer, and it is presented

1570
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:02,120
like a GUI, but it is all through in Curses and it's all, like, I'm pretty sure it's all

1571
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,680
based on Yast.

1572
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,560
So it's like Yast is handling it all.

1573
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:11,640
It is really slick and it is also, like, super fast and lightweight when it runs.

1574
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:18,800
And like, it's kind of like, it's kind of so cool, it's hard to actually describe it.

1575
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,680
So I'm so excited what SUSE is doing.

1576
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:22,680
Yeah.

1577
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:23,680
It is rubbing off.

1578
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:24,680
Sure is.

1579
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:25,680
Yeah.

1580
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:28,080
And so I'm going to have to try it and report back.

1581
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,560
And like I said, it's a little bit hard to conceptualize all this stuff, especially because

1582
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:37,440
a lot of these services, associated services with open SUSE, you know, don't mean a lot

1583
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,680
to me because I haven't really used it a whole lot.

1584
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:46,440
I tried to implement it one time in a commercial setting and I ran into, the first little problem

1585
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:49,600
I ran into, I'm not even necessarily blaming open SUSE, it was just, it was a dumb little

1586
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:53,360
problem that I had and I just said, just went to Ubuntu.

1587
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,400
And that was probably a little unfair and in hindsight, maybe that was a little foolish

1588
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:01,120
and short-sighted, but I'm going to give it a real world and report back.

1589
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,000
Now I have a request from the community and from everyone else.

1590
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,440
We are looking for Runs Linux.

1591
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:10,320
We are looking for really cool and unique Runs Linux.

1592
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:14,400
We are looking for a picture or a video of something that runs Linux.

1593
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,800
We see the things that like in restaurants and stuff and that's super cool.

1594
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,840
And if you see those, please send those in.

1595
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:24,080
But if you have something unique, especially if you are part of a project like the guy

1596
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,560
that wrote in that did the school bell.

1597
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,560
Oh, I love that one.

1598
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,560
Yeah.

1599
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:28,560
Wasn't that cool?

1600
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,560
Super cool.

1601
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:32,200
I mean, that, that is, that combines everything that is cool.

1602
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,360
It combines open hardware.

1603
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,480
It combines open software.

1604
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:38,240
It combines a maker and you put education, education.

1605
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,840
You get all this stuff together and you get something really cool out of it.

1606
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,120
I know that you guys are out there.

1607
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:46,120
I know that you guys that are doing cool Runs Linux people, I know you guys are out there.

1608
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:51,360
So I want you to upload a video to YouTube or submit a link via the subreddit or email

1609
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:55,240
Linux action show at jupyterbroadcasting.com or go to jupyterbroadcasting.com.

1610
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:58,460
Click on the contact link and choose Linux action show from the dropdown menu and let

1611
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:00,160
us know about your Runs Linux.

1612
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,560
We really, really want to hear it.

1613
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:08,360
Also, the network is, could really use your support, um, patreon.com slash today.

1614
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:14,280
I want to make a plea with you guys, um, to think about, uh, supporting the network.

1615
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:18,240
If you're not supporting the network, I know that, um, you know, there's, there's a, there's

1616
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:24,320
a wide variety of, of opinions, um, on, on, um, on, on the current show lineup and the

1617
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,120
current way that we're doing the shows.

1618
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:31,840
Um, but the way I have always looked at contributing to the network was I pay my cable bill and

1619
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:36,520
I pay $80, $90 and, um, I'd flipped through the channels and some of the shows I liked

1620
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:40,320
and some of the shows I didn't like and some of the episodes of the shows I liked and some

1621
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,480
of the episodes, the shows I didn't like.

1622
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:47,020
And at the end of the day, I still paid my cable bill, um, because it was a flat fee

1623
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:53,680
and right now the network is, is in need of you guys to, to, to step up and help out.

1624
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:59,400
So if, if you can afford it, um, we would really appreciate your support, patreon.com

1625
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,400
slash today.

1626
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,640
If you like the content, if you like what you're hearing, and I assume you do, if you're

1627
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:07,840
listening to the episode, um, uh, throw the network a couple of dollars, every dollar

1628
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,920
goes a long, long way and we would really appreciate it.

1629
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:16,400
And if you get to swag level, uh, sponsorship, I just have to tell you, I, I feel like it's

1630
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,400
Christmas.

1631
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,960
The other day, Angela sent me this really cool, um, like, uh, like Jupiter broadcasting

1632
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:21,960
pin.

1633
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,600
Oh, I'm jealous already.

1634
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:28,560
I know it's so like, I like ding dong, the door rings and I go up to the door and here's

1635
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,560
the mail guy.

1636
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:30,560
And I'm like, but I didn't order a package.

1637
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,460
I did not spend any of my hard earned money.

1638
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,460
Why am I getting this?

1639
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:36,760
And I rip it open and then there's like, there's a little, there's a, there's a little treat

1640
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:41,240
in there and I've gotten, I've gotten mouse pads and I've gotten coffee mugs and there's,

1641
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:42,240
there's all sorts of things.

1642
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:46,020
And I don't know, you know, I see sometimes some of the cool stuff that they're thinking

1643
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:48,680
of sending out or, or trying to work out sending out.

1644
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,920
It just, it's a cool thing to do.

1645
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,080
So if you can get to swag level supportership, that's something that's in the budget for

1646
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,080
you.

1647
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,080
I highly recommend it.

1648
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,080
It's super, super fun.

1649
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,960
And it's really rewarding to know that for literally half the cost of what it would cost

1650
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:04,560
you for direct TV or half the cost of what it would cost you for cable TV, you're supporting

1651
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:10,740
a, uh, you know, you're supporting a, a small, a small business plus all that product for

1652
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:11,740
Chris's hair.

1653
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:12,740
It just doesn't buy itself.

1654
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:13,740
No kidding.

1655
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:14,740
Right.

1656
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:16,120
Pay for that as a community.

1657
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,120
He does.

1658
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,320
And, and he, and you know, even living in the RV.

1659
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,520
I was a little worried.

1660
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:23,860
I was a little worried, Wes, when he showed up and he was talking about like doing the

1661
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:24,860
dry shampoo.

1662
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:26,600
I'm like, what if, what if all his hair fell out?

1663
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:27,600
And like, he's the network.

1664
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:28,600
It depends.

1665
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,280
I know it is, is, it's a huge deal.

1666
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,680
And so when he stepped out of the camper for the first time, like I was holding my breath

1667
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:37,040
and I'm like, and I knock and then he opens the door and there's her master Chris.

1668
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,280
And it looked amazing.

1669
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:39,280
Yeah.

1670
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,280
Looked amazing.

1671
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:44,960
So patron.com slash today really, really, really would appreciate it.

1672
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:48,540
If we could get, uh, if we could get some supporters, let's do this, let's, let's open

1673
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:54,240
this up in a browser and let's look, let's see, um, let's see what we can accomplish

1674
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,240
as a team.

1675
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:57,820
How many, how many patrons does he have right now?

1676
01:31:57,820 --> 01:31:59,900
Right now he has 554.

1677
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:01,700
Let's see if we can just get to 560.

1678
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:02,700
But I like round numbers.

1679
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:05,420
Do you ever, do you ever do that thing where you go to the gas station and he scored a

1680
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:09,660
little bit of gas into the car and, uh, and you, you, you have to bump it up to the next

1681
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:11,460
dollar just so it's a nice even amount.

1682
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:12,960
It's like a fun little game.

1683
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:13,960
I know.

1684
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:14,960
Yeah.

1685
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:15,960
So let's see if we can get it to exactly 560.

1686
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:19,500
And, and so, and so Chris wakes up and goes, oh, that's kind of cool.

1687
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:24,140
Look at what, look at what my, look what the podcast based on the community was able to

1688
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,140
accomplish.

1689
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,140
I think that would be super cool.

1690
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:27,140
Agreed.

1691
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:30,100
And you know, I always look forward to the next, the next program, you know, it's something,

1692
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:33,960
it's something that I kind of define my week with is, is JB, is JB podcasts.

1693
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:38,260
And I know a lot of you guys do too, so it really doesn't take very much to, to keep

1694
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:39,260
Chris going.

1695
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,300
No, no, it really doesn't.

1696
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:44,420
And it, like I said, every dollar goes a long, long way.

1697
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:46,780
Also join us Friday for the Linux action show.

1698
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:49,860
And I can't tell you what we're going to talk about.

1699
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:50,860
Top secret.

1700
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:51,860
Yeah.

1701
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:55,300
But I can tell you that in order to pull it off, we are going to need some Coca Cola, some

1702
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:58,620
beef jerky, a blanket, a USB drive.

1703
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:01,740
And I gave Chris a dedicated laptop before he left Grand Forks.

1704
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:05,100
So make sure you tune in and you can see what we have planned.

1705
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,860
It's going to be absolutely awesome.

1706
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:09,860
And you can use your imagination and see what you can come up with.

1707
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:12,700
Wes, is there anything you want to say before we get out of here?

1708
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:15,540
No, just that it's been a pleasure co-hosting with you Noah.

1709
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:16,860
Yeah, I really appreciate it.

1710
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:17,860
We should do this more often.

1711
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:18,860
I really think we should.

1712
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:19,860
Who needs Chris anyway?

1713
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:20,860
Yeah.

1714
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:21,860
Why I need Chris.

1715
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:22,860
Oh wait, nevermind.

1716
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:27,820
But he can, but he can go on vacation every once in a while and enjoy himself and uh,

1717
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:29,020
and we can hang out.

1718
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:33,380
That brings us to the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1719
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:36,840
We should be at our usual time next week, over to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

1720
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,260
to keep an eye on that.

1721
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:40,380
Chris may change a couple of things while he's on the road.

1722
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:44,420
If you have feedback about the show, jupyterbroadcasting.com, click on the contact link and choose Linux

You can follow me on Twitter at Colonel Linux.

1727
01:33:56,660 --> 01:33:59,740
Thank you so much for tuning into this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1728
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:04,180
A special thank you to our producer, Michael Tennell, and our mumble team.

1729
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:28,580
We'll see you right back here, next week.

1730
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:40,220
That's a wrap.

1731
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:41,220
Great show, everyone.

1732
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:42,220
Individually.

1733
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:46,820
It's such a pleasure having all these wonderful people.

1734
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:47,820
Oops.

1735
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:48,820
I hit the wrong button, Wes.

1736
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:49,820
I hit the wrong button.

1737
01:34:49,820 --> 01:34:50,820
Uh-oh.

1738
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:51,820
Uh-oh.

1739
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:52,820
And so then I couldn't hear your voice in my ear hole.

1740
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:53,820
Ah.

1741
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:55,180
What will you do without my beautiful voice, Noah?

1742
01:34:55,180 --> 01:34:56,180
I know.

1743
01:34:56,180 --> 01:34:57,180
I know.

1744
01:34:57,180 --> 01:34:58,180
All right.

1745
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:59,180
Now it's time to go to jbtitles.com.

1746
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:00,180
Jbtitles.

1747
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:02,180
I think I get to pick the title today.

1748
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:03,180
I think I do.

1749
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:04,180
You're not.

1750
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:05,180
Yeah.

1751
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:06,180
Oh.

1752
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:07,180
Yeah.

1753
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:08,180
I know.

1754
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:09,180
I know.

1755
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:10,180
We're in trouble, gang.

1756
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:11,180
That makes me sad when I see things like a title that says, Who Needs Chris?

1757
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:12,180
That's so sad.

1758
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:13,180
I would miss the hair vest.

1759
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:15,460
I would start crying if I didn't hear from him for a week.

1760
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:16,460
I think it would cry.

1761
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:18,540
It would make me sad.

1762
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:19,540
Open source power outlets.

1763
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:20,540
That's not bad.

1764
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:21,540
Um.

1765
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:22,540
Um.

1766
01:35:22,540 --> 01:35:23,540
Um.

1767
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:24,540
Um.

1768
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:25,540
Um.

1769
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:26,540
End user dilemma.

1770
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:27,540
Oh, man.

1771
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:28,540
We don't have many.

1772
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:29,540
You know what?

1773
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:32,620
Now I know why Chris says bang suggest all the way throughout the episode.

1774
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:33,620
Now I know.

1775
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:35,180
You gotta goad the audience.

1776
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:36,180
Yeah.

1777
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:40,180
If you don't, you get 12 title suggestions.

1778
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:42,180
And who doesn't want to say bang suggest?

1779
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:46,380
Who doesn't want to say bang suggest?

1780
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:51,580
I think we could have a lot of fun with God mode.

1781
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:55,580
This is Noah in God mode.

1782
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:59,380
Bang suggest inside of the chat room to come up with excellent titles that we can vote

1783
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:07,780
at JBtitles.com ultimate Linux podcast in a world where no one has submitted a title.

1784
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:13,100
Why does every single advertisement for a movie always start with in a world?

1785
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:14,540
Like we don't live in other worlds.

1786
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:16,400
We all live in the same world.

1787
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,020
Maybe that's the the fantasy draw.

1788
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:20,020
Maybe.

1789
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:21,480
All right.

1790
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:22,680
We need titles, guys.

1791
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:23,680
We need time.

1792
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:24,680
It's a.

1793
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:27,340
Oh, we got multi universe type thing.

1794
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:32,060
Noah in God mode, open source power, open source, your power outlets, open source, your

1795
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:34,500
power outlets isn't bad, especially because it's close.

1796
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,500
Yeah.

1797
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:41,100
So do we like open source power outlets or open source, your power outlets?

1798
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:43,100
Maybe not your just because it's shorter.

1799
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:44,100
OK.

1800
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:45,100
All right.

1801
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:49,220
So open source power outlets is winning by seven votes.

1802
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,820
All by four votes, total seven.

1803
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:54,260
I mean, either one, I think are great.

1804
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:57,980
Not the same just because I did them, but not anyone.

1805
01:36:57,980 --> 01:37:02,460
Unbiased rotten as always.

1806
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:03,460
Protect the beard.

1807
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:09,100
I was focusing more on moving you guys around than anything else.

1808
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:10,100
Thank you.

1809
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:11,100
Yes, thank you very much.

1810
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:17,100
I really, really, really appreciate it, because the way that the setup is, if I if I if I if

1811
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:20,280
somebody were to talk to the Mumble Room, I would reach over and mute the Mumble Room,

1812
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:23,600
but then that would mute West and there's no way for me to separate West unless you

1813
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:27,580
put us into our own separate.

1814
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:28,580
Our own separate channel.

1815
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:29,580
Don't worry.

1816
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:30,580
We got this.

1817
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:31,580
Yeah.

1818
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:32,580
You guys are amazing.

1819
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:33,580
Just just amazing.

1820
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:35,980
Did you like my thank you to you rotten corpse at the end?

1821
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:38,980
Yeah, that was fantastic.

1822
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:39,980
So.

1823
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:40,980
All right.

1824
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:41,980
Open source power outlets is the winner.

1825
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:47,100
Yeah, I declare it as a winner because it has to be because it has the most votes out

1826
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:48,100
of everything.

1827
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:49,100
Oh, you know what?

1828
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:50,100
I'm not going to say it.

1829
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:51,100
I'll say it.

1830
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:53,700
I won't say it right now.

1831
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:54,700
Okay.

1832
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:55,700
What are we going to talk about for a post show?

1833
01:37:55,700 --> 01:38:01,660
We're going to talk about the open QA dot open source dot or open source dot org.

1834
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:05,500
But yeah, I know that we've got there already.

1835
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:08,460
I didn't know that was a photo impressions there.

1836
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:09,780
Oh, yeah.

1837
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:11,420
No, it doesn't matter.

1838
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:12,420
There's tons of things to talk about.

1839
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:15,420
What else should we talk about, guys?

1840
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:18,860
To you, Mumble.

1841
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:22,140
Hey, thanks for the meetup shout out.

1842
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:23,140
Yeah.

1843
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:24,140
Thank you so much.

1844
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:25,140
All right.

1845
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:26,140
Let's talk.

1846
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:27,140
Well, I guess I was kind of the pre-show topic.

1847
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:30,340
But yeah, thank you so much for making the making the time to be at the meetup.

1848
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:36,060
I, you know, it'd be really cool to get up and do that every once in a while.

1849
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:37,060
I think that should be a thing.

1850
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:38,060
Do, do, do.

1851
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:39,060
Yeah.

1852
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:43,860
And since I assume Chris isn't going to hear this part, I'm not going to break it to him

1853
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:47,820
that they spelled my name wrong, but.

1854
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:48,820
They spelled your name wrong?

1855
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:49,820
Oh, yeah.

1856
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:52,140
I had the Rover Rambler.

1857
01:38:52,140 --> 01:38:56,300
I didn't I didn't leave a card that since my name is Reed with an I.

1858
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:57,300
Oh.

1859
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:58,300
OK.

1860
01:38:58,300 --> 01:38:59,300
It'll be our secret.

1861
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,300
It's not like it's going out over the air or anything.

1862
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:04,140
So nobody will ever know.

1863
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:08,980
So there's there's one thing this is more of an interesting topic or less, but it's

1864
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:09,980
not really.

1865
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:13,620
I guess it's perfect for post-show, I guess.

1866
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:19,420
But there's a there's some new stuff with the like the Devils Canyon stuff and the new

1867
01:39:19,420 --> 01:39:24,620
hardware stuff for running.

1868
01:39:24,620 --> 01:39:27,180
Hard like running virtualization pass through.

1869
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:31,660
So you have the hardware, hardware acceleration and everything in a virtual machine.

1870
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:38,340
So you could use something like KVM or you could use a bird manager or whatever.

1871
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:40,580
And I think even VirtualBox has this.

1872
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:46,540
So you can play Windows games inside of a virtual machine with your hardware and everything.

1873
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:49,500
So it feels like a full.

1874
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:54,580
You know, you have a full machine, you basically have, you know, everything you absolutely

1875
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:55,580
need.

1876
01:39:55,580 --> 01:40:00,780
And even like 60 frames per second games and stuff running now, are they using KVM pass

1877
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:01,780
through for that?

1878
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:07,100
Yeah, there's KVM pass through and well, it's PCI pass through, but you basically get access

1879
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:10,940
to your graphics card and you get the full processor ability.

1880
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:12,700
So it limits like your main host.

1881
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:15,220
But if you're playing a game, it doesn't matter.

1882
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:19,100
But it gives you like the full access to all of your hardware.

1883
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:25,280
And only like the latest like from Haswell and newer has these like these features like

1884
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:26,440
pretty solid.

1885
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:29,980
But you need to have like a motherboard and the processor needs to support it.

1886
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:30,980
Both need to support it.

1887
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:31,980
Otherwise, it won't work.

1888
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:32,980
What is it?

1889
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:33,980
Intel?

1890
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:34,980
Is it BTD?

1891
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:35,980
Is the name of the?

1892
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:36,980
Yeah, I think so.

1893
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:37,980
Yes, BTD.

1894
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:42,100
I've always had this crazy idea that I could have like one physical machine that sits in

1895
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:48,020
my basement and then have like four video cards and then a KVM switch so I could KVM

1896
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:52,980
through my different computers, but they're all physically one machine.

1897
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:58,500
I don't know how realistic that is, but I dream or maybe not to definitely possibly

1898
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:01,300
three or might be a little bit over the time.

1899
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:02,300
Don't push your luck, Noah.

1900
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:06,960
You know, separation is so nice, like even things for different tasks.

1901
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:10,700
The amount of times that I have thanked myself for having a separate video production computer

1902
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:11,700
than everything else.

1903
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:15,780
It's not because video production is so like it's not like I can multitask doing video

1904
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:16,780
production.

1905
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:20,420
Either I'm editing video or I'm not, but the mere fact that it's on a separate machine

1906
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:23,580
means that I can slide my chair over, get a little bit of work done, and if I have to

1907
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:26,680
do something else, I go to a different machine to do it.

1908
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:30,100
Not only am I not interrupting my workflow, but I don't wind up with extra junk on my

1909
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:34,540
machine like I don't wind up with Thunderbird with misconfigured email accounts because

1910
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:37,580
the password changed, but I hadn't opened it in a year or so that, you know, just didn't

1911
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:38,580
work or something like that.

1912
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:44,500
And I don't wind up with, you know, weird files and my huge long list of Firefox bookmarks

1913
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:46,000
on my video editing machine.

1914
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,820
All I have is resources for editing videos.

1915
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:51,860
And as we know in your life, everything changes pretty much all the time.

1916
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:55,980
So it's probably essential to have some a little firewall where you can say this is

1917
01:41:55,980 --> 01:41:59,780
the purpose and it stays that way and I change it only when needed.

1918
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:02,300
Wes, I call it an ADD firewall.

1919
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:03,300
Perfect.

1920
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:07,660
It's a firewall for my ADD and it helps me separate things out into separate machines.

1921
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:09,380
You have a toy machine over there.

1922
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:11,340
Don't install that package yet.

1923
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:13,340
That's the one with the shiny stuff on it.

1924
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:14,340
Exactly.

1925
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:19,980
But yeah, so that has been where I have found that's been hugely helpful to be able to compartmentalize

1926
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:24,440
stuff and if I could, that's a promise, it's very, very expensive to buy different machines

1927
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:26,020
to do multiple different things.

1928
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:30,420
Yeah, boy, the number of computers you have, that's right, brings a tear to my eye.

1929
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:31,420
Yeah.

1930
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:38,940
So you need a KVM switch with a keyboard and mouse shut off so it limits the access to

1931
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:39,940
that machine.

1932
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:47,100
Well, if I had, so if I could pass through, so the KVM switch will give me four USB connectors,

1933
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:48,100
right?

1934
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:49,100
And four video connectors.

1935
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:55,700
And so I could plug all four video, I could plug all four KVM connectors into the computer

1936
01:42:55,700 --> 01:43:00,460
and I'm hoping there would be a way that I could tell it this USB plug is only passed

1937
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:03,300
through to this computer and this one is only passed through to this computer.

1938
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:09,380
And I don't know, I might end up having to use separate like little PCI, you know, cards

1939
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:13,060
with a separate USB controller, huh, to be able to get that to work.

1940
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:18,340
Oh, you know what, I just saw somebody on YouTube that did this, was that Logitech has,

1941
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:24,940
what the heck they call it, it's the mouse that has like multiple Bluetooth dongles and

1942
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:28,780
a switch on the bottom of the mouse that you can go back and forth.

1943
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:30,420
Oh, that is awesome.

1944
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:36,140
And like, you know, it's intended to be, you know, you can plug, you can pair with two

1945
01:43:36,140 --> 01:43:43,980
different computers, but if you plug the USB dongle into the same computer and then pair

1946
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:49,940
the USB port that the dongle is plugged into your KVM, then, you know, you've got the same

1947
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:54,900
mouse that's paired with two different machines on the same physical host.

1948
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:55,900
It's like a hardware synergy.

1949
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:58,100
You know what's funny?

1950
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:59,740
You took the words right out of my mouth.

1951
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:00,740
Those are my words now.

1952
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:01,740
Yeah.

1953
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:02,740
Yeah.

1954
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:05,220
That's what I was, that's right about what I was going to say was it's like what I look

1955
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:09,620
for with synergy and except not in synergy.

1956
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:10,620
Well that'll be really cool.

1957
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:11,700
I will have to keep an eye on that.

1958
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:14,660
It's something that, it's something that I really think I could put into practice.

1959
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:18,860
Again, it's, I'm going to run up against that problem of, since I have a working solution,

1960
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:22,280
I'm going to have to pry myself away.

1961
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:28,060
Anything else anyone wants to add into the post show before we get out of here?

1962
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:33,500
Well the reason I brought up the hardware thing is because it creates a potential discussion

1963
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:40,940
topic of when Linux adoption is something that's really hard to do right now, you know,

1964
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:45,620
for a, you know, forever basically because trying to convince them about a certain application

1965
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:46,620
blah blah.

1966
01:44:46,620 --> 01:44:55,920
Do you think it would be better and that Linux would be more likely to kind of take over

1967
01:44:55,920 --> 01:45:03,100
the world if, you know, there was pre-packaged applications that you could just run and like

1968
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:05,900
instead of having to see, oh, does it support it?

1969
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:06,900
Doesn't matter.

1970
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,220
Your virtual machine has an app.

1971
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:11,580
We have an instead of a wine wrapper, we have a virtual machine wrapper and all you do is

1972
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:14,140
install this and there you go.

1973
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:21,420
I've done that on a basic scale for my parents before where I had a Windows application listening

1974
01:45:21,420 --> 01:45:25,460
for a file at startup and I would have a shortcut on the Linux desktop for like, you know, when

1975
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:30,540
my mom, for instance, would need to use Microsoft Office for a certain document, you know, once

1976
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:34,820
in a while that she could pass it, open it up just like a regular application, it would

1977
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:38,780
open the virtual machine, the virtual machine would know to open Word.

1978
01:45:38,780 --> 01:45:41,700
So I think there's something there.

1979
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:45,720
Long term solution maybe not but it could be a really good, you know, a wrapper for

1980
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:50,420
someone who wants to transition but still requires a certain amount of Windows specific.

1981
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:55,460
You know, I keep coming back to, I really hope I'm not wrong on this but I'm really

1982
01:45:55,460 --> 01:46:00,500
hoping that as we move forward, that web centric applications begin to take more dominance

1983
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:05,660
and as that happens, the need for a compatibility layer just kind of drops.

1984
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:07,140
I mean, hopefully.

1985
01:46:07,140 --> 01:46:11,220
Yeah, but the web layer can't really work with the hardware that well.

1986
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:12,500
Yeah, that's true.

1987
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:14,260
Something has to talk to the hardware, you're right.

1988
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:18,940
So there's certain things like, I don't know, it's kind of like the web apps have like,

1989
01:46:18,940 --> 01:46:25,100
I use web apps a lot and they're great in certain cases and they're awful in other cases.

1990
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:32,140
So like stuff like WebGL are making that a lot better but I think that there's, you know,

1991
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:34,660
I don't want web apps to become the norm.

1992
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:39,020
I would like them to become a novelty that it's a very highly used novelty.

1993
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:40,100
Yep, yep.

1994
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:43,020
I'm right there with you Rottencorpz, I really am.

1995
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:47,740
I have seen web apps, I have always looked at them as a necessary evil.

1996
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:51,580
I would prefer that my software run locally but if I have my choice between running the

1997
01:46:51,580 --> 01:46:57,220
software on Linux in a web browser or running Windows software only, if I have to pick between

1998
01:46:57,220 --> 01:46:59,740
those two, I'll take the web software every time.

1999
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:02,860
Yeah, I would agree with that.

2000
01:47:02,860 --> 01:47:06,700
Windows users migrate to web software, Linux will keep our awesome desktop applications.

2001
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:07,700
Yeah, exactly.

2002
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:21,020
See, now we're on the money, we can agree on that.
