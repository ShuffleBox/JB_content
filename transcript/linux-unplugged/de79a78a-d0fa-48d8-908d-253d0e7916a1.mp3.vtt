WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.840
Did we just hear that someone in the mumble room

00:01.840 --> 00:03.440
is running Solaris?

00:03.440 --> 00:04.400
Tell me about this.

00:04.400 --> 00:09.400
Yeah, so I've got a Solaris virtual machine running QEMU

00:09.640 --> 00:14.520
and I've got IRC running over Telnet inside of Solaris,

00:14.520 --> 00:16.520
inside of a virtual machine.

00:16.520 --> 00:17.360
Why?

00:17.360 --> 00:19.680
I honestly don't know, I was bored.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.280
Isn't that the reason for anything?

00:21.280 --> 00:23.520
Yeah, because I can.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.840
And I mean, at this point,

00:24.840 --> 00:27.160
he might be the last Solaris user out there.

00:27.160 --> 00:32.160
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.360
Hello friends, and welcome back

00:36.360 --> 00:38.000
to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:38.000 --> 00:38.920
My name is Chris.

00:38.920 --> 00:39.960
My name is Wes.

00:39.960 --> 00:40.880
My name is Brent.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.240
Hello gentlemen, welcome in.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.880
And this episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.920
You know, they are the leader in learning for Cloud Linux

00:47.920 --> 00:48.920
and other modern tech skills.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.040
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs.

00:51.040 --> 00:54.720
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.560
Well, coming up on the show today,

00:56.560 --> 00:59.480
we're gonna do a checkup call on the state of Linux phones,

00:59.480 --> 01:01.000
a little reality check there.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.480
And maybe we'll then try to work out the line exactly,

01:04.480 --> 01:07.000
where do you draw what makes a Linux user

01:07.000 --> 01:09.280
and what doesn't make a Linux user?

01:09.280 --> 01:11.120
And as funny as it sounds,

01:11.120 --> 01:13.120
that question, as we kicked it around as a team

01:13.120 --> 01:15.560
before the show, turned out to be a lot harder to answer

01:15.560 --> 01:16.400
than you might think.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.120
We'll go into details on that.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.200
But first, before we get into the show,

01:20.200 --> 01:21.960
right at the top, I wanna say hello,

01:21.960 --> 01:24.200
time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.160
Hello mumble room.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.040
Hello.

01:27.040 --> 01:27.880
Good evening.

01:27.880 --> 01:28.720
Hello.

01:28.720 --> 01:30.320
Hi, it's nice to, I can't see you today

01:30.320 --> 01:32.920
because of this remote setup I have going,

01:32.920 --> 01:35.040
but I can hear you and I can feel you.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.640
So it's good to have you there.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.720
This is the last remote show for a while.

01:39.720 --> 01:43.360
I made it to Oregon and JOOPS is all fixed up

01:43.360 --> 01:46.040
as of like an hour before the show.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.280
I feel like at this point, you shouldn't even tell us.

01:48.280 --> 01:49.560
You're just gonna jinx it.

01:49.560 --> 01:50.400
I know.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.680
And actually it's not even totally fixed.

01:51.680 --> 01:52.920
There is still one more.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.360
Yeah.

01:54.360 --> 01:55.320
That's how it always goes.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.320
You say last remote show, but how can you be sure?

01:57.320 --> 01:58.640
Well, if it breaks down again,

01:58.640 --> 02:00.000
he's just gonna move to Oregon.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.880
Yeah, pretty much.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.640
Like I just can't have it.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.000
We made it into the shop yesterday

02:05.000 --> 02:06.800
and they squeezed us in on a Monday,

02:06.800 --> 02:08.400
but they couldn't finish.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.080
They figured out what went wrong.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.240
They fixed it for us.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.320
And we also improved it a little bit

02:13.320 --> 02:16.080
by adding a few more what are called Coney shocks.

02:16.080 --> 02:19.720
They're very, oh, Coneys, you like Coneys, oh, okay.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.360
And we got those installed and the ride's better than ever.

02:22.360 --> 02:25.480
She really is riding so, so great.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.280
I wish I could have done this work ironically

02:27.280 --> 02:31.960
before the trip, but we wouldn't have been in here

02:31.960 --> 02:33.280
if we didn't have the suspension problems,

02:33.280 --> 02:35.400
but they finished her up about an hour ago.

02:35.400 --> 02:40.280
And then I rushed to a spot that is without any kind

02:40.280 --> 02:43.360
of doubt, Brent, the best spot I have been in

02:43.360 --> 02:44.920
since we started the road trip.

02:44.920 --> 02:47.000
And I wish I could have brought you here

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
because I feel like you got a bad picture

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
of what all the RV parks are like.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.360
Cause you didn't really get to go any nice ones.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.200
What?

02:54.200 --> 02:56.000
You told me the whole time these were great.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.480
No, no, no.

02:57.480 --> 02:58.960
This one we're at is great.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.680
So what's different about it that makes it so a chic?

03:01.680 --> 03:02.640
Well, you're gonna like this.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.560
First of all, cement pads everywhere.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.360
Everything's cement, right?

03:06.360 --> 03:07.520
You got grass.

03:07.520 --> 03:12.200
Oh yeah, trees with shade and super fast wifi,

03:12.200 --> 03:16.080
beautiful landscapes, bridges over creeks

03:16.080 --> 03:19.400
and just a wonderful facility.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.080
Nice bathrooms, huge showers,

03:21.080 --> 03:23.360
really like a destination RV park.

03:23.360 --> 03:25.960
And they let us in early too.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.880
Like usually you can't even get into like two o'clock,

03:27.880 --> 03:29.360
but the show goes live at noon

03:29.360 --> 03:31.240
and I needed to be in before that to set up.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.200
They let us in a couple of hours or well,

03:33.200 --> 03:35.200
more than a couple of hours early,

03:35.200 --> 03:37.160
no extra charge just because they, you know,

03:37.160 --> 03:39.120
they wanted to make sure we could get set up for the show.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.080
How great is that?

03:40.080 --> 03:41.360
That's pretty amazing.

03:41.360 --> 03:42.600
How's the dog park though?

03:42.600 --> 03:45.600
Yeah, I'll tell you, he's out enjoying it right now.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.160
I got on the air and Hadia took Levi out

03:49.160 --> 03:51.360
for some fun that was like, we just boom,

03:51.360 --> 03:54.640
got right to it because there's a lot to do today.

03:54.640 --> 03:57.280
So why don't we get into some community news?

03:57.280 --> 04:00.000
And the first one is a series of stories

04:00.000 --> 04:02.120
that kind of came together to give us an update

04:02.120 --> 04:06.120
on the state of Linux on phones.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.840
And you might've heard that Purism is raising the price

04:08.840 --> 04:11.520
of the yet to be fully fulfilled Librem 5.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.400
Now I think making it more expensive

04:13.400 --> 04:15.360
than an iPhone 13, ironically.

04:15.360 --> 04:17.960
That is impressive by itself.

04:17.960 --> 04:21.440
Yeah, Purism wrote that we will be increasing prices

04:21.440 --> 04:26.320
for all new orders of the Librem 5 in stages.

04:26.320 --> 04:29.880
So the phone will be priced at 1199

04:29.880 --> 04:34.880
for all orders received on or after November 1st, 2021.

04:35.880 --> 04:40.440
And then the price goes up another a hundred bucks to 1299

04:40.440 --> 04:44.040
if you order after March, 2022.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.560
Although they do go on to note

04:45.560 --> 04:48.200
that they have a refund policy.

04:48.200 --> 04:52.160
Good, and I also appreciate the early communication on it,

04:52.160 --> 04:55.440
but it really feels like a desperate move

04:55.440 --> 04:57.280
that the hardware of this thing

04:57.280 --> 05:00.680
is already so substantially uncompetitive.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.320
And even if they make some investments

05:02.320 --> 05:05.160
like they say they might into the hardware,

05:05.160 --> 05:07.800
it's so far behind everything else

05:07.800 --> 05:11.120
that you can't make the hardware the value proposition.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.920
And the software, well, I think the whole package

05:14.920 --> 05:16.280
gives us all a bit of a reality check.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.760
And it seems like every time we see

05:17.760 --> 05:20.520
one of these disappointing updates from Purism,

05:20.520 --> 05:23.120
we learn again just how hard it really truly is

05:23.120 --> 05:24.840
to take on the Apple and Google duopoly

05:24.840 --> 05:26.280
because it's not just the hardware,

05:26.280 --> 05:28.480
it's the software and the ecosystems.

05:28.480 --> 05:32.600
And that just alone has its own incredible challenges,

05:32.600 --> 05:34.800
many of which I don't think we can even appreciate

05:34.800 --> 05:37.400
since we can't fully inspect the code of iOS and Android,

05:37.400 --> 05:39.320
we can't even see all the problems they've solved.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.240
Android, obviously at least the base is more open,

05:41.240 --> 05:43.800
but that whole Google layer is closed off to us.

05:43.800 --> 05:48.160
And as is on iOS, it's with this that you think,

05:48.160 --> 05:50.280
well, okay, well, where can we focus and do good?

05:50.280 --> 05:53.040
If we can't really compete on the software,

05:53.040 --> 05:57.120
at least at the user level and the APIs and the ecosystem,

05:57.120 --> 05:59.960
can we compete in a way that is more genuine

05:59.960 --> 06:02.400
to free software, more like how we do

06:02.400 --> 06:04.200
where we slowly build up over time

06:04.200 --> 06:05.560
and we upstream technology.

06:05.560 --> 06:09.080
And in the last week, I think there was a link

06:09.080 --> 06:10.160
that started getting spread around

06:10.160 --> 06:11.880
that really made me think like this challenge

06:11.880 --> 06:15.720
is so much greater than we've ever conceptualized.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.920
There was a post that was authored in mid June,

06:17.920 --> 06:19.080
but it's been, I don't know why,

06:19.080 --> 06:21.520
but it's been getting linked around like crazy this week.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.960
And the post was created by Median,

06:24.960 --> 06:26.800
I apologize because he's a security researcher.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.800
You may be familiar with the projects that he's worked on.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.560
They work on Whoix or Hoonix, I should say.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.520
And their post was getting shared around

06:35.520 --> 06:37.280
and it really was trying to draw attention

06:37.280 --> 06:40.840
to mobile Linux OSes lacking what we would consider

06:40.840 --> 06:44.200
really kind of table stakes standard security features

06:44.200 --> 06:45.880
in Android or iOS.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.960
Yeah, they note that at this point,

06:47.960 --> 06:52.200
Linux phones lack any significant security model.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.040
And the points from the Linux article

06:54.040 --> 06:55.760
apply to Linux phones fully.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.220
I mean, if you've read their article

06:57.220 --> 06:59.440
about the Linux security implications,

06:59.440 --> 07:03.400
you get Linux on a phone, all of those basically port over.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.960
There's not yet a single Linux phone

07:04.960 --> 07:06.560
with the same security model.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.280
They don't have modern security features

07:08.280 --> 07:11.560
such as full system Mac policies, verified boot,

07:11.560 --> 07:13.240
strong app sandboxing,

07:13.240 --> 07:15.560
something we're still working on on the desktop,

07:15.560 --> 07:18.960
modern exploit mitigations and so on,

07:18.960 --> 07:23.600
which even most modern Android phones already deploy.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.680
Those are all fair points, right?

07:24.680 --> 07:27.580
There is mandatory access controls

07:27.580 --> 07:30.700
and limiting application data access with sandboxing.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.500
And a lot of stuff we have all the fundamental plumbing for,

07:33.500 --> 07:35.740
but we're just not necessarily employing

07:35.740 --> 07:37.160
in our mobile OSes yet.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.760
There's that kind of security.

07:39.620 --> 07:40.960
And then there's the kind of security

07:40.960 --> 07:42.560
that we talk a lot about on Self-Hosted

07:42.560 --> 07:44.120
and we talk about on this show.

07:44.120 --> 07:47.300
And that's the security from eavesdropping

07:47.300 --> 07:48.840
and the privacy that you get

07:48.840 --> 07:50.000
from controlling your own devices

07:50.000 --> 07:52.820
or having access to application data

07:52.820 --> 07:55.360
or being able to install arbitrary applications, right?

07:55.360 --> 07:58.700
There are different kinds of security

07:58.700 --> 08:00.260
and they're all important.

08:00.260 --> 08:03.500
And the Linux devices are really good

08:03.500 --> 08:06.680
at like the privacy and user control kind of security.

08:06.680 --> 08:07.660
Do you follow what I'm saying?

08:07.660 --> 08:08.500
I think in all of this,

08:08.500 --> 08:10.420
like the observations here are definitely true,

08:10.420 --> 08:12.020
but we're still stuck in that middle ground.

08:12.020 --> 08:13.420
And maybe we're gonna talk a little bit more

08:13.420 --> 08:14.460
about this later in the show,

08:14.460 --> 08:17.260
but like, what are we marketing here?

08:17.260 --> 08:19.340
Are these phones made for the average user

08:19.340 --> 08:21.100
who doesn't know what they're doing?

08:21.100 --> 08:22.180
Is that the end goal?

08:22.180 --> 08:24.300
Because if so, then yeah, right?

08:24.300 --> 08:26.300
Like they are not competing on the terms of protections

08:26.300 --> 08:28.380
that we now have for those users.

08:28.380 --> 08:29.940
But at the same time,

08:29.940 --> 08:32.420
I kind of hate that on a non-rooted Android phone,

08:32.420 --> 08:33.860
I don't really feel like it's my phone.

08:33.860 --> 08:36.780
I can only do a subset of the things I'm used to doing,

08:36.780 --> 08:38.220
which means I still haven't shifted

08:38.220 --> 08:41.300
a majority of my workflows off the desktop, you know?

08:41.300 --> 08:42.700
And so there is kind of that balance.

08:42.700 --> 08:43.940
Like I want security,

08:43.940 --> 08:46.020
but I want it in the way that I can opt into it

08:46.020 --> 08:47.220
and I'm aware of it.

08:47.220 --> 08:48.900
And I don't know that we really have anything

08:48.900 --> 08:50.980
that meets all of those needs.

08:50.980 --> 08:54.220
Yeah, to say nothing of the apps, like mapping and...

08:54.220 --> 08:55.600
Well, yeah, you still have to have apps

08:55.600 --> 08:57.340
that actually let you get your stuff done.

08:57.340 --> 09:00.580
And then there's sort of the lower level stuff, right?

09:00.580 --> 09:02.240
The Post does a great job of noting

09:02.240 --> 09:03.820
that we have a lot of the plumbing

09:03.820 --> 09:05.940
for decent firmware updates.

09:05.940 --> 09:08.060
But when you look at the devices

09:08.060 --> 09:09.160
that are out there right now,

09:09.160 --> 09:11.340
there's not really a lot of standardized ways of doing it.

09:11.340 --> 09:14.660
Like let's look at the Librem and PureOS again.

09:14.660 --> 09:15.540
They prevent the user

09:15.540 --> 09:17.680
from loading proprietary firmware updates,

09:17.680 --> 09:20.260
which seems like a good thing.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.220
But in practice over the years,

09:22.220 --> 09:25.500
it means that users can't update to new firmwares

09:25.500 --> 09:27.060
released by that vendor

09:28.260 --> 09:30.680
because you have to wait for the Purism version,

09:30.680 --> 09:32.980
which sometimes maybe gets old out of date,

09:32.980 --> 09:34.580
insecure, has known vulnerabilities.

09:34.580 --> 09:36.020
Like there's just, it's not sustainable

09:36.020 --> 09:37.340
for every vendor to be releasing

09:37.340 --> 09:39.900
their own custom free versions of firmwares.

09:39.900 --> 09:41.860
And then you're back in that choice problem, right?

09:41.860 --> 09:43.540
Where you're like, well, okay, I get that.

09:43.540 --> 09:45.400
And maybe some users would prefer to wait for that.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.360
But then there might be other users who are like,

09:47.360 --> 09:48.380
okay, well, this isn't ideal,

09:48.380 --> 09:49.920
but I would rather just take the security update,

09:49.920 --> 09:52.060
even if it's proprietary firmware right now,

09:52.060 --> 09:53.020
and they can't do that.

09:53.020 --> 09:55.460
But there's a layer to security in these mobile devices

09:55.460 --> 09:57.260
that we've touched on before,

09:57.260 --> 09:59.700
but is trickier than I think we can appreciate.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.900
And that is sometimes there's components in there

10:01.900 --> 10:03.660
that don't necessarily even trust each other

10:03.660 --> 10:05.860
and how you implement that isolation matters.

10:05.860 --> 10:08.940
Yeah, it's really worth reading the full post here.

10:08.940 --> 10:11.140
And of course, that'll be linked in the show notes.

10:11.140 --> 10:13.760
But as an example, we talk a lot about the importance

10:13.760 --> 10:15.420
of like modem isolation, right?

10:15.420 --> 10:18.360
You've got this baseband stuff that really no one trusts.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.620
And we're always hearing about how those cellular modems

10:20.620 --> 10:22.540
are basically essential on a device,

10:22.540 --> 10:24.220
but they're also kind of risky

10:24.220 --> 10:25.580
and can receive all kinds of commands

10:25.580 --> 10:27.360
to do remote snooping on you.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.220
And then there's what the Librem 5 is trying to do

10:30.220 --> 10:32.580
to try to isolate that modem.

10:32.580 --> 10:34.980
It seems it's a little unorthodox

10:34.980 --> 10:37.620
because it actually attempts to isolate the modem

10:37.620 --> 10:40.980
using the Linux kernel's USB stack.

10:40.980 --> 10:43.180
Interesting in theory,

10:43.180 --> 10:45.240
but that stack wasn't necessarily designed

10:45.240 --> 10:47.820
as a strong isolation barrier,

10:47.820 --> 10:49.860
which the article really highlights.

10:49.860 --> 10:53.020
Yeah, you can see how that could be target number one

10:53.020 --> 10:54.860
for an attacker is just figuring out

10:54.860 --> 10:58.020
how to hop around just right there.

10:58.020 --> 10:59.660
Brenda, I think the unspoken thing too,

10:59.660 --> 11:02.060
when we talk about Linux phones,

11:02.060 --> 11:03.820
and I'm curious if this is true for you

11:03.820 --> 11:05.460
because this is how I feel.

11:05.460 --> 11:07.400
When I'm thinking about a Linux phone long-term,

11:07.400 --> 11:09.220
I'm still trying to solve the problem

11:09.220 --> 11:12.100
I was probably trying to solve back in 2002.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.820
And that is have a mobile compute device

11:14.820 --> 11:17.540
that lets me do the kind of work I need to do

11:17.540 --> 11:19.460
when I need to do it in a pinch.

11:19.460 --> 11:21.280
And that's, I think, something Linux could offer me

11:21.280 --> 11:24.100
on a device that iOS and Android can't.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.380
And I think that's really what still appeals to me

11:26.380 --> 11:29.220
about these devices and the privacy.

11:29.220 --> 11:32.100
Yeah, I think those of us in this wonderful Linux niche

11:32.100 --> 11:35.580
of ours just want that sort of mobility.

11:35.580 --> 11:37.960
I know you've been talking about it for years.

11:37.960 --> 11:41.300
And it feels like we're still really far away from that,

11:41.300 --> 11:43.100
even though we've been thinking about it for a long time.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.620
Some people are working really hard on it,

11:44.620 --> 11:48.300
but man, it feels like smart posts like this

11:48.300 --> 11:51.580
just make me feel kind of sad and sick all at once

11:51.580 --> 11:53.860
about the current state of affairs, really.

11:53.860 --> 11:56.860
Sad and sick at the same time is a great way to put it.

11:56.860 --> 11:58.580
Although I do have a glimmer of hope

11:58.580 --> 12:00.860
because I feel like my use case

12:00.860 --> 12:03.760
is going to be addressed one day.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.580
Like, I think I'll probably,

12:05.580 --> 12:07.860
one day I'll be like a two-phone guy again,

12:07.860 --> 12:10.160
and I'll have, instead of an Android and iPhone,

12:10.160 --> 12:12.820
again, I'll have probably an iPhone

12:12.820 --> 12:14.920
and probably a Linux phone.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.300
And I'll use the iPhone for some of my traveling apps

12:18.300 --> 12:20.340
and stuff like that, and maybe I'd use the Linux phone

12:20.340 --> 12:23.980
for remote work or doing any kind of thing

12:23.980 --> 12:25.900
that requires anything outside the box.

12:25.900 --> 12:28.820
I guess we're gonna need bigger pockets, though.

12:28.820 --> 12:31.180
I mean, I suppose devices just get smaller and smaller,

12:31.180 --> 12:32.660
so maybe we can make it work.

12:32.660 --> 12:36.540
Two words, my man, two words, tactical pants.

12:36.540 --> 12:37.900
They're a real thing.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.180
Do you not know about tactical pants?

12:39.180 --> 12:41.020
I'm just not sure they're my style.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.480
Tactical shorts, maybe?

12:42.480 --> 12:44.580
Yeah, maybe you should go with the tactical shorts, Wes.

12:44.580 --> 12:45.900
You should probably go with the tactical shorts.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.260
They have vests, you know?

12:47.260 --> 12:48.940
You can keep your Linux phone in your vest.

12:48.940 --> 12:50.620
That's all I'm all about, a vest.

12:50.620 --> 12:51.620
Mm-hmm, you know it.

12:51.620 --> 12:56.620
Looks like the dev kits are on the move.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.580
So let's do a little quick update.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.700
Valve has sent out a short little blurb to developers

13:03.700 --> 13:07.540
saying that if you haven't gotten your deck yet,

13:07.540 --> 13:08.420
you should get it soon.

13:08.420 --> 13:11.220
And they've included in there some sweet shots.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.720
Seriously, we'll have a link to the article

13:13.720 --> 13:17.240
where the deck looks good, hooked up to maybe even possibly

13:17.240 --> 13:19.820
a mechanical keyboard, getting all of its OS updates.

13:19.820 --> 13:22.300
Yeah, Liam over at Gaming on Linux

13:22.300 --> 13:26.620
notes that a few developers have already received their units,

13:26.620 --> 13:28.740
saying that Gary Neumann of Facepunch

13:28.740 --> 13:32.660
commented that Rust runs good on the Steam Deck.

13:32.660 --> 13:34.500
And they're working with easy anti-cheat

13:34.500 --> 13:38.140
to get it all hooked up, which is very important.

13:38.140 --> 13:41.820
Also saw Phil Spencer of Xbox had access as well

13:41.820 --> 13:45.660
and commented on Halo, Age of Empires, and xCloud,

13:45.660 --> 13:48.300
all working nicely.

13:48.300 --> 13:51.260
It also seems that the Terraria developer, ReLogic,

13:51.260 --> 13:53.140
also has a dev kit.

13:53.140 --> 13:55.340
They noted on Twitter to say that Terraria and the Steam

13:55.340 --> 14:01.180
Deck, perfect combination for your adventures.

14:01.180 --> 14:03.740
Linode.com slash unplugged.

14:03.740 --> 14:07.060
Go there to get $100 in credit for 60 days on a new account.

14:07.060 --> 14:09.020
And of course, you go there to support the show.

14:09.020 --> 14:11.540
So that's linode.com slash unplugged.

14:11.540 --> 14:12.880
Linode is our hosting provider.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.200
They have been for a couple of years now.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.300
I became a customer first.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.420
I signed up because I was, I'll be honest,

14:19.420 --> 14:21.140
I was a little Linode curious.

14:21.140 --> 14:22.780
You might be a little Linode curious too.

14:22.780 --> 14:24.580
I recommend you take this opportunity

14:24.580 --> 14:26.600
to support the show and get that $100.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.260
And after I tried it out, I thought,

14:28.260 --> 14:30.100
this is where we're going to build everything.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.420
And then once we got the idea to go independent again,

14:32.420 --> 14:34.340
I knew I was going to need a lot of infrastructure fast.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.320
And I knew I was going to have to make

14:35.320 --> 14:39.100
a serious decision about where I host that infrastructure.

14:39.100 --> 14:41.060
Because A, I want it to run great,

14:41.060 --> 14:43.420
because that's part of what I think the JB experience is,

14:43.420 --> 14:45.060
is that you get our files super fast.

14:45.060 --> 14:46.380
And everything runs really well.

14:46.380 --> 14:48.700
And then the sites are always up when you expect them.

14:48.700 --> 14:51.140
And B, I wanted something that's going to be reasonably priced.

14:51.140 --> 14:55.140
And C, I wanted something that I felt like was a company I

14:55.140 --> 14:56.660
could trust long term.

14:56.660 --> 14:58.540
Everybody makes their own judgment call on this.

14:58.540 --> 15:02.500
But I have worked with companies that are VC backed.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.420
And I have worked with companies that are independently funded.

15:05.420 --> 15:07.220
And I don't think it's a surprise to any of you

15:07.220 --> 15:08.740
guys to know that I'm always going

15:08.740 --> 15:11.800
to go with the independently owned, independently funded.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.900
And for me personally, and for my business,

15:14.900 --> 15:18.860
I'm not ever going to host with any company that's VC funded.

15:18.860 --> 15:20.820
And that's just my personal choice.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.500
Everybody has to decide those things.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.860
But after having close exposure to the VC world

15:25.860 --> 15:28.880
and understanding how that goes and how it works,

15:28.880 --> 15:29.860
I made my decision.

15:29.860 --> 15:33.820
And Linode beyond just that has fantastic performance.

15:33.820 --> 15:35.540
So not only are they independently owned,

15:35.540 --> 15:37.660
but they have been since 2003.

15:37.660 --> 15:39.740
They've got 11 data centers around the world.

15:39.740 --> 15:42.980
They became their own ISP years ago.

15:42.980 --> 15:44.780
That's the level we're talking about here.

15:44.780 --> 15:46.420
They became their own ISP.

15:46.420 --> 15:49.380
They have great fast links to all their data centers.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.380
And their pricing is 30% to 50% cheaper

15:51.380 --> 15:53.020
than the major cloud providers.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.060
Something else to consider, too, is

15:55.060 --> 15:56.940
if you're all in on one cloud provider,

15:56.940 --> 15:59.420
you might want to look at Linode as a multi cloud

15:59.420 --> 16:00.420
part of your strategy.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.660
I think that's pretty important to look at over the next couple

16:02.660 --> 16:03.540
of years.

16:03.540 --> 16:05.380
And Linode could work out great there, too.

16:05.380 --> 16:08.540
So get started by going to linode.com slash unplugged.

16:08.540 --> 16:10.420
They have great customer service, the best

16:10.420 --> 16:11.260
in the business.

16:11.260 --> 16:12.580
And you're going to be really impressed

16:12.580 --> 16:14.940
with how fast things are, how clean the dashboard is.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.180
I think you're going to like it.

16:16.180 --> 16:17.500
It's just going to take a guess.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.260
So head over to linode.com slash unplugged.

16:19.260 --> 16:21.860
Get $100 for your new account and try this stuff out.

16:21.860 --> 16:22.980
Go build something.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.220
Go learn something.

16:24.220 --> 16:25.220
Go experience something.

16:25.220 --> 16:27.540
There's a lot of places out there to host stuff.

16:27.540 --> 16:28.700
There's a reason.

16:28.700 --> 16:30.980
There's several of them why we choose Linode.

16:30.980 --> 16:33.660
That's linode.com slash unplugged.

16:33.660 --> 16:38.660
It's the last time we got to clean up on the road.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.380
Oh, man.

16:40.380 --> 16:41.460
It's been a mess.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.820
I am really looking forward to being back in the studio.

16:43.820 --> 16:46.740
Nothing like a 40-day road trip that

16:46.740 --> 16:49.460
makes you super appreciate having a studio.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.220
Really looking forward to that.

16:51.220 --> 16:53.780
I want to also mention our friends over at the Ubuntu

16:53.780 --> 16:55.900
podcast are wrapping up the show.

16:55.900 --> 16:59.660
The final episode will be season 14, episode 30.

16:59.660 --> 17:03.260
And it will be released on Thursday, September 30, 2021.

17:03.260 --> 17:05.340
And they're going to have an online after party

17:05.340 --> 17:07.260
with listeners on Friday, October 1,

17:07.260 --> 17:08.780
with more details to come on that.

17:08.780 --> 17:11.140
We'll try to pass that along as we can.

17:11.140 --> 17:13.180
But I just wanted to say congratulations

17:13.180 --> 17:16.140
to them for 14 years of making a great show.

17:16.140 --> 17:17.740
No kidding.

17:17.740 --> 17:18.740
What an accomplishment.

17:18.740 --> 17:22.500
I mean, that kind of regularity, the quality of content

17:22.500 --> 17:25.380
they've churned out continuously throughout the years,

17:25.380 --> 17:27.940
just sticking to it, it's something else.

17:27.940 --> 17:30.100
And it really is the end of an era.

17:30.100 --> 17:30.940
It is.

17:30.940 --> 17:34.780
And you look back, 14 years is a long time.

17:34.780 --> 17:40.140
There is so much in that back catalog of things that happened.

17:40.140 --> 17:43.180
I may do a little back catalog spelunking to celebrate.

17:43.180 --> 17:46.540
So be sure to tune in for episode 30 from season 14,

17:46.540 --> 17:49.140
which will be released on Thursday, September 30.

17:49.140 --> 17:52.380
And we will try to get our friends Wimpy and Poppy on

17:52.380 --> 17:54.080
when their schedule allows, so that way you

17:54.080 --> 17:56.860
can still hear from them and get their opinion on Linux stuff.

17:56.860 --> 17:58.980
They can join us in the virtual lug, of course.

17:58.980 --> 18:00.900
And speaking of the virtual lug, the LUP lug

18:00.900 --> 18:03.580
happens every Sunday, every Sunday, this Sunday,

18:03.580 --> 18:07.940
and every Sunday at noon Pacific in our Mumble Room.

18:07.940 --> 18:10.100
You can get the details at linuxunplug.com

18:10.100 --> 18:13.540
slash mumble to set up your Mumble client, I guess.

18:13.540 --> 18:15.420
And you can get the time converted

18:15.420 --> 18:18.180
at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.940
And that's all happening every Sunday.

18:19.940 --> 18:23.300
And I, you know what, I'm going to recommend it.

18:23.300 --> 18:28.100
I know, shocker, but I'm going to recommend it.

18:28.100 --> 18:31.120
What doth make a Linux user?

18:31.120 --> 18:33.540
What means you are a Linux user?

18:33.540 --> 18:34.300
What makes you that?

18:34.300 --> 18:37.420
Is it that you have a device in your home

18:37.420 --> 18:41.520
that runs Linux, like a router or an Android device?

18:41.520 --> 18:44.020
This is a conversation that came up recently on Coder Radio.

18:44.020 --> 18:47.100
And my co-host, Mike, defines a Linux user

18:47.100 --> 18:49.700
as anyone who uses Linux in some capacity,

18:49.700 --> 18:53.560
either through voluntary methods or involuntary methods.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.380
And I think I draw the line at anyone

18:56.380 --> 18:58.500
who chooses to use Linux.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.580
So you choose to get a Raspberry Pi,

19:00.580 --> 19:01.980
even though you might have Mac and Windows

19:01.980 --> 19:04.480
or whatever on your desktop, you choose to get a Raspberry Pi.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.300
Or perhaps you buy a Chromebook because it

19:07.300 --> 19:08.540
runs Linux.

19:08.540 --> 19:11.380
Any time you make an active choice to use Linux,

19:11.380 --> 19:13.640
I consider you a Linux user.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.460
And we've been kicking this around.

19:15.460 --> 19:20.860
And how does that influence how we create content in the show

19:20.860 --> 19:24.100
and how we view our potential audience?

19:24.100 --> 19:27.420
And the question has come up with,

19:27.420 --> 19:30.700
where do we draw the line as far as the desktop?

19:30.700 --> 19:33.800
And this is the conversation I'd like to have with you guys.

19:33.800 --> 19:37.580
Is that a requirement to be considered a Linux user?

19:37.580 --> 19:40.820
We got a tweet from Listener Poke who said, Chris Lass,

19:40.820 --> 19:43.980
I admire your quest to get Linux running on your ThinkPad

19:43.980 --> 19:47.020
with the same battery life and performance you got on Windows.

19:47.020 --> 19:50.980
Side note, I tried out Windows 11 on my ThinkPad X1

19:50.980 --> 19:53.900
ages ago when Windows 11 first came out,

19:53.900 --> 19:55.500
the ISO that you could get.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.260
And it ran great.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.060
The battery life was better, the performance better

19:58.060 --> 19:59.260
than I ever saw with Linux.

19:59.260 --> 20:01.340
This first time I ever had Windows on this laptop,

20:01.340 --> 20:04.780
I was shocked that it was that much better of an experience.

20:04.780 --> 20:07.380
I hadn't seen that kind of differential in a long time.

20:07.380 --> 20:10.100
Well, Poke goes on to say, I've got to admit, I've given up

20:10.100 --> 20:12.420
and I just run Windows on mine.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.140
And the ugly truth is, Windows 11, for my needs,

20:15.140 --> 20:16.460
is really nice.

20:16.460 --> 20:18.340
I know it's super unpopular, but I

20:18.340 --> 20:19.980
think the Linux community would really

20:19.980 --> 20:23.820
benefit from being accepting of the idea

20:23.820 --> 20:27.780
that you can be an inherent Linux fan

20:27.780 --> 20:30.740
and still choose to run Windows on the desktop.

20:30.740 --> 20:33.100
Sometimes that's just what makes sense.

20:33.100 --> 20:36.420
If someone opts to run Windows on the desktop and all

20:36.420 --> 20:39.380
of their desktop devices, laptops, desktops, everywhere,

20:39.380 --> 20:41.620
but they still have a server they SSH into

20:41.620 --> 20:44.780
or they still have a Raspberry Pi in the corner that runs Linux,

20:44.780 --> 20:47.260
do we consider them Linux users?

20:47.260 --> 20:48.540
We got an email into the show.

20:48.540 --> 20:51.660
Somebody says, look, I had to switch to Windows for work,

20:51.660 --> 20:56.380
but I found out that WSL has worked amazing for me.

20:56.380 --> 20:59.140
And I can get access to the Linux file system now.

20:59.140 --> 21:01.540
I can use VS Code and IntelliJ in Windows

21:01.540 --> 21:03.100
to program for Linux.

21:03.100 --> 21:05.800
It's like a near native experience,

21:05.800 --> 21:08.660
as if I am on Linux, but yet I have the Windows desktop

21:08.660 --> 21:12.300
and I'm compliant with all of my work's policies.

21:12.300 --> 21:15.300
And he says, does this make me no longer a Linux user?

21:15.300 --> 21:17.860
And I think he is still a Linux user.

21:17.860 --> 21:20.540
I think if we're real with ourselves,

21:20.540 --> 21:25.380
we have to acknowledge that the Linux desktop market is tiny,

21:25.380 --> 21:27.820
compared to the Linux server market and the Linux embedded

21:27.820 --> 21:30.260
market, which is ginormous.

21:30.260 --> 21:33.860
And if you look at what makes money on Linux,

21:33.860 --> 21:36.340
it's the server market and the embedded market.

21:36.340 --> 21:38.860
And the desktop market's making money for some folks,

21:38.860 --> 21:41.380
but the server market makes real money, right?

21:41.380 --> 21:43.060
We're talking enterprise money.

21:43.060 --> 21:48.620
And that is such a larger use case that, in comparison,

21:48.620 --> 21:51.900
you could remove every desktop Linux user

21:51.900 --> 21:56.220
and it would not impact anybody's bottom line that

21:56.220 --> 21:57.420
is in that market.

21:57.420 --> 21:59.980
Companies like Dell and Canonical and System76

21:59.980 --> 22:01.140
obviously would be impacted.

22:01.140 --> 22:03.620
But when I'm talking about enterprise companies,

22:03.620 --> 22:06.060
the desktop market could literally not exist.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.820
And at least immediately, it would not

22:07.820 --> 22:11.860
impact them until development fell off a cliff.

22:11.860 --> 22:15.340
So I think we have to acknowledge that reality.

22:15.340 --> 22:18.700
And we have to acknowledge that even with desktop Linux

22:18.700 --> 22:21.060
at 1% of the market or something,

22:21.060 --> 22:22.900
we are still a tiny minority compared

22:22.900 --> 22:26.020
to the server market, which is just unfathomably huge.

22:26.020 --> 22:27.860
I mean, you look at one company like Facebook,

22:27.860 --> 22:30.780
and you've got like 20,000, 30,000 servers all running

22:30.780 --> 22:31.500
Linux, right?

22:31.500 --> 22:32.660
One company.

22:32.660 --> 22:34.500
So you times that across the industry,

22:34.500 --> 22:37.980
and it's just incomparable in the scale of the server market

22:37.980 --> 22:39.820
compared to the desktop market.

22:39.820 --> 22:43.700
And so I think we are kind of kidding ourselves if we say,

22:43.700 --> 22:45.940
well, if you're not running Linux on the desktop,

22:45.940 --> 22:48.780
then you're not really a Linux user.

22:48.780 --> 22:50.980
We're going to put you in this bucket over here.

22:50.980 --> 22:53.740
I think our community, and this is something

22:53.740 --> 22:55.420
I really want to position the JB shows

22:55.420 --> 22:57.940
and make the JB community about, I think our community,

22:57.940 --> 23:00.340
as Linux as a whole, but JB specifically,

23:00.340 --> 23:03.060
has to really be open to the idea

23:03.060 --> 23:06.940
that a Linux user is anyone who actively chooses to use it.

23:06.940 --> 23:09.380
And it might mean they're using WSL,

23:09.380 --> 23:11.660
and they're not using a full desktop distro.

23:11.660 --> 23:15.660
Or it might mean that they've got an M1, an Apple M1

23:15.660 --> 23:17.300
Mac or something, but they've got.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.340
Say it ain't so.

23:18.340 --> 23:18.820
I know.

23:18.820 --> 23:19.340
It happens.

23:19.340 --> 23:20.740
And they've got a virtual machine.

23:20.740 --> 23:24.180
Or they're SSHing into a dozen Linux servers.

23:24.180 --> 23:25.660
That's the real world.

23:25.660 --> 23:27.860
And while I love it on the desktop,

23:27.860 --> 23:30.220
and I think Plasma makes the best desktop environment now,

23:30.220 --> 23:33.380
I think KD Plasma's tops, I got to acknowledge,

23:33.380 --> 23:34.580
I'm in the minority there.

23:34.580 --> 23:38.100
And so I think it is our job to be welcoming

23:38.100 --> 23:40.460
to all types of Linux users.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.060
What's curious to me, Chris, is that you've

23:42.060 --> 23:45.220
been talking about people who actively choose to use Linux.

23:45.220 --> 23:47.780
But I bet you there's a whole other subset of people

23:47.780 --> 23:51.500
who actively have to use Linux and aren't necessarily

23:51.500 --> 23:54.740
as passionate as all of us here on the show are.

23:54.740 --> 23:57.780
Those of us who are using the desktop Linux,

23:57.780 --> 23:59.320
there's an inherent passion.

23:59.320 --> 24:02.260
And that's likely the reason we came to in the first place.

24:02.260 --> 24:05.420
But I bet you there's a bunch of Mac users and Windows users

24:05.420 --> 24:08.100
out there who just need to use Linux to get their job done.

24:08.100 --> 24:10.780
And they don't necessarily have the same passion as we do.

24:10.780 --> 24:12.940
And they're still Linux users, aren't they?

24:12.940 --> 24:15.020
I would probably argue that a lot of Linux users

24:15.020 --> 24:19.740
are considering themselves more technical users or developers.

24:19.740 --> 24:23.340
But you know, we may, maybe, might, maybe

24:23.340 --> 24:26.700
be about to see a shift in the public perception of privacy

24:26.700 --> 24:28.500
and spying and snooping.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.820
I think every time you see a story like Apple's CSAM

24:30.820 --> 24:34.460
scanning or a story about Google locking out somebody's Google

24:34.460 --> 24:37.780
account, I think you get a few more people interested

24:37.780 --> 24:38.500
in alternatives.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.300
And yesterday, and I feel like an idiot

24:40.300 --> 24:42.380
for not remembering the person's name,

24:42.380 --> 24:45.540
but yesterday I came across a pastor who

24:45.540 --> 24:48.960
has set up an online telegram group for everyone now.

24:48.960 --> 24:52.860
And they are really pushing and recommending

24:52.860 --> 24:55.180
Linux and free software.

24:55.180 --> 24:56.820
I don't think because they, I don't even

24:56.820 --> 24:58.060
know if they know about the GPL.

24:58.060 --> 25:01.060
I couldn't tell you because I just kind of skimmed through it.

25:01.060 --> 25:04.820
But it seemed like the entire thrust of the pitch

25:04.820 --> 25:06.980
to tell people to switch to Linux

25:06.980 --> 25:09.380
was because it was the operating system that

25:09.380 --> 25:13.300
freed you from tracking and censorship and spying.

25:13.300 --> 25:15.220
And if you're worried about your privacy

25:15.220 --> 25:17.540
or you're worried about people monitoring what you're doing,

25:17.540 --> 25:20.100
even if these things weren't even 100% concerns that they

25:20.100 --> 25:22.980
really should be worried about, like Linux was the answer.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.820
And there wasn't really a conversation

25:24.820 --> 25:27.860
about its technical merits or its licensing.

25:27.860 --> 25:31.780
It was more about, well, it's open source, which is OK.

25:31.780 --> 25:35.020
All right, they almost got there.

25:35.020 --> 25:36.380
It's not being tracked by Microsoft,

25:36.380 --> 25:37.520
and it's not being tracked by Google,

25:37.520 --> 25:39.100
and it's not being tracked by Apple.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.600
In the code, they're not watching you

25:40.600 --> 25:42.540
and all that kind of really aggressive kind

25:42.540 --> 25:46.080
of worrying about the most egregious kind of spying,

25:46.080 --> 25:48.140
it solves all those problems.

25:48.140 --> 25:51.020
And what struck me about it, besides the fact

25:51.020 --> 25:52.980
that they were getting some of the details wrong,

25:52.980 --> 25:57.460
is I think there was like 20,000 people in that Telegram group

25:57.460 --> 25:59.740
who were clearly not technical but were

25:59.740 --> 26:04.420
interested in solutions to combat, quote unquote,

26:04.420 --> 26:05.680
big tech.

26:05.680 --> 26:09.340
And I mean, I saw that 1,000 times in that Telegram group

26:09.340 --> 26:11.940
for the few hours I hung out in there.

26:11.940 --> 26:14.980
And it was people that had searched up and tried

26:14.980 --> 26:16.300
to find a solution to this problem

26:16.300 --> 26:19.240
and came across this pastor and came across this Telegram

26:19.240 --> 26:19.820
channel.

26:19.820 --> 26:22.660
And we're in there asking questions on what Linux is

26:22.660 --> 26:25.340
and what is LibreOffice and what is Fire.

26:25.340 --> 26:27.380
They were getting themselves educated

26:27.380 --> 26:28.760
because of privacy concerns.

26:28.760 --> 26:31.740
And I'm sure they're not a huge group of the market,

26:31.740 --> 26:34.180
but that could be a whole area that we

26:34.180 --> 26:35.620
begin appealing to and expanding to when

26:35.620 --> 26:37.060
it comes to free software.

26:37.060 --> 26:38.780
And in the meantime, I look at it

26:38.780 --> 26:41.600
as we just have to be as comfortable with them

26:41.600 --> 26:44.740
using as little free software as they choose.

26:44.740 --> 26:47.940
If they just get in and get on board with using free software,

26:47.940 --> 26:49.100
that's a win.

26:49.100 --> 26:51.620
If it's something like Linux or if it's LibreOffice

26:51.620 --> 26:54.860
or if it's even just Firefox, that's a good win.

26:54.860 --> 26:58.740
And if we kind of are shitheads about the fact

26:58.740 --> 27:00.620
that they don't run it on Linux on the desktop,

27:00.620 --> 27:03.980
it kind of acts as this kind of bouncing screen

27:03.980 --> 27:04.780
that rejects people.

27:04.780 --> 27:06.060
I get these emails into the show,

27:06.060 --> 27:08.140
and that's what brings this topic up is people

27:08.140 --> 27:09.500
have written in and they've said,

27:09.500 --> 27:12.900
I feel like because I don't run it on the desktop anymore,

27:12.900 --> 27:15.460
I can't really hang out in the Telegram group

27:15.460 --> 27:16.260
or in the IRC room.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.220
And that's just totally not true.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.140
But I think there's that perception out there.

27:20.140 --> 27:21.480
Yeah, it does feel like that way.

27:21.480 --> 27:24.140
And I know, I mean, I'm excited about Linux on the desktop.

27:24.140 --> 27:27.460
I don't really enjoy any other desktop operating systems.

27:27.460 --> 27:30.420
But when we ask what, we've said Linux a lot here,

27:30.420 --> 27:32.940
but I think it applies to the broader free and open source

27:32.940 --> 27:36.140
ecosystem is every improvement that you get,

27:36.140 --> 27:38.020
every step along that way is good.

27:38.020 --> 27:41.140
So even if WSL makes us uncomfortable, which I mean,

27:41.140 --> 27:42.700
I'll admit it does to me too.

27:42.700 --> 27:45.420
But that is introducing these concepts to folks.

27:45.420 --> 27:47.820
And we all have different practical realities

27:47.820 --> 27:48.860
at the end of the day.

27:48.860 --> 27:50.320
And so if we can help bridge that,

27:50.320 --> 27:52.960
if we can get people to understand that these are tools

27:52.960 --> 27:55.540
that are available for you for free, they are your tools,

27:55.540 --> 27:58.020
change them, embrace them if you want,

27:58.020 --> 28:00.220
and that they can help you regain some of the control

28:00.220 --> 28:03.300
you might not feel you have anymore in whatever domains

28:03.300 --> 28:05.940
matter the most to you, let's do that.

28:05.940 --> 28:08.580
Because the great thing about free and open source software

28:08.580 --> 28:11.060
as well is it's not going anywhere.

28:11.060 --> 28:12.820
It can't be taken away from us.

28:12.820 --> 28:14.860
And so if it takes us another 15 years to the point

28:14.860 --> 28:17.140
where the desktop is totally irrelevant,

28:17.140 --> 28:20.300
all the big companies are now focusing on mobile exclusively

28:20.300 --> 28:22.880
and Linux desktops become the best again, well, great.

28:22.880 --> 28:25.180
I'll celebrate that, and I'll keep using it

28:25.180 --> 28:26.700
until that point regardless.

28:26.700 --> 28:28.040
Yeah, boy, well put.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.700
It's like they're not going to take it from you if it's.

28:30.700 --> 28:32.260
And I think this is a big part of it

28:32.260 --> 28:36.100
is as we get further and further down the road with technology

28:36.100 --> 28:38.420
just being normalized in our daily lives,

28:38.420 --> 28:42.200
we have transitioned from oh, isn't this a quaint toy

28:42.200 --> 28:46.420
to I need this to do my job, or I need this to feed my family,

28:46.420 --> 28:48.820
or I need x, y, z for this to happen.

28:48.820 --> 28:51.860
And it's become much more critical.

28:51.860 --> 28:54.440
Technology is unavoidable if you want to participate

28:54.440 --> 28:57.180
in modern life at all.

28:57.180 --> 29:00.380
20 years ago, I could have family members around me

29:00.380 --> 29:02.500
who'd never used a computer.

29:02.500 --> 29:03.740
They'd never owned a computer.

29:03.740 --> 29:04.580
They never used one.

29:04.580 --> 29:07.120
They were in construction work or something like in that line,

29:07.120 --> 29:09.180
and they just never came up.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.320
And all of them now own computers.

29:11.320 --> 29:13.020
All of them know how to use a web browser.

29:13.020 --> 29:15.060
They have to fill out stuff online for work.

29:15.060 --> 29:16.180
It's changed.

29:16.180 --> 29:18.660
It's touched every profession.

29:18.660 --> 29:22.380
And I think we start rethinking about, well, this matters.

29:22.380 --> 29:23.340
I need to own this.

29:23.340 --> 29:25.140
I need to make sure it's not going away.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.660
I'd like to customize this.

29:26.660 --> 29:28.200
I think there's always been some of us

29:28.200 --> 29:31.060
out there who have felt that way about our tools.

29:31.060 --> 29:34.460
And Jonathan wrote into the show, and he said something.

29:34.460 --> 29:35.120
He had an email.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.880
He touched on a couple of good things.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.820
But he said something that I think

29:38.820 --> 29:41.060
Brent and Wes, you both are going to agree with a lot.

29:41.060 --> 29:43.900
He said, the thing about desktop Linux

29:43.900 --> 29:48.260
is it has a major feature that the other desktops don't have,

29:48.260 --> 29:51.700
and that is I don't need to manage and run Windows.

29:51.700 --> 29:54.760
I don't need to bother with Windows as an OS,

29:54.760 --> 29:56.900
and I can just use the Linux desktop,

29:56.900 --> 29:57.900
and it does what I want.

29:57.900 --> 30:01.340
And I completely felt that on this road trip,

30:01.340 --> 30:05.620
because when I brought a Mac, I have a Mac,

30:05.620 --> 30:06.780
and I have my ThinkPad here.

30:06.780 --> 30:09.900
And the ThinkPad, every time I have turned it on,

30:09.900 --> 30:12.060
it has just gotten to work, and I've gotten online.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.260
I've gotten what I needed.

30:13.260 --> 30:18.020
And the Mac, it has to connect all these cloud services,

30:18.020 --> 30:21.680
and it sits there, and it pulls down data for 10, 15 minutes

30:21.680 --> 30:24.100
as it syncs a bunch of stuff with the NSURL session

30:24.100 --> 30:25.340
de-process.

30:25.340 --> 30:28.940
And I feel like I don't own or control this machine.

30:28.940 --> 30:32.900
I am just using Apple's box, where my ThinkPad,

30:32.900 --> 30:35.380
if I don't tell it to do something, it's not doing it.

30:35.380 --> 30:38.180
It feels to me like that sense of control alone

30:38.180 --> 30:40.900
is worth so much when, in our world,

30:40.900 --> 30:44.300
it feels like we don't really have control over that much.

30:44.300 --> 30:46.420
I remember seeing you, Chris, pulling your hair out

30:46.420 --> 30:48.040
for those 10, 15 minutes as you're just

30:48.040 --> 30:49.100
trying to get work done.

30:49.100 --> 30:51.660
And on that limited cell signal that we

30:51.660 --> 30:55.140
had for most of the trip, that was really challenging for us.

30:55.140 --> 30:57.780
Yeah, it was my precious, precious bandwidths,

30:57.780 --> 30:59.700
my precious bandwidths.

30:59.700 --> 31:01.500
And it's just never an issue on the Linux box.

31:01.500 --> 31:02.940
I could make it take a bunch of bandwidth

31:02.940 --> 31:04.660
if I wanted to run updates and install them right now,

31:04.660 --> 31:08.100
but it's also, for better or for worse,

31:08.100 --> 31:11.020
it's not trying to coalesce a bunch of different processes

31:11.020 --> 31:13.060
in the background and use one single process

31:13.060 --> 31:14.660
to download everything.

31:14.660 --> 31:16.840
But it gave me a real sense of, one,

31:16.840 --> 31:20.500
is a real work tool for me, and the other, well,

31:20.500 --> 31:21.540
it's a tool for sure.

31:21.540 --> 31:23.380
It runs certain applications I needed, but.

31:23.380 --> 31:24.840
I think we also have to understand

31:24.840 --> 31:27.580
that those barriers and preferences will be different.

31:27.580 --> 31:29.660
A lot of the feedback we're addressing says,

31:29.660 --> 31:31.220
oh, WSL works great for me.

31:31.220 --> 31:33.060
Or I can use Windows and also get

31:33.060 --> 31:34.940
a lot of the huge benefits from some of the free

31:34.940 --> 31:35.940
and open source software.

31:35.940 --> 31:38.780
And to me, I get aggravated pretty quick

31:38.780 --> 31:39.740
on a Windows desktop.

31:39.740 --> 31:42.140
I mean, I used to admin it years ago.

31:42.140 --> 31:43.620
It rubs me the wrong way.

31:43.620 --> 31:45.500
But that's a personal feeling for me,

31:45.500 --> 31:47.620
and I don't think I have no place comment.

31:47.620 --> 31:49.380
If other people aren't bothered by that

31:49.380 --> 31:52.260
and they like to combine systems, no problem.

31:52.260 --> 31:52.940
Yeah.

31:52.940 --> 31:56.660
On that question, what defines a Linux user, is it even Linux?

31:56.660 --> 31:58.260
I mean, I think there's a question about if it's

31:58.260 --> 31:59.500
free and open source software.

31:59.500 --> 32:02.620
But I also wonder, is it also just the philosophy?

32:02.620 --> 32:05.660
Maybe all the tools you use, you're into the Adobe suite

32:05.660 --> 32:08.380
because you do a lot of video or photo editing work.

32:08.380 --> 32:10.580
And you've already got Office paid for at work,

32:10.580 --> 32:12.140
so you don't really need LibreOffice.

32:12.140 --> 32:13.840
And you don't have any servers you admin,

32:13.840 --> 32:15.540
but you still appreciate the philosophy

32:15.540 --> 32:18.220
and advocate for open source and privacy.

32:18.220 --> 32:19.420
Does that count too?

32:19.420 --> 32:20.380
I think it does.

32:20.380 --> 32:22.780
I think it's really, in so many ways,

32:22.780 --> 32:26.340
it's about certain ideas that we jive on,

32:26.340 --> 32:29.540
certain approaches to solving problems we jive on.

32:29.540 --> 32:32.340
And I think that really is the commonality.

32:32.340 --> 32:32.820
All right.

32:32.820 --> 32:34.920
Well, I'd love to hear the audience's thoughts on this.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.420
Also check some of the conversation

32:36.420 --> 32:38.180
on the Coder Radio Show at coder.show.

32:38.180 --> 32:40.540
But send us your thoughts, your emails, your feedbacks

32:40.540 --> 32:42.240
at linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.660
We've got a form there.

32:43.660 --> 32:46.580
But let's move on.

32:46.580 --> 32:49.220
One of the things we loved about elementary OS 6

32:49.220 --> 32:51.860
is, as they always do, they really

32:51.860 --> 32:54.540
kind of went the extra 10%.

32:54.540 --> 32:57.020
And they made this great centralized spot

32:57.020 --> 32:59.260
where you could visualize all of the stuff

32:59.260 --> 33:02.500
different Flatpak applications can do on your machine

33:02.500 --> 33:03.620
or on your network.

33:03.620 --> 33:05.740
And there's various tools out there

33:05.740 --> 33:08.300
that will do this and other ways to solve that problem.

33:08.300 --> 33:12.220
But we really liked the way elementary OS did it.

33:12.220 --> 33:16.820
And now there's an app that will let all of us have that fun.

33:16.820 --> 33:20.020
It's on Flat Hub, and it's called Flat Seal.

33:20.020 --> 33:22.220
And it lets you manage your Flatpak permissions.

33:22.220 --> 33:24.180
I mean, how this works, it is Flatpak itself,

33:24.180 --> 33:25.740
but it manages Flatpak.

33:25.740 --> 33:27.420
My head is exploding.

33:27.420 --> 33:29.740
But honestly, this is almost, I think,

33:29.740 --> 33:31.580
something that should be required.

33:31.580 --> 33:32.500
I love Flatpak.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.220
I love that we're now getting more and more integrations

33:35.220 --> 33:36.420
into the GUI tools.

33:36.420 --> 33:39.060
But even as someone who uses most of his proprietary apps

33:39.060 --> 33:42.340
in Flatpak, the command line syntax isn't super friendly.

33:42.340 --> 33:44.180
There's a lot of concepts going on.

33:44.180 --> 33:46.020
And having to adjust some of those permissions

33:46.020 --> 33:48.220
or get stuff to work right when you're like, well,

33:48.220 --> 33:49.900
in general, I want sandboxing.

33:49.900 --> 33:51.260
But for this app, I really don't.

33:51.260 --> 33:54.980
I want this to feel more like part of my desktop.

33:54.980 --> 33:57.780
And that's where Flat Seal can help you understand it

33:57.780 --> 34:00.460
without having to go read the Flatpak code base.

34:00.460 --> 34:03.100
Yeah, and it gives you a great visual conception

34:03.100 --> 34:06.340
of what the different security portals do for Flatpak

34:06.340 --> 34:08.300
and how you can turn those on and off.

34:08.300 --> 34:09.140
It's great.

34:09.140 --> 34:10.660
When you've got sandbox apps, why not

34:10.660 --> 34:12.740
have that kind of control and make it easy?

34:12.740 --> 34:14.620
Because I agree with you, Wes.

34:14.620 --> 34:17.480
The Flatpak command line syntax has never

34:17.480 --> 34:18.900
been that great, in my opinion.

34:18.900 --> 34:21.540
Snap was way better out of the gate with the command line

34:21.540 --> 34:22.140
syntax.

34:22.140 --> 34:23.100
Definitely.

34:23.100 --> 34:25.580
So again, it's called Flat Seal, all one word.

34:25.580 --> 34:27.380
And we'll have a link in the show notes

34:27.380 --> 34:31.060
at linuxunplugged.com slash, what is this, 423?

34:31.060 --> 34:34.660
Yes, 423, linuxunplugged.com slash 423.

34:34.660 --> 34:37.340
I'd love your app pick submissions as well,

34:37.340 --> 34:39.080
linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.660
If there is a great app out there

34:40.660 --> 34:41.740
that you think we should know about,

34:41.740 --> 34:43.500
that's a great way to get in front of us.

34:43.500 --> 34:46.120
You could send it other means, too, like Twitter's fine.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.660
And Telegram would probably work, too.

34:47.660 --> 34:49.580
But the nice thing about the contact page

34:49.580 --> 34:52.540
and why we always are pushing it here on the show

34:52.540 --> 34:55.460
is because, depending on what's going on, both Wes and I

34:55.460 --> 34:58.380
can put eyes on that, where if you send it to one of us

34:58.380 --> 35:00.540
directly, we might forget about it or something.

35:00.540 --> 35:02.900
But if you put it on the contact form,

35:02.900 --> 35:04.940
we're both checking that all the time.

35:04.940 --> 35:05.860
Well, you know what?

35:05.860 --> 35:07.020
We do the Twitter thing.

35:07.020 --> 35:08.140
Bren, are you on the Twitter?

35:08.140 --> 35:08.980
You know I am.

35:08.980 --> 35:11.340
But you don't get to know what it is because no one

35:11.340 --> 35:14.300
knows how to spell it.

35:14.300 --> 35:16.220
I've been thinking about getting rid of my Twitter.

35:16.220 --> 35:19.060
I've been thinking about actually just no social media

35:19.060 --> 35:21.740
except for then there's the show stuff and the announcements.

35:21.740 --> 35:24.060
And it's useful when you're live and that kind of thing.

35:24.060 --> 35:26.100
Well, you can keep the network account, I guess.

35:26.100 --> 35:28.300
Yeah, and the show accounts, maybe.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.820
But I think such a small percentage of our audience

35:30.820 --> 35:32.900
is on social media, too.

35:32.900 --> 35:34.460
That's the thing.

35:34.460 --> 35:36.840
A very, very small percentage of people are actually on there.

35:36.840 --> 35:37.340
I don't know.

35:37.340 --> 35:38.960
Well, it's a big difference, too.

35:38.960 --> 35:42.340
It can be useful to see trends, to see what prominent folks

35:42.340 --> 35:43.380
might be talking about.

35:43.380 --> 35:44.800
But if it's not a platform that you

35:44.800 --> 35:47.220
feel like you're engaging with to have productive discussions.

35:47.220 --> 35:49.340
And honestly, we already have places like The Matrix

35:49.340 --> 35:51.820
and self-hosted Discord and the Telegram channel

35:51.820 --> 35:54.340
where I feel like we have a much better curated set of folks

35:54.340 --> 35:56.620
who have self-selected in there to have

35:56.620 --> 35:59.020
good and respectful discussions.

35:59.020 --> 36:00.660
Then yeah, it kind of makes me question,

36:00.660 --> 36:01.900
what value are you getting?

36:01.900 --> 36:03.400
Well, I think the biggest value would

36:03.400 --> 36:06.260
be that when the audience does tweet at me, I can reply.

36:06.260 --> 36:07.720
And it's nice, short, and concise,

36:07.720 --> 36:09.700
where an email can sometimes turn into a book.

36:09.700 --> 36:12.380
And it's harder to respond to a book.

36:12.380 --> 36:13.940
But tweet is limited.

36:13.940 --> 36:14.460
I don't know.

36:14.460 --> 36:15.540
I'm just on the fence.

36:15.540 --> 36:18.820
And I wonder, is there a moral reason

36:18.820 --> 36:20.620
I should not be on social media, too?

36:20.620 --> 36:22.180
The whole thing's really a first world problem, though.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.020
So I don't really worry too much about it.

36:24.020 --> 36:25.420
But it has been on my mind recently.

36:25.420 --> 36:26.380
But we will be there.

36:26.380 --> 36:28.860
In the meantime, Brent's on social media.

36:28.860 --> 36:30.460
But he won't tell you what it is.

36:30.460 --> 36:32.500
But we may have it linked in the show notes.

36:32.500 --> 36:33.620
Wes is on there.

36:33.620 --> 36:34.740
He may tell you what it is.

36:34.740 --> 36:36.700
It's just at Wes Payne.

36:36.700 --> 36:38.740
Yeah, when you've got the last name of Payne,

36:38.740 --> 36:40.460
you don't really need a fancy Twitter handle.

36:40.460 --> 36:42.180
You know, you just go with that.

36:42.180 --> 36:43.460
I'm at Chris LAS.

36:43.460 --> 36:46.900
And the LAS does not stand for an airport.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.180
It is Linux Action Show.

36:48.180 --> 36:51.060
And the entire network is at Jupiter Signal.

36:51.060 --> 36:52.340
See you next week.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.900
Same bat time, same bat station.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.780
We'd love to have you join us live on a Tuesday.

36:56.780 --> 36:58.300
Should be back in the studio.

36:58.300 --> 37:03.620
Oh, mm, oh, that's going to be great.

37:03.620 --> 37:05.300
And you know what, we got the see you next Tuesday

37:05.300 --> 37:06.540
in the fridge still.

37:06.540 --> 37:08.300
Oh, that's going to be great.

37:08.300 --> 37:09.980
You've earned it, my friend.

37:09.980 --> 37:10.660
Thank you.

37:10.660 --> 37:12.540
In the meantime, you can always get the show

37:19.020 --> 37:20.900

37:20.900 --> 37:23.100

37:32.420 --> 37:33.380

37:33.380 --> 37:34.860
Thanks so much for joining us.

37:34.860 --> 37:36.100
We'll see you next Tuesday.

37:36.100 --> 37:58.500
And you can always get the show at linuxunplug.com.

37:58.500 --> 38:10.960
Let me tell you, we have been driving hard.

38:10.960 --> 38:16.160
I don't know if you've been watching the tracker at all, but we ended up spending a couple

38:16.160 --> 38:20.560
of more days in Tucson as we waited for the work to get done and then to leave.

38:20.560 --> 38:26.560
And so we cooked for a couple more days and then we hit the road like in a way we haven't

38:26.560 --> 38:31.100
done in a couple of years, 10, 13 hour drive days back to back.

38:31.100 --> 38:36.180
And one of our goals was to make it to the coast as fast as possible because that's where

38:36.180 --> 38:37.180
the temperature dropped.

38:37.180 --> 38:45.400
It goes from like 106 around noon to 65 Fahrenheit around noon at the coast.

38:45.400 --> 38:52.360
And so Hadia and I just drove like maniacs for a couple of days and belined it.

38:52.360 --> 38:57.440
The rig limped the entire way with a lean and half working suspension on one side, but

38:57.440 --> 39:01.460
it was working and just got all the way to the coast.

39:01.460 --> 39:05.320
And it was incredible to see the Pacific Ocean again.

39:05.320 --> 39:10.120
I had an emotional reaction when I came around the corner and I saw the Pacific Ocean.

39:10.120 --> 39:11.660
It was amazing.

39:11.660 --> 39:17.160
The breeze, the smell, just the cold ocean air.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.200
And the evergreen trees are so beautiful.

39:19.200 --> 39:20.480
It's so nice to be back up.

39:20.480 --> 39:21.480
You're home.

39:21.480 --> 39:22.980
And now I'm actually I'm in Southern Oregon.

39:22.980 --> 39:26.580
I was in Northern California and I'm in Southern Oregon and it's the Pacific Northwest.

39:26.580 --> 39:27.580
It's so gorgeous.

39:27.580 --> 39:28.600
It's so great.

39:28.600 --> 39:29.960
It feels so good.

39:29.960 --> 39:32.000
It's like 55 degrees at night now.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.940
It's so much more comfortable.

39:33.940 --> 39:37.360
And I am so, so proud of Joups.

39:37.360 --> 39:42.200
I mean, she, you know, she had some technical problems with the suspension, but we were

39:42.200 --> 39:47.160
cooking from day one when we left Seattle, there was a heat dome and it was hot everywhere

39:47.160 --> 39:49.080
we went, everywhere we went.

39:49.080 --> 39:53.480
It was low 90s to triple digits.

39:53.480 --> 39:58.640
And it didn't, it did not relent until we made it to the California coast and Joups

39:58.640 --> 39:59.640
held up.

39:59.640 --> 40:03.500
I mean, if this wasn't the ultimate stress test for Joups, I feel like now you're pretty

40:03.500 --> 40:06.400
prepared for whatever climate catastrophe is to come.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.400
Bring on the zombies.

40:07.400 --> 40:21.000
Yeah, dude, totally just need a push bar and I'm good to go.
