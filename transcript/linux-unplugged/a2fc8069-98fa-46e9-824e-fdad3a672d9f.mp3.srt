00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 36 for April 15th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,380
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's stuck between two studios.

3
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,380
My name is Chris.

4
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,380
My name is Matt.

5
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,380
Hey Matt.

6
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,360
So I'm, this week I'm recording Linux Unplugged somewhere I've never, ever recorded it before.

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,360
So it's a little weird.

8
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,080
So it's gonna, it's gonna, everything's gonna be a little different.

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,240
I'm actually in the regular studio that, hi, see I'm right here.

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,440
If you're watching the video version, I'm in the regular studio that we do the Linux

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
action show.

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm usually not in the studio, but we're this week, we're beginning the transition to our

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
new studio.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So please forgive, pardon the dust as the old saying goes, because Matt, this week I

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,340
still want to try to have a great conversation about something that's sort of been brewing

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,600
over the last few episodes.

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,320
Last week we had Chase on and he talked about what kind of has been his blockers to switching

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,320
to Linux.

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,760
And one of the things he talked about is way too much choice and how, how that was really

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,480
a big part of the problem.

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,920
And I want to sort of just float the idea, playing devil's advocate, if you will, that

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,040
maybe suggesting the underdog distro to folks is doing them a disservice and hurting Linux

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
adoption.

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
And I want to talk about that.

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,480
And then if we have some time after that, I want to discuss that here we are Tuesday

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,080
and it is still open source is getting a beating over this Heartbleed bug and everybody is

27
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:57,600
condemning open source, the model for open source software, your buddy, Paul Throt, took

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,040
the web and said that this proves that the all eyes are on the source code philosophy

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,960
is bogus and that open source security is not any better.

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,920
And it's just, you know, people are piling on.

31
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,120
So if we have time, yeah, I know I've been harping on this one, but I want to talk about

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
a little bit.

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,440
If we get through the underdog distro discussion, that's all first.

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,400
So it should be a pretty good show this week.

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,720
And you know, the other thing is, too, while we're talking about this underdog situation,

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,960
it's kind of in the shadow of Ubuntu 14.04's release, which comes out between now and Linux

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,880
action show on Sunday.

38
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,480
And the 14.04 is getting a lot of praise right now.

39
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,640
And it's the epitome of the big dog desktop distro when we talk about underdogs, like

40
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,120
Ubuntu is on the absolute opposite end of that spectrum.

41
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,440
And so this conversation is happening with all of this with their release on Sunday,

42
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,520
and then we're going to have that review.

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,200
It's just kind of a very interesting time, so I hope folks stick with us for that.

44
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,280
But I wanted to give a quick, like, you know, just update about GNOME 3.12.

45
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,880
GNOME 3.12 hit the Arch repo stable since Linux action show on Sunday.

46
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,800
And I've got my main machine upgraded to GNOME 3.12 now.

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,720
And I wanted to pass along a little helper I found.

48
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,680
If you're having troubles with GNOME Terminal after upgrading to GNOME 3.12 on Arch, I have

49
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,160
a link in the show notes that does a pretty quick fix.

50
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,840
I didn't have any issues.

51
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,120
It runs really good.

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,520
GNOME 3.12 runs really great.

53
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,720
I'm really happy with this release.

54
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,240
And you know, one of the things that I've joked about, and I'm kind of actually serious,

55
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,960
is I started using GNOME 3.10 in anticipation of GNOME 3.12.

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,480
I was like, I'm going to spend the GNOME 3.10 release, I'm going to spend that time just

57
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,600
like totally learning GNOME, and then I'm going to, I'll be ready, my body will be ready

58
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,460
when GNOME 3.12 lands.

59
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,560
And I think that worked out.

60
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,200
I think that's pretty much where I'm at.

61
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,200
But I'm really happy with it.

62
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,200
And so at the same time, a new Cinnamon release came out this week.

63
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,560
And I'm thinking, well, it's worth checking out.

64
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,440
What I'm really interested in is how is Cinnamon handling these new client-side decorations

65
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,880
that the new GNOME apps, you know, like gEdit and Roller, and a lot of these, Nautilus,

66
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,800
a lot of these apps are, and in some cases, you know, Cinnamon Desktop has their own replacements,

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,840
NEMO, for example, to replace Nautilus, but there's, inevitably, on a Cinnamon Desktop

68
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,920
now, you're going to run a GTK app that has these client-side decorations, these new toolbars

69
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
that GNOME apps have.

70
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,320
And I'm really curious how that works, because I know they did some kind of support in the

71
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,520
new version of Cinnamon to support client-side decorations, but I'm not really, I'm not really

72
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,960
hip on how it actually works, I haven't tried it yet myself.

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,440
And then on the other side of all that, you know, I should grab the person's name, because

74
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,720
I don't know if it's the same guy, or if it's a couple of people, but they have been awesome

75
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,460
at submitting the KDE Design Group's Monday updates to our subreddit, like, they're just

76
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,160
on it, yeah, so, Euro Topman, is that you?

77
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,880
Are you out there, Euro Topman?

78
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,360
I don't know if you're the guy that's been doing all of them, but I want to thank you,

79
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,160
because it's really been helping me keep in touch with what the KDE Design Group is up

80
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,200
to, remember we had their lead designer on last couple weeks ago.

81
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,800
When he unveiled their, kind of the prototype, this is a mock-up, or, I don't know, not a

82
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,640
mock-up, because there's actual code out there you can get, but this is an early design iteration,

83
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,920
it's very flat, Matt, I don't know if you had a chance to look at the new KDE design

84
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,760
shots, but some people in our subreddit are calling it very metro-looking.

85
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Oh, really?

86
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,000
No, I haven't actually had a chance to look at them yet.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,400
They're very, I think they're very nice, as somebody who's enjoying GNOME 3.12 right now,

88
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,680
I think these actually look pretty great.

89
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,800
I'll put a link to this in the show notes, but it's a brand new theme that they're working

90
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,240
on, it's not going to replace any other themes, it's just going to be an option.

91
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,560
I think it's the cleanest-looking KDE theme I've ever seen.

92
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,840
I don't know, what say you, chatroom?

93
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,920
I'm curious what you guys think, but it's just a very interesting time right now for

94
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:03,760
all of this stuff, because we've got the latest version of Unity launches on the 17th, KDE's

95
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,200
working way at this new design and on their new version of KDE, and GNOME 3.12, it's a

96
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,440
crazy time, man, it's a crazy time to be doing a show.

97
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,160
So alright, well I wanted to get to some feedback from last week's episode, we got a lot of

98
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
good stuff.

99
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,280
We had Chase on, if you guys didn't catch last week's episode, and he was talking about

100
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,340
his challenges switching to Linux, and so some of these touch on that, some of these

101
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,000
touch on a few of the other aspects that we got to in last week's episode, so we'll start

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,200
with this.

103
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,680
Our first one comes in from Kerry, and he says, hi Chris and Matt, I've been listening

104
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,440
to LAS and CodeRadio and TechSnap from the beginning, I just started listening to Linux

105
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
Unplugged.

106
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,100
On the subject of Windows users coming to Linux, I wanted to give the perspective of

107
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,200
someone who recently, newly came to Windows.

108
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,560
The only time I've encountered Windows was using a Windows 95 box for gaming when I was

109
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,640
young enough not to remember using Windows, and just for Word documents at school.

110
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,320
Otherwise, I've been using KDE and OS X, and now mainly Ubuntu.

111
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,560
It was only a couple of years ago that I received a laptop that an office was throwing out that

112
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,800
I actually used Windows for the first time and I ran into many roadblocks that I've seen

113
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,520
other Windows users run into that they just brush off and don't care about, and he has

114
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,880
a couple of examples here.

115
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,760
The file manager, it's difficult to navigate, what's the difference between pictures and

116
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
my pictures?

117
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,080
I have no idea why no one else knows either.

118
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Very true.

119
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Yeah, very true.

120
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,960
Navigating the settings menu is difficult.

121
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,680
When an app crashes, Windows will try to resolve the problem for several minutes.

122
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,880
Sometimes the problem resolving Windows will start to freeze up as well.

123
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,000
When this first happened to me, it was really upsetting and I asked around, what to do if

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
this happens?

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,600
People told me, yeah, it happens when you just wait for it to, you wait it out.

126
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,220
He says it's insanity.

127
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,780
All the apps are awful.

128
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,480
If they aren't installing malware or a toolbar, then they use ads or annoying pop-ups.

129
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,040
I use Microsoft recommended PDF reader and I still use sneaky tactics to make the experience

130
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,560
awful for me.

131
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,620
There are so many more things, but these are just the kinds of problems that I never have

132
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,840
to deal with when I'm using Linux or OS X, and these problems should be pointed out to

133
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,680
any Linux newbie of the things they won't have to deal with anymore.

134
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,360
Gnome 3.12 was light years ahead of Windows when it comes to ease of use, and I didn't

135
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,160
realize that until I started using Windows.

136
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,800
PS, when Linux Unplugged was launched, I couldn't find it in iTunes, so I didn't listen to it.

137
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,640
But after a while, I stumbled upon the feed again.

138
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,400
You should remind the audience that the feed does now actually exist.

139
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,340
Well, point well taken, Kerry.

140
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,320
How funny is that to get it from that perspective?

141
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Like the...

142
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,080
That's a fascinating perspective because it kind of proves that it's all in the eyes of

143
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
the builder.

144
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
Yeah, yeah.

145
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,160
I find it funny too, because I feel the same way when I now use Windows.

146
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,520
It feels very frustrating to me, and I think it's people that are switching have never

147
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,620
really experienced that phenomenon.

148
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:59,240
So if you're coming from Windows to something, you've never done that before, so you don't

149
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,720
realize it's actually...

150
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,700
You don't realize how much that familiarity plays into what you perceive to be usable.

151
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,720
And I think until you've switched around and hopped a few distros and desktops, then you

152
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
start to realize it.

153
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Right.

154
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
No, I definitely agree with that.

155
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,480
I think it's something that really kind of makes us think twice about stuff.

156
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,440
It certainly makes us rethink what we've been reading in the media.

157
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Kenny writes in.

158
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,320
He says, hi Matt and Chris, and Chase.

159
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,840
I was a little surprised the discussion regarding switchers to Linux went so long before someone

160
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,320
mentioned Linux distros are built around software centers or repositories.

161
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,440
This is the first thing that I explain to potential new users of Linux, and it's easy

162
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
to do.

163
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,120
It's critical to starting them off in the straight and narrow, and is a straightforward

164
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
advantage.

165
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
What?

166
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,920
You don't want to have to go racking around the internet and shoot off to PC world and

167
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,760
spend a fortune on new software?

168
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
Nope.

169
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,680
When I tried Linux for the first time circa 2008, it was because I couldn't afford a Windows

170
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,560
upgrade from Windows ME.

171
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,240
What had kept me from doing it earlier was not that there was too much choice or confusion,

172
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,600
but that I thought I completely borked my precious computer during the installation

173
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,160
of Windows.

174
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,880
Microsoft likes to impress you that you need to be an expert or crazy to actually want

175
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,160
to install your own OS.

176
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,240
The first time around, I got stuck between I didn't know what home and swap partitions

177
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
were.

178
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,800
But after some Googling, I was able to sort that out.

179
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,280
So here's my advice for Chase.

180
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,660
You can only do so much reading or research on a subject before you just have to try it.

181
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,480
Pick one of the larger distributions.

182
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,320
Go with the default desktop and settings.

183
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,120
And during installation, ensure you create a separate root or home and swap partitions.

184
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,520
Check on the official distro's website as to which proprietary drivers or codecs you

185
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,400
might want to add and how to install them.

186
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
And you're off!

187
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Anyhow, Chase, good luck with the move and I'm sure it won't be long before you're feeling

188
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
right at home.

189
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Great show as always.

190
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,120
I'm really looking forward to the how-to show.

191
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,200
I think his point about sometimes you just got to jump in is exactly right.

192
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,720
That takes a kind of adventurous person.

193
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,860
Yeah, I would tend to agree with that because I think you can only read about it so much

194
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,860
as they pointed out.

195
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,360
I think you definitely have to kind of stop running your face against the wall and walk

196
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,960
around and actually try some stuff.

197
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,640
Now that's why Chromebooks, I think, are doing so well because you don't have to really...

198
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,680
Your choice is what kind of screen you want, what kind of keyboard you want, the battery

199
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,720
life you want, and then you just buy it.

200
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,240
And I think that's why it's super appealing to a lot of XP switchers.

201
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,320
And then Linux becomes an implementation detail, which if you remember what Linus said in his

202
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,480
recent Q&A, that's perfectly fine with him.

203
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
That's how he likes it.

204
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
He doesn't care at all.

205
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,720
And that's why I think it's funny, you know, there are certain people, certain Microsoft

206
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,460
pundits out there that like to boast about how it's Linux, you know, users will never

207
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,480
care about Linux and they never have cared about Linux.

208
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
And you're silly to think otherwise.

209
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,580
What Paul is forgetting is that that's exactly how it should be.

210
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,960
That's what we expect.

211
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,680
Linux is the implementation detail.

212
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,240
Now it is a massive detail that we spend our lives here thinking about, but it is to the

213
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,160
user, it is but a detail.

214
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
And that's how it should be.

215
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,120
And that's how Linus thinks it should be too.

216
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,600
And we've heard him say it.

217
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,720
So that's why I'm warming up to the idea of Chromebooks, which I was initially pretty

218
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,080
cold on.

219
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,440
And I don't judge anybody who thinks that's the machine they should be running.

220
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,040
Just like I think Chase got hung up on choice.

221
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,640
I think the Chromebook solves that problem.

222
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,440
But I think as a community, we can help solve that.

223
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,880
And that's what I want to talk about in the second half of the show today is kind of that

224
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,640
hang up and exactly what our last email just sort of touched on is, you know, pick one

225
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,000
of the big ones to start with, at least.

226
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,960
And so often I see in the community advice in the other direction given.

227
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,800
Before we talk about that, before we get to the rest of our feedback, I want to thank

228
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,040
our first sponsor this week.

229
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
And that is Ting.com.

230
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,360
Go over to linux.ting.com.

231
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Now what is Ting?

232
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,920
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

233
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,620
It's my mobile service provider, and it's Matt's mobile service provider.

234
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,560
And I got to tell you, what I love about it, and I think what Matt probably loves about

235
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,980
it too, is you only pay for what you use.

236
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,960
And if you're a work at home kind of guy, or if you're in an office that has Wi-Fi you

237
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,860
can jump onto, this is such a value.

238
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,360
Because you can use your phone when you need to make that actual call.

239
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,140
But 90% of my data usage is on the Wi-Fi.

240
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:05,640
So why would I pay into some massive plan that I, you know, I might need four gigabytes

241
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,800
one month out of the year, maybe three months out of the year, maybe more or less, you know.

242
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,600
And so every single month I pay into that large plan in the off chance that I might

243
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
need that.

244
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,320
Whereas with Ting it's like, okay, I'm just going to pay for it when I actually need it.

245
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,880
And otherwise I get full advantage of being on Wi-Fi when I'm on Wi-Fi, and I just pay

246
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,840
for the usage and there's zero stress.

247
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,800
When I'm out on the road, when I'm setting up the new studio, I don't have to worry about

248
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
overages.

249
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,900
I don't have to worry about getting $15 every gigabyte like some of the other big blue logoed

250
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,080
mobile carriers do.

251
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Dang it.

252
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
I have to tell you.

253
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,240
You can support it by going to linux.ting.com and you'll save $25 off your first device.

254
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,940
If you already have a device and you want to bring it to the Ting network, check out

255
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,840
their BYOD page.

256
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,680
They support lots of great devices.

257
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,080
It's a great way to get started because then they'll apply that $25 credit to your bill.

258
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,280
And if you're like me, your first bill is going to be free.

259
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,600
They just recently also added support for the iPhone 5.

260
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,400
98% of people would save money with Ting.

261
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,900
And one of the things that's different about Ting is go to linux.ting.com.

262
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,160
That registers your interest.

263
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,760
It thanks them for supporting this show because they see that you came there because we sent

264
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
you there.

265
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,080
So linux.ting.com and then check out their blog.

266
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,840
And tell me you didn't wish your mobile carrier was as transparent and awesome as this.

267
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,120
Ting is constantly updating their blog with behind the scenes interviews that are real

268
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,480
and legitimate.

269
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,160
They have app comparisons that are really great apps.

270
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,080
We covered one on Linux Action Show.

271
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,820
They did a Heartbleed update because they had a lot of people send in and ask what the

272
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,840
status of Ting's Heartbleed security was.

273
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,560
And this is a great one too.

274
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,200
They're posting a little reminder about their personal shopper service which just turned

275
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,840
one years old.

276
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,760
You can go to Ting and be like, hey Ting, this is what I want from a device.

277
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,460
I don't want to buy it new.

278
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,120
But I still want to take advantage of the fact that when I get a device from you, I

279
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
own it outright.

280
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
It's mine.

281
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,680
And if you could find me a device that meets these specifications, then I could switch

282
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,680
to you.

283
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,440
And on average, in two days, Ting will find you a used mobile device that you can get

284
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,200
refurbished and then help you get it connected to the Ting network.

285
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,280
It's another great way to get started and really take advantage of Ting's value.

286
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,880
So go over to linux.ting.com to get started.

287
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,920
And finally, get out of your contract.

288
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,560
Never worry about early termination fees.

289
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,800
And by the way, if you are in an early termination fee, they have an ETF relief program.

290
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,920
You can find more about that at ting.com slash ETF.

291
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,880
They're going to pay you up to $75 per line that you have to get canceled.

292
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
That's a really great deal.

293
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,500
And then you're just going to start saving money from the now linux.ting.com and a big

294
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,560
thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged and their great support of the Jupiter Broadcasting

295
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Network too.

296
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,000
We really appreciate it.

297
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So Quickie writes in.

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That's a great name.

299
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,240
And he says, you guys were talking about the terminal versus the GUI last week.

300
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,880
And some of you were floating the crazy arse idea that the terminal might actually be better

301
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,360
for new users in the GUI because you can give them the commands over the phone.

302
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,240
He says, hey, Chris and Matt, time zone sucks.

303
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,160
I wish I could have joined you live.

304
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,080
About the terminal versus GUI topic, yeah, it's a personal choice really, but nothing

305
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
is better than the other.

306
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,920
I developed GUI applications for Linux, but they aren't as powerful as the terminal since

307
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,840
text gives you a lot of advantages like almost infinite permutations and the ability to compose

308
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,400
features together.

309
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,000
About the text support part, though, it's harder to explain where to click.

310
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,540
But I don't think that is something that makes the GUI inferior to the command line.

311
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,160
It just points out bad design decisions of the GUI.

312
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,560
Try to explain to someone to change the default application for the document type on Windows

313
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,000
and elementary OS.

314
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,040
In Windows control panel, you go to the control panel, then you go somewhere and you right

315
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,640
click on that file and you go to open with and you select, he gets lost, and you can

316
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,920
eventually get them depending on the version of Windows to check the default application.

317
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,480
But in a more well-designed operating system like elementary OS, it's simple as pie.

318
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,700
You go to applications, system settings, defaults, and then you just select the application.

319
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
It's right there.

320
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,840
I think UI dictates the usability of the GUI, not command line versus GUI.

321
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,240
Interesting point.

322
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,600
And I agree, too, that we got some other people that are like, yeah, see, when you try to

323
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,160
read somebody a command over the phone, you never know if they're typing it in right and

324
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,920
they don't always read back the return right to you.

325
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
True.

326
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,880
Each their own, Matt.

327
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Okay.

328
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,840
Before we get to our Valve update, Kyle wrote in and he says there was a big point that

329
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,760
we missed in last week's episode and I kind of agree with him.

330
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:16,200
We were talking about how Linux is especially right now in 2014, really better suited for

331
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,280
geeks, for technical people that want to switch away from Windows for various reasons and

332
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
there's a lot of them.

333
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,440
And it's not just XP going away, there's a lot of reasons why technical users who have

334
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,640
been Windows enthusiasts for years might want to move over to the Linux platform.

335
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,560
And we were trying to discuss the best way for that to happen and he says the point that

336
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,480
you missed, and though I enjoyed your conversation with Chase in the last show, is since I think

337
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,760
it dealt with the topic that all of us want to promote Linux, we struggle with this.

338
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,440
However, I think that you missed out on the biggest and most obvious point that you should

339
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,600
have considered.

340
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,520
I think that despite your claims to the contrary, that you remain stuck on the topic of the

341
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,400
mythical first time PC user or the grandma and grandpa user who have no technical knowledge.

342
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,400
If you truly believe that technical users are most likely to switch to Linux, you should

343
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,280
recommend experimenting with Linux in a VM.

344
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,680
The immediate objection to this idea will be that VMs are too complicated for new users.

345
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,360
However, complexity of using Linux on a VM is mostly handled in the host OS where the

346
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,220
technical user is already comfortable with the GUI and the software, not in the guest

347
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,360
where they are out of their element.

348
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,320
What is the biggest advantage with experimenting in a VM?

349
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,080
Snapshots are external to the guest OS.

350
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,320
They can be restored from the GUI and that is what the user is comfortable with.

351
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,520
This is a set of training wheels or water wings that a new user who wants to go nuts

352
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,360
with an experiment needs.

353
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,240
Want to remove Ubuntu desktop and try to install Ubuntu?

354
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,360
No problem.

355
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,520
Once you run into problems, just restore your last snapshot.

356
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,640
Feel like maybe you want to try another distro, but worry you might lose your work you've

357
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
put in so far?

358
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,060
No problem.

359
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,160
Just create a new VM yourself.

360
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,680
You yourself have often used VMs in the past to demo distros, so why wouldn't a technical

361
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,000
user?

362
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,920
This was the method I used to get into Arch Linux.

363
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,240
My first two attempts at installing the OS were a total catastrophe, but eventually with

364
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,440
some determination and a few snapshot rollbacks, I started to feel at home with it and now

365
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,600
I've installed on a number of real computers.

366
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,440
For most of my distro hopping needs, I still use VMs and if a user like Chase really wants

367
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,940
to maximize benefits they get out of their hardware, well, they can do that once they

368
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,240
get used to the basics of Linux.

369
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
Next, Kyle.

370
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,600
What do you think, Matt, for technical users is trying it out in a VM first a viable idea?

371
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,800
Well, I think if you have the resources that will support it, I think that's fine, but

372
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,320
I think that's a pretty iffy situation for most people.

373
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,800
Yeah, I think Chase could.

374
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,000
I think he has pretty good PCs.

375
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,920
Oh yeah, Chase could do it, but I mean for Joe average, just someone who maybe is not

376
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,800
a Windows power user, that might not be such a great thing.

377
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,120
I do agree with Kyle in the sense that I am surprised when we're talking about tech users

378
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,920
that the VM doesn't come up more because that is his point where the management of the VM,

379
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,240
like the snapshotting, all of that is done in the native OS that they're familiar with,

380
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,700
so like they are comfortable with pushing those boundaries.

381
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,680
That actually makes a lot of sense to me.

382
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,960
So when I think about it that way, I kind of feel like bad on me for saying, hey, if

383
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,600
you're a technical user, like Chase, for example, when we start how to Linux is going to make

384
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,180
that switch and I've been racking my brain, like I think the best way to get him to use

385
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,360
Linux is to make him run it to do a lot of things, right?

386
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,200
Say, hey, Chase, when you know you're doing your regular day-to-day stuff, do it in this

387
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
machine.

388
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,760
Don't default back to your Windows box or your Mac box.

389
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,440
And I was trying to think like, well, what am I going to do?

390
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,520
Am I going to like rent him a laptop, you know, am I going to set up a PC at his house

391
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,680
and then like I read this and I was like, yeah, he could just run a full screen VM.

392
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,600
I know he's got a machine nice enough to do it.

393
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
That would make sense.

394
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,160
I mean, I think in his case that definitely matches for sure.

395
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Yeah.

396
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
All right, Matt.

397
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,480
Before we get into the main discussion in our show this week, I do want to have a little

398
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
valve update.

399
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,920
We got to talk about this because the valve news hasn't been making it in the big show

400
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,080
as much, but I try to keep up to date in Linux Unplugged and we've got a release date on

401
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
that valve controller.

402
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,240
Now you don't have to have a steam box to use the valve controller.

403
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,640
I know you've been doing some Let's Play videos, Matt, so you've been looking at controllers.

404
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,440
You'll be able to, so I don't know if you've seen the latest version of the valve controller,

405
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,960
but it looks much more like a regular controller with regular buttons.

406
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,520
It still has those, the areola controllers, I don't know what else.

407
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Those are still pretty cool.

408
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Those are still there.

409
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,200
And I guess it's October or November is when the steam controller is going to be available

410
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,120
with, right now they're saying over 500 compatible games.

411
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,760
And then I would think anything that really supports a controller.

412
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,000
So there you go.

413
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,760
If you want to get yourself a steam controller, you'll be able to pre-order it soon.

414
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,800
I'm going to get one.

415
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
I'm going to get one.

416
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Are you?

417
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Oh well, I've got to, right?

418
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm going to get one on the show.

419
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,280
And I play with the controller quite a bit anyways.

420
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,080
I'm already playing with a 360 controller.

421
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,160
I'm not going to lie, it feels dirty every time I plug it into my bonobo.

422
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,920
I feel like I'm committing some sort of crime or something.

423
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
I don't know.

424
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,200
So yeah, I think I'm going to get one.

425
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,360
I'm looking forward to it as a matter of fact the more I think about it.

426
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,480
I'm just a little worried it's not going to work as great because the thing is, the dirty

427
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,000
little secret, actually it's not that dirty of a secret, the Xbox 360 controller works

428
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,480
outrageously well under Linux.

429
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,320
Like you just plug it in, it works out of the box on every game that I've tried.

430
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:19,040
And Valve even just recently updated the kernel support for the controller so it's even better.

431
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,120
So the Xbox 360 has turned into the perfect Linux game controller.

432
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,320
And on top of that, it's not a bad controller to begin with.

433
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,280
It's one of my more preferred controllers anyways.

434
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,840
So I've never tried the one, so I don't know.

435
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,160
But the 360 controller, well I guess I have tried the one, it seems the same to me.

436
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,760
So I don't know, as ridiculous as it sounds, I think on my Linux box, Valve's biggest competition

437
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,400
is Microsoft's 360 controller.

438
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
I feel dirty.

439
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Dirty thunk it.

440
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Ugh.

441
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,720
All right, well before we get into our main topic this week, I want to thank our second

442
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,240
sponsor and that is Digital Ocean.

443
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,880
You guys, if you've been listening to the show a little bit, you know how much I love

444
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
Digital Ocean.

445
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,240
But if you're new to the show, let me tell you a little bit about them.

446
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:03,120
Digital Ocean is growing and exploding and they are probably both concisely put, consider

447
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,600
them to be simple cloud hosting, dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

448
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,320
to spin up a cloud server.

449
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,880
And if you just think about like if you need to spin up a system, like I was just having

450
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,640
a little pre-show chat about a new server I needed and it's like, oh yeah, that would

451
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,240
work great as a Digital Ocean instance and here's the great part.

452
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,080
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds, however, however in our subreddit right now,

453
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,960
the record is 43 seconds.

454
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,320
And then I got an email today, this morning, saying, hey man, hey man, my record, if you

455
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,700
listen to like episode 26 of Unplugged, my record's 40 seconds.

456
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,040
So we've got people competing right now, 55 seconds is the average benchmark, but we have

457
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,780
people that can create an entire cloud server instance in 40 seconds in Digital Ocean as

458
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,600
data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore and Amsterdam.

459
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,680
And part of the reason why people can make these cloud servers so fast is because their

460
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,640
interface is simple, they have an intuitive control panel and power users can replicate

461
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,080
that on a larger scale with their straightforward API, which I've been told is quite beautiful.

462
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,760
And their dashboard is really great and one of the things I love about Digital Ocean is

463
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,320
once they implement a feature, they don't just leave it alone, they continue to do really

464
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,320
smart logical iteration.

465
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,200
You can see the evolution of not just the product features, but the design and how you

466
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,840
use the product.

467
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,680
Like I have watched them really mature the resize image stuff, you know, they've added

468
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,680
in some really great DNS management, the snapshot interface has never been better, their HTML5

469
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,720
console access to your droplet, you get HTML5 console access.

470
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,360
And they have one button install of WordPress and Ruby on Rails, and they're using Doku

471
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,400
on the backend, which is an open source project that they created that they sponsor that works

472
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,160
with Docker to deploy applications.

473
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:46,200
And listeners of Coderadio, if they use the promo code UnpluggedApril, of Linux Unplugged,

474
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,120
UnpluggedApril, you can get two months for free when you get the $5 droplet.

475
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,520
If you use the promo code UnpluggedApril, two months for free, that's a great deal.

476
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,020
And you can try out that $5 rig for a little bit and see what you can do.

477
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,080
I'm constantly finding new uses for mine, and we have a G Plus community thread where

478
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,040
they've been talking about all of the great things that they're using their DigitalOcean

479
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
droplets for.

480
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,480
So go over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code UnpluggedApril to check them out.

481
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,400
And an outrageously huge thank you to DigitalOcean for not only supporting the Linux Unplugged

482
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,040
podcast, but for just being so awesome.

483
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,600
I love your SSD drives, I love them, and I love your tier one bandwidth.

484
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,480
Tell you what, Matt, if you wanted to refresh some server hosting skills, or you wanted

485
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,260
to do a little MP3 stream or something like that for yourself, or maybe your own cloud

486
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:41,600
instance or a Minecraft server, or if you're like Michael Dominic on Coderadio, he uses

487
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,280
DigitalOcean to host the backend infrastructure for the apps that he sells to clients.

488
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,080
And some of the biggest sites on the web use DigitalOcean.

489
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,980
So the scalability is so awesome, and what we talk about all the time, we've talked about

490
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,360
it on this show specifically, is the technologies that are doing this are the technologies

491
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,480
that we are watching in front of our very eyes evolve.

492
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,100
Like Docker, like KVM, and all of this stuff is coming together, SystemD, it's all coming

493
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:12,880
together to work as a platform for DigitalOcean to make a whole new generation of servers

494
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,720
that are available to folks at unbelievable value.

495
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,520
And that's what's so exciting because we're actually seeing the realization of the stuff

496
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,200
we've been talking about in DigitalOcean, and they're blowing up.

497
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
They're hiring right now.

498
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
You can go over to their website.

499
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
You can get a job.

500
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,200
They just got a great round of funding.

501
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,080
They have an awesome video series on TechCrunch that goes into their office and kind of gives

502
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,120
you a little bit of behind the scenes about their culture.

503
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,660
They're a really cool company, and I'm really happy to have them on here.

504
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:43,860
So go over to DigitalOcean.com and use that promo code unpluggedapril to thank them.

505
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,480
And check it out for yourself and see what's so cool about having your own SSD-powered

506
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
droplet.

507
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,760
Okay, Matt, so I wanted to talk about the underdog a little bit, and I really don't

508
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
mean to...

509
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:02,140
I don't want this show to be ranty, and I don't want to get anybody offended that works

510
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,640
really hard on their distribution.

511
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,400
That's not my goal here.

512
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,960
So I want to give you the background on this, and then we'll go from there.

513
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,000
So recent discussions that we've had on Linux Unplugged, I think pretty much prompted by

514
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,120
the demise of XP, have really made me thinking about getting more people to switch to Linux.

515
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,120
And really, the scope of the problems that we have there.

516
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,640
And so many of those problems are really outside our ability to control.

517
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,560
They're OEM, or they're distribution channel problems, or whatever it is.

518
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,280
They're really just as regular, at the end of the day, regular Linux users, they're outside

519
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,280
our scope.

520
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,040
So I've been trying to think more of what's actually legitimately in our scope to solve.

521
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:46,040
And a lot of times that comes down to community, support infrastructure, helping onboard people

522
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,640
who are already maybe interested in making the switch, and maybe trying to find ways

523
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,120
to outreach to people who haven't made the choice yet.

524
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,160
And I think some of this is honestly in the shadow, some of this discussion we're going

525
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:02,360
to have about underdog distros is legitimately in the shadow of the 14.04 release, which

526
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,880
we're talking about soon.

527
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:11,880
And so I've been running Ubuntu again, and I'm once again on a distribution where when

528
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,800
you run it, you can genuinely feel that it is the wider used platform, like it's unquestionable

529
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,780
that the most people running Linux on the web are on Ubuntu because so much that you

530
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,720
find on the web is just automatically tailored for Ubuntu.

531
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,680
And that really comes through when you're using it.

532
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,480
It's got me thinking about this a lot more.

533
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,000
And so I think what I want to kind of pitch to you into the Mumble Room is, are we doing

534
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,220
a disservice to new users when we recommend these boutique distros, which I think are

535
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,960
great for experienced users, but essentially you're sending them down a path where they

536
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,080
become part of a niche of a niche, because Linux is already a niche desktop environment,

537
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,840
and then you send them onto a distro that is a niche of that already small slice of

538
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
pie.

539
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,920
So the support community is automatically out of the gate smaller.

540
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,120
Even if it's really sharp where it's sharp, it's smaller.

541
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,800
And the other thing that it's one of these unpredictable things that you can't account

542
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:12,040
for, but it always smacks new users right in that face, is that random, poorly crafted

543
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,800
Google search, you know, where they're just, they're less likely to get results for their

544
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
own distro.

545
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,040
Like I don't know if it was in the pre-show, I think, or I know it was in the post-show

546
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,120
I think of last week's Linux Unplugged, but Chase decided after using 14.04 for the whole

547
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
episode to try to install Steam.

548
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,120
So he went to Google.

549
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,120
He didn't even think about going to the package manager because that's a totally new concept

550
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
to him.

551
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:37,080
So he went to Google and he searched for Steam installation and he got a link for Fedora,

552
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,920
and he started downloading an RPM like he was off on a completely wrong course because

553
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,960
the title of the article was install Steam on Linux.

554
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,680
And you got to think about when these guys are searching for this stuff, if you have

555
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,600
them off on some boutique small distro, and I have a lot of respect for some of these

556
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,720
smaller distros that we've had on the show and talked to, but that right there is setting

557
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,680
them up for some level of failure.

558
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,320
Then you have to ask what's the long-term viability of any really small team.

559
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,800
There is a good shot it'll work out, but it's always questionable.

560
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,440
Larger distros like Ubuntu or OpenSUSE or Fedora, even if they're corporate backers

561
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,440
or their community pulled out completely, that code would still go on.

562
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,080
There would be a fork in the open source community that would maintain that for at least some

563
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,440
point in time.

564
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,280
But with these smaller distributions, sometimes when they shut down, they shut down.

565
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,120
And Matt, I know you've seen that, you've watched that happen, and we've seen these

566
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,040
smaller guys where they just kind of go away.

567
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,960
Well I also think that, it's a little bit like I was saying previously, that I feel

568
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,600
that if you're starting someone out for the first time, they should be starting out with

569
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,720
an Ubuntu base, whether that's Ubuntu with Unity or whether it's one of the other desktop

570
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
environments.

571
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,000
But I think by sticking to that, that actually provides you with enough flexibility to try

572
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,920
some new stuff, but you're pretty well grounded in not ending up in an experimental land,

573
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,200
which is where most people end up with boutique distros.

574
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,400
Later on you can try out the boutique distros.

575
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,040
Let me ask Crash Bandicoot, because I believe he recently switched somebody new to Linux

576
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:08,480
and he chose Korora 19 or Korora 20, is that right Crash?

577
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:17,080
Yeah, that's right, it's a friend of mine who, he's one of my housemates, and so I put

578
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,960
him on that because I figured, you know, every time he needs anything done, he just comes

579
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,880
to me and says, oh I need this done, all that done, what do you want me to do?

580
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,520
He's got the proximity advantage.

581
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:34,840
Yeah, so that's why I ended up actually switching him to Intergas, just because there was a

582
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,840
few things going wrong with Fedora, it was just running slow and stuff.

583
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
So you moved him to Tegra?

584
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,120
Yeah, because like I said, you know, I have SSH access to his machine, so updates and

585
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,320
stuff I just do every week or so, I just do it.

586
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,800
But I actually have another friend who, he came to me and he said, oh you know, I've

587
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,000
been looking at Harry's computer and it's really cool because, you know, Gnome Shell

588
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,680
and all the rest of it, and he wanted to give it a try.

589
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,560
And so I pointed him towards Ubuntu and he's had no problems with that at all, like he

590
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:09,920
just installed it, he used the Gnome Shell remix because he wanted Gnome, and he just

591
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,840
installed it and he's been loving it, like he's had no issues at all.

592
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:21,160
Whereas the guy that I'm sort of managing his system, if he was by himself, I'd probably

593
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,680
have pointed him towards Ubuntu as well for that exact reason that you mentioned with,

594
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,320
you know, if he Googles how to do something, he's going to get a guide for Ubuntu, he might

595
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:34,280
get a guide for Arch or whatever else, but he's definitely going to get a guide for Ubuntu

596
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,080
that works.

597
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,920
Now Crossroads, you were going to say that we should maybe consider custom tailing it

598
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,920
for each user.

599
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,600
That doesn't sound very scalable to me, to be honest with you.

600
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,880
Also, um, sorry.

601
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Go ahead Riley.

602
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:55,600
Well, I was going to say, uh, there is an issue with Ubuntu, even still though, is because

603
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,080
a lot of the time you'll find outdated PPAs and like you'll find info, but it'll be

604
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,560
retaining like 804 or something.

605
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
It's way off.

606
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,600
So you got to be careful what you're searching for too.

607
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
Well, that's very true.

608
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Yeah.

609
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,400
But it's also easier for Ubuntu anyway, cause it's like most time people will, the stuff

610
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
will be updated.

611
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Like the forum, if you go to Google to something, a lot of the times the form doesn't show up

612
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,280
anymore and it's Ask Ubuntu now.

613
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,840
So that's an improvement.

614
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,180
Well that was a conscious decision actually.

615
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:31,480
We had a, uh, George Castro, a great talk at one of our, um, developer summits and, uh,

616
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,680
it was all about going through the wiki and deleting pages cause we're doing a disservice

617
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:41,760
to our users and our friends when we leave like some wacky how to from 804 detailing

618
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,560
how to use Endis wrapper, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, we should get

619
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,680
rid of that page because it's no longer needed and point people at Ask Ubuntu.

620
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,680
Hmm.

621
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:56,560
Well, I guess, so here's what happens is people for whatever reason, uh, and I don't know

622
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,920
if I consider myself in this camp or not, I'm undecided, but people for whatever reason

623
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,560
sometimes hesitated recommending Ubuntu.

624
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,080
I mean, we just saw this New York Times article that we covered in the Linux action show and

625
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,120
the author of the New York Times article, the number one distro at the top of his list

626
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,960
was Bodai Linux and it was also the one he had the most praise.

627
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,320
Uh, I think Ubuntu was three on the list after Mint.

628
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,280
And so Mint is the one you hear like thrown around the most often is an alternative to

629
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Ubuntu.

630
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,800
Uh, I want to, so I think if you guys are buying, it sounds like you guys are all kind

631
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,080
of buying off on this philosophy that if, if it's a, if it's a random new user who you're

632
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,360
not holding his hand or her hand and installing that Linux for them and then by proxy also

633
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,160
being their support, then Ubuntu is a good choice.

634
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,680
All right, so if we accept that, yeah, okay.

635
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,480
So if we accept that, do we also accept that about Mint?

636
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,720
Yes, but slightly different.

637
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,240
So I would, I would argue why is it any different?

638
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:54,140
Like so for me, then you get into the question, well, but cinnamon and mate are again onto

639
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,560
an island of their own.

640
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,340
They're not something that's super common.

641
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,700
They're not something that, you know, what the longterm prospects are, although they

642
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,700
look good.

643
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,540
Uh, and you know, you don't know if they've been as banged on as the rest of the desktops

644
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,880
that have maybe a larger user base because they're on more distributions or they just

645
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,240
have more users.

646
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,600
So what is the difference between a boutique recommending a boutique distribution and recommending

647
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
a boutique desk?

648
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:20,040
Well, well, they're not boutique and longterm support, but there's also not boutique like

649
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,040
Mint's not boutique.

650
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,960
I mean, it's, it's become a, just as popular as Ubuntu, but it benefits when having Ubuntu

651
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,960
support.

652
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,000
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't buy that.

653
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,240
I don't buy that for a minute.

654
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,680
I'm not talking about, I mean, I think it's a great distribution.

655
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,400
I don't, I don't buy, I don't buy that.

656
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,240
It has nearly the install base that Ubuntu does.

657
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
It doesn't.

658
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:42,920
I'm talking about like you're, you're talking about the consideration of like, uh, as far

659
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,160
as like popularity goes, Mint has as much popularity, popularity, but out, but outside

660
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,840
of Linux community, it's, it's much lower and outside of servers, it's basically, you

661
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,640
know, there's, there's nothing.

662
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,720
But when you look into it, like just usability wise, people are going to suggest Mint purely

663
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,760
for the fact that Cinnamon is very user friendly to Windows people.

664
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Yeah.

665
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,000
Whereas Ubuntu is like completely different paradigm.

666
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Right.

667
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Right.

668
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,240
So there's, there's, there's reason why Mint is picked because instead of Ubuntu, not because

669
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
Ubuntu is bad.

670
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,640
I mean, the people who bash Ubuntu, I think are a little crazy, but when you have, um,

671
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,760
the, the, the paradigm of the usability such drastically different, there are some people

672
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,620
who would be turned off by that.

673
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:31,040
When you give them Cinnamon, they, they look at it like, oh, okay, it's kind of like Windows.

674
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,320
So that has a benefit there.

675
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
Yeah.

676
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
I don't know though.

677
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,720
I mean, look, we just heard Crash Benedict's anecdote about somebody wanting to switch

678
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
because of Gnome.

679
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,740
And this has never been a problem for the Mac since time of inception.

680
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:47,280
That is never, the Mac OS 10 has never gotten a single switcher because it looks like Windows.

681
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,480
And I don't know if that's a requirement.

682
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,680
I think it just has to work and make sense.

683
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,760
Also, you know, forgetting to the whole desktop thing is Unity is going to be having some

684
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,640
pretty big changes in 1310 and, uh, we're not talking to, but 1410 and so on and so

685
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,240
on, but it's going to be a little, in Gnome, pretty changes every other month.

686
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
Yeah.

687
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,240
Yeah.

688
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
Yeah.

689
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,240
And Cinnamon has consistently remained the same.

690
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
I mean, since its beginning.

691
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,240
Paradigm wise.

692
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
Yeah.

693
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
Yeah.

694
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,080
It has, it's, it's had a very casual evolution, so it keeps people feeling safe.

695
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,920
It just adds some user friendly settings into it and that's very good for new users.

696
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,440
You could argue that, that Unity has not changed that much usability though.

697
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Right.

698
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,160
And Unity won't change that much in 14.04, it's an LTS, remember, five year support.

699
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:36,400
So you put your user on, yeah, and I'm saying you don't need to, you don't, you don't have

700
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
to upgrade.

701
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,920
There's no, there's no one with a gun to your head saying you have to upgrade.

702
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,200
You can just stay on 14.04.

703
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:47,040
And also that, that is precisely what Windows XP users would be looking for, right?

704
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,160
Because they've been using the same operating system for going on 13 years now.

705
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
Yeah.

706
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,160
And that's what they want to replace.

707
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
Yeah.

708
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
That's what they want to swap out.

709
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,160
And that's the paradigm they're familiar with.

710
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
That's what, that's how they think of it.

711
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,160
They just want their security updates and just keep on rolling.

712
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:05,320
And the only, the only place where I see where, where Mint has, has an argument is, is that

713
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:11,640
the, the desktops it provides offer a familiar user environment that a Windows switcher would

714
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,080
be comfortable with, whereas Ubuntu is, is different enough to require, require them

715
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
to think.

716
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,920
Well, the issue is like the XP users are typically people who have never thought of updating

717
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,440
and they don't, they just, they're afraid to update, they don't want to change anything.

718
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,760
So those people going to Ubuntu, that paradigm switch might be too much.

719
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,880
The only reason I would suggest like people from Windows, it would be Windows XP users

720
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,880
to Cinnamon would be very friendly to them.

721
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,660
But if you did, somebody who's just a regular user for, and who's like, who has a computer

722
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,080
that can handle it, they not necessarily care at all.

723
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,640
So Ick, you wanted to make a point that maybe just offering folks what they already have,

724
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,240
isn't that, that appealing?

725
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
I don't think so.

726
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,200
I think when people want to switch, they want to switch to something that might be a little

727
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,720
bit different than what they're used to.

728
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,760
I mean, you know, Windows is Windows, Mac is Mac, let's let Linux be Linux.

729
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,800
They want it, they want their hassle to feel like it was worth it.

730
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:13,200
Yes, they want, they, they're going to want it to not necessarily feel familiar, but to

731
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,720
get to know something that feels a little bit different so that they, you know, it doesn't

732
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,480
have to always be about familiarity.

733
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:27,160
I, my biggest pet peeve is when I see us trying to copy what Microsoft or Apple has already

734
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
done.

735
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,080
And, you know, we've need to brand our own brand.

736
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,940
We have too many brands to brand.

737
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,940
That's the problem.

738
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,320
But I think Crossroads has a good point in the sense that if you have, you're going to

739
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,640
have to, we're going to, we're going to be the people telling people to switch so we

740
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,600
could just give them an example of what they could look like.

741
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,720
And I think the best option to get people to switch would not be here's what you should

742
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,880
use and not even give them distros, just don't even mention the distros, just get like a

743
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,240
grid of, or here's like a slide show of here's what you could get, here's what GNOME looks

744
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,760
like, here's what Unity looks like and then just let's say which one do you like the best

745
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
and then focus on the distro after that.

746
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,760
Huh.

747
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
That's a great idea.

748
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
So is that me?

749
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,400
Go ahead, you said your sister switched because of Unity?

750
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:20,800
Yeah, actually, when I was actually first getting into Linux, I was running Ubuntu off

751
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,400
a USB stick and she saw it and she's like, oh, that looks awesome.

752
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,720
Can I have it?

753
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,680
And so I set her up with a dual boot.

754
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:35,240
She actually only uses Windows for Netflix, but and she uses it all the time.

755
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
She loves it.

756
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
Yeah.

757
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
Yeah.

758
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
Yeah.

759
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
I don't doubt it.

760
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,240
That's just funny to me.

761
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,240
So Matt, I want to ask you something.

762
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,520
This is a very general, reasonable conversation about different desktop options, about why

763
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,840
Cinnamon makes sense, about why Unity makes sense, why Ubuntu makes sense.

764
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,440
These are all very logical.

765
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:58,360
So why is it you still hear so many people recommending some off the wall distribution?

766
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,600
Like I mean, I don't mean to label Bodhi as off the wall, but you know, in the grand

767
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,400
scheme of like support when you're searching the Internet, you're not going to get a lot

768
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,400
of Bodhi results.

769
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,020
Why are we seeing this, Matt, when Ubuntu seems, or Mint maybe, seems like a pretty

770
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,320
practical choice?

771
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,040
Well, I think it depends on who's doing the recommendation.

772
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,200
There's usually two separate groups that do the recommendations for a distribution.

773
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,600
The Linux users themselves, which they either love or hate Ubuntu, there's not a lot in

774
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
between.

775
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,480
So you have that person with their vested interest.

776
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,320
The second group of people is generally the folks that are doing articles, speaking to

777
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,560
someone that writes articles.

778
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,480
If you're not writing about Ubuntu, you're not writing because no one's going to hire

779
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
you.

780
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
That's just reality.

781
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,720
I hate to be the one to break that to everyone, but welcome to reality, kids.

782
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,720
That's what people want.

783
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,200
It's open source and Ubuntu.

784
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,200
Yeah, it just seems so mono, it seems so monotone.

785
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,720
Now unless it's enterprise stuff, then you can use Ubuntu, but otherwise it's Ubuntu

786
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
or open source.

787
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,720
That shows you though, right?

788
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,080
That shows you what the interest of the reader is.

789
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,160
Yeah, it really is.

790
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,760
And that's, and quite frankly, that's what ranks.

791
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,760
I mean, that's what people are searching for.

792
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,400
And for why that is, is debatable, but the point is, is that's certainly what's going

793
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
on.

794
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,080
So I think you have those two groups of people that generally you have to work with.

795
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,080
It doesn't necessarily mean, that doesn't necessarily mean that those other distros

796
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,280
shouldn't be suggested.

797
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:21,160
I mean, if the computer is old enough, I mean, Ubuntu might not be a solution purely because

798
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,880
Unity needs a decent hardware.

799
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,080
I feel like the elephant in the room here and heaven's revenge is like thinking like

800
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,120
I don't read the chat room or something.

801
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,680
I think the elephant in the room here is it's SUSE, right?

802
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,600
I mean like where does open SUSE fit in?

803
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,560
Is it, is it something that is for the enthusiast?

804
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,200
Is it something that is for these new switchers?

805
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,880
They've got their evergreen release now.

806
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,400
I'm very surprised that there's been no open SUSE representation at all here at the moment.

807
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,400
That's all representing Ubuntu right now.

808
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,640
Well, except for the shirt I'm wearing.

809
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:00,480
Well, it's just as big or even bigger than Canonical in terms of corporate power.

810
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,120
They also have a one for the windows power use and their distro when it comes to major

811
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,560
release upgrades have never screwed up like a Ubuntu upgrade as for me.

812
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,560
Yeah.

813
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,160
And they have a good presence in enterprise and they have a lot of partnerships there.

814
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,440
So there's a lot of folks who would be using it in an IT setting.

815
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,680
They might want to use it on their desktop.

816
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,840
They could be a great windows candidate switcher.

817
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,260
Here's the reality.

818
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,200
And I've had a lot of open SUSE experience over the years and I have never not had at

819
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,440
least one major groundbreaking issue with every single solitary installation I've ever

820
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
had.

821
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
On their own software?

822
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,800
Always, always, always something breaks.

823
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
It just happens.

824
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,160
I mean, it happens for everybody.

825
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,800
I'm just saying from my own experience.

826
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,800
So when I'm going to then experience that and then recommend it to somebody, it's kind

827
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,520
of like, it's really pretty.

828
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
I like it.

829
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,680
I love what they do with a lot of their features and stuff, but at the end of the day, it's

830
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,680
an RPM distro.

831
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,680
I'm sorry.

832
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,680
I just can't.

833
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,680
I agree with you, Matt.

834
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,680
I agree.

835
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,680
Yeah.

836
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,520
The only issue I've ever had with is the DILD service failing every once in a while.

837
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,800
That's a different thing though.

838
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,400
I've had open SUSE break more often than Arch.

839
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
I don't know how it's that.

840
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,400
Seriously.

841
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,280
I mean, I'm willing to work at it, but my God, it's like, I remember just basic sound

842
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,280
issues.

843
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,280
I was finally like, screw this.

844
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,280
I'm done.

845
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,280
I've had a few things where open SUSE is great, but there are certain aspects that it's kind

846
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,160
of falls behind because they push a lot of interesting ideas and they're innovative.

847
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,160
Some of them are awesome.

848
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
The SUSE studio is awesome.

849
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
The DILD service is awesome.

850
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,160
Yeah.

851
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,160
DILD is awesome.

852
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,160
I like DILD.

853
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,160
I have no problem with that at all.

854
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,400
One of the things they have a lot of awesome ideas, but they have some fundamental issues

855
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,600
that they just don't address.

856
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,280
I've never been to an issue that I've never been able to solve, ever.

857
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,160
Well, you haven't been able to solve.

858
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,240
That's based on individual user experience.

859
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,100
That doesn't mean that everyone around you is also having that experience as well.

860
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,560
I think everybody's mileage is going to vary.

861
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,000
I definitely give you all the benefit of the doubt that you are as capable as I am.

862
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,880
That's very gentlemanly of you, sir.

863
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:06,840
But also, in KDE, you can simply right-click that menu and get a nice XP-looking menu.

864
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,480
It doesn't have to be the Lancelot paneling menu.

865
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,480
It can be XP-ish.

866
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,480
Yeah, sure.

867
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,480
Yeah.

868
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,480
Yeah, but it's still KDE, though.

869
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,600
KDE is a pretty big barrier if you don't know what you're doing.

870
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,520
I tried showing that to people, and they're just like, why the hell would I use that?

871
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,120
You know, whatever the hell they call that.

872
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,120
Oh, activities?

873
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,120
Activities, yeah.

874
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,360
It's like, it's a cool idea if you're really geeky.

875
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,360
It's awesome.

876
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,360
Yeah, but I've tried it.

877
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,280
Anyone else that's actually ever been outside?

878
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,280
It's not.

879
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,280
Some use it.

880
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,280
So I'm like, no.

881
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,040
I've seen people use workspaces when I just introduced them, and then they're like, oh,

882
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,040
that's awesome.

883
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,040
And they'll jump to it.

884
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,300
But I think it goes back to the whole, there's so many options and so many things that we

885
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:50,360
just have to say, here's what the easiest thing to do if we can't talk to them, and

886
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,840
that might be Ubuntu.

887
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,580
And then they even turned off workspaces by default, I'm pretty sure, unfortunately, before.

888
00:45:55,580 --> 00:46:02,060
So there's certain things that if, like, Ubuntu might be just like, we should, if you can't,

889
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,280
you know, you can't help them out, you can't find out what it might fit them perfectly,

890
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,100
like a YouTube video, it could be Ubuntu.

891
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:13,080
That might be the best option, because you got the upgradability, you got the ease of

892
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,080
use.

893
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,080
You got the Google tools.

894
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,000
Well, Crossroads wants to disagree with you.

895
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,060
Crossroads, what do you think?

896
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:23,080
You think the software at opensusa.org and KD and Yast, specifically maybe Yast, do you

897
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,680
think that's the advantage for the Windows switcher?

898
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:32,680
Well, I mean, yeah, Yast is much like the Windows control panel.

899
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:43,320
And software.opensusa.org appeals to the Windows users being used to searching it on the web

900
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,240
and then being able to install it just like a.exe file.

901
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,960
Yeah, but I would argue that a lot of people would ignore the control panel completely,

902
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,780
like an average user would just never touch the control panel.

903
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,200
But I think what I've been trying to get to and what I've been trying to wrap my brain

904
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:03,480
around on this whole discussion is, I think, you know, Ubuntu has had a pretty bumpy road

905
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:10,120
in terms of PR and community perception.

906
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,640
And so my question was, as I'm looking at the 14.04 release, right, I'm looking at this

907
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:21,880
and I'm thinking, how relevant is Ubuntu's role today in the general Linux desktop and

908
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,560
those people coming to Linux?

909
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,640
And to me, what I'm hearing from you guys is that it is just as relevant today as it

910
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,680
was the day 12.04 was released.

911
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,680
If not more so.

912
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,680
Yeah.

913
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,680
I really, I really feel that way.

914
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,680
And even though I might personally...

915
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,680
I don't even use it on a daily basis.

916
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,680
Right, exactly.

917
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,400
Like even though I personally am really glad I'm on Arch today because I have GNOME 3.12

918
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:49,160
and that makes me a happy boy, I can't help but acknowledge the still significant role

919
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,000
that Ubuntu plays in its piece.

920
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,360
And maybe you could still argue that it's, for the desktop user, the most significant

921
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,360
role.

922
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,360
Probably.

923
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,640
I think another thing, like, I just went to the, I mean, I know this is just Reddit,

924
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,640
but I went to the Linux subreddit.

925
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:08,560
It's got a list of the most popular distributions in it and I opened the subreddits related

926
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,800
to each specific distribution.

927
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,800
I just grabbed some.

928
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:18,760
And if you look at the numbers, Debian has 7,000 readers, Fedora is 4,000, SUSE is 1,000,

929
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,240
elementary is 2,000, and Mint is 5,000.

930
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:31,840
And then Ubuntu is, sorry, yeah, sorry, Mint is 5,000, and then Ubuntu is 45,000.

931
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:40,200
And that, it definitely makes a big difference when you can go anywhere and you don't even

932
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,400
have to be in a Linux-related context.

933
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,440
Like you could be on some forum, like I was on HarlowCP the other day on their forum,

934
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,720
and somebody had said something about, oh, you know, I was trying to do this or that

935
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,480
or whatever in Linux and it didn't work.

936
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,880
And some other guy posted, oh, you should try apt-get, da-da-da-da, and that worked

937
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,280
for him because of the fact that they were both on Ubuntu.

938
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,280
Yeah.

939
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,060
They, I mean, of course it's not necessarily a good thing that people think Ubuntu is Linux,

940
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,060
as we know.

941
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,060
Right.

942
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,440
But the fact of the matter is that people do.

943
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,280
And so if they're on a completely different forum, a completely, you know, they can be

944
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,400
on a forum about CAS or something and mention they're on Linux, the other person who responds

945
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,160
to them is likely also going to be running Ubuntu.

946
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,160
And look at that.

947
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,160
And they might even assume that they're running Ubuntu.

948
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,080
Look at that, the top of the Ubuntu subreddit.

949
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,680
Windows XP refugees start here, right?

950
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,960
I mean, that's exactly the kind of landing pad I've been talking about.

951
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,120
I mean, the subreddit for Ubuntu actually has more users than Linux, doesn't it?

952
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,120
All the Linux subreddits.

953
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,120
I mean, like the Linux subreddit itself.

954
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,120
Yeah.

955
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,120
No, no.

956
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,120
45,000.

957
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,120
No, it has 100.

958
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,120
Yeah.

959
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,120
42.

960
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,120
42.

961
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,120
Yeah.

962
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,120
No, the Linux one, the Linux subreddit is much more popular.

963
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,120
Ubuntu subreddit is actually pretty friendly.

964
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,120
I mean, even if they disagree with you, they're not all ripping on you.

965
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,120
Yeah.

966
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,120
Yeah.

967
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,120
I'm not too big a fan.

968
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:01,400
So I think what's interesting is, so our email area, and I agree, is does that make Ubuntu

969
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,880
the ultimate distro that shames all others?

970
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,880
No.

971
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,960
But it makes it a hell of a damn good choice for switchers.

972
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,760
And people just need to get over themselves, stop rooting for the underdog in all cases,

973
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,720
run the underdog yourself, let them run Ubuntu for a while, let them get used to the terms,

974
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,720
let them get used to the command line if they need to, let them get used to the ecosystem,

975
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,920
and then let them expand out.

976
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,080
It doesn't diminish the other distributions, it just means that perhaps those aren't the

977
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,840
best landing spots when they're switching.

978
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,360
And that's, I think that's what, does anybody disagree with that?

979
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,400
I would say that it's good, it's probably the best landing spot for someone you can't

980
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,400
help.

981
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,160
But if it's somebody who you can help, it might not be, because you can put them out

982
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,020
to, if there's an issue, they would come to you anyway.

983
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:46,760
And for example, like Bodhi, or Bodhi, I don't know, that would be a good distro for someone

984
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:54,240
who has a low resource hardware, because then they don't have to worry about the, you know.

985
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,240
The overhead of Unity.

986
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,240
Yeah, the overhead.

987
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,560
But that's the same thing with Lubuntu and stuff.

988
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,320
That have actual other desktops that are still Ubuntu-based anyway, if you put lbuntu on

989
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,320
it, it'll run.

990
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,320
Well Bodhi's Ubuntu-based.

991
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,320
Yeah.

992
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,320
Oh, okay.

993
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,440
Well technically, Bodhi's, I think it was like, there's like three different levels.

994
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,040
It was based on something else, which was also based on Ubuntu, so technically, yeah.

995
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:21,040
So what would be the advantage between that and Sail, like some of the other desktop options

996
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,040
for Ubuntu?

997
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,040
It's Enlightenment, I suppose?

998
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,040
I think it's just Enlightenment.

999
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,040
Yeah.

1000
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,040
Enlightenment.

1001
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,040
Okay, that's good.

1002
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,040
Yeah, I mean it's fun.

1003
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,560
Enlightenment runs pretty great on, that was the point of the article, was that Enlightenment

1004
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,160
runs pretty good on lower-end hardware.

1005
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,040
Which you're gonna have from an XP to a switcher.

1006
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,040
Yeah, exactly.

1007
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,040
Yeah.

1008
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,320
There's a lot of stuff in Enlightenment and LXDE and stuff like that, but I think Enlightenment

1009
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,960
doesn't actually have an official flavor.

1010
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,000
So Bodhi's the only one that I know of that is officially, like their main focus is Enlightenment.

1011
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,600
See, I'm on board with Crossroads.

1012
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,920
I think people get a new machine and they want to just love the hell out of it.

1013
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,920
What do you think, Crossroads?

1014
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,920
Is it the eye candy?

1015
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,200
Is it the more advanced features?

1016
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,040
What is it that's gonna make people switch?

1017
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,040
Crossroads.

1018
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:04,520
It's GNOME 3, KDE, GNOME 3, KDE, and Unity are pretty, and that's, at least for kids

1019
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,540
my age, is what is going to drive them towards Linux.

1020
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:12,480
When they see my computer, and I'm running GNOME 3 right now, they're like, whoa, that

1021
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,480
looks so cool.

1022
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,480
How can I do that?

1023
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,280
How can you do that with your computer?

1024
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,480
It's things like, I mean, XFCE is great and it's customizable and I love it, but it's

1025
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,600
not what's going to push people to Linux.

1026
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,600
Yeah.

1027
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,400
Yeah, and then of course, it's like the point you've been making is that for different folks,

1028
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,440
some people will want the slower stuff or the more resource-friendly.

1029
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,480
Okay, I want to put this topic to bed.

1030
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,520
I feel like we've kind of reached a consensus, and I feel like I've kind of reached a good

1031
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,520
understanding.

1032
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,040
We don't have a lot of time left in the show, so I'm just going to point people over to

1033
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,040
the show notes.

1034
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,400
It's just, and it's probably good because I've probably talked about it too much recently,

1035
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:53,080
but you know, this Heartbleed vulnerability has just been getting so much coverage, and

1036
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:58,520
it seems like the coverage is now sort of pivoted from discussing the technical details

1037
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,360
and how disastrous it is to playing a little bit of the blame game, and you're seeing a

1038
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,880
lot of articles crop up on the web right now.

1039
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,320
Articles that kind of cast open source and the open source development model in a bad

1040
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,320
light.

1041
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,740
We talked a little bit about some of that on Sunday.

1042
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:19,720
Like here's one on ZDNet from Larry Seltzer, he says, open source does not provide any

1043
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:24,240
meaningful inherent security benefit for OpenSSL, and it may actually discourage some important

1044
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,040
testing techniques.

1045
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:33,320
So panhandling is not a good business model for important software like OpenSSL.

1046
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:38,200
And of course he's framing it in a very adversarial way, and he's painting it in the most light

1047
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,360
possible, and you're seeing a lot of these crop up.

1048
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,160
I've got a collection of them in the show notes, and I wanted to say, I guess what my

1049
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,860
point was in all of this, and I won't lean on this too much because I know we've talked

1050
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:53,660
about this before, but I think people need to focus on with this whole Heartbleed thing

1051
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:57,840
is that while maybe open source is getting dragged through the mud on this, we should

1052
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:02,880
maybe be focusing on the whole turnaround for the patch time, like how rapidly the response

1053
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,480
was, and the fact that we now have the ability to audit for these kinds of things in the

1054
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,480
future.

1055
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,000
And maybe they'll pop up, maybe they won't, right?

1056
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,400
But now we can look.

1057
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,360
Well, I got two words for everyone, especially the guy that wrote that article, it's called

1058
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:22,520
Blaster Worm, and it's called DMVs, hospitals, police stations, pretty much any civic entity.

1059
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,480
It was like literally the apocalypse when it happened.

1060
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,560
A month later, everybody was fine, Microsoft's great, we love Microsoft.

1061
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:37,360
So if these same idiots that are writing this crap can forgive a company that allowed something

1062
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:42,600
that, and keep in mind, when that happened, the patch was available.

1063
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,960
That's how pathetic this was.

1064
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:49,960
So things happen, but I think blaming licensing over it is just silly, I really do.

1065
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:55,480
Yeah, and I'll run, we'll leave it at this, because I've got to go do some work on the

1066
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,480
studio.

1067
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,040
So we can't talk about it too much, and I've probably over-talked it anyways, it's stayed,

1068
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:04,040
it's welcome, but if you would like to read some of those articles, and think about it

1069
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,760
yourself, I'll have links in the show notes.

1070
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,760
Look, we'd love to hear from you, this show, a huge portion of the show runs on your feedback

1071
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:15,800
and your involvement, and if you can't join us live over at jblive.tv Tuesdays on a 2

1072
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,840
PM Pacific, and we also would love to hear from you if you can't join us live, just go

1073
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,240

Matt, get your Ubuntu 14.04 ready, our review on Sunday, I'll see you then.

1076
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,680
Sounds good, see you then.

1077
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,280
Alright everyone, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged, see

1078
00:55:35,280 --> 00:56:01,840
you right back here, next Tuesday!
