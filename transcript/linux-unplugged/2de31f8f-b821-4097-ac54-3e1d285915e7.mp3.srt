1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
This didn't make it into the show, it's just not really on theme this week, but I think, Brent, you'd really appreciate this.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:16,000
The SATA hat, and there's a couple of these out there for the Raspberry Pi or the Rock Pi, with varying degrees of success, but there's a new one out there

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that lets you put a whole stack of disks. Look at this thing.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,500
Up to four SATA disk drives connected to this hat that then connects to the Raspberry Pi 4.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,500
And they're starting around $35. I don't know, can't vouch for it.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,000
One thing I'm worried about is power. That's a heck of a lot of power, right?

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,500
I was thinking this is going to be like an e-serial ATA, like the external version, where the drive's powered by something else and you're just making a connection.

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:51,000
That would probably be a lot easier and much smaller and much better, but this thing is like a drive, like it's a toaster right onto this, right?

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,500
Yeah, although on the bottom side, they do have a Molex power connector right there, and there is also a USB-A port.

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
So now you need a power supply beside your Pi?

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Yeah. Yeah, you will need a standard external ATX power supply, and it'll need to be at least 60 watts if you're going to do all four drives.

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:15,500
That's what's great about this, especially when you look at, they've got a photo here, and we'll have a link in the show notes, set up with 3.5 inch drives, plus you got your power supply.

13
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,000
Like, what are you saving in space? You still need a whole ATX case for this thing.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,500
And if you're going to sandwich all those drives together, I think they recommend a fan, too.

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Oh no.

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
So you've basically, at this point, just built the next ATX PC?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But slower.

18
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Hello friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris.

19
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
My name is Wes.

20
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,500
And my name is Brent.

21
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Hey guys, well guess what? Coming up on this week's episode, I've been wondering if we're witnessing the development of two kinds of Linux systems.

22
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:07,500
One that's for tinkers and enthusiasts, and one that's built to be absolutely bulletproof, but you have to totally change the way you've been using Linux.

23
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,500
But just how practical are these systems, and what are their limitations for real users?

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,500
So the three of us try switching our workflows over to Silverblue. We'll explain why.

25
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,500
We'll explain how it went for each of us, good and bad.

26
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,500
And then I'll talk about why maybe I see a bit of a fork in the world of Linux coming up.

27
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,500
It's not like it's an overnight thing. It's not like it's happening right away.

28
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,500
But slowly but surely, there does seem to be two different paths forward.

29
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:48,500
I think latpacks play into this, and snap packages, and systemd, and containers. They're all kind of coming together to create a new trajectory for a new kind of base operating system.

30
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:55,500
It's going to completely change the way you interact with your Linux system as a desktop user or as a server once it lands.

31
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
That's what we're going to be looking at, you know, no bigs.

32
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
No big deal.

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Are you talking about NICs again? This feels familiar.

34
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Hey, hey, I didn't say it.

35
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Oh, no, but we'll get there. But before we go any further, we've got to say time-appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

36
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Hello, Mumble Room. Welcome in, everybody.

37
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Hello.

38
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Good evening, Cody.

39
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Hey, Brent. And last but not least, hey, Wes.

40
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Hello. I love it because I feel like we've got more and more folks in the quiet listening just getting that high-quality, low-latency audio feed now.

41
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
That's a special crew.

42
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:35,500
And what I think is fantastic about that is they could always pop down into on-air if they needed to or like in the post show or if like in the future they want to join us for an office hours or Linux Unplugged and they do want to join us in on-air, they're all set up.

43
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
That's pretty great.

44
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Details at Linux Unplugged dot com slash Mumble if you'd like to participate in our virtual lug.

45
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,500
And I also want to say a big good morning over to TailScale.

46
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
This is a tool you've got to try.

47
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,500
TailScale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

48
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
We love it. We use it.

49
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
It'll change the way you work.

50
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,500
It's I love it so much.

51
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
I have virtual machines.

52
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
I have VPSs.

53
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
I have physical machines.

54
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,500
I have mobile devices on TailScale.

55
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
So go say good morning to the folks over at TailScale.

56
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Try it for yourself on 20 devices for free at TailScale dot com.

57
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Maybe let them know Linux Unplugged sent you.

58
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,500
All right. And then one little other bit of deets that we're just going to be covering at the top of the show for a little bit as these events are super close.

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Just a few days away at this point, the London meetup is nigh very, very close.

60
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Meetup dot com slash Jupiter broadcasting for all of this.

61
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,500
We're only feeling a little bit of FOMO out here on the West Coast.

62
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,500
There's there's going to be like one hundred and fifty people at that meetup, I think.

63
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
I don't know for sure.

64
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,500
I think having it outside was a bit of brilliance.

65
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
That was a good idea because you're going to need the space.

66
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
And then are we ready to announce this, do you think?

67
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,500
How are you feeling? You good?

68
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I mean, I assume you looked at the I looked at it.

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I made a couple of tweets. If it's Chris Fisher approved, then who am I to object?

70
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,500
He was waiting to see if it was Westpain approved.

71
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
I guess we'll just have to blame brand if it doesn't go well.

72
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Yeah, I don't even know what this is.

73
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Our JPL lottery is up and live at Linux Unplugged dot com slash JPL.

74
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
So we have a West Coast road tour coming up.

75
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Long story short, at the end of that road tour, we're going to be at JPL and we're going to get a special tour down at the Jet Propulsion Lab.

76
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,500
And we can bring about 15 of our friends.

77
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,500
So what we're going to do is ask that you put your name into a virtual hat.

78
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,500
We have a submission form that we have running on a next cloud instance of ours that we use for this stuff.

79
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,500
And then we'll write like a little bot like West is going to run like a little Python script or something.

80
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,500
You know, he does how he does. You know him.

81
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,500
And we'll pull a list of names and a list of backup names in case somebody can't make it.

82
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:49,500
But we do ask that if you do fill out the form, please only fill it out if you are in the area and can actually make it to the event because there are just so few slots available.

83
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,500
It's fine if you got to travel to be there, but you have to be able to make it.

84
00:05:53,500 --> 00:06:08,500
And so we will probably run that as the event gets closer and then we'll get everybody notified so that way they can make the travel plans to Linux unplugged dot com slash JPL for the lottery to get into the JPL tour.

85
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:19,500
And again, if you're just on the West Coast between Seattle and Pasadena and you'd like to do a meetup, we have a whole bunch scheduled and all the details are at meetup dot com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

86
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,500
All that's over there. There's a lot going on.

87
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,500
I feel like we should we should start like collaborating and planning on our end a little bit on the trip eats very much.

88
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,500
So we did get a team Airbnb. So that's all settled and figured out.

89
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,500
We got to like dial in like when Brent gets here before the trip because we got the studio projects we got to do.

90
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,500
That's true. And maybe just learning this. But, you know, he didn't object. I think we got him. That's how it goes.

91
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:50,500
We got a whole lot of stuff to plan, really. There's still so much, but it's going to be really my understanding is we're still going to make some shows during these events.

92
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,500
So we got to think about that probably. It's going to be really good, actually.

93
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,500
So to wrap all of this up again, the London meetup is August 5th, just a few days away as we record.

94
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:15,500
And then the meetup at JPL will be September 29th. And there's a series of meetups before that and after that. All of that's a meetup dot com slash Jupiter broadcasting and the JPL tour lottery is at Linux on plug dot com slash JPL.

95
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,500
We also, of course, have links in the show notes.

96
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Let's talk about this turning point that I think Linux could be at.

97
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:29,500
And it's again, I don't think we're rushing into it at a breakneck pace. I don't think everything's going to change overnight.

98
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,500
But I would be willing to go on the record, which I'm about to do right now.

99
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,500
The nature of the show, I'd say in 10 years, we're going to be in a much different space.

100
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,500
And this stuff's going to be a lot more ironed out, perhaps a lot more standard.

101
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,500
You're seeing it already. I'm talking about the two kinds of Linux that are out there now.

102
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:56,500
There's the old school kind that lets you do anything you want. These are your Ubuntu desktops, your Linux Mint desktop, your Manjeros.

103
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
You just, you know, all those types of desktops, you just have full access.

104
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,500
If you're a root user or whatever, you can do anything to the system. You can install anything anywhere.

105
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,500
It's great for tinkers and we've made it work really great as a desktop and server operating system.

106
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,500
That's one of the traditional Linux.

107
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,500
And now there's also and they've been around for a while, like in the case of Nix, a decade, and there's many others.

108
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,500
And Chrome OS is technically this type of Linux. Endless OS is technically this type of Linux.

109
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,500
And Silverblue is this type of Linux. And these are your immutable Linux's.

110
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,500
The ones where they're solidly reproducible and you can roll back if something goes wrong.

111
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,500
If you do an update and a botch is your favorite application, you roll back.

112
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,500
If you think of it more as like it's it's an operating system that rides almost on top of Git, only it's your file system.

113
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,500
And it's being managed with check ins and check outs and that type of stuff.

114
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:55,500
It's a completely different approach. And in these scenarios, as an end user, you sometimes don't get access to a typical package manager.

115
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,500
You're not supposed to write to that directory. You know, you maybe maybe can't do anything outside your home directory at all.

116
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,500
And if you want to add an application, you're really only supposed to do it through Flatpak.

117
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,500
That type of scenario where you can't just go in there and tweak something.

118
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Or if you want to have 32 bit libraries, you don't just app get install the 32 bit library packages.

119
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,500
It's a much more intentional where you have to really think about the modifications and changes you're going to make.

120
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:27,500
But the end result is the system's a rock. You turn it on. As long as your hardware is functional, you know your Linux operating system is functional.

121
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,500
It kind of is more like an appliance. And I think that's why you've seen this type of operating system design.

122
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Really just take over mobile and appliance devices completely.

123
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,500
This is pretty much how all mobile devices are done is this sort of design is how iOS works.

124
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,500
It's how Android works. And now we're getting to the point where we've taken lessons from containers.

125
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,500
We've really kind of looked at all the different options out there. We know about get we know about these tools.

126
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,500
And how would you build a desktop around this? And could you make a workstation OS out of it?

127
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Could we use it? Could we use it as a studio OS? Could it work on a laptop that you want to game?

128
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Could it be great for Brent's HP Dev1? Would it work for years?

129
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
These are the kind of questions that we had going into trying something like Fedora Silverblue.

130
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:21,500
And Silverblue really felt like a great chance for us to try one of the distributions that's the furthest out ahead in this area for the desktop experience.

131
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,500
The idea being that you deploy this kind of system and then you're always going to get the desktop you expect.

132
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:37,500
You got a problem. You roll it back. There are much more modern, much more advanced, much more capable package manager system that makes things like apt look really old.

133
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,500
In fact, George Castro has a great tweet where he went and did the math on this one.

134
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:51,500
And this is so like. I don't know. It's kind of not surprising to me, but I think the listeners are going to are going to probably think that I've never had a problem.

135
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,500
But he says I went and ran a query on 11 years over at I think it was Stack Exchange or something like that.

136
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Sort of then by view count looked counted up all the problems users ran into and then looked at the top 200.

137
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:12,500
And they all basically sort out to essentially be package manager related issues or installing software on Linux.

138
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,500
I'll have a link in the show notes. There's a spreadsheet that he put out.

139
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:23,500
And when you look at like the top problems that people have been asking questions about in trying to fix on Linux.

140
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:32,500
It's dominated by package manager problems, package managers breaking packages, not installing, not knowing how to somebody trying to install a tar file.

141
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:39,500
I don't want to hit this point too hard, but I think all of us on the show have like these things are starting to show their age, especially apt.

142
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,500
And I don't mean I love apt, but yeah, right. I mean, it doesn't it hasn't seen that much love.

143
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,500
We've kind of got the new right. We've got the new front end bits, the apt stuff, which is nice.

144
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Appreciate it. It's, you know, but mostly targeted at us humans and then didn't seem like it really fixed up much of the underlying plumbing per se.

145
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,500
It feels so slow to compare to some of these newer tools. But that's an aside.

146
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,500
It does make me think, too, when you're talking about just, you know, Georgia's tweet there.

147
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,500
It's almost as if at least for how computing has evolved and like who's using computers, how computers have spread.

148
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:19,500
If you think about like just how that's changed since some of these package managers were first introduced, maybe it's the wrong abstraction to too high.

149
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:29,500
You know, it might work well for us because we are OK with all the nitty gritty of putting our system together that way, but not usually what most other folks want to be doing.

150
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:39,500
I agree. I have thought for a while it seems like these systems that we have today, especially the Debian based systems and the Red Hat based systems were built for system administrators.

151
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Who are managing the software. They might not even have an Internet connection.

152
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Maybe they only have a LAN and they have local packages on their LAN and they are managing all of it.

153
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Where Silverblue and Nix feel like it's more of a centrally managed idea.

154
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,500
You deploy it and then you just redeploy and redeploy and redeploy.

155
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,500
I think the end result sort of speaks for itself in terms of reliability.

156
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,500
But let's talk about actually using Silverblue for a little bit. I think, you know, that's the idea of why we want to try this.

157
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,500
First of all, Silverblue lives and dies on its flat hub access.

158
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Like you really are going to be installing everything as a flat pack for the most part.

159
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,500
You can do RPM OS tree and you can install packages as a layer into your Silverblue system.

160
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
But ideally you want to use flat packs. And so that means flat hub.

161
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:38,500
And the problem is, and I believe they're going to fix this in 37, but currently as it ships in 36, flat hub in Fedora is filtered.

162
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,500
So guess what? Chrome doesn't show up. And some of the things that I wanted just weren't even available.

163
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,500
And that is frustrating when this is supposed to be how I get access to software.

164
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:55,500
And it felt Apple like, you know, like how Apple would control the App Store experience and lock it down.

165
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
So that way I don't get the wrong thing or something like that.

166
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,500
And that's not what I want for my workstation OS.

167
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
So I'm glad to see that's on the list of things to fix.

168
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,500
I think it might be more like 38 now, if what I remember last hearing.

169
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
But yeah, right. It's going to get fixed.

170
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:17,500
And it's not a huge deal for us because you just run, you know, whatever, enable flat hub and then you're off to the races for the most part.

171
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Right. But if you're thinking about a system that's getting shipped ideally in a state that you're not going to be doing that much

172
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,500
configuration on customization on besides just this sort of, you know, oh, I need these things right now.

173
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
That's not great.

174
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Once I did enable the rest of flat hub, which, you know, like you said, takes 30 seconds.

175
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,500
The instructions are super easy to find on the flat out website.

176
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,500
True. Yeah. That part is well documented at this point, which is nice.

177
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:52,500
I could see this if you wanted to, if you liked this idea of an immutable Linux that has snapshots that is very intentionally controlled.

178
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
I think I could be great for studio production.

179
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,500
I think it'd be great for a work environment. I think it'd be great for like a terminal server environment.

180
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,500
It's funny, though, in a lot of ways. And I'm curious to know if you guys felt this way.

181
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Silver blue would be a lot easier if it was the Linux you started with.

182
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,500
If this was just your first experience with Linux, it would make sense because this is honestly how Mac OS works now.

183
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Mac OS is a read only file system now.

184
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,500
And when you say like drag and drop an application into the application folder, that's an overlay.

185
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,500
That's not actually writing to the application folder. That's a read only directory.

186
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,500
And then your home director is the only place that's actually read writable.

187
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:35,500
And then they have an overlay area. And so if you're used to these concepts and you sat down and you use this as your first Linux, this wouldn't seem strange to you.

188
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:44,500
This would seem totally fine. The only downside I would definitely absolutely know you'd run into is all the guides online for everything.

189
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:50,500
I assume that you have access to your full system and there's very little silver blue specific documentation.

190
00:15:50,500 --> 00:16:03,500
I suppose that is a benefit. It just makes me think of, you know, nautical folks rightfully complaining of like, yeah, your upgrade didn't go well because you followed half a dozen guides that made you make random changes to your system that you didn't understand.

191
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,500
So, you know, you're right. There's not a lot of help for you, but perhaps it prevents some from making a mistake.

192
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
I guess that's got to be part of the rationale here.

193
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Things are great when they're packaged. If there's an RPM OS tree you can install or if there's a flat pack you can install, things are great.

194
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,500
When they're not available like that, you resort pretty quickly to just running binaries out of your home directory.

195
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:33,500
And my beloved tail scale was like this. Tail scale, which I have baked into every Nix I deploy, is got tail scale.

196
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
It's just like one of the first things you figured out.

197
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Totally was. And with silver blue, I mean, I patched it together. I got it working.

198
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,500
I downloaded the tail scale binaries, which they do make as a tar model that you can just go get.

199
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:52,500
And I deployed that on like a bin folder. And then they have a little service you start and then they have a little user space demon you can run.

200
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,500
And then I went and got the gnome extension that connects to all of that. So I can actually manage it pretty well.

201
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,500
It's basic. You know, it's not integrated.

202
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:08,500
And I don't know if it's actually super straightforward or not to create a new system, be unified on silver blue and add a new service because I couldn't figure out how to make it work.

203
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
And so I just ended up running it manually.

204
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Everything like that, like little edge case softwares are just a little bit harder on silver blue.

205
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,500
But if there's a package, if there's a flat pack for it, the experience is so smooth, you wouldn't even know what's going on.

206
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,500
And by the end of my experience, I had absolutely everything running.

207
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,500
I had to have flat seal installed because like things like element needed some additional privileges or else it would crash.

208
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,500
But flat seal makes it so easy to modify the permissions for flat packs.

209
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Got all your flat pack apps listed there, all of their capabilities, you know, and you can just check on, check off.

210
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
And it really feels like a solid system.

211
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
And I got old DOS games going.

212
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,500
I got I got a whole bunch old retro DOS games.

213
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
I mean, just tons of stuff working.

214
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Wine was working. I have steam working.

215
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,500
I got several steam games downloaded and installed on that thing.

216
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,500
And then I was also like once I got going, I also started having a lot of fun with things like toolbox.

217
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
Of course, you know, we've talked about toolbox before.

218
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Oh, yeah. And this is just such a cool little idea.

219
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,500
It's it's it's kind of become even bigger than the last time I used it.

220
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:20,500
But toolbox lets you quickly spin up like by default of fedora 36 environment that you can work in inside a terminal.

221
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,500
And then you got DNF, you got everything you can, you know, you can install whatever you want inside this environment.

222
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,500
And it really cleverly mounts your home directory.

223
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:33,500
And so it's all really it looks like you're on your local box, but you're running inside a container OS environment.

224
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,500
And you can actually deploy Ubuntu and Arch.

225
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,500
And there's all kinds of suces packaged up for this thing because they're just they're just containers.

226
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,500
It's using all that great technology, the podman type stuff that we've got at the bones of.

227
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Right. And toolbox can all just kind of put it together into a nice little experience.

228
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,500
And there's a couple of like it's like boxy boxes or something.

229
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
I can't remember in the in the software that you can install.

230
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
That's a terminal that's just dedicated for this.

231
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,500
I open up my terminal and I'm in a special environment and I will link to distro box in the show notes.

232
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Which let's which is a tool that lets you do this on any distro.

233
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
So you don't have to be on silver blue or you have to be on fedora.

234
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:15,500
You can be on any distro and install distro box and they get to run these different containers kind of like WSL where you can have a bunch of different distros in a in a window.

235
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
So that's a distro box link in the show notes.

236
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:24,500
You start doing stuff like that with silver blue and then, you know, you're on this super solid base.

237
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
I started to really get into it towards the end.

238
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,500
It took me a while to get over the fact that it's not Nix and that it's definitely very desktop focused and all that kind of stuff.

239
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:42,500
But. Yeah, man, like I don't know if it could fully replace all my all my systems, but I put it on the dev one and everything worked.

240
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,500
And that's a big part of it. It's a whole open source graphic stack. It's everything worked.

241
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
It is a very solid experience.

242
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:56,500
So my intention is to keep it on there for as long as I can and see if I can go through an upgrade cycle and see what that's like, because I think I want to keep it as my daily driver.

243
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:06,500
I really liked it. And I think now it's let's keep going with this for a little bit longer and see if, you know, maybe this is my workstation OS for the studio, too.

244
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,500
We'll see. But in the end, it's a keeper, I think.

245
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:19,500
And I could see the appeal to keynote if you want the plasma version. I think it's a little bit on the fringe.

246
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:28,500
You're already you know, when you're using Fedora, you're already kind of like a little bit harder to find stuff, just a little bit harder to find guides and maybe a little bit harder to find software.

247
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,500
It's all getting so much better. And then you take on silver blue and it gets just like even a little bit harder than that.

248
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:41,500
So I don't think this is for average folks that just, you know, don't want a system they have to mess with, even though ironically, that's the goal of this thing.

249
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,500
I just don't know if it's user manageable yet, but I think ultimately it will be.

250
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Well, I think I think you hit it on the, you know, live or die with flat pack thing is I think it depends on what user you're talking about.

251
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Maybe LUP listeners? No. But like my mom, maybe. Yeah.

252
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Because I don't I don't want her downloading random RPMs or Deb from the Internet and installing them.

253
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Right. I want her to get the software from the store and know that it comes hopefully, you know, as a nice little flat pack and that kind of thing.

254
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,500
I keep having this feeling with silver blue where like the admin side of me, you know,

255
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,500
and I hear you like not, you know, struggling with some things and not being able to put more in a box or like messing things up in your toolbox and not on the system.

256
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Like, yeah, I like that. Like, don't let Chris touch stuff under slash user.

257
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:30,500
But then I want to touch those things. So I'm a little conflicted on like I can I would want to deploy this elsewhere.

258
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,500
I don't know how much yet. I want to deploy it for myself.

259
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Yeah, I think that's probably a lot of people are going to feel when you use it.

260
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,500
It's like, OK, this makes sense on a machine that's on the factory floor.

261
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:51,500
This makes sense maybe on a dedicated live stream machine or this makes sense on a work station that's in an office where you have a bunch of people who are just doing input work into like standard office.

262
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,500
We'd applications. I think it makes tons of sense in all those scenarios.

263
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,500
But if you know how to use Linux and you like to tinker with things, install things and all that, I just don't know.

264
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:09,500
I just don't know. But I guess we'll find out what you guys thought in just a moment.

265
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Linode dot com slash unplugged, go there to get one hundred dollars and 60 day credit on your new account.

266
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,500
And of course, it's a great way to support the show while getting yourself a little something special.

267
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Linode is really the Linux geeks cloud. Eleven data centers worldwide means there's something close to you, a customer, a client or your friends.

268
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,500
They've been doing this for nearly 19 years, so they have honed this thing in.

269
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:41,500
They have polished this thing until it shines. So go try something, go deploy something, go to take advantage of that one hundred dollars and see why we run everything on Linode.

270
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Stuff for our team, stuff for ourselves and stuff that is audience facing.

271
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Linode is always rolling out screaming fast new hardware like MVME drives, dedicated AMD epic CPUs.

272
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:59,500
You know, if you need to do a little audio and video transcoding in the cloud like we do, a dedicated CPU can make a big difference.

273
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Maybe you just want to run a game server. Again, a dedicated CPU can make a big difference.

274
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:08,500
And I hear from audience members who offload their machine learning to Linode's cloud.

275
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
How neat is that?

276
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,500
And I'm always super impressed by those of you who tell me how you use Kubernetes or Ansible or Terraform to manage your Ansible systems.

277
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:23,500
And of course, you know, I love their API. That makes it super quick and clean to get things spun up, to reboot a server, to take a snapshot before we do something crazy.

278
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:36,500
I'll even put the command line tool on my Linode box so that way I can initiate a snapshot from the interface when I'm logged in, like on, you know, the shell and get a snapshot on the node side before I do anything crazy.

279
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:45,500
You know, when I remember. But the tools are there. And the other thing that's really great is we've taken advantage of their object storage, their DDoS protection, their cloud firewalls.

280
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:54,500
I mean, you can really stack and mix and match as you like. And the best part is everything is really reasonably priced, 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there.

281
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:03,500
And they're not like these crazy, esoteric, unique options that are only really viable on one hyperscalers platform and they use their own language and everything.

282
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:11,500
It's not like that at all with Linode. These are standards. It's Linux. It's open source projects. These one click deployments, you can go look how they put them together.

283
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:17,500
It all makes sense. It's all reproducible. It's so clean. It's just the best place to run apps on Linux in the cloud.

284
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,500
That's why they're giving you a hundred bucks to try it, because they think if you really do try it, you're going to like it.

285
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:31,500
A hundred bucks. That's confidence right there. So go try it. Support the show. Learn yourself something. Try something. Experience something. Linode.com slash unplugged.

286
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:39,500
I think you're really going to like it. One more time. It's Linode.com slash unplugged.

287
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:47,500
You know, guys, I went a little crazy this week. I met Alex's and he's got all these toys. So I figured I'm going to put silver blue everywhere.

288
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:54,500
So I got three projects for you. The first one I did. So I didn't do as deep a dive, Chris, as you did.

289
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:01,500
So I appreciate your perspective on it, but I did, however, sort of touch silver blue in a bunch of different areas.

290
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:09,500
So the first one I did was just in a VM on this neon box that I have here using and it went perfectly fine.

291
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,500
I did watch a video quickly just to get a sense of silver blue.

292
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:23,500
And I think Chris, that what you mentioned before the break was spot on, just explaining sort of how it works and wrapping your head around how it's a different paradigm.

293
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:29,500
If you don't do that, you're going to be really lost trying to use this. But it seems fairly straightforward.

294
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:35,500
The install process was super smooth. I really appreciated how easy all of that was.

295
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:40,500
I did run into a small error in the software center that I'm sure they're aware of.

296
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Maybe we should check. Chris, I think you ran into this as well.

297
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:52,500
The software center is doing the background updates for you on the system, but the user experience is a little odd.

298
00:25:52,500 --> 00:26:01,500
Because it sort of does the downloads for the entire new image of silver blue when you first launch it.

299
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,500
But the message it gives you is like what you would expect if you're just updating like the package index.

300
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,500
And so it takes like, you know, I'm here with this amazing Internet connection.

301
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,500
It took like a full two minutes. And I think you had to wait quite a while as well.

302
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:23,500
Right. Yeah. And of course, the first thing like you do within a minute or two once you got a fresh install is you launch software because it's time to load some apps in there.

303
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,500
And yeah, I got a really wild air message. It was a little bit different than the message you got.

304
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,500
I think it was exactly the same kind of thing, though. Basically, it was still refreshing all of its metadata in the background.

305
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,500
It wasn't really that obvious. There may have been a spinner up in the left corner.

306
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Well, I did some investigating because I thought this is what's going on here.

307
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:58,500
I got to know more. And I figure if I was home, I would have just abandoned because had I been doing a bunch of downloads, which took two minutes here with like one of the best Internet connections I've ever used, I think at home it probably would have taken me like an hour or two or something.

308
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:08,500
So I'm glad I wasn't trying it back there. So I did some investigating and sort of because I was trying this in a VM, I could just wipe the system and try to get pretty darn easily.

309
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Ha, ha, ha. Done with you. Right. So I thought I'm going to start again and do some poking around.

310
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:24,500
So I was able to discern that it it downloads the whole fresh new image when you first launch Software Center.

311
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:30,500
And that actually is great because then you're you know, you go to update and it just says, oh, you're ready to go.

312
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:36,500
Just reboot. So I think the wording they could change it quickly to something more useful. But that was actually a nice experience.

313
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Exactly. Once it's done, it's a great experience. Yeah. Yeah. And then so as we do, I then thought, well, geez, I want to know how all this is working and get some more visuals.

314
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:55,500
So the RPM OS tree terminal command was actually super friendly, like just with the status. I don't know if you did some investigating.

315
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Yes. So RPM OS tree status just gives you like the various versions that are installed and it even gives you some of those layered packages that you may have installed that you mentioned that you install with RPM OS tree install.

316
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:14,500
Now, that is a discouraged way to install software. It's like an as an as needed way to do it.

317
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:21,500
But one of the examples they gave in their wonderful documentation was fish and West turned me on to fish recently and I've been really enjoying it.

318
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,500
And I was like, oh, they're basically saying that they want me to try this.

319
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,500
You see how I got the credit for fish, even though you've been talking about it for years.

320
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Next thing he's going to tell you, I tried this new text editor called Nano and I think it's pretty nice and elegant.

321
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:48,500
And so installing fish via the RPM OS tree was very interesting because it did things that you would never see with apt.

322
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,500
It shows you a few packages you need and then you install it. You could go. But this did like all sorts of crazy stuff.

323
00:28:53,500 --> 00:29:00,500
I suggest everybody goes and tries it. It's like I don't know what it's doing under the hood, but it was a fascinating experience and then totally worked.

324
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:06,500
It was great. So but you have to reboot to make that sort of it's kind of nixie in that way.

325
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,500
You have to reboot to make it apply, which is can be frustrating.

326
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:18,500
There is a live flag that I think became standard in 36 or I don't know the reboot thing. It's not really a big deal.

327
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:25,500
See, it bothers me a lot. Oh, does it? I just don't reboot very often. Yeah, I'm with Wes.

328
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:32,500
But I think if you want the benefits, then that's a necessity because of the way it's engineered.

329
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,500
I'm not that worried about restarting service. I'm not worried about the race.

330
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,500
I get those for some systems for sure, especially in like like remote manage systems.

331
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:47,500
But like. Really, I'm not running that many services on my desktop, and then if something does go wrong, that's when I'm happy to reboot.

332
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,500
But like I just I just unless it's a kernel update, I really don't reboot that. So, yeah, I get that. I get it.

333
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,500
I'm not opposed to it, but that was one of the things that took me the longest to adjust.

334
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:00,500
I just you know, I just decided I'm going to embrace the reboot lifestyle because the damn thing boots fast.

335
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:09,500
It does really it boots really fast. I was like, fine. But yeah, you're right. That is a thing you got to appreciate and understand is you're switching over to a live image, right?

336
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:16,500
You're switching over to that to that branch now. So you're booting into that environment that has that version of the packages and whatnot.

337
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,500
And the great thing is you can go back. But the kind of tradeoff that they have there is to switch over.

338
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:28,500
You're doing a reboot. Yeah, I think if you've joined us on the next challenge, that will not feel out of place.

339
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,500
I think that's kind of necessary for this kind of paradigm shift.

340
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:41,500
But it would be interesting, though, touching on next to see some like declarative configuration to avoid maybe as many reboots.

341
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Chris, I don't know. You set up all these crazy things. I don't know how many applications you installed.

342
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,500
Flatpak versus this layered packaging and how many reboots you did.

343
00:30:50,500 --> 00:31:04,500
I did very few layered packages just because to me it felt I don't know, like it felt like the right way to go is flat packs and with flat packs is I go to flat hub and I just open up like all of them that I want.

344
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,500
I just sit there and I just tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab.

345
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,500
And then I go and I I copy pasta all of like the names and they because they have the little install command below.

346
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:20,500
God bless. And I just copy that and I just paste, paste, paste, paste, paste, paste and then enter. And then it just installs all of them at once.

347
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,500
And it's glorious. And with the flat with the flat packs, you don't have to reboot or anything.

348
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:33,500
So I hit enter and it's done. And what's so nice now in modern versions of GNOME and and everything is everything's available right away.

349
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,500
The launchers are available in the search. It's indexed. So it's as soon as the apps installed, you can use it.

350
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:51,500
And so I went that way for a lot of things. But there's things on the command line. There's just system tools like I installed cockpit via RPM OS tree and just to play around and fish and those kinds of things I install via RPM OS tree.

351
00:31:51,500 --> 00:32:00,500
And so, you know, when I say when I do an RPM OS tree status, I do have several layers listed there now and feels gross, but I get I get by.

352
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:08,500
I found it really nice to have the option because, you know, when there's there are things that you just can't find in the flat pack offering.

353
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:15,500
For some reason, neo fetch wasn't in there, maybe because it has to touch a bunch of crazy things. It's nice to have that option for those of us who want to dig in a little deeper.

354
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:25,500
You know what I was surprised by? Perhaps this will make sense in a moment, but I was surprised that in Nix, I have a much harder time getting no extensions working.

355
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:35,500
And in Silverblue, I just go to the extensions website and I just install the extensions. Let's pause right here before we get to the Raspberry Pi journey that Brent went on, because I do want to hear about that.

356
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:43,500
And let's let Neil jump in and just kind of touch on some things that we've mentioned, because I know, Neil, you've got thoughts on who these types of systems are targeted for.

357
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
And there's probably some other things we've mentioned that you want to touch on.

358
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:57,500
My feeling about Silverblue and Kinoite and similar systems like this is that they tend to they tend to hit opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of users.

359
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:03,500
So, like, you're either going to have really simple users who don't really demand much from their systems who want to use this.

360
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Like I know, you know, someone throughout like grandma or whatever. Right. That's that's one side of it. But the other side of it is the people who what I like to call live in the container circus.

361
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:22,500
And they are super enthusiastic about, you know, the containerization of the world.

362
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:33,500
And, you know, they're willing to take all the downsides of operating in that world because they consider it the best method to deal with it.

363
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:40,500
So they consider, you know, in some respects, maybe the downsides are upsides for them and things of that nature.

364
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:54,500
But there's a lot of Linux users in the middle where this is probably not going to work super well because, you know, things like NeoFetch and Fish and whatever those the nature of those things, they're not easy to containerize.

365
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,500
Especially if you actually want to, like, plug them into your system and use them as part of the system.

366
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:11,500
Yes, our PMOS tree lets you layer them, but somewhat disingenuously, there is no straightforward method for you to know whether you're layering or not.

367
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,500
And within the graphical environment, you can't really see any of those things or work with it.

368
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,500
And it's it's pretty much command line only.

369
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,500
And that that's obviously a barrier for a large swath of users.

370
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:37,500
So where I see, aside from from those two, the if we step back a little bit further, the third potential target audience is managed systems.

371
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Because if you consider Silverblue and Kinoite as demonstrations of what you can do with RPMOS tree, then things start fitting a little bit better because then you can use it as an idea of like in a corporate environment.

372
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Maybe you have office workers and you need to make sure that they have XYZ software on all these machines.

373
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:04,500
And you want to make sure the configuration, the deployment is standardized and you want to be able to easily lock it down so that they can't do anything else.

374
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:29,500
Well, then you can produce your own OS tree using the RPMOS tree composing the core OS composition core OS assembler, which I think is the tool that's used for this and some other other RPMOS tree tooling, image creation processes, whatever, to create these OS trees to then feed into like Anaconda to pull them and mass deploy them to hundreds of systems.

375
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:38,500
And then they're chained to that and they update with that based on what the IT team wants.

376
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:48,500
This is essentially the Holy Grail for managed computers in a corporate environment because they don't need to worry about things like, oh, do we need GPOs or whatever?

377
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Do we need, you know, insert XYZ remote machine, you know, configuration tool or whatever, because they basically statically define it server side.

378
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:15,500
The biggest downside to RPMOS tree based systems or really a lot of these quote unquote immutable desktop platforms is that somebody else had to make the decisions for you unless you were able to build it yourself, assemble it yourself.

379
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:24,500
And so keeping that caveat in mind, I think it starts to make a lot more sense where you're going to likely see these become popular.

380
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,500
I can see that. I think that's where you're going to see more of it.

381
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:33,500
And like my personal feeling is like maybe we'll see it for like example Fedora Mobile.

382
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:40,500
I know that's definitely one example where we're probably going to see RPMOS tree become more of a thing.

383
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:46,500
I know that's, you know, in the KD SIG, we're thinking about it for the Fedora Mobile KD edition.

384
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
Maybe some other places will do it.

385
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:57,500
But like for the regular desktop, for most users, it gets a little awkward and it requires a lot of extra overhead.

386
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:09,500
And there hasn't been a ton of thought into how to make the developer experience for the not just the developer experience, but the user experience seamless for dealing with this.

387
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:17,500
So, for example, Steam as a flat pack has a major downside in that you can't use an external data drive.

388
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:29,500
I don't know about you, but I'm not putting all of my all of my steam downloads and running my steam games from my home directory because that's it's going to fill it up immensely.

389
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:35,500
Things like that are really difficult to deal with with the way things are right now and could be solvable.

390
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
That kind of thing, though, right? Right. It could be.

391
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,500
The biggest problem is that everyone's thinking of solving this by modifying the applications.

392
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:53,500
Like in both Windows and Mac, the way that they're containerizing applications involves the applications not changing and that the OS layer or the toolkit layers are changing to account for this instead.

393
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:58,500
But nobody's thinking of making these applications work just out of the gate.

394
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:12,500
And because they're making the changes at the application level, because GNOME wants to change all of GNOME for GNOME's reasons or KDPlasma wants to change its applications to adapt for these whatevers.

395
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,500
It's leaving out that other class of applications where you can't change anything.

396
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,500
And so you need some level of indirection below the application to do it meaningfully.

397
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Or they're never going to change just because the market share doesn't really.

398
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:30,500
The market share doesn't matter, right? Like so take, for example, all the portal stuff, right?

399
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Do you know the only portal that actually works without application modification is the file picker one?

400
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:41,500
That's the only one because that the portal implementation is done at the toolkit layer at GTK or Qt.

401
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,500
But if your application doesn't use either of those, you're you're out of luck.

402
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:52,500
You can't flat pack it. Those are the kinds of problems that are just not being solved.

403
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,500
I look at like where it's so endless. I look at where they're going.

404
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:03,500
And I think if you take that out on a time on a timeline that's like 10 years, maybe they start chipping away at some of these usability problems.

405
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:13,500
And then you get to the situation where your mint type Linux distros, your endless type Linux distros are sort of almost just by like steak and potatoes.

406
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Like all of them are OS tree based or some kind of system like that.

407
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:27,500
But then the systems that sys admins and maybe developers and people that consider themselves enthusiasts and power users, those are still traditional.

408
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Absolutely. Yeah. That is where I actually see this going.

409
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:45,500
I see this going in a realm of if you're in a corporate environment and you're rolling out things to like people with minimal training, then I hate immutable as a term for this because that's not a correct way to describe it.

410
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:51,500
But we're going to go with it. These immutable desktop platforms are very, very good choices.

411
00:39:51,500 --> 00:40:02,500
But once you start getting into people that need to like do things like at a level that kind of exceeds what this is able to handle, it gets difficult.

412
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:14,500
And this is where I think, Chris, you ran into way more problems because you're you're you're sitting on the edge of this a lot and you're hitting those boundaries very often.

413
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:23,500
And and I think that for your simpler use, like, for example, most people are probably going to be treating it similar to a Chromebook.

414
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:33,500
A Chromebook style model is totally going to work great with silver, blue or quinoa because the vast majority of these things are just not going to need to be layered in.

415
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:44,500
But as soon as you start getting into having to manage external capabilities, system extensions, drivers, it starts falling apart unless somebody builds a custom image up front.

416
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,500
And that is that's where you start getting into where corporate environments are probably going to want this.

417
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,500
They'll bake in firmware, they'll bake in drivers, they'll bake in all these other things.

418
00:40:53,500 --> 00:41:06,500
And so so that's where, you know, I feel like some of this is a solution looking for a problem, but some of this is also where it's trying to solve a problem that most people don't need to have solved.

419
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:12,500
I think most enthusiasts, right, the like the people who are really going out and downloading Linux ISOs, they don't have this problem.

420
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Right. It is absolutely necessary for growing the total addressable market of Linux users because you're targeting a different class of them.

421
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:29,500
And so I can always see, like, for example, silver, blue and quinoa being alongside the main workstation and KDE variants.

422
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:36,500
And personally speaking, as someone working in the KDE SIG, this is how I position the two.

423
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:47,500
I position them for different types of people. And when quinoa gets more up to scratch, there's still things we've got to do, things we've got to beef up, integration work that needs to be completed.

424
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:56,500
You know, once we're there, I see quinoa as the one for the simple user or the managed user.

425
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:03,500
Right. And then you get that plasma, baby. That's great. Right. And then the rest of it is the rest of it is, you know, whatever.

426
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:09,500
OK, so that's kind of where I'm seeing this is I'm really seeing like two types of Linux is really out there, two types of Linux desktops.

427
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:27,500
But, Brent, I wanted to switch back to the Raspberry Pi for a moment because I often treat my pies like an appliance. I've definitely played around with on and off over the last year with my Pi 400, creating like these different kind of always ready to go workstations like the idea.

428
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,500
Oh, crap, I forgot my laptop, but I've got this Raspberry Pi 400, which is the Pi built into the keyboard.

429
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,500
I've got that all hooked up and ready to go. What's the perfect OS for that?

430
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,500
And Silverblue, I've thought of I've right now I have Pop OS on there. I've been trying their Raspberry Pi build.

431
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:49,500
But I'm curious how your efforts went and if you managed to actually get Silverblue working on a pie for these are all important questions.

432
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,500
You know, before even starting this project, because there's, you know, been a pie behind me for a few weeks now, weeks.

433
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,500
I don't know. I paused because I was like, no, no, Chris is going to try this. Right.

434
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,500
I'm just duplicating efforts here. And then I thought, well, I'm just going to give it a go anyways.

435
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,500
And so I'm surprised to hear, Chris, that you may not have tried it. I did have to do a little bit of tinkering.

436
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:14,500
Now, I'm not that high initiated, so I did a little bit of tinkering to get the ISO to boot.

437
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:29,500
So I do have some resources here. I had to download and very simply put on the SD card a Raspberry Pi for UEFI firmware image that would, I guess, see a USB drive and be able to boot from that.

438
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,500
Once I did that, that was like a little tip that I found once I did that super easy.

439
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:41,500
My preferred end case was to install from a USB drive to another USB drive, and I was never able to get that to work.

440
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:48,500
This morning, I had a little bit of a light bulb moment and I just installed to the SD card because I'm not running this thing for a long time, but I wanted to get it going.

441
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,500
And I thought, oh, I think there's a way that I can make this happen.

442
00:43:51,500 --> 00:44:04,500
So what I ended up doing was just leaving a small partition for that UEFI stuff, and then I was able to get the installer up and running and get Silverblue installed, you know, alongside this partition that I had made.

443
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:11,500
And so it's booted right now behind me. It's doing stuff and it is running without complaining any.

444
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:17,500
It is very slow for a variety of reasons. You know, this could be a hardware issue.

445
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:27,500
Clearly, SD card is very slow. Yeah, right. So I don't have that much experience to say, well, how slow is it compared to maybe the optimum setup?

446
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:32,500
I would say as a desktop, at least the way I have it set up, it is unusual.

447
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,500
Yeah, it's just too slow. Well, if I want to move the mouse, I got to move the mouse.

448
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:43,500
Wait for a sec or three and then the mouse begins to move and then I could do stuff.

449
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,500
Well, that sounds like a video acceleration issue out there. I'm sure there's work that can be done here to greatly improve this experience.

450
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,500
I was going to say, Brent doesn't have outrageous standards here, so his unusable is.

451
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:59,500
Can I just say, can I just say, that's true, you're right. Actually, we should appreciate that comment.

452
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,500
I was getting frustrated. Not in a bad way, but I mean, like Brent can use a lot of different systems.

453
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,500
He's not super picky about, you know, the performance side of things usually.

454
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:13,500
Yeah, yeah, I think that's a very nice way to say it. I don't need to elaborate. I think everybody understands what you're saying.

455
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,500
OK, now, can I just say, like, hmm, I.

456
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Brentley, I wanted I wanted to I wanted to have this really, you know, gentle and wholesome and great Raspberry Pi experience with you.

457
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:35,500
Right. I wanted to have you sit down with a Raspberry Pi that had a USB SSD for its storage and it had a camera device attached to it.

458
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:42,500
And then I wanted to experiment with a compute module that had a MMC built in with a carrier board.

459
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:49,500
And instead, I feel like you've had the most. Well, perhaps appropriate introduction to Raspberry Pi is possible, I suppose.

460
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:57,500
You will be able to appreciate how far they've come next time you're at the studio and we mess around with some of the studio Pi setups because, yeah, it's.

461
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Oh, there's really the peak Pi experience is the compute module on a carrier board with MMC storage, because what happens and it's beautiful.

462
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:12,500
Is when you boot from an ISO image, you just have to get any old generic arm ISO image now.

463
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:22,500
It's so wonderful. You know, you boot from an ISO image and it sees the MMC storage as a local disk like it, like just like a Dev SDA type disk.

464
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,500
And then you just install Linux on it like it's a computer.

465
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:33,500
And then when you're done, you disconnect the USB and you reboot and it boots up off its local disk like a real computer.

466
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,500
And it's so much better than what you're having to go through. So that seems so luxurious.

467
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:43,500
There is light at the end of the tunnel, just so you know. But it's hard for me. I wanted your first Pi experiences to be better than this.

468
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:49,500
But I feel like perhaps if you stick with it, you actually appreciates more where it's gotten to.

469
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,500
Once you get to use different setups. So don't judge the whole system while bottlenecked.

470
00:46:54,500 --> 00:47:04,500
I do also appreciate the tinkering aspects. So there's something about, you know, staying up maybe a little too late and solving some problems that are lessons you don't forget.

471
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:14,500
And so I've appreciated that. But I think I think it sounds to me like what you're suggesting is I'm living in like Pi world from three years ago and not the updated experience.

472
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,500
So I'm looking forward to the upgrade.

473
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:22,500
Yeah, I mean, it is what you make it. You could put different stuff together. I'm sure from I mean, I'm sure Alex has drawers full of stuff. But yeah.

474
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:33,500
Oh, yeah. He's got a bunch of things like that. We're connected to it. But I haven't given myself the leeway to erase any of his data because I feel like that would maybe challenge our friendship.

475
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:41,500
It's not it's not a racing if you back it up and restore it afterwards. Just I'm just going to put that out there.

476
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:49,500
Bitwarden.com slash Linux. Get started with a free trial for teams, enterprise or yourself at Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

477
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:56,500
It's the easiest way to store, share and sync sensitive data. Full stop is what we use for our password management.

478
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:06,500
And Bitwarden is fully customizable. It's open source and it's trusted by millions of individuals, teams and organizations worldwide for secure password storage and sharing.

479
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:17,500
Bitwarden also has great things like account switching support, username generation now and something else that I really appreciate Bitwarden when I'm on the road is it also has an offline capability.

480
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:26,500
Bitwarden uses a client server architecture where every Bitwarden client application connects to the Bitwarden cloud or the self-hosted Bitwarden server you set up, Vaultwarden.

481
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,500
That easy setup means you can synchronize offline.

482
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:38,500
So if you need to get access to your information when you don't have a connection, which happens to me, well, that client server architecture means that information is available locally.

483
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:44,500
And Bitwarden has a full write up on how this works. I will put a link in the show notes so you can review this.

484
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:49,500
But I think if you're like me, you're going to appreciate that particular use case from time to time.

485
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:54,500
And you know what? You probably should be getting off grid. But let's be real managing your passwords.

486
00:48:54,500 --> 00:49:02,500
It's a chore to something like Bitwarden that makes it all super accessible and approachable by a pro or by a total beginner.

487
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:12,500
That's a winner. And then when you combine it with your mobile device so you can use secure passwords and usernames for services and apps that you use on your phone and on your desktop game changer.

488
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:20,500
It really is that piece you need to be fully secure online. So if you haven't done this yet, go to Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

489
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:26,500
But if you know someone that hasn't done this, maybe you could recommend they check it out. Maybe your workplace needs to do this.

490
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:32,500
This is just table stakes now online. So let's get everybody using a great password manager.

491
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:39,500
And I think the best one out there is Bitwarden. Go try it out and support the show by going to Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

492
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:52,500
I think this is a game changer. It's one of those tools you just got to have. And I think Bitwarden is the best. Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

493
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:59,500
Well, I came into my silver blue journey having had a kind of persistent Fedora 36 install hanging around.

494
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:05,500
I don't use it for everything, you know, but it's something I consistently like, especially for just hanging out.

495
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:11,500
The nice modern Linux desktop on the couch while I'm catching up on things or, you know, doing some show prep or the like.

496
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:21,500
On one hand, I was kind of really impressed with silver blue because it did not feel that different from the, you know, just the standard Fedora 36 install.

497
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:26,500
I mean, there's some differences here and there, you know, once you start looking under the hood, but just from a surface level user.

498
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:32,500
You know, I wiped that old one away because I just I just like, well, sorry, Fedora 36, your partition is getting sacrificed here.

499
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:36,500
Right. And switch it over to silver blue and set up a few things to get back to where I was.

500
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:44,500
But on that surface level, I mean, I wouldn't have known if it wasn't my laptop and I did start poking under the covers.

501
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,500
Yeah. If you just sat down at a machine, I don't know if you could tell.

502
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:52,500
Yeah, exactly. To get there, though, I had a little more struggles than I was expecting, honestly.

503
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:59,500
I mean, OK, first I tried Ventoy just because I wanted an excuse to like I hadn't updated my USB for a while.

504
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:06,500
I'd been using that same USB when I was doing the Nix Pi experiment stuff because it's the fastest USB that I had laying around.

505
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:11,500
So I was like, OK, wipe it out. Get fresh Ventoy. Stick silver blue on there.

506
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,500
You know, my first ISO on the new Ventoy. Get it booted up real great.

507
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,500
Just also all those they've got all the new like they've got the GUI version to install Ventoy.

508
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,500
They got the script. Yeah. They got the web client. Right.

509
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:28,500
And they've now got that web configurator to configure the like plugins and the config for the plugins and stuff.

510
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,500
Oh, yeah, yeah. It's real slick. Anyway, that worked fine. Boot it up.

511
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:37,500
I'm installing. The following error occurred while installing the payload.

512
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,500
This is a fatal error and installation will be aborted.

513
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
Oh, this is in the installer. Yeah.

514
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,500
OS tree admin and then specifies the sys root deploy.

515
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:54,500
So it's trying to do that deploy of the like, you know, the base silver blue image exited with the code one.

516
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,500
That was a little bit disappointing.

517
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,500
I thought, you know, I always do things a little bit weird.

518
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,500
So in this case, I'm trying to install to a partition, but I deleted things.

519
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,500
I gave it some free space. I let it automatically use the free space and like come up with how I wanted to use that.

520
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Should be fine. So it seemed like it should be fine.

521
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:13,500
So then I go and I get the fedora image writer and I write the image that way to the USB.

522
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,500
Blow away my new Ventoy install just to be like, OK, well.

523
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,500
Doing it by the book. Doing it by the book this time.

524
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,500
Same thing. So that was like a little off putting.

525
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:28,500
Yeah, I bet. I don't know what was going on. Normally this is where I've installed silver blue multiple times in the past and it was fine.

526
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:34,500
Yeah. Ultimately, I just ended up installing doing the thing where I install it via a virtual machine and then reboot it that way.

527
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,500
And then it worked fine. So you used Kexec. Yeah.

528
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,500
Yeah. OK. Of course you did. We need a little jingle for that.

529
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,500
We do. Someone to make us a Kexec jingle.

530
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,500
This time it didn't break things. It actually made things work better.

531
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,500
Oh, yeah, it's true. So, hey, I feel a little bit vindicated.

532
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,500
Perhaps more appropriate for the scope of this type of distribution. Really, let's be honest.

533
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,500
So, OK, once you got in there.

534
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,500
I did run into, unlike regular Fedora, Kexec wasn't built into the base image.

535
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:07,500
And then that's where I had to start learning a little bit about how do I how do I get this binary live right now?

536
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,500
Because I don't want I can't I don't want to reboot. I want a Kexec right now.

537
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,500
Of course. All right.

538
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:20,500
And I just I love the Kexec. It always inevitably ends up your solution.

539
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:24,500
Somehow Brett and I would have solved that problem and I don't think Kexec would have been involved at all.

540
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,500
But I don't know if they've ever even installed it somehow.

541
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,500
Anyways, what was your impression once you got it up and going?

542
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:37,500
It didn't feel like my system. You know, when I was when I was first exploring NixOS, for better or worse,

543
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,500
you kind of had to learn the build side of it, at least a little bit.

544
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:46,500
Right. Because you're going to be using the next language to, you know, to configure your system.

545
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,500
And then you're probably going to start looking at the next packages stuff to go see like what's in there.

546
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:55,500
And then you probably start reading the like the expressions for how they're built to see like, oh, is this the thing that I want?

547
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:00,500
And it's getting the thing, the pieces that I need. And so in that way, yeah, whether you're forced, maybe.

548
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,500
But you're also sort of welcomed is maybe too strong of a word.

549
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:09,500
But, you know, like you have to learn that. And then that means you're configuring it and customizing it.

550
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:15,500
And Silverblue felt much more like it was someone else that had constructed the system for me.

551
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,500
And I was just kind of a guest on it.

552
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:24,500
Wow. You really just touched on something that I hadn't even put words to or thought about.

553
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:30,500
But it is an exact 180 experience. Silverblue feels like it's been composed by a team and you're using it.

554
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:40,500
And a NixOS install feels like you handcrafted this thing and it is exactly your thing that you have built.

555
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:45,500
Much like a custom Arch or Gentoo install does. Right. Just easier.

556
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:51,500
Yeah. It's a total different experience when you're still trying to get to the same result. That's fascinating.

557
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:57,500
Now, admittedly, I would like to spend some more time playing with OS tree and RPM OS tree.

558
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:01,500
I mean, I think it's the technology underlying it is really quite neat. Right. I mean, you kind of hit on it.

559
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:07,500
It's like a version control system. It's like it's like Git, but for, you know, binary files to build operating systems with.

560
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:12,500
And it shares with Nix this idea of, you know, different like roots of your system that you can build separately.

561
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:18,500
Right. So you can have all these, you know, you can have this big, big old store of all the underlying files and then compose those together in different ways

562
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:23,500
and sort of manipulate it and create new versions without having to duplicate your whole system or, you know,

563
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:28,500
back up everything onto our sink like we did in the old days.

564
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:35,500
So I like that. I wasn't forced to. And so I haven't yet had the opportunity to to dive in and figure out like,

565
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,500
how can I make OS tree work a little bit better for me?

566
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,500
Or what if I want to start trying to build like my own take on the image and build my own image?

567
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:47,500
I was going to pre configure for Raspberry Pi's that we deployed in the studio or for some studio rigs.

568
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,500
In the same the same sense, I probably want to get a little better at maybe making RPMs.

569
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:57,500
I've done that in the past or really and I probably need to do this anyway is get a little better at configuring with Flatpak.

570
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:01,500
Right. I kind of accepted on the Nix side that I'm probably going to end up writing some Nix expressions.

571
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:08,500
I might end up packing or something, even if it's just something I package for myself locally or figure out how to build and extract from a tarball and stuff.

572
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:16,500
And I feel like if I was going to use it on a machine that I was actively not tinkering, but like, you know, doing Linux stuff with,

573
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:21,500
I probably want to embrace those tools a little bit more to, you know, learn how I could customize it.

574
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:25,500
Yeah. And something else that strikes me about what you're saying, too, is with the Nix system,

575
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,500
when you've built it for the most part, all of those packages are locally installed.

576
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,500
They have access to the local file system. They're not sandboxed.

577
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:38,500
You can absolutely use Flatpaks on a Nix desktop, but like my base Nix OS setup,

578
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:47,500
a lot of the standard things I use are just installed via my Nix config and they're all local applications that have access to the full system,

579
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:51,500
like VS Code, which is how I prefer to run VS Code.

580
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:57,500
Now, I'm using it as a Flatpak and I can make that work, but I prefer just to have access to my entire file system.

581
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,500
Yeah, there are some limitations with the Flatpak in particular.

582
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:04,500
And what kind of language runtimes do you need integrated and how do you get that all to play nicely?

583
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:10,500
And yeah, you're right. I mean, Nix doesn't really have a traditional file system hierarchy, which causes its own set of problems, obviously.

584
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:16,500
But I think that the self-hosted episode title, what was like, No Container Theory, that was it, right?

585
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,500
Like in all the ways that Nix is more complicated, it's also simpler in that there's just,

586
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:27,500
because you have this control at the build system level, you don't necessarily do it at the operating system level with things like containers.

587
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,500
Yeah.

588
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:35,500
The flip side of this, though, is something Neil hit on in the managed environment or just with things like Chromebooks.

589
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:40,500
Or it makes me think, too, you know, you were talking about Distrobox.

590
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:45,500
If I had a Windows machine, I wouldn't be configuring Windows or customizing it, or I would try to avoid doing that, right?

591
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,500
I would be spinning up WSL instances and doing it that way.

592
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:53,500
Yeah. If you're coming from the traditional OSs, this approach isn't that strange.

593
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:58,500
And then, you know, these days you also have things like, you know, cloud developer environments.

594
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:02,500
You have things where, you know, it's very common to just, you know, you've got your ID, you've got your local thing, however that's set up.

595
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:06,500
And then you've got your Scratchbox that's a, you know, instance on Amazon or whatever.

596
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,500
So part of me also wonders if this is just a mentality shift I need to have.

597
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:14,500
Like in the WSL version, you know, they've done a lot of work to make that pretty seamless,

598
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,500
especially with all the graphical support that they've worked on, too, right?

599
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:22,500
So if there's more of that, like, you know, things to hook up toolbox more so into the native system,

600
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,500
things like virtualization that did the same.

601
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:31,500
Maybe that would maybe that if I could embrace that workflow, that might make a lot of my problems go away.

602
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:37,500
Yeah. And then there's those those edge cases like tail scale or like Reaper where you'd love to see a solution that really makes that fit.

603
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:46,500
So at the end of all of this, if you can only install one like here in the studio or for your system on a desktop that you're going to use or like on a stream machine,

604
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:51,500
or would you do Nix OS right now or would you would you do Silverblue at this point?

605
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:56,500
I think for me and part of this is just maybe this on cost fallacy, but I think I do Nix.

606
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,500
I feel a little more comfortable there. I feel a little more familiar.

607
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,500
And I think I'm more aware of the various escape hatches and ways that we could make it work.

608
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:07,500
It might end up being more of a time investment, but that's where I have the most confidence at the moment.

609
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:13,500
I tend to lean towards Nix as well because Silverblue was a pretty good desktop experience.

610
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:18,500
But Nix also is great on the server and I could see using it on the desktop.

611
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:27,500
And I like the idea of just using Nix. And then the other thing that's brilliant about it is even when I'm on a different distribution, I can still install the next package manager.

612
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:32,500
So that's just like I invest in a skill set that I can really use in multiple different ways.

613
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:37,500
So that's sort of why I lean towards Nix. Plus, I really I like the idea.

614
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:44,500
And Brent, you touched on this. I like the idea of I just have a Nix OS config and the system is built from that.

615
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:49,500
Whereas with Silverblue, it's a system that's built and then I configure it and I install all my stuff into it.

616
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:55,500
But with the Nix system, when I'm done and I started up, everything I want is installed already.

617
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,500
It's already good to go. So what about you, Brent? Where do you lean?

618
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,500
Because there is the whole Red Hat ecosystem.

619
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:08,500
So there is benefit in learning this and just being in that Red Hat ecosystem, which, you know, is always great for anybody that's in the industry.

620
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,500
It felt mostly like Fedora.

621
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:14,500
So there's lots to like about that. And you can apply a lot of the Fedora skill sets to this, too.

622
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:21,500
So I'm curious where you land on it, Brent. If you could only pick one in some weird bizarro, you know, like I said, the CEO of Linux calls you up and says,

623
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,500
Brent, we're going to get rid of one of these. You got to pick. Which one would you pick?

624
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,500
What would you tell the CEO of Linux? That person didn't ask me.

625
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:32,500
I think probably I think you nailed it right there, Chris, of what I was thinking.

626
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:38,500
And maybe we're not giving it enough justice, but that declarative nature is really attractive.

627
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:51,500
And Neil touched on how you can use OS tree if you know what you're doing to kind of accomplish the same end goal, which is declaring what your system should look like and be able to reproduce those fairly easily.

628
01:00:51,500 --> 01:01:02,500
That just seems very, very, very attractive in a, you know, I'm going to put a time investment into a system and then just reap the rewards forever from it.

629
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:13,500
So I would lean next word because it feels, I don't know, like that documentation was presented fairly easily to, you know, that's the only way to use next OS.

630
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:18,500
So like Wes said, you kind of forced to jump in, but then you get the benefits right away.

631
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:28,500
So when I was reading the documentation on Silverblue, I didn't even come across any of that suggestion that that was a way that this could be done with this system.

632
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:37,500
And maybe the documentation is or the version of the documentation I reached was meant for end users and not specifically for administrators.

633
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:42,500
But maybe it or that info maybe is in the installer documentation or something like that, right?

634
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:48,500
Could be, but it leads me to wonder, well, maybe that's not what they're banking on then.

635
01:01:48,500 --> 01:02:01,500
Or maybe it's not meant for someone like me who, you know, isn't a system administrator for hundreds of systems and just has maybe a handful that he wants to, you know, quote unquote, administrate.

636
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,500
Maybe, but I'm on board with you.

637
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:08,500
I'd like to know if the audience would be interested in us trying out Endless because this is, I think, on the other spectrum here.

638
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:12,500
Endless OS, GTK GNOME based desktop and the same thing.

639
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:17,500
OS tree approach, but it's Debian based, which is which is I think that's kind of interesting.

640
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,500
So let us know, send us a booster.

641
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,500
Go to Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

642
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:30,500
And speaking of the contact page, I do just want to tidy up in here really briefly and mention your emails matter.

643
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,500
We read them all the time.

644
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,500
Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact for that.

645
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,500
And I want to say thank you to our members.

646
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,500
You guys, you give us the power to be picky and choosy.

647
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,500
You make it so that our audience is our largest customer.

648
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:49,500
That is critical because it allows us to say no to all kinds of ridiculous things.

649
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,500
And we've seen some really funny offers.

650
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:56,500
I don't know what's going on out there, but we have seen some really funny offers come in for advertisers.

651
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:01,500
And I suppose if we were hard up, you know, maybe you'd have to say, maybe we could try this.

652
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,500
But our members.

653
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:08,500
Members, if you have any sketchy links you want to put on the episode, I mean, just let us know.

654
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,500
Really? Yeah. But it really matters as a business.

655
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,500
Our members are our largest customers.

656
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,500
We've got to make sure they're happy.

657
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,500
And of course, we would we would always try to do that.

658
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:22,500
But I think it I think it makes sense to have both us as hosts aligned that way and JB as a business aligned that way.

659
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,500
So if you'd like to become a member, that's an unplugged core dot com.

As always, we got some amazing feedback this week, so thank you to everyone who wrote in.

663
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:46,500
And please feel free to write in about just about anything.

Do you remember we were talking about HP?

666
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:58,500
We got a boost in talking about HP and the dev one and not being able to order it from an enterprise perspective.

667
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,500
Yeah. I hate the nuances of supplies.

668
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:06,500
Yeah. Isaac gave us a little tidbit that might be helpful here in understanding that situation.

669
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:16,500
They're right in regards to HP dev one HP split into two companies a few years ago, HP and then HPE, the enterprise version.

670
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:29,500
So the HP dev one is a product that the consumer company HP and I would guess that the person complaining about the company not being able to order it is going through the business relationships with HPE.

671
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:37,500
Despite both coming from one company and still using HP in their names, the two companies are completely separate and would not recommend each other's products.

672
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:42,500
Not confusing at all. We knew this, too, but this has got to be what it was.

673
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:50,500
And that's why they're like, we don't sell that. And of course, as a consumer, you're like, but your name's HP. It's an HP dev one.

674
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,500
Yeah, that's silly. That's very silly.

675
01:04:53,500 --> 01:05:01,500
The person also wrote in with some Steam Deck hacks, Chris, which I think is probably up your alley. Hey, they're right.

676
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,500
Hey, broke college student here. Big fan of the show.

677
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:09,500
Heard your review of the Steam Deck and just wanted to let you know about a project called Holo ISO.

678
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:14,500
That is the official unofficial SteamOS image taken directly from the Steam Deck.

679
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:20,500
I installed this on an old deconstructed laptop board similar to the one behind me.

680
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:26,500
Paired it with an Xbox handle and got a great home theater interface for streaming games from my PC.

681
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,500
It works flawlessly.

682
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:35,500
Also, if you want to know more about the graphical stack of the deck, check out Steam Deck Guide on GitHub,

683
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:39,500
which explains how the game mode compositor uses X-Wayland for frames.

684
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:46,500
You might be able to use this information to modify your installation, virtual keyboard, boot into plasma, et cetera, to suit your needs.

685
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,500
This looks neat. I mean, it's kind of like a neat little guide.

686
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:56,500
I don't quite know what the intended audience is, but it seems like it could be really useful for folks who have gotten a Steam Deck

687
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:01,500
or maybe Linux curious, but are not, you know, are not listeners of the show already.

688
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:08,500
I got a couple of good tips, including there's a command I can do to make the file system read right so I can install stuffs.

689
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:13,500
But of course, then when you do an update to the image, it kind of does whatever you did.

690
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:20,500
But I have to say, week two with the Steam Deck has been interesting.

691
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:25,500
First few days of the week, I didn't even pick it up. I just did not even have an opportunity to play.

692
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:32,500
And then the weekend rolled around and I found myself with 20 minutes here, 20 minutes there.

693
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:36,500
And I probably picked it up four or five times and played a Steam game.

694
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:41,500
And I have to say, this is I realized when I put the order in exactly what I was hoping for,

695
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:46,500
because living in a tiny home, like I don't have always a machine actually set up.

696
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,500
I don't have I currently don't have a desktop set up. I sometimes do.

697
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:53,500
You don't have a dedicated room with your gaming rig and a chair and everything all ready to go.

698
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:58,500
Yeah, no. And I don't even have a game console hooked up at the moment.

699
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:06,500
And so having the deck and being able to just bust that out and playing a little bit of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredder's Revenge

700
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:13,500
for like 15, 20 minutes here, there was has really been great. And then like I was able to hand it over to the kids and like you try this.

701
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:20,500
What's the turn on? Pretty darn. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It turns on about as fast as you'd expect a device like that to turn on and off.

702
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:24,500
The only thing that's really kind of slow on it is the switching in and out of desktop mode.

703
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:29,500
It's starting like a whole new display server or something. But that's been it's been nice.

704
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:36,500
Just having something that I have readily available, I pick it up and I play games for a little bit and I put it back down.

705
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:42,500
And because I know this sounds so obvious to you guys, but once you have like this appliance in your hand,

706
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:48,500
because all of the games I've ever bought on Steam are available, I have a huge selection of games.

707
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:56,500
And then the thing that was super cool is then I was as I was playing with Silverblue on the Dev one, I installed Steam and then I could just play those same games.

708
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:01,500
I picked those games right back up on the Dev one and I was playing and I'm like, this is actually pretty great.

709
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:07,500
That's a pretty nice combo. So week two, still pretty happy with the deck.

710
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,500
I did not yet, but I got a new USB-C dock that arrived.

711
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,500
I'm going to hook that up probably this next week or so and play around with that.

712
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:19,500
We tried out as a more of a computer. Yeah. And maybe also just I don't know for funsies,

713
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:27,500
hook up our physical keyboard and do like a Wazda shooter game. Oh, yeah. Turn the tables. I like it.

714
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:31,500
Yeah. Why not? Right. So we'll see. See how that goes.

715
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:35,500
And now it is time for the boost.

716
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:43,500
Our first boost today comes from Acerbic. Six days ago, 6,210 sets.

717
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,500
Loving the Fountain app. Thanks for the tip.

718
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:51,500
Have you looked into the impervious browser from impervious.ai at all?

719
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:56,500
I would love to hear your thoughts on that. The good stuff coming. Cheers, Acerbic.

720
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:02,500
Thanks, Acerbic. Impervious AI. Have you looked into this at all? No, new to me.

721
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:05,500
A programmatic layer that sits on top of the lightning network.

722
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:11,500
Developers can leverage the impervious API to easily build peer to peer data transmission.

723
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:17,500
Whoa, man. That's a lot. That's a lot. I would have to look into that. You should build something on that and tell us how it works.

724
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,500
Layer 3. Here I'm just getting to layer 2. Yeah. Well, layer 1 is Bitcoin.

725
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:26,500
Layer 2 is the lightning. And layer 3 is whatever that is.

726
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:31,500
We're about to find out. Yeah. I mean, I prefer a seven layer dip. So bring it on.

727
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,500
When do the beans come in?

728
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:40,500
I get some like IPFS vibes off this thing, even though I haven't really dove in, but I wonder if it's similar.

729
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:46,500
Well, six days ago, the Golden Dragon boosted in with a row of ducks. 2222 sats.

730
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:50,500
I'm a duck. D.U.K. duck. Loaded with talent.

731
01:09:50,500 --> 01:10:00,500
And the big dragon's been listening live. So we boosted in and said, you know, if we had tech pants that were penguin themed, I think I'd buy some hint, hint, hint, hint.

732
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:06,500
We need a swag person. If anybody out there is a swag person. What about like a tech robe? Is that a thing that can?

733
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:11,500
Yeah. Well, the robes need to happen, too. But I would like some tech robe, just like a robe mixed with cargo pants.

734
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:16,500
It's like a robe with like pockets for all your tech. You got to have like the tablet pocket.

735
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:21,500
Yeah, right. I think it has hooks for like cable loops that you probably have a gimbal for your stream.

736
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:28,500
And, you know, you got a mic from Kota Radio is like on a sustained campaign to get the robe started again.

737
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:34,500
So that's probably going to have to happen at some point in the future. But I feel like some super comfy pants with the bearded tux on them.

738
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:39,500
I feel like those would be really good. You know, because last week, Microsoft had the tech pants.

739
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:44,500
Do you think they want to do a crossover with us? Yeah, maybe a collab. Uh-huh. Yeah, we could collab.

740
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:50,500
BBX Microsoft. We could collab on the soc, you know. Wouldn't that be great?

741
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:58,500
The golden dragon double boosted in with another two thousand two hundred and twenty two sats.

742
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:05,500
Says I live in plasma and I've been a big fan of XFCE, but I've moved to a window manager with an XFCE taskbar.

743
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:11,500
You know, this is an interesting setup where you can mix and match pieces like this of the Linux desktop back in my day.

744
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:16,500
You could really in with GNOME, you could replace Mudder, you know, what we consider Mudder now.

745
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:21,500
You could swap out different back ends. I mean, you could take it to the next level.

746
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:28,500
You back in my day, Wes, you could mix and match your window managers with your back ends and your front ends. You could swap all day long.

747
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:34,500
Hey, I was about to say golden dragon. Don't don't hang him on. I'm excited for plasma up in here and finally get XFCE.

748
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:40,500
I swear I'm cursing that thing every other week. We have XFCE on the recording machine and I think it's time to go.

749
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,500
And then we got a triple boost from the golden dragon six days ago.

750
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:57,500
Ten twenty four sats. He calls it the gigabyte sats. May Brent's gas tank and whatever else you may need be fulfilled by sats.

751
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,500
Oh, that is so kind.

752
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:05,500
That is great because we are raising funds to get Brent out to the studio before the road trip to work on some projects.

753
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:14,500
And so we have him in as a 50 50 split for the month of shows to build up a little bit of a piggy bank to get him down here.

754
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:19,500
It's about a day and a half, two day drive, which is about three thousand dollars in gas.

755
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,500
No kidding these days. Not really.

756
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:34,500
But yeah. And then a quad boost from the golden dragon two thousand two hundred and twenty two sats.

757
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,500
Says you are sharp right off the cuff on the pre show.

758
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,500
He's watching live and appreciating the West in action. That's so sweet.

759
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:45,500
I think that was a covid adult just set up rush to set up a home studio.

760
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,500
It's probably a little spicy. Yeah, you were a little spicy.

761
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:53,500
Whoops. We love it, though. Todd also wrote in from a northern V.A.

762
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:57,500
Was that Virginia? Virginia. Is that what that is? You got it.

763
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:01,500
Five days ago with eleven thousand one hundred and eleven sats.

764
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:08,500
So this baller is boosting the dip.

765
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:13,500
Ah, very nice. Yep. Cheap sats right now. I wonder. I wonder for how much longer.

766
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:17,500
I suspect longer, but I may be wrong on that. And we don't care.

767
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:23,500
Still the same good old sats to us. We just love this as a great method to get into the show and support us.

768
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:26,500
And again, make sure the audience stays the number one customer.

769
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:32,500
Our next boost comes in from X thumbs X five days ago with a thousand sats.

770
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:36,500
How about a brunch with Brent with someone from the dark table team?

771
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:39,500
That is an idea right there.

772
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:48,500
You know, this I have a list of like possible brunchers and some pretty big whales on there as well.

773
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:53,500
And the dark table team members have been like I think they were number two on that list.

774
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,500
And so, yeah, that would be amazing if we can make that happen. I don't see why not.

775
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,500
Very good. Very good. I like that idea a lot.

776
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,500
All right. The next boost comes in from Marcel.

777
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:08,500
And we're going to probably institute a thousand sats or above boost policy to get the whole note read in the show.

778
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,500
But occasionally I think I want to pull some forward.

779
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:15,500
But the idea being just to kind of tighten up this segment so that way doesn't run on and on.

780
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:20,500
But Marcel boosted in with a total of six hundred and sixty six sats.

781
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:25,500
And the first boost was I remember drug cam, but can you use it without being in anger?

782
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:29,500
And I thought this is funny because this is the same that you picked up in the last year or so.

783
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:33,500
I mean, you probably had it longer, but we hear it more often. What does it mean?

784
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:37,500
I mean, like when you really used a tool, right? You've had to be angry with it.

785
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:41,500
You've used it in a dark situation. You've had to make it work under pressure.

786
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,500
Yeah, right. You know, you've actually embraced it.

787
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:48,500
It wasn't just the the easy few top common use cases. It's been in production for a while.

788
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:53,500
Yeah, like you're like it was live stream time. You just have this get this thing set up. It was brand new.

789
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:57,500
It's like that's a pressure situation. Yeah, that's a good place to review a piece of software, too.

790
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,500
You know, I tried out another I forget what it was called after looks.

791
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,500
I didn't work super well, but I was trying to find a similar set.

792
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,500
I was like, can I reuse this on my work Mac? You know, because like why not?

793
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,500
It looked it looked better than the built in webcam.

794
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,500
And at least the most common ones I could find.

795
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:15,500
None of them had the sweet like, you know, video for Linux to loop back set up.

796
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:19,500
So it would let me like record and even had some fancy effects and stuff in this Mac version.

797
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:23,500
But like didn't make it easy to import it into my team's call or whatever.

798
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:28,500
Isn't that just the difference right there? You know, they are building that into Ventura.

799
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:34,500
But you got to buy like an accessory to make it work, I think, like something that actually goes and like implements the APIs that they've added or whatever.

800
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:41,500
Well, it's like an NFC equipped device that activates the function in the phone.

801
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:45,500
Then connects over like a direct Wi-Fi connection to the it's like this whole setup.

802
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:49,500
But yeah, but like on Linux, you can have it today. Maybe it's not as slick.

803
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:53,500
Right. But it worked pretty good for you. Right. So all right.

804
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:59,500
Boost two from Marcel. Why doesn't the Steam Deck just shrink and scroll the terminal window when the keyboard is open?

805
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,500
You know, like you have on phones, this seems like problem solved.

806
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:06,500
Now, the issue there, Marcel, is that I don't think the terminals aware.

807
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:09,500
And I got some insight. The keyboard opens up on the screen.

808
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:15,500
Thank you to whoever sent this in. The keyboard opens up on the screen depending on where the mouse cursor is, not the content screen.

809
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:20,500
Yeah. So there you go. And then we had a third boost.

810
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:25,500
Come on, Brent. You know, you want to go on a coast to coast Canada meetup tour.

811
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:30,500
It is true. I mean, who says I haven't previously? I think we should totally do this.

812
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:35,500
I mean, there's a lot of area to cover between those coasts in Canada.

813
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:40,500
Not dissimilar to the US, but a few key spots. I don't see why not.

814
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:45,500
And I might even be able to convince like one of my American buddies to join me.

815
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,500
Mic Mac boosts in three days ago.

816
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:52,500
Oh, a row of ducks. Two thousand two hundred and twenty two cents.

817
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:56,500
Thank you very much. And here's something for your trouble.

818
01:16:56,500 --> 01:17:00,500
Because who doesn't love the ducks? Long time listener. Really appreciate the network.

819
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,500
Thanks for the great content, guys.

820
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:07,500
Thank you, Mic Mac. There's been a few first time boosters in the last couple of weeks.

821
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:13,500
And that's been really, really gratifying to see and grateful because I I'm grateful because not only is it a bit of a journey,

822
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:17,500
I recognize that and we're asking you to try to new technology.

823
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:22,500
And of course, we're just crazy enough to ask you to do it when the markets crashed and Bitcoin's dead.

824
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:26,500
Right. And of course, we're thinking long term.

825
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:31,500
This is free freedom for money like the GPL was freedom for software.

826
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:37,500
And so if we can build out a network of users that are on this system and then we can start supporting free software projects,

827
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,500
I think that's going to be a win win for everyone, Mic Mac.

828
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:45,500
And we may just be putting some code where our mouth is on that front in the future.

829
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:48,500
Well, we'll share details on that if we if we get that far.

830
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:51,500
But it is something that is in active discussions right now.

831
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:56,500
Torched escape boosted in two days ago with fifteen thousand cents.

832
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:11,500
Oh, all right. I think Torched here wants to help out that cross Canada tour.

833
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:15,500
They write in a few more drops in the tank. Thanks for the great show.

834
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:19,500
Oh, thank you, Jeff. I think he actually secretly wants me to go south.

835
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:24,500
Well, yeah. Well, I mean, you know, if you come along with us on the road trip, we'll end up at Jeff's house.

836
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:28,500
So you got to get to the studio first to make it. But we got big plans.

837
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,500
Jeff is a listener who has been around for a long time.

838
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,500
He often pops in the Bumble room during the show. So that's another way he's shown value.

839
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:41,500
But in the past years ago, he came to where we had JOOPS parked and help us get electricity hooked up.

840
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:49,500
So we had full electrical hookups. And now he has built a parking spot in his backyard that can accommodate JOOPS in California.

841
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:57,500
So we have a destination where we can park and hook up and and have Internet and air conditioning and, you know, have dog buddies.

842
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:02,500
So it's pretty great. Jeff's a pretty great guy and we super appreciate him.

843
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:14,500
And we have a couple of thank you boosts. Five thousand sats from LT Guy. Four hundred and fifty sats from Nick's Bitcoin is amazing, saying that he loves the duck hunt hit.

844
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:20,500
Yeah, who doesn't? I mean, come on. I know. Andri sent five hundred sats for a little bit of gas money for Brent. Thank you.

845
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:26,500
CB sent seven hundred and seventy seven sats saying, how do you make an algorithm soup taste better?

846
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:33,500
You toss in a bullion cube. You know, we need like a, you know, like a drum kick set up.

847
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:41,500
I think I can figure that out. Yeah. Two hundred and twenty two sats from Fuzz Mistborn. First time boost.

848
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:46,500
I'm glad Chris likes his steam deck. I still love mine four months later, although I rarely use desktop mode.

849
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:51,500
Two hundred and twenty two sats from forty seven says Python's great to break sites.

850
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:56,500
Two hundred and twenty two sats from user four twenty six. Just to say hi. Thank you, everybody.

851
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:08,500
Hi, user four twenty six. We appreciate you helping us stay independent, keeping us honest to our audience and sending in your value for the show using a podcasting to app a new podcast apps dot com.

852
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:12,500
You can also use boost CLI if you don't want to switch apps or which nobody did this week.

853
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:22,500
Or you can use Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z dot technology. And if you want to hear me go on about the podcast industry in general and podcasting 2.0 and the features that J.B.

854
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:29,500
will be implementing in the future. I do. I do. Well, then go check out the podcasting 2.0 show over at the podcast index dot org because I was just on there.

855
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:34,500
Do you remember it was episode ninety one or four? I should know. I was just listening to it. I know I should know, too.

856
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:43,500
I have it right here. Episode ninety four bells out. If you want to check that out at the podcasting 2.0 show, I was on there with Adam and Dave and it was a lot of fun.

857
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:47,500
Thank you, everybody, for boosting. And did you hit your J.B. Bell? Is that why it was named like that?

858
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:52,500
There may have been a little bit of a bell off in the show. I don't want to give any spoilers.

859
01:20:52,500 --> 01:21:01,500
I had some Bell history with Adam that needed to get sorted out. That's just I'll just say that was really is a lot of fun.

860
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:07,500
And with that, we do have a few picks. Yeah, I think this is a qualifies as a quick pick.

861
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:18,500
You and I were doing office hours, I believe, and I was having struggles several weeks ago with some of my network connections and you and I were both pinging to try to figure out if it was you or if it was me.

862
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:24,500
And we just said, hey, there's this feature we really want, which is sort of in line.

863
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:35,500
Summaries of the ping, because previously, like an animal, you and I have been like stopping the ping process to get the summary of how many packets were lost.

864
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:47,500
And one of our wonderful listeners, I forget exactly who it was, but thank you, thank you, suggested you just hit control four and you'll get an inline sort of summary during the active ping.

865
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:54,500
It's a game changer. You don't have to control. See, you're paying to get my goodness to get the stats. You knew this, didn't you?

866
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:59,500
West West didn't react at all. You knew this, didn't you? You knew this and you didn't tell us. I didn't know.

867
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:06,500
I just don't know that much. I feel like I use something like MTR if I want more access with the MTR.

868
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:11,500
This is a great tip, though. I'm trying it right now. It is nice. It is. It is nice.

869
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:17,500
All right. I got a hot pick for you guys. I got a real hot pick. This is so fricking handy.

870
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:25,500
You can thank me with a boost. It's just simply called audio sharing, and it is the simplest application possible.

871
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:29,500
It's available however you want it. I've linked to the Flat Hub here page.

872
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:34,500
But say you want your audio on a different device from your computer, right? Oh, yeah.

873
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:39,500
Say you maybe got a speaker, you got a mobile device, you want to take the audio with you, whatever it is, right?

874
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:46,500
Maybe you want to watch it on your televisions. I don't know what you're doing, but you want remote audio from your laptop, your desktop, whatever.

875
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:53,500
This quickly and instantly creates an RTSP server with an audio stream from your desktop available.

876
01:22:53,500 --> 01:23:00,500
And so like on my iPhone here, I open up VLC. I paste in that RTSP address that it gives you.

877
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:06,500
It also gives you a QR code you can scan. And then immediately VLC begins playing back my computer's audio.

878
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:10,500
And I can even mute my local speakers like on my laptop and the audio will continue to play.

879
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:17,500
So then I can walk away with my phone and continue to hear the video that I was listening to on my laptop from my phone.

880
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:23,500
Any device that can stream RTSP, you can do this with. And it's instantaneous.

881
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:31,500
You just put this app on there on your machine and then you'll launch it and then open up VLC or whatever you use to look at RTSP streams.

882
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:38,500
And now you have the remote audio from your Linux box. It's so nice. I was using it this weekend, obviously, as you can tell.

883
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:43,500
I was I got I started a talk on Silverblue and then I was like, I got to go outside.

884
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:47,500
I got stuff to put the headphones on with my phone and just streamed it to my phone as I walked around the yard.

885
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:52,500
It was choice. Does it at all offer media controls as well?

886
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:58,500
Or do you have to do that natively or how is that process? So you're not going to get like play and pause, right?

887
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:03,500
Because it's just receiving a stream, but you'll get, of course, mute and pause on local on your local client.

888
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:09,500
But you can't stop the remote stream. But you may be able to just pair that with something like KD connective.

889
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:14,500
Oh, sure. Sure, you could. That would work pretty well, actually. Sure. You could take it to the next level.

890
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:20,500
I feel like I missed you didn't play a certain soundboard clip. Oh, is it? Did I miss that?

891
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:30,500
It's yeah. Wait, let me check it. Oh, it's rust based, huh? That's right. Well, I didn't even look in the repo.

892
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:34,500
This is the thing about flat back. You just slap them on your system. You don't even pay attention to the dependencies.

893
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:40,500
It doesn't even matter anymore. It's the brave new world. All right. Well, we got to wrap it up because it's getting hot in here.

894
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:45,500
But I did have one more pick. I mentioned that I was playing my old DOS games.

895
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:53,500
I got Star Trek Judgment Rights going. I got Voyager Elite Force going. I got Star Trek Away team going. I got Diablo going.

896
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:57,500
I mean, some of these games were literally pre windows. That's how old some of these games are.

897
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:03,500
OK, bottles. I know you guys probably know about it, but I'm going to give it a mention right here right now.

898
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:10,500
There is no slicker way to just set up a wine environment and get stuff installed, tweak the settings.

899
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:20,500
I can't believe what you can run with wine these days. So many applications, so many of our audio plugins that we like the special like emergency repair plugins that we sometimes have to use that are all windows based.

900
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:26,500
We can run them in wine now. The games I'm looking at, I can run a wine. So many desktop applications are running under wine.

901
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:31,500
It has really gotten impressive. And bottles is a front end that lets you set up different environments.

902
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:36,500
So you can have like a Windows 7 environment. You can have a DOS environment. You can have a Windows 10 environment.

903
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:42,500
It's cool. I'll also let you pull in like dependencies like fonts and nice. Yeah, yeah.

904
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:50,500
You know, it's amazing where wines at, especially because I feel like if no one told me they were starting the wine project today.

905
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:57,500
Might be a little skeptical, but like after all of this time and all of this effort, it has really gotten to an amazing place.

906
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:05,500
Bottles is so, so good. And it is it even like it's good at like telling you what it's doing and giving you status updates.

907
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:11,500
It's good at letting you manage the processes when like a wine process hangs. It's just that's killer.

908
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:15,500
All the things, all the things. So bottles is just a big recommend.

909
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:20,500
And then audio sharing, which we'll have a link to all of that, of course, in the show notes.

910
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:28,500
It's real simple. Linux Unplugged dot com slash four six eight. And if you want more show, don't forget, we do have the live stream goes on nice and long.

911
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:34,500
Lots of extra content in there. We try to make it interesting. And then we make that available to our members as a thank you as well.

912
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:43,500
Our members also get access to an ad free version of the show. Unplugged core dot com for that or Jupiter Party for all the shows.

913
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:48,500
And don't miss Linux Action News. We need a new plug for Linux Action News, but it's a companion to this show.

914
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:53,500
If you're not getting Linux Action News, you're missing out on the world of free software and open source, like there's a lot going on.

915
01:26:53,500 --> 01:27:00,500
And we try to hone that sucker in and get you really just what you need to know, get you in, get you out, make it really information dense.

916
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:04,500
Yeah, but if you're missing that, you don't have the same context we do for the nonsense we talk about on this show.

917
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:09,500
Could be true. It could be maybe that could be a thing that could we try not to. But that could be a thing.

918
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:15,500
And of course, sometimes we do have schedule changes and we try to get those listed at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar.

919
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:20,500
Hint, hint, hint on that one. The stream is at Jupiter Dot Tube.

920
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:24,500
If you'd like to watch the archive, the playback version or catch it live when we are live.

921
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:33,500
Jupiter Dot Tube for that. I've got a lot of URLs. I feel like I should stop mentioning them. So I'll just give one more plug for the JPL lottery sign up form.

922
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:39,500
Linux unplug dot com slash JPL. Simple threat there. It'll take you to our next cloud.

923
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:43,500
Well, one of them. We've got only like three of them. So that's one of our three next clouds.

924
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:50,500
You got to have more than one for safety. Yeah. Yeah. And all the other meetups that meet up dot com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

925
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:55,500
All right, everybody. Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of the unplugged program.

926
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:24,500
And I hope to see you right back here, not on Tuesday, but on Sunday.

927
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:45,500
I actually wanted to get back over with Brett because there was a there was a bit that we didn't get to here in the show notes.

928
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:51,500
And I'm curious what he's got in mind. I see it's just simply titled System 76 Teaser.

929
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:56,500
Yeah, I came across a little I think I'm going to call it like a little nugget.

930
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:04,500
I was trying to solve this Raspberry Pi, you know, install from one USB on to another issue.

931
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:16,500
And so as we do doing a bunch of research and I came across an issue on that Raspberry Pi for UEFI firmware image GitHub that I was playing with.

932
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:36,500
And so the little nugget is that there may or may not be a system 76 employee in there asking a few questions on perhaps how to get a pop 2204 arm 64 image working with UEFI in there, which is not exactly a public image at this point.

933
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:43,500
But I think something we're there working on internally. Look at you with the teasers, right?

I'm excited for you to continue your Raspberry Pi journeys, Brent, although I'm sorry that it started so rough.

935
01:29:48,500 --> 01:30:01,500
It's going to get easier in the future as finally, we are going to have mainline graphics core support hardware accelerated graphics with the Pi 4 cores.

936
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,500
That is exciting.

937
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:07,500
Which has been missing for a very, very, very long time.

938
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:16,500
This is the reason why Fedora 37 is going to have official support for the Pi 4 series because the graphics core is now finally mainline.

939
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,500
And here I thought I was excited about Fedora 37 already.

940
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:38,500
Will that be just in time for the Pi 5 to come out?
