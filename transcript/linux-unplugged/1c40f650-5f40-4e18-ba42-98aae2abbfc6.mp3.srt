1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
Isn't this news of Nvidia nerfing the RTX 3060 for crypto miners just sort of the warning

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:12,960
shot that really should be telling us open source drivers matter and open video hardware

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,680
might even be more important because Nvidia is going to just artificially limit the capabilities

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,600
of these cards via their driver.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,040
And I mean, no love lost here, no tears for the miners, but boy, this just grades on a

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,040
nerve of mine.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,040
Yeah, it's interesting.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,520
I love that they're trying to help gamers out and I think part of the idea here is right

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,240
now miners are the ones with the money because they're trying to make a buck off, you know,

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,860
mining Ethereum or whatever.

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,080
And so they're just paying all the high prices grabbing all the stock that exists.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,200
So if you create an artificial version that is just for gamers, okay, maybe that leaves

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,080
a little supply for some gamers, maybe, but you know what's going to happen.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,960
You'll have the miners that will just buy up the gaming cards and they'll have a hack

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,800
driver in under a month.

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,960
Well, you know, Nvidia addressed that and wrote that apparently there's a key handshake

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,200
between the driver, the RTX 3060 and the BIOS that prevents removal of the hash rate limiter.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
So it might be a challenge.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,780
Oh, that'll do it.

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,120
Until somebody just figures out how to put a Raspberry Pi in the middle and pull the

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,120
whole thing off anyways.

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:25,840
Hey there, good looking and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
My name is Chris.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
My name is Wes.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,000
Hello, Wes.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,400
Coming up on today's episode of the unplugged program, we're going to tell you how we have

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,920
managed to stick it out with Linux over the years.

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,560
I mean, at least once, maybe sometimes more, you get tempted by the fruit of another.

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,840
Well, listener John wrote into the show with a problem that's forcing him to consider dropping

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,260
Linux entirely.

31
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,720
So we'll share some hard learned wisdom on our part with him and some practical tools

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,080
to actually pull the whole thing off.

33
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,220
So that's coming up in the show.

34
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,920
But of course, we also have community news and a lot more to get into.

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,280
But first, we got to mod load up our virtual lug and say time appropriate greetings, Mumble

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Room.

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Hello, everyone.

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Well, hello.

39
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Hello.

40
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,760
You know, you guys, every time you manage to make me giggle and I don't know how, because

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,200
you know, I know it's coming, but you still make me smile.

42
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Thank you for being here.

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,160
We've had a little bit of connectivity issues today.

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,080
We don't know what's going on.

45
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,840
So appreciate you guys sticking it out with us.

46
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:34,200
It's kind of ironic because this week otherwise has been one of the coolest Linux production

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,400
achievement weeks for Wes and I in maybe about a year.

48
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,880
I mean, we have we're really flying on high cloud right now with Linux.

49
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,520
We are experiencing like a whole new revolution in tools for Linux and audio production.

50
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,200
And we're going to talk about some of that today, some new tech and just stuff that people

51
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,960
are working on for a little bit that's finally being realized and it's all kind of coming

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,040
together to make something special.

53
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,120
So connectivity issues aside, we've actually had a really, really solid week for Linux.

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,720
I mean, besides Wes and I and our our accomplishments that we'll share in a little bit, Linux also

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,460
made it to Mars in the last week since we all got together.

56
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,480
And I think a lot of us have been geeking out about Linux landing on Mars.

57
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,860
And we covered it a little bit in a recent episode of Linux Action News.

58
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,920
But if you've caught stuff since that episode, you may have caught that there was more Linux

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,080
and open source involved than has been widely reported during the Monday public unveiling

60
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,080
of the landing footage of the Mars rover, which was legitimately awesome.

61
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,080
Amazing.

62
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:47,000
In there, the NASA officials actually thanked open source and even name dropped FFmpeg directly.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,640
I grabbed a few seconds of that stream for you.

64
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,600
It's not perfect audio because they were having some packet loss in their stream at the time,

65
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,800
ironically, but I still wanted you to hear it.

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,320
And I want to add one more thing I wanted to mention about the camera technology and

67
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,400
then this data.

68
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,560
We haven't mentioned it, but in addition to use commercial cameras, we're using a commercial

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,360
computer and Intel based PC that's running Linux open source.

70
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,040
So it's the first open source, at least that I know of, open source Linux box running on

71
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,160
the surface of Mars, actually inside the rover.

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,120
It's quite compact.

73
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,560
And so there's the Linux operating system and we compress the video using FFmpeg, which

74
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,860
is another open source tool.

75
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,160
So thank you to the open source community for allowing us to use your amazing software.

76
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,480
In fact, there really is quite a bit of Linux and open source software making this mission

77
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
possible.

78
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,120
And if that's the kind of thing that interests you, well, definitely check out episode 177

79
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,960
of Linux Action News, because we've got some exclusive details about the open source software

80
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,840
powering multiple aspects of the mission hardware.

81
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,600
Yeah, it's not just Linux on the copter or on the landing system, but there's also a

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,240
lot of open source that's helping both systems do local processing.

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,420
And it was the highlight of my week.

84
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,200
We got to chat with the operations lead of the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars and he gave

85
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,000
us some of the Linux details and hardware details.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,240
And that is in Linux Action News 177.

87
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,100
If you haven't caught that one, it's pretty historic.

88
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,440
It's pretty historic that Linux helped them achieve something.

89
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,600
Linux and the open source software that was running on Linux helped them achieve something

90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,080
historic like that and kind of awesome that it crosses over with our area.

91
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,460
And then that this individual at JPL took the time out of his schedule when they're

92
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,720
probably pretty busy right now to answer questions for Linux Action News.

93
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Really wonderful.

94
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
It was pretty great.

95
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,840
Wes and I were geeking out pretty, pretty good.

96
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,000
And now it just gets better as we wait for more and more awesome pictures and videos

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
to come back from Mars.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,800
Yep, that Linux Copter will be flying in a few months.

99
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,600
And the system we talk about in that episode is what will be powering that flight.

100
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,180
And back here on Earth, the open build service from the SUSE folks is announcing that they

101
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:07,760
are introducing Flatpak support into the build service, which is brilliant.

102
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,680
And really, you don't have to do much.

103
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,080
They have a quick start guide.

104
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,740
Even if you've never built a Flatpak app, they say you can quickly get started by branching

105
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,340
their template package.

106
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,600
For a successful Flatpak build, you're going to need four things.

107
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,840
The project configuration, which you can get in that template, the project meta configuration,

108
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,160
oh yeah, a Flatpak manifest file, Flatpak.yaml.

109
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,040
You knew there was going to be a yaml file here somewhere, right?

110
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,600
And then, of course, whatever sources you're using in the form of a bunch of tar archives.

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,880
But once you've got that, you're on your way to making a Flatpak.

112
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,640
I don't think this replaces FlatHub necessarily, but I guess it gets you the Flatpak, then

113
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,080
you could turn around and publish on FlatHub.

114
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,000
I wonder if this is going to have interesting ramifications for Flatpak's adoption.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,200
Neil, do you have any thoughts on this being rolled out for the open build service?

116
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Yeah.

117
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,880
So I've taken a gander at the functionality and looked at it a bit.

118
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,880
So what it basically does is provide a way to run Flatpak Builder in the build service

119
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,800
environment depending against the normal runtimes and things like that.

120
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,860
But at the moment, they don't have a way of handling OS trees inside of the open SUSE

121
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,860
build service.

122
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:27,540
So without that piece, it's almost impossible right now to actually correctly publish Flatpaks

123
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,600
and such.

124
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,440
It actually takes a different approach from how Fedora has done this.

125
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,760
So for those who may not be aware, Fedora is also capable of building and publishing

126
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Flatpaks.

127
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,820
Well, publishing is the important part.

128
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,640
We can actually publish Flatpaks.

129
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,760
Fedora's technology works off of constructing its own runtime using the RPMs that make up

130
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,080
the Fedora distribution.

131
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:55,120
And then for applications, we use the Fedora modularity building tool chain to construct

132
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,000
using the existing spec files for various packages and constructing a Flatpak build

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,660
out of that and shipping that as an OCI container bundle.

134
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,880
So they publish to the container registry on registry.fedoraproject.org.

135
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:18,840
That registry can be used as a substitute for an OS tree remote to actually fetch Flatpaks

136
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,160
and run them.

137
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,980
And so that's how we've been shipping Flatpaks in Fedora.

138
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,940
And I think this is actually one of those steps for open SUSE to get there to be able

139
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:32,520
to build and release Flatpaks built on their own runtime using their own trusted inputs

140
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,840
and making it so that it becomes more accessible to ship software as Flatpaks.

141
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,720
So this is where I was going with it is do you think long term, I mean, a couple of years

142
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,240
down the road, we could see some of the desktop applications on a SUSE desktop or the open

143
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,480
SUSE desktop packaged as Flatpaks instead of RPMs?

144
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
I think so.

145
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,440
Yeah, I'm sure you've kind of seen this.

146
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,600
But for those who may be a little less familiar, there's an open SUSE, a micro OS, which is

147
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,960
a minimal platform that you can use for single purpose workloads or specialized workloads

148
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
and things like that.

149
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,400
That's a rolling but stable platform built on Tumbleweed.

150
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,360
There's also now a micro OS desktop, which lets you do this by your single purpose being

151
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,020
a desktop computer.

152
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,360
And then applications would generally be shipped in the form of Flatpaks and layered on top

153
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,400
of it that way.

154
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,400
So yeah, we could totally see a future where, like Fedora with Silverblue and Kinoite, you

155
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,480
will see micro OS desktop, Gnome and KDE doing the same thing.

156
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,120
Yeah, Colonel, I see you joking in the chat room, but I think there's some seriousness.

157
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,000
You're like, you're OK with this, but not if it's Snap.

158
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,520
So we're OK with Flatpaks, Colonel, but but not Snap doing this.

159
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,880
I'm fine if distros want to start shipping applications via Flatpak because the Flatpaks,

160
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,160
especially on Fedora and I haven't used them on OpenSUSE, but at least in Fedora, they

161
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,120
integrate in well.

162
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,960
There's no real performance hit.

163
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,000
And there are certain applications that I actually prefer to be in a Flatpak because

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,420
it's proprietary software and I like that sandboxing around that.

165
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:18,720
My issue with Snaps is that, A, they don't work well on distros that don't have app armored

166
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
by default.

167
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,420
They don't work well with SELinux.

168
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:28,360
And the other issue I have with Snaps is that regardless of the distro, you're always talking

169
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
back to Canonical.

170
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,920
Well, OK, but isn't all of those concerns and complaints irrelevant if you're on Ubuntu

171
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,880
because Ubuntu is already checking back with Canonical to check for updates.

172
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,620
Ubuntu isn't going to have some of those integration issues because it will have app armor and

173
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,200
all the components necessary to run Snaps.

174
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,940
Isn't it sort of validating the idea that there is actually some utility in moving away

175
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,840
from the distribution's core package manager, which by the way, not actually sure I agree

176
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
with.

177
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,980
But anyways, isn't other distributions attempting to do this with Flatpak sort of validating

178
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,240
what Canonical tried to do early with Snaps?

179
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,940
I think it really depends on that particular piece of software.

180
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,960
If it's a piece of software that is either proprietary or it's a piece of software that

181
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,140
pulls in proprietary components or it's a piece of software that's difficult to build

182
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:24,040
and maintain for the distro, I think a containerized solution in that case makes sense.

183
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:30,820
If it's something like Firefox or it's the desktop environment or it's something else

184
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,820
that's either heavily integrated in with your user experience and the distro or it's very

185
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:43,620
easily built and it's open source, I personally would prefer to have those maintained and

186
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,620
in the repos.

187
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,900
Yeah, I think that's how I fall down on it too, pretty much.

188
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,700
Well it's an interesting development and I could see the utility of it for certain applications.

189
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,880
Some that in the past maybe you had to add specific repos for and then install a bunch

190
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,920
of dependencies.

191
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,380
It remains a problem that needs a little bit of solving.

192
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,660
As somebody who's been trying to make Fedora work kind of to some futility because I just

193
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,900
can't get my hands on some software still, I appreciate this is not a problem that is

194
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,740
fully solved by repositories alone and there needs to be some other solution in here.

195
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,020
But while we're talking about Flatpaks, for you parents or maybe anybody out there who's

196
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:26,620
a Minecraft fan, there's this Bedrock edition that Microsoft created that is basically a

197
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:35,340
utopia of Microsoft components, ties in nicely with their store and Windows 10 and it's really

198
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:40,460
one of those kind of transitions that for my kids has been extremely tempting.

199
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,880
They traditionally use what is the standard version of Minecraft, the Java edition, which

200
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,060
has a huge community, tons of mods, years of history, but Microsoft, they couldn't have

201
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,060
that.

202
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,140
Something about embracing and extending?

203
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,140
I'm not sure.

204
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,140
Yeah.

205
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,020
So the Bedrock edition of Minecraft came along and that's sort of a rewrite of Minecraft

206
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,300
with more integration with Microsoft technologies and surprise, surprise, there's no Linux

207
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,100
version.

208
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,980
And this has been a bit of a point of contention with my kids because they'd like to have access

209
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,620
to it because a lot of their friends on their Windows 10 machines or whatever are playing

210
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,620
it.

211
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,820
And there isn't really any gaming stream service that offers it because it's a Microsoft game

212
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,940
and there's no Microsoft gaming streaming service that offers this via the web browser

213
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,980
right now.

214
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,020
So I did not have a great answer until today when I was browsing Flathub and I saw that

215
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:39,260
there is a Minecraft Bedrock launcher that you can download and play on Linux.

216
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,900
And it's clever because it appears to be using the Android version of this game but running

217
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,940
it on your Linux desktop.

218
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,940
Clever indeed.

219
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,940
Yeah.

220
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,940
And it's early.

221
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,020
It's a work in progress big time.

222
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,460
There's still several ways to make it crash and all of that.

223
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:01,200
But the author is continuing to update it and it's becoming the unofficial launcher

224
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,860
for the Minecraft Bedrock code base.

225
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,300
And they're not affiliated with Microsoft or anything like that but it shows real potential

226
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,420
and it could be another one of those things that helps me keep the kiddos on Linux which

227
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,540
I'm a big fan of because I hate for these silly app store games and stuff to be what

228
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,100
draws my kids off of a free operating system.

229
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,340
And it just sucks to have to also be on the other side and be like, well, I'm sorry, it

230
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,580
just doesn't exist on Linux.

231
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,580
Yeah.

232
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,580
You can't have access to it.

233
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,580
That must feel bad.

234
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,460
Well, they see it as a deficiency in Linux because their friends, it's just their computer

235
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,240
that has Windows on it and it just has this Microsoft store on it.

236
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,420
So I will put a link to that in the show notes or you can just go on Flat Hub and search

237
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,100
for Minecraft Bedrock Launcher and you'll find it over there.

238
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,900
And I'm going to give it a go probably this week.

239
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,660
So I'll find out how good it works I suppose and maybe I'll report back on it and see if

240
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,820
I solve the problem for the kiddos.

241
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,420
I think this whole topic was just an excuse so you could play more Minecraft.

242
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,160
Linode dot com slash unplugged.

243
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,740
Go there to receive a one hundred dollars, 60 day credit towards your new account and

244
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,740
of course, support the show.

245
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,500
It lets them know you heard about it here and it's kind of a way of saying, hey, thanks

246
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,300
for supporting my weekly Linux talk show.

247
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,280
Linode is the largest independent cloud right there.

248
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,100
How awesome is that?

249
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,060
Independent still after all these years.

250
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:22,780
They started in 2003, which is basically before time, before the cloud.

251
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,380
I mean, it's just forever ago because they're huge fans of Linux and they saw where things

252
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:31,140
were going in the kernel and in the user space and they were able to build a company around

253
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,140
that.

254
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,700
Over the years, they've managed to refine it into a lean mean cloud hosting machine

255
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,980
with native SSDs, 40 gigabit connections to the machines, revamped and easy to use cloud

256
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,760
manager that's extremely competitive, fast and very reliable.

257
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,420
They have an API that has a command line you can use, which you get really awesome when

258
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,180
you're doing like the drop down terminal thing and you run the Linode command line tool in

259
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,180
there.

260
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,140
And that interaction with their object storage or for managing your servers, I mean, it's

261
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,140
really great.

262
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:06,660
And Linode costs 30 to 50% less than the major cloud providers like AWS or Google or Azure,

263
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,460
which is great because they're an independent Linux company that's been around forever.

264
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,820
You get a real good balance of technology and price.

265
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,420
They have machines you can pick from that start at $5 a month.

266
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,420
Of course, they have systems with lots of dedicated CPU and memory or GPU, kind of depends

267
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,420
on what you need.

268
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,820
They make it really easy to go through and pick and that's why that $100 credit is fricking

269
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,580
great because you can really play around, see what works best for you.

270
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:34,520
So go to linode.com slash unplugged, get that $100 60 day credit and try something out.

271
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:40,100
And if you dig around on their site, you'll find some extremely useful utilities, guides,

272
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,120
how tos, you know, all that kind of stuff.

273
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,660
And one I'll throw a link to in the show notes because it was just updated a couple of days

274
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,040
ago is the Linux system monitoring fundamentals.

275
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,420
This is a great way to wrap your head around what might need to be monitored on a Linux

276
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,420
system.

277
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,460
What might be the best tool to collect that depending on what your needs are and get a

278
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,280
good rundown of the entire thing.

279
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,220
It's an example of an area that Linode is always investing in and we'll have a link

280
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,180
to that in the show notes for the Linux system monitoring fundamentals that you can run through

281
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,980
and get an idea of maybe what you could be looking at to properly monitor your Linux

282
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,980
box.

283
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,060
And of course, they build a lot of those analytics into the dashboard to give you a quick snapshot

284
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,020
of that too and that's extremely useful as well.

285
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,860
So go check them out, linode.com slash unplugged.

286
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,940
Get that $100 60 day credit and a big thank you to everybody who does that and supports

287
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,100
the show.

288
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,140
It's what makes it possible for us to do this and for us to remain independent, linode.com

289
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,620
slash unplugged.

290
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,900
There is some big GNOME developments or GNOME developments this week.

291
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,580
GNOME Shell and Mudder have hit a bit of a 40 version milestone with the beta being released

292
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,600
and things really kind of coming together.

293
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,780
If you can get your hands on the freshest builds of GNOME, you're going to see essentially

294
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,380
the almost near final design for the new shell.

295
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,780
It's getting real close.

296
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,540
Oh, yeah.

297
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:05,220
In GNOME Shell 40 beta, you'll see the redesign to the overview area.

298
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,540
Out of date extensions are now disabled by default.

299
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,400
Hey, that's nice to see because you don't want a busted and old extension plus a wide

300
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,780
variety of fixes, just general bug fixes, but also some crash fixes.

301
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,780
That's nice.

302
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,780
Yeah, really, right?

303
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,660
As for Mudder, well, it's now defaulting to starting X Wayland on demand.

304
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,620
It gained support for atomic mode setting, improved touch mode heuristics, which that's

305
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:34,260
nice too, and of course, defaulting to the horizontal workspace layout.

306
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,540
Yeah, we're going to talk more about that.

307
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:44,300
Alan Day over at the GNOME Shell and Mudder blog did a post just before the show started

308
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,620
about the horizontal layout and the multi-monitor stuff.

309
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,940
Stick with us here, guys, because we got to chew on this a little bit because as you know,

310
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,300
these things tend to have lasting ramifications.

311
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,780
I think it's important to note here that the development team for GNOME seems to be listening

312
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,260
to what people are saying.

313
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:09,600
Alan writes, multi-monitor has come up a fair bit in conversations about the GNOME Shell

314
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,940
UI changes that are coming in GNOME 40.

315
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,140
There has been uncertainty and anxiety in this area.

316
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,620
I just don't think that's an overstatement.

317
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,320
I think if you go back a few weeks and you hear my conversation with Carl, there is some

318
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,500
anxiety in how multi-monitor users are going to use these new updates.

319
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,740
So he goes on to say, so we wanted to provide more detail on what the multi-monitor experience

320
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,540
will be exactly like so people know what to expect.

321
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:43,100
Now, in many key respects, multi-monitor handling in GNOME 40 will be basically identical to

322
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,580
how it is in 3.3.8.

323
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,500
GNOME 40 still defaults to workspaces only on the primary display, as we've had since

324
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,120
3.0.

325
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,660
The top bar in overview will only be shown on the primary display and the number of workspaces

326
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,540
will still be dynamic.

327
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:03,380
So in many respects, GNOME 40 should feel very similar to previous GNOME versions.

328
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:08,860
But there are still some changes and some unanswered questions about what exactly is

329
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,860
changing.

330
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,860
Yeah, and that's fair.

331
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,360
And there are some good visuals that we'll have linked in this GNOME post.

332
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,340
They tried to specifically illustrate what he's talking about.

333
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,740
But the key here is, like Wes said, GNOME 40 will continue to default to only showing

334
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,260
one workspace on the primary display.

335
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:30,260
When we have a dual display setup, the overview on the other screen will be just that workspace.

336
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,920
It'll zoom back like the primary display does, and it'll overview all of the screens.

337
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,580
But that workspace on that second screen, that won't change.

338
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,980
But they're making some tweaks in how it's displayed, and the team feels like that presentation,

339
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,700
the tweaking they're doing, will help people understand with multiple displays how this

340
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
works more clearly.

341
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,100
Now, while workspaces only being on the primary display, as we mentioned, it's the default

342
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
behavior.

343
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:00,660
GNOME also supports having workspaces on all displays using the workspaces only on primary

344
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,380
settings key.

345
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,500
This is pretty similar to how workspaces work with just only on primary configuration, but

346
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,980
the main difference is you can see the additional workspaces extending to the right on the secondary

347
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,980
display.

348
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,620
It's also possible to see that the workspace navigator, that small little set of thumbnails

349
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,440
up at the top, that's now visible on both displays.

350
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,540
It's a new change in GNOME 40, and it's intended to hopefully improve the experience for users

351
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,180
to actually have workspaces on all displays.

352
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,420
I think a few people have pointed out that horizontal workspaces aren't going to work

353
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,480
for them.

354
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,420
But if you think about it, it is how a lot of the desktop environments do it today already.

355
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,860
It's sort of been kind of standard.

356
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,780
And what I think needs to now be appreciated, and why we wanted to go through some of these

357
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,900
details with you, is when GNOME 40 launches, it's going to be kind of controversial.

358
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,980
There'll be different headlines about it.

359
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,780
There'll be different hot takes on incumbent threads, and I think it should be reflected

360
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:01,020
in that future conversation that the team listened and made some tweaks and even has

361
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,260
some further adjustments they want to make long term.

362
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,440
They say, in case there's any doubt, multi-monitor is absolutely a priority for us in the shell

363
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,720
design team.

364
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,380
We know that the multi-monitor experience is important to many GNOME users, including

365
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,620
many of us who work on GNOME, and it's something that we're committed to improving.

366
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,140
That's a commitment, right, from the top there.

367
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,500
I think it's notable and should be considered in the future conversation.

368
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
Yes.

369
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,300
I think the other part here, too, as Alan mentions, is that we actually have a few plans

370
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,860
for multi-monitor improvements in the future, and some of these predate the GNOME 40 work

371
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,500
that's currently happening.

372
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,140
So there's more in the pipeline.

373
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,340
They're hoping to get back to that after all these GNOME 40 changes, but this isn't something

374
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,960
new that they just started considering after the feedback.

375
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,180
It's been there the whole time.

376
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,300
And then just also in the new stuff department, something that we're going to be telling you

377
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,300
more about soon, we have an update on that.

378
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:55,340
And then my plan, too, by the way, is to switch to GNOME, win 40 launches, and give it an

379
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,700
honest go for a bit, see how things go on the GNOME side for a while, because I've been

380
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,240
living Plasma for a long time, I like it a lot, but I want to give this a fair shot.

381
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,340
So when GNOME 40 lands, I'm going to make the switch for a bit.

382
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,420
Not in protest, but because I want to.

383
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,660
But something that I'm playing with right now, I don't have to wait around for, is pipe

384
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,660
wire.

385
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,660
It's getting really exciting, and Wes and I have had an opportunity to use it in a couple

386
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,820
of scenarios now in production.

387
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,660
And there's a new version that's just been released this week, with a lot of stuff landing,

388
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,260
I think, Wes, to get it ready for Fedora 34.

389
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,740
Yeah, PipeWire 0.3.22 was released this week.

390
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,460
A whole lot of work, yeah, and a lot of that focused around making sure that Fedora 34

391
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,020
can hopefully ship it as default this coming spring.

392
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,940
Some of the highlights of this release are per-client configuration files, that's some

393
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,940
nice customizability, support for pro audio cards, Bluetooth audio improvements, better

394
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:57,300
sync, support for HFP, HF, that profile, and most notably for us, improvements in their

395
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
jack support.

396
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,460
So I think this is one of the funny things about PipeWire, is I think it gets talked

397
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:07,220
a lot about as a jack replacement, but ironically, one of the things that Wes and I are finding

398
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:13,340
best about PipeWire is how it plugs into existing jack tools and makes it even simpler and more

399
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,500
reliable and easier in a lot of ways to use.

400
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,300
It really unifies the desktop Linux audio scene.

401
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,780
Suddenly you can use these jack tools with regular Pulse audio apps.

402
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,460
You don't have to convert everything over, PipeWire brings them all together.

403
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,940
It's been pretty exciting.

404
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,020
And I'll save it because we have more to talk about on that front.

405
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:37,180
We should probably wait and do our due diligence and do a little cleaning up around here.

406
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:43,540
We do have some housekeeping, just a few things to let you know about to keep the show on

407
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,540
the road.

408
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,740
And that, and first and foremost is we love hearing from you.

409
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,600
We love it when you can participate in the conversation outside just when the show is

410
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,440
live or just when the show is released.

411
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,560
That conversation, it's always rolling in our telegram group at jupiterbroadcasting.com

412
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,860
slash telegram.

413
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,500
And then additionally, check out the Luplug on Sunday.

414
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,920
It goes down at noon Pacific, 3pm Eastern.

415
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:11,300
On Sundays we have the details at linuxunplug.com slash mumble if you want to get connected.

416
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,100
And I wanted to mention something about this.

417
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,820
I'm not really a big social person.

418
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,660
I don't generally go out and hang out at a bar and socialize.

419
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,140
Generally when I'm off air, I kind of keep to myself.

420
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,780
You're hiding away in the woods.

421
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,780
Right.

422
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:33,980
But I still get a lot of enjoyment and fulfillment out of attending the Luplug.

423
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,260
It's nice to hang out with people who know what you're talking about and are excited

424
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,500
about the same stuff you're excited about.

425
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,700
And they always either have just a conversation that it's open and everybody can jump in or

426
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,660
sometimes they have presentations happening too.

427
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,200
Things are always in the works.

428
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,540
So I encourage you to join on Sundays and we have that up on the calendar to get it

429
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,680
in your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

430
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,980
Also over there on our website we have the all shows feed so you can subscribe and get

431
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,980
all of those shows.

432
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:04,060
We have some really great stuff in the works for Koda radio and self-hosted and of course

433
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:08,100
we just mentioned a killer Linux action news that went out this week so why not make it

434
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,100
easy on yourself.

435
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,740
Get the all shows feed and then you just get everything in one solid feed.

436
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,740
Mr. Payne is there anything else we need to clean up around here?

437
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,820
No, looks pretty tidy to me.

438
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,820
Thank you.

439
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,820
Just set that bag over there.

440
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,820
OK.

441
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,820
Appreciate it.

442
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:29,260
Let's take a moment and thank a Cloud Guru for sponsoring this episode of Linux Unplugged

443
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,620
and there is a special opportunity right now.

444
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,020
You can save 20 percent on ACG's annual plans.

445
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,420
20 percent when you use the promo code SPRINGINTOCLOUD21.

446
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,420
All one word?

447
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,420
But you know the cloud's growing.

448
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:47,820
I mean we see it around us all the time and of course that means there's demand for skilled

449
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,860
cloud professionals and that's increasing all the time.

450
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,580
82 percent of hiring managers say that cloud certificates make a candidate more attractive

451
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,780
for hiring.

452
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,860
So maybe it's time to go keep modern, keep up to date and grow your skills and your career.

453
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,860
Get 20 percent off the most effective and hands-on cloud learning.

454
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,140
Keep up with change and develop the new skills you need at a Cloud Guru.

455
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:18,380
So get 25 percent off, go to a cloudguru.com and use the annual promo code SPRINGINTOCLOUD21.

456
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:22,580
Ninety-five percent of their learners say that their tools and content directly helped

457
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,860
advance their career.

458
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,340
Ninety-five percent.

459
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:32,160
And you can get an annual plan for 20 percent off SPRINGINTOCLOUD21.

460
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:37,400
We got an email into the show that we thought we should hold and maybe make into a wider

461
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:43,060
conversation because it's a bigger question and the longer you use Linux the more opportunities

462
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,340
you have to be tempted by the fruit of another.

463
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,740
And so we thought let's have a conversation about how we stick with it.

464
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,060
How do we manage to stick it out?

465
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,060
Sometimes it's hard.

466
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,060
Yeah.

467
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,060
It takes work.

468
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,060
It takes time.

469
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,740
And so this email from John, listener John, came into the show and we realized it was

470
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,100
really about two things.

471
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,380
How do we stick with Linux on the long haul when we get tempted?

472
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,420
And what's the current snapshot of media production on Linux and some of those tools that seem

473
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,420
so tempting by the other platforms?

474
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,700
How are we doing on the Linux side?

475
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,960
And there of course have been some big boosts recently that have landed for Linux content

476
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,340
creators that we haven't really talked about much on air in one cohesive piece.

477
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,700
So we thought, you know, our buddy Drew, perfect guy to tackle this, right?

478
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,860
I mean this is his sweet spot right here.

479
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,980
He's gone above and beyond in the past to stick with Linux.

480
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,740
He's documented that before on Joe's Late Night Linux Extra.

481
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,940
And he's also mastered audio editing and mixing on Linux.

482
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,480
So he's really kind of in this area.

483
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,700
So we called him up last night to chat about this.

484
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,820
And Virtual Lug, I want you to listen along and then flag me in the chat with your thoughts

485
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,420
and then we're going to follow up after this chat with Drew and expand on it a little bit.

486
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,180
So we'll go back in time to last night when we called up Drew.

487
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,080
Hey guys, how you doing?

488
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,980
It's been a minute and this really felt like it was in your wheelhouse.

489
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,620
Are you ready to help us solve a couple of particular problems?

490
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,340
I will certainly try.

491
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,040
I'll do my best here.

492
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
No promises, of course.

493
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,780
No, it's just all resting on your shoulders and it goes like this.

494
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,860
John writes into the show, greeting lepers, do you sometimes wonder if it's time to give

495
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,980
up on Linux as your daily driver?

496
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:34,260
I'm no stranger to Linux, having built a PC with bespoke components in 1995 so that I

497
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:39,560
could run Slackware 1.0 on a 15 inch CRT monitor.

498
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:45,060
But I've used the Mac exclusively since 2000 after starting a new job in a window shop

499
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,060
in 2008.

500
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,680
I just didn't feel like spending the money to go upgrade to a new MacBook Pro.

501
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,420
So I found myself exploring desktop environments.

502
00:29:54,420 --> 00:30:00,420
But about a year ago, I bought a System76 Lemur Pro running Pop OS.

503
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,420
And here's my dilemma.

504
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,980
I love my Lemur Pro.

505
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,020
I love it.

506
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:09,100
But since getting it, I've decided maybe I'd return to podcasting.

507
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,340
And that's where things have become a problem.

508
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,660
I find that I need to run a VM for certain audio applications frequently.

509
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:22,420
It started with DScript, then the Rodecaster Pro utilities, the Hindenburg Journalist Pro,

510
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:27,220
and I just find myself in Windows more often than I would like.

511
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,900
And I hate Windows.

512
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:34,420
Sure there are plenty of digital audio workstations out there available for Linux.

513
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,420
But DScript?

514
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,080
DScript will probably never be available.

515
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,260
And it's just amazing how much faster DScript is than a traditional editor.

516
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,120
And at what point do I just give up?

517
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,140
What point do I just give up and return to a mainstream desktop?

518
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,660
Is it when I have two apps in a VM?

519
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,340
Is it three apps in a VM?

520
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,340
Where's the line?

521
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,460
And what do you guys think?

522
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,460
Thanks in advance.

523
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,460
And I'm interested to hear your thoughts.

524
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,680
Now I thought, Drew, this is really two questions.

525
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,400
This is, how do you stick with Linux when things get a little tough?

526
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,860
And how do you produce content on Linux?

527
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,620
And I was curious to get your take on both of these, because obviously they're right

528
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,620
in your wheelhouse.

529
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,620
Okay.

530
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:19,260
So first things first, honestly, use the tool that is the most comfortable and the best

531
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,780
for you.

532
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,980
Yes, you can do all of this on Linux.

533
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:30,260
But if you absolutely have to have DScript or whatever other tool that only runs on Windows,

534
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,940
and that's the only way you want to do it, just do it on Windows.

535
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,940
Nothing's stopping you.

536
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,460
I mean, yeah, if you hate Windows and you don't want to be going back and forth into

537
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:45,820
a VM or dual booting or whatever, you can certainly do it on Linux.

538
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,060
The way I do it is with Reaper.

539
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:55,880
I also use Yawbridge for some Windows VSTs that I quite like, and they run great on Linux.

540
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:01,460
And I have set up my Reaper with so many keyboard shortcuts and macros, I don't even remember

541
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,100
what the defaults are anymore.

542
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,900
And those make me considerably faster than I would be in something like Ardor or what

543
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,900
have you.

544
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:16,060
So, I don't know, I mean, I want to say, yeah, do it all on Linux.

545
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:21,900
But at the same time, it's like, well, if DScript is really that important to your workflow,

546
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:27,540
if this other tool is that important to your workflow, use the best tool that you have

547
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,940
available to you.

548
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:33,500
It also seems like there's maybe a trade-off of how invested do you want to be in playing

549
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,500
with that tooling?

550
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,140
Like, I know, Joe, as you said, you've spent a lot of time customizing Reaper to work well

551
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,140
for you.

552
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,000
And you've also definitely learned the ins and outs of working with wine, making things

553
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,100
like Yawbridge work nicely.

554
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:49,340
But that might not be interesting enough or worthwhile enough if folks just want to concentrate

555
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,780
on whatever that application is.

556
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,780
Oh, for sure.

557
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:56,380
I mean, I had the privilege of working in a job where I could work on this stuff all

558
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,500
day and get paid to figure out how to do this stuff on Linux.

559
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,700
So that certainly helped.

560
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,700
But if that's not your jam, and it's not your jam, there's no shame in that.

561
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,460
Here's where I think the struggle comes in.

562
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,500
Because if you and I were having this conversation, you'd tell me just suck it up and use Reaper

563
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,560
on Linux is what you'd actually, that's what you'd really say to me.

564
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,840
But here's where the problem is.

565
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,780
So let's focus in on DScript because it's a really good example.

566
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:32,660
DScript is a new kind of audio editor that uses a cloud component to analyze audio and

567
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,300
create and generate a transcript.

568
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,140
And then it allows you to edit the audio like you would edit a text document.

569
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:44,060
So you edit the transcript and on the back end, the application does audio editing.

570
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:49,020
But what's even more incredible is, of course, this is going to have just full disclaimer,

571
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:54,660
probably very, very poor results compared to someone who knows how to edit.

572
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,860
But something else it offers is you can actually copy and paste text.

573
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:04,660
And it will generate the audio of you saying those things based on what its machine learning

574
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,620
has figured out from how you spoke the other words.

575
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:13,100
And it can actually generate you saying the or adding a word into an audio track.

576
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,100
Wow.

577
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,900
Yeah, it's pretty remarkable.

578
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:20,980
So you can have like for me, the compelling thing would be the use case that even for

579
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:28,100
this podcast right here would be you download a two hour talk from, say, Foss Talk or from

580
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,380
Linux Fest or from whatever, you know, event that might be.

581
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,500
Maybe somebody you love is up there doing something or has some topic that you want

582
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,020
to know more about.

583
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,300
You could download it into this DScript editor.

584
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,340
It would generate a transcript of the entire thing for you, which is fairly accurate and

585
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,340
getting better all the time.

586
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:48,000
And this is a this is a tool that is being used at some scale right now.

587
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,220
So it's not like it's vaporware.

588
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,660
And you could just search the document for the section of the talk that we wanted, like

589
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,180
somebody maybe talking specifically about a component for three minutes in a two hour

590
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,180
talk.

591
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,980
And I could grab that audio for the show that way.

592
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,300
I mean, it's a very compelling tool.

593
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:09,260
The problem is it only works on the Mac and I don't want to run on the Mac.

594
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,660
And the Mac is a pain in the ass to virtualize.

595
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,940
The Macs are extremely expensive.

596
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,940
Mac OS really locks you in.

597
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,900
I want to use Linux for everything else.

598
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,420
But from time to time, there's tools like this that have come along and you've got to

599
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,060
acknowledge this must have hit you at some point, too, Drew, where at some point in the

600
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:31,460
last decade, tools come along that's only available on another platform and it's tugged

601
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:36,220
at your, oh, maybe I should consider getting a Mac or maybe I should consider installing

602
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,220
Windows.

603
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,420
Or it's tugged on that that that thing that tempts you to leave the Linux platform.

604
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,700
And I'm curious what you've done in those situations.

605
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,340
Like did you explore it and then come back?

606
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,620
Or did you find a way to stick with Linux?

607
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:55,640
That's a tricky question for me, because remember, I'm coming from doing rock and roll and live

608
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,660
shows for years and years and years, right?

609
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:07,700
So I was used to real hardware mixers and outboard compression gear and stuff like that.

610
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:15,020
So for me, it's less about, oh, this tool is really cool and more I need it to sound

611
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,020
this way.

612
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,220
How do I get there?

613
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:24,040
So I'm a little less of like, oh, it's got to be this one specific tool and more I just

614
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,500
need it to do what I need it to do.

615
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,500
And it turns out there's a wide variety of plugins that work really well on Linux.

616
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:37,020
And sure, I use some Windows stuff because it works really well and I like the way it's

617
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,340
designed and it sounds great and all of that.

618
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:44,140
But I can still do it on Linux through Winebridge.

619
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,780
So no, I haven't really gone out and said, oh, well, you know, I need to be using this

620
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:55,560
tool that's only on Mac or that's only on Windows because it's just not that interesting

621
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,660
to me.

622
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:02,220
I'd rather use what I'm more comfortable with and find a tool that will do what I want it

623
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,860
to do in the platform I'm on.

624
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,140
But I'm also, you know, weird that way.

625
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,140
What about you, S?

626
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,260
Have you ever wandered away from Linux for a bit and then found your way back?

627
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:15,820
I mean, I definitely have had more VMs in the past.

628
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:20,660
I think partly, and this is definitely a position of privilege, but I tend to try to avoid things

629
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,620
like that if I can.

630
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,180
And I'll be the first to admit, sometimes that means I'm using a worse solution.

631
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,740
This is in a different space entirely, but Plex is kind of one of those things.

632
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,220
I mean, I have a Plex account.

633
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,900
I watch stuff on Plex from people's shares, but I've kind of purposefully avoided really

634
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,940
investing all in because I knew that there were open source solutions and I was willing

635
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,940
to make that work.

636
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:45,160
It doesn't mean I don't appreciate some of the nicer aspects that some of these more

637
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,960
proprietary products might have, but maybe to Drew's point, if I can focus on the goal

638
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,080
that I have and then evaluate the tools and if it meets that goal enough and it makes

639
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,240
me comfortable and it's on the system that it already works, I kind of just try to focus

640
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,240
on that.

641
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,240
Yeah.

642
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,900
I feel like what John is hitting up against when he writes in is he switched back to Linux,

643
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,460
he got the Lemur, and then he's like, man, this thing is powerful.

644
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,740
I could produce an entire podcast on this thing.

645
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:18,580
And when you haven't been on Linux for a while or you're new to it, you don't really have

646
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,740
a lot of knowledge to pull from.

647
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,500
And so the first solutions that start coming to you are going to be from the platforms

648
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,500
you're most familiar with.

649
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,500
So if you spent the most time on Mac and Windows, you're going to kind of almost already know

650
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,780
what direction to go in for those platforms and not really know where to even start with

651
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,780
Linux.

652
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,780
Right.

653
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,340
You framed it in the terms of how the problem would be on Mac and Windows even.

654
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,340
Yeah.

655
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,340
Yeah.

656
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,060
And I totally get that too when you're just trying to get something done.

657
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,860
And I think that's where Drew's overall point is really a sound one, is don't feel guilty

658
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
about it.

659
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,900
Use the right tool for the job.

660
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,860
Maybe it means you end up using Linux for 80% of your desktop use, but you have a laptop

661
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,220
that runs another operating system that you use for another tool.

662
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,220
Yes.

663
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,480
That's definitely something we've both explored too, I think, is, you know, you don't look

664
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,940
down on someone who has a piece of hardware or audio gear.

665
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,020
And yes, a Mac is more of a general purpose computer.

666
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,820
And of course, in the Linux and open source world, we have issues with those being locked

667
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,820
down.

668
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,540
But if you just set it aside as a purpose built, this is how I edit my podcasts or maybe

669
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:22,580
this is how I do my like outlook for work and I keep my communications on this and then

670
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:26,920
I have desktop Linux and all the joys on everything else.

671
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,880
Sometimes the compartmentalization can be nice, especially, I would say, invest in making

672
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,740
sure that you're not paying a really large tax in switching systems because the second

673
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,880
you're like, oh, I've got to unplug cables just to get my Linux desktop back set up to

674
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,340
my monitors.

675
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,460
That's where it's tempting to stop doing that.

676
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,140
But if you've got it all set up nicely, you've got a KVM switch or whatever makes it simple

677
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,860
to switch to the system you need for the task you want, and then get back to desktop Linux.

678
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,420
I find that much easier, totally well put.

679
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,940
And I'm going to I'll add this before we get into some tools here, because that's the second

680
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,380
part of this question.

681
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,980
But I think this is a good spot to transition.

682
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,940
But I will just add this that long term, if you invest the time to do the production under

683
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:11,140
Linux, that is where the puck is skating to what we can do now in Linux with PipeWire

684
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:19,180
and Jack and Reaper and applications like Sonobus are so far beyond what was capable

685
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,560
when I started about 15 years ago, that just yesterday, Wes and I were working on something

686
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,300
that I was thinking to myself, if I could have told 15 year version of me that there

687
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,020
would have been a go that there would have been something like this, I wouldn't have

688
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,060
even understood how it could have been possible, what Linux can do today.

689
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:41,540
It's so it is advanced so far in media production.

690
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,860
And if so, if you take the time to learn it, and you're willing to invest it, and you have

691
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,500
that time to invest, eventually, it pays off this entire conversation that we're having

692
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
right now.

693
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,780
We're all on Linux.

694
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:57,820
We're all doing it with tools that are integrated into our audio subsystem at a very awesome

695
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,860
level that I didn't think would even be possible.

696
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,100
And we're just using it to have this chat right now.

697
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,920
It's so cool.

698
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,420
So let's talk a little bit about the tools.

699
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:14,140
Because Drew in there, you mentioned Reaper, he's really liking this Hindenburg journalist

700
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,660
audio editor, which kind of is like GarageBand, but for podcasts, and it really blocks things

701
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,220
up really nicely.

702
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,220
It's a really easy to lay it out kind of podcast, I don't know how it would work if you have

703
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:28,800
like eight tracks, and it was two hours long, but it seems like it's very approachable.

704
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,900
But there are a lot of tools available for Linux today that were only available, that

705
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,580
have only been around for a couple of years, so I thought maybe we could hit on a couple

706
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,580
of the highlights.

707
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,580
Reaper is obviously one of them.

708
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,920
But I think beyond that, it's kind of how you have learned to use the tool.

709
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,540
And we should disclaim that Reaper is a digital audio workstation style editor.

710
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,980
It's what we use to record the shows.

711
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,880
And it's one of Drew's go to tools.

712
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,460
And we should probably also note that it is proprietary, although very reasonably priced.

713
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,460
Yep.

714
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,540
So what do you think, Drew, besides just Reaper itself, it's how you use it.

715
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,980
There's other tools as well.

716
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,960
Give us a snapshot of what you consider to be the state of Linux podcasting tools right

717
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,960
now.

718
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,980
There are a lot of plugins that are available for Linux, like directly, natively for Linux

719
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,380
that you don't even have to put through a bridge.

720
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:20,020
And I know we're going to harp on Reaper a lot, but because it's amazing, they have a

721
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:27,380
bunch of tools in the box that are available for free for Linux, like studio quality compressors,

722
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:35,180
studio quality reverb units, really, really cool stuff that you can use for free.

723
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,020
Not even just in Reaper, they release them as VSTs that you can load on your system.

724
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:44,820
They're not the prettiest, but they definitely get the job done.

725
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,940
So definitely check out the Reaper plugins.

726
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:53,300
Even if you're not using Reaper itself, but you have something that is VST capable.

727
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,500
They're great.

728
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,140
Ardor also has a lot of great built-in plugins.

729
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:02,620
There's the CAF plugins, which I don't really like that much, but they've been around forever.

730
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,460
They're kind of a staple.

731
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:11,960
There's the LSP plugins collection, which is fantastic and really good to use, although

732
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,500
I do find they're a little heavy on the CPU.

733
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,360
Air windows is available for Linux.

734
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,680
There's all kinds of stuff out there that can help you with your mixes.

735
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:30,580
As far as editing, for podcast production, I don't find Ardor to be very good, personally.

736
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:36,980
The editor is not geared towards this kind of production and it's a lot harder to make

737
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,180
it be that way.

738
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:43,620
I edited on that for a long time before Reaper came to Linux and it's a great editor.

739
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:49,340
In my opinion, it's probably the best multi-track recorder out there.

740
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,140
But for editing podcast, it's really hard, it's really slow.

741
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,140
It's fair.

742
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,980
I completely agree with your take.

743
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,620
It's probably better for music production.

744
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,780
Yeah, it's great for music production.

745
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,540
Seems like it works nice too sometimes, maybe just setting up for mixing or routing or applying

746
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,540
effects live.

747
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,540
Yep.

748
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,540
Mm-hmm.

749
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:11,120
I think we have to also mention what Wes and I are extremely, and Drew too, very excited

750
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,940
about is Sonobus, which we mentioned last week on the show as an app pick, but we've

751
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,620
been using it this week as the method that we communicate.

752
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:25,340
And it is a Linux desktop app also available for the other desktops and mobile devices

753
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,340
that use...

754
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:32,460
And it's open source and it uses Opus to create a peer-to-peer audio session that is incredible

755
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:37,100
audio quality that integrates in with jack audio so we can route it around with everything

756
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,820
else that we route with jack audio in our system and bring it directly into our audio

757
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,820
editor.

758
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,860
This is radio quality grade software.

759
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,660
I mean, it sounds incredible and the latency is the best you're going to get.

760
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,460
It gives you data that the other tools don't give you.

761
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,980
You combine that with PipeWire, which Wes and I have just begun messing with for remote

762
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:01,300
production setups and PipeWire brings some functionality.

763
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:06,140
It's like not all of it, but some core functionality that you get from a software on the Mac called

764
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:11,500
Audio Hijack Pro, which is one of those third-party Mac software tools that in the past I've

765
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,900
looked at and gone, Oh God, I'd love to have that on Linux.

766
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,900
I would love to have that.

767
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,060
But PipeWire gets a lot of it of what I would need.

768
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,740
There's a lot more Audio Hijack can do, but PipeWire is also new, but we were just playing

769
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:28,860
around with that last night where I was able to take the audio output of applications like

770
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:38,020
Firefox and VLC and then route them all into Sonobus using PipeWire and the jack tools

771
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,460
that you can use to manipulate some of those settings.

772
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:46,460
And it means that I could host a remote streaming session all on one laptop recording with separate

773
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:51,600
audio tracks all routed through PipeWire going through Sonobus back to the studio.

774
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,280
And it just is seamless.

775
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,620
It's really awesome stuff.

776
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,540
The other part too is some of this stuff was definitely already possible, especially with

777
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:03,960
Jack, but it was a little more complicated than I think you especially were really interested

778
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,960
in investing in.

779
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,500
You had to manipulate a whole bunch of pulse audio bridges and run some command line stuff,

780
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:14,100
but this was just you pulled up one tool and you could move audio wherever you want it.

781
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,480
I think I've heard just about every Linux podcaster make a joke about Jack audio being

782
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,740
too complicated at some point, you know, it's like it's it's a cliche about how complicated

783
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,740
Jack is.

784
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,940
Well, and they're not wrong.

785
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:33,540
I mean, Jack is really designed to function like you would route cables in a studio to

786
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,260
real hardware.

787
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,200
That's the way it's set up.

788
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,960
And if you don't have that background and don't want to learn that stuff, you just want

789
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,020
it to work.

790
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,420
It's not the tool for you.

791
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,420
Right.

792
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,540
But yeah, PipeWire is amazing.

793
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:49,800
I've been using it for a few months now and it's only gotten better.

794
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,020
You bring things like PipeWire landing in Fedora 34.

795
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,100
It's available in just about every distro right now.

796
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:59,200
It's super simple to get up and running in just about any modern distro.

797
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,720
You bring PipeWire together, something like Sonobus and a tool like Reaper and you have

798
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,060
everything I needed to build a studio four years ago in a laptop or a desktop all on

799
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,940
Linux.

800
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,420
Most of it free software with the exception of Reaper.

801
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,260
It's just it's really awesome.

802
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:21,340
So John, it is worth learning because when you do get all the pieces together, what you

803
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,600
get is vendor independence.

804
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:28,840
So now your content production is is independent of what Apple does with their processors or

805
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,480
their operating system.

806
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,100
It's totally separated from Microsoft and the hell of Windows and it's your desktop

807
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,600
environment, your operating system of choice.

808
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,500
And then you get all the other great features like so we'll stack WireGuard in on this.

809
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,800
So now we're connecting our studio systems via a WireGuard network.

810
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,120
And maybe while we're at it, we'll go to a low latency kernel and we'll use a specially

811
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,960
tuned ButterFS partition for our recordings.

812
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,020
You can start leveraging all of the other technologies in Linux that make Linux great

813
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:02,660
for servers and other desktop workstation use cases that make it also great for audio

814
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,080
and video production.

815
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,360
And you only get to take advantage of that stuff when you've learned the tools and you

816
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,560
just you have to start the journey one step at a time.

817
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,280
So hopefully some of this stuff will be useful to you.

818
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,720
We will pick Drew's brain and Wes and I will get a collection of our links together for

819
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,960
some of these for some of these different tools and applications we've talked about.

820
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,280
And you can take a look at those.

821
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,400
We'll have them all linked up at linuxunplug.com slash 394.

822
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,240
Thank you to Drew for coming on and helping us sort through that.

823
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,480
So I thought we'd we'd have a little confession time with our virtual lug.

824
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:40,520
I know ByteBitton, you said that you've had some steps along the path to sticking with

825
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,280
Linux that you wanted to share with the class.

826
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,280
Yeah.

827
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:50,640
So what I usually do is check can I show the most obvious step is, is there a tool in Linux

828
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,560
that can handle the tasks that I want to do?

829
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,840
But sadly, that is not always the thing.

830
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:02,080
And usually some specific software is known for that specific function.

831
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,640
So you usually need that piece of software.

832
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,160
And then I start to look in, can I run it in wine?

833
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:18,200
Can I go a step just a step a step higher with the crossover from code weavers or stuff

834
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:24,280
like that, because the issue with going into a virtual machine is, yes, you can do a virtual

835
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,840
machine, but windows does updates.

836
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,840
Windows does drivers.

837
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,840
Yeah.

838
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,840
And it's slower.

839
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,840
It is slower.

840
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,840
Yep.

841
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:39,120
But the thing is that once you do need that tool to run on windows and yeah, you can do

842
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:44,080
something within the virtual machine, but there are also some modes like seamless mode.

843
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:50,680
So where you start the application within the windows system, but it has its application

844
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,480
window in your Linux box.

845
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,040
So that makes the transition a bit easier to work with.

846
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:03,760
And there are also some windows versions that are more dressed down from functions and other

847
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,040
things to run lighter.

848
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,800
Well, I know we have more to get to in the post show, so we will cover some more of those.

849
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,480
And of course, a big thank you to Drew for coming on.

850
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,000
He came on late after working, and that was after he spent the weekend patching servers.

851
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,240
And we told him to use a brand new audio tool to join us, which he'd never tried before.

852
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,180
But of course, he's always down to cloud because it is pretty fun to play with that stuff.

853
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:29,280
So thanks to Drew as well.

854
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,320
Datadog.com slash unplugged.

855
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,580
So Datadog is how you see it all.

856
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,860
If you have an on premises set up, if you use cloud infrastructure or you use everything

857
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,560
in between, you want to visualize it all in one place.

858
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,960
So why not something that gives you drag and drop dashboards to visualize all of the metrics

859
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,920
from the bare Linux stuff up all the way to the application stack in your website.

860
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,360
Datadog is about visualizing the entire stack, quickly analyze the performance of your Linux

861
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,000
servers in real time.

862
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,600
These customizable dashboards are beautiful.

863
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,840
You got to go to datadog.com slash unplugged just to check those out.

864
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:09,080
But if you're there, you sign up and you create one dashboard, you can get a free t-shirt

865
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,600
as well by going to datadog.com slash unplugged.

866
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,960
And of course, you support this show.

867
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:18,840
So when you're there, take a look around and see how Datadog can be used as a tool for

868
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,880
you to communicate with your team.

869
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,560
And you can set up, of course, alerts and different events that can be pushed into your

870
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,520
Slack communications or be sent to different messaging systems that you use.

871
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,840
You can integrate it with whatever tool your team uses.

872
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:36,000
Additionally, Datadog itself has integrations for over 400 technologies.

873
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,760
Like just turnkey, now you're getting metrics into Datadog and you're visualizing the entire

874
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,760
thing.

875
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,440
This is data to make decisions with.

876
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,880
This is data to communicate with your team, datadog.com slash unplugged.

877
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:55,520
Go there, start a free trial, create one dashboard and get a free Datadog t-shirt, datadog.com

878
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,520
slash unplugged.

879
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,080
And a big thank you to Datadog for building tools to help teams communicate.

880
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:05,440
And of course, for sponsoring this here podcast.

881
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,960
We have a really cool pick this week.

882
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,920
There's been several ways to go about this problem.

883
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,280
And that is, wouldn't it be great if you could take all of the coolness of Proton, which

884
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,960
has seen a lot of advancements in running Windows applications, and just use Proton

885
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,320
to run everyday Windows apps?

886
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,840
And it turns out you can.

887
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,080
Proton Collar, run any Windows program through Valve's Proton.

888
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,260
And Chris, you'll love this.

889
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:35,240
Not only is it already in the AUR, it's powered by Rust.

890
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,240
What was that?

891
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,240
Hold on, I'm sorry.

892
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,240
Did you say it was powered by Rust?

893
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:46,120
I sure did.

894
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,880
I don't know why, but I misunderstood our conversation earlier.

895
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,960
And I actually thought you told me, it's too bad it's not using Rust.

896
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,560
I just totally misunderstood you.

897
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:59,120
And so I'm actually legitimately surprised this is a Rust app.

898
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,980
Yeah, and there have been a couple of weird ways to do this.

899
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:05,520
But Proton is so neat, and it's seen so much development.

900
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,400
So wouldn't it be great if you could use it to run an application, perhaps a Windows application

901
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,160
that needs some 3D support?

902
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,240
Yeah, and I'll admit, Proton's a little bit of a black box.

903
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,800
I click the button, maybe I have to change the version sometimes, and then I just cross

904
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,640
my fingers and hope the game runs.

905
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,520
It's cool that this sort of exposes things for you.

906
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,920
You can specify what Proton version to use on the command line, or even point it to your

907
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,280
Steam apps folder where there's all the juicy details.

908
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,120
And it's all open source online.

909
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:35,840
Of course, right now, there are no releases, binary releases available.

910
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,920
Easiest way to get it is the AUR, but they've got build instructions.

911
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,920
You just need cargo.

912
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,920
Yeah.

913
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,080
I mean, that way you get to feel accomplished for the day.

914
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,040
What did you say that name was again, Wes?

915
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,040
Proton Collar.

916
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,040
Proton Collar.

917
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,040
There you go.

918
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:53,040
It needs an echo effect as well.

919
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:59,240
That's pretty neat, we'll have a link to that.

920
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:03,560
Everything is linked at linuxunplugged.com slash 394.

921
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,880
Thank you to our Unplugged Core contributors.

922
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,640
You are our core.

923
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,640
That's why we call you that.

924
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,040
You are the core of this show, and you keep us going, unpluggedcore.com.

925
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,800
Help us stay independent, reduce the ad load needed for this here show, and of course,

926
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,800
you get two feeds, limited ad version of the show, same full production, just limited ads,

927
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,880
or get the full thing, the live stream.

928
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,280
That one's fun because you hear all of our friends show up.

929
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,880
They show up and we say, oh, hi, hey, Bray, good to see you, and you hear everybody kind

930
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,580
of shuffling in for the day and us grousing about stuff.

931
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,200
It's a whole additional show.

932
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,280
It's just really relaxed and chill, plus a bunch of the post-show stuff, so you get access

933
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,280
to either one of those.

934
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,080
Also that second feed, we try to get that out pronto after the show, so it's another

935
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:50,760
way to get it right away if that works better for your afternoon commute.

936
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,280
Also we'd love to hear from you, so head over to our website, linuxunplugged.com.

937
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,600
There you'll find links to Matrix, you'll find links to, I don't know, the contact form,

938
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,280
you know, good old traditional email.

939
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,280
It's like new again.

940
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,280
You should try it.

941
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,880
And also, of course, our mumble is over there as well.

942
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:11,320
And our live time, well, that's actually a different website now that I think about it,

943
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,400
but it always stays the same unless it doesn't because something...

944
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,400
You better check.

945
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,400
Yeah, you better check.

946
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,920
Jupiterbroadcasting.com's last calendar, but we try to do it on a Tuesday.

947
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,320
See you next week.

948
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,800
Same bad time, same bad station.

949
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,800
And of course you can find the show on Twitter, at Linux Unplugged.

950
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,120
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

951
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:38,300
And all of our fantastic shows, whole family of shows, all having a big hug over at Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

952
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:43,320
Do make it live if you can because then you can participate and you can get your word

953
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,320
into the show.

954
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,940
We'd love to have you do that.

955
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:46,940
Find information at our website.

956
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:50,920
Thanks so much for joining us in this week's episode of this here Unplugged program.

957
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,200
I'm going to get out of here and go play with Sonobos and Pipewire.

958
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,400
I am like totally jazz.

959
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,680
You guys got to, you guys got to watch out because I'm not going to stop talking about

960
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,680
it.

961
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,680
It's that exciting.

962
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,680
I think you might mean you're totally jacked.

963
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,520
I see what you did there.

964
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:27,920
See you next Tuesday.

965
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:44,080
All right, let's go boat.

966
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,240
I know what I want to call it.

967
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,280
I know what I want to call it.

968
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,960
Thank you everybody for being here.

969
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,240
Colonel, did you want to get your Linux story in before we wrap up today?

970
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,240
Yeah.

971
00:56:54,240 --> 00:57:00,280
So one of my classes in college, the professor said, no, you can't write things in LibreOffice.

972
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,600
You have to do it in Word.

973
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:09,760
And because I would save things out in the 1003 Word format and he's like, no, you can't

974
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,760
do that.

975
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:15,040
And I go, okay, here's the requirements for the class because all at my college, all of

976
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:19,560
the classes, they have a list of here's your required textbook and your required software

977
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,440
and et cetera for a class.

978
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,920
And I was like, where is it on this list?

979
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,200
And he goes, well, I didn't put it on there because I thought everybody would just use

980
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,120
Office and I go, well, when you want to put it on that list, which you can't change during

981
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,320
the class, then okay, fine.

982
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,040
And I basically said, screw him.

983
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:44,680
And then the other one I've had is the way that I actually use Windows because I do have

984
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:50,640
some classes that I actually have to take screenshots of Windows applications and stuff.

985
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:57,160
And I have a VM of Windows that I install it, I activate it, I run the updates and that's

986
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,160
it.

987
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,520
And then I will clone it, take away its internet connection, do whatever configurations I need,

988
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,880
use that for that semester and blow it away at the end of the semester.

989
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:12,520
I have found that with Windows 10, if you take away its internet connection, it runs

990
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,920
way better.

991
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,840
All of a sudden it runs fine.

992
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,240
But if you give it an internet connection, it hangs.

993
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,880
That's classic, isn't it?

994
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:26,160
All right, I have something I have to get off my chest.

995
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:33,080
The Fedora experiment has come to an end on the ThinkPad and it's running Arch again and

996
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,080
it's glorious.

997
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:39,020
I thought I'd make it to 34, but it simply just came down to software availability for

998
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:45,000
Fedora is just not quite there for the kind of things that I need because I need these

999
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,600
weird esoteric thing that maybe only a couple of hundred people have.

1000
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,640
So Chris, what?

1001
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,640
You could have used the snap.

1002
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,960
No, no, I can't because the snap supports an older version of Jack, Jack one and I need

1003
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:57,960
Jack two support.

1004
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,600
But you see, it's not just that.

1005
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,680
It's not one piece of software.

1006
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:05,240
So Sonobus is what Neil's referring to, but it's actually several pieces of software.

1007
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:09,760
And it's just that, and I, what I will do is next time I take a go at Fedora, what I

1008
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,080
will do is I will, I will first learn how to make a copper repository for the software

1009
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,080
that I need.

1010
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,200
Oh my gosh, you're going to finally do it?

1011
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,560
Well, because that's clearly the missing piece.

1012
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,080
I think you have to at this point.

1013
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,840
Either you engage with the packaging system.

1014
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:29,680
We were chatting with Drew last night and there was no Sonobus package at all for Fedora.

1015
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,400
It's kind of sad too, because it's this incredible new piece of production software and Fedora

1016
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,760
is totally left out.

1017
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,240
And Drew just coppered it up and has it ready to go.

1018
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,640
And he's able to do that with the tools that he needs for all of his production stuff to

1019
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,000
make Fedora work for him.

1020
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,200
And he's had to do a considerable amount of the lifting on his own, but it seems like

1021
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,240
it's doable.

1022
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:54,480
My only concern is that I feel like it's likely to be one of those tasks where there is a

1023
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:59,720
variable amount of effort, i.e. some things are going to be a real pain in the butt to

1024
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,680
copper up and other things are going to be really straightforward and simple.

1025
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:08,320
And fundamentally what it comes down to is justifying how I spend my time.

1026
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:13,320
Because I could spend my time figuring out how complicated this weird esoteric audio

1027
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:21,200
recorder for pulse is, or I could just yay-s audio-recorder and I have it and I can record

1028
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,280
the stream that I already have up on my computer paused waiting to get recorded.

1029
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,240
And that's where at the end of the day it just doesn't end up working out for me, because

1030
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:33,160
I do that math and I think I need to learn how to do these things so that way I can bring

1031
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,160
software over.

1032
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:39,080
But even if I learn, I'm not going to stop mid-flow of a task that is to accomplish something

1033
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:43,440
else for a production, just so that way I can then package an application so that way

1034
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,960
I can use it on the esoteric distribution that I've chosen to use when I can either

1035
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:53,480
just run Ubuntu or I could run Arch or any of the Ubuntu derivatives, obviously, and

1036
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:58,280
the problem is preemptively solved for me and it saves me time at multiple iterations

1037
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,400
because every time a package comes up, like this thing we just talked about today, already

1038
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,480
available in the AUR, I can install it right now and I can have an opinion about it on

1039
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,360
the show, I can actually have hands-on experience with something, or I can spend my time packaging

1040
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,440
and it just doesn't really seem to make sense to me.

1041
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:18,200
It's not that I don't want to learn how to do it, it's just that's the math of the situation

1042
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,200
right now.

1043
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:25,120
Sure, but Chris, you could also, when you're making those copper things, you could also

1044
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:29,920
just reference the AUR package build files to be able to speed through actually making

1045
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,920
them.

1046
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:31,920
So how does that work?

1047
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,280
Tell me about that, because that might be like the hack to make it work, because if

1048
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,800
it's in the AUR, then I have a shortcut, it sounds like.

1049
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:41,000
You can't necessarily, at least right now, take a package build file and just run it

1050
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
and it produces you an RPM.

1051
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,920
However, a package build file and an RPM spec file look very similar in structure, and in

1052
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:58,040
many cases what you can do is that you can do vim foo.spec and it'll generate you the

1053
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:02,080
template because vim has a built-in template for RPM spec files, and you can literally

1054
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:07,080
just copy and paste a lot of the commands that are run to actually just go ahead and

1055
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,760
build it and push it into copper.

1056
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:16,960
It'll build it, produce you an RPM, and have a repo that you can show off to others or

1057
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,160
have other people reference or whatever, and they can run it.

1058
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,920
Moreover, you can actually build it for multiple releases of Fedora.

1059
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:29,000
You can even technically use copper to build for OpenSUSE if you'd like.

1060
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,520
It's not exactly the same, it's not exactly completely zero effort, but it can get you

1061
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,460
through it fairly quickly.

1062
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,900
So here's kind of another element of this.

1063
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,640
It's like what speed are you operating at, I feel like.

1064
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:46,720
For another example is something I've kind of been talking about on Coder Radio and the

1065
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:52,200
live stream for this show is performance and getting my machine faster and maybe getting

1066
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:58,660
a faster refresh rate on my monitor and experimenting with the Profile Sync Demon to get my browser

1067
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:05,080
to cache into RAM, messing around with maybe different types of schedulers or things like

1068
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,080
that.

1069
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:12,840
And it all seems like it's infinitely easier on Arch than it is on Fedora or other desktops.

1070
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:18,680
And I know I heard your recent tirade about how dangerous Arch is, and frankly I can't

1071
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,680
have it.

1072
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:24,900
I can't accept that because I'm sitting here, somebody who has enough knowledge to put together

1073
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:30,040
a box, but ultimately I just want the tool that saves me time, and I swear right now

1074
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:35,760
to you on the mixer sitting in front of me that if Fedora could save me time and make

1075
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:41,600
it possible for me to get my job done faster than Arch, I 100% unequivocally with no doubt

1076
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,580
would use it on every single machine I have.

1077
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:48,840
And it started with my workstation, I tried it there and on my laptop, and over time even

1078
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,700
though I struggled not to do it because I didn't want to make the concession, I eventually

1079
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:58,360
had to replace it simply because what I want to spend my time on is experimenting with

1080
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:02,840
this software and trying things, or recording that clip, or getting that editing software,

1081
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:08,320
or quickly installing this esoteric branch of the kernel to try it for a week so I can

1082
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,320
talk about it on the show.

1083
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:13,600
And I don't want to spend my time figuring out how to go set up a copper account, and

1084
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,840
how to go wire this hard work that somebody's already done to get it in there.

1085
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,360
None of that sounds appealing to me right now.

1086
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:24,220
And I cannot be the only one who has this opinion.

1087
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:30,100
And so you can denigrate Arch for being rolling and for maybe being unsafe for new users,

1088
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:34,100
but for people like me who have been using Linux since the 90s, and I just want a damn

1089
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:38,320
workstation that I don't have to fuss with just to get some piece of software going,

1090
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,320
it's very appealing.

1091
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,280
And I feel like it doesn't get the credit.

1092
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:47,040
Instead we laugh at, oh I run Arch by the way, and we actually have now kind of ganged

1093
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:51,780
up on Arch users for being so crazy to run a distribution that they don't have to go

1094
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:53,960
through an upgrade cycle every six months.

1095
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,340
And I feel like it's kind of unfair because it turns out to make an incredibly powerful

1096
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:01,260
workstation if you're remotely comfortable with using Linux.

1097
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:04,300
And then on top of that they have really good documentation.

1098
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:10,180
And then if you just go to the AUR and you sort by the most popular applications, you

1099
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:14,080
just see it's people trying to solve problems to get their work done.

1100
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,980
And that's who's installing software from the AUR.

1101
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,420
It's things like Slack and Zoom.

1102
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:22,400
It's not this weird crazy stuff.

1103
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,660
It's just people trying to get their jobs done during the day.

1104
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:31,760
And I kind of feel like we have cast Arch users as if they're these dangerous influencers

1105
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,020
who are going to derail new user adoption and prevent Linux from taking off.

1106
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:39,900
And the only way to save them is because package managers will come in and protect them from

1107
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,740
the dangerous rolling releases.

1108
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:46,340
And it's just a shame because I struggled with this, and I didn't because of this opinion,

1109
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,400
and I didn't know how to tackle this on air.

1110
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,980
And I feel like it produces like this boogeyman out there.

1111
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:56,240
And it creates a parody of Linux users, and it's just unfortunate.

1112
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,240
End of rant.

1113
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,240
Okay.

1114
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:02,160
First of all, Chris, I don't have a problem with you running Arch.

1115
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:06,640
I am disappointed when you run Arch because it feels like I failed in trying to make things

1116
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,600
work out well in Fedora for you.

1117
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:17,160
But I don't particularly care to make you feel bad or whatever for it.

1118
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,460
That's not my point.

1119
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:24,600
My problem with talking about Arch in a lot of sense, like the nuance here is there are

1120
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:30,360
a lot of people who don't know anything about anything about Linux who try to use Arch because

1121
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,100
everyone else talks about it as if Arch is easy.

1122
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,260
I guess I reject that premise.

1123
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:39,840
And I think that that premise, which I don't think can be proved, leads to denigrating

1124
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,960
Arch users and making it actually almost embarrassing to admit that you run Arch.

1125
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,420
I grant you that in a theoretical world where new people were coming to Linux and they were

1126
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:53,520
somehow discovering Arch on their brand new journey, thanks to the magic of Google, that

1127
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,640
would be a problem.

1128
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:59,160
But I just don't really accept that based just solely on the user base numbers of Ubuntu

1129
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,160
and Mint alone.

1130
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,920
I'm not saying it's happening universally.

1131
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,260
I'm saying it happens in places like R, Linux.

1132
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:09,200
It even happens in my workplace Slack where people say, you know, Arch is easy, so just

1133
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,200
go do it.

1134
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:14,140
And then I have people telling me that Arch, because of their experience with Arch, that

1135
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:17,360
they hate Linux and they just go back to Windows or Mac OS.

1136
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:23,760
I don't care that you find Arch more comfortable.

1137
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,320
That's fine if that's the case.

1138
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,600
I would like to make Fedora better for your use case because I feel you are actually one

1139
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,600
of those people.

1140
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:35,120
I also want to tackle this other thing where you said, well, you know, these people working

1141
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,580
in AUR, they're all people trying to solve problems.

1142
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:38,580
You know what?

1143
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:41,760
That's pretty much everybody working in every Linux distribution, doing everything that

1144
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,780
they're doing.

1145
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:44,120
That's why Copper exists.

1146
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,560
That's why Launchpad exists.

1147
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,400
That's why, you know, PPAs.

1148
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:48,400
That's why OBS.

1149
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,400
That's why AUR.

1150
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,400
All of these systems are for that stuff.

1151
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,880
Not everything is going to have the required effort to put it into the main distribution.

1152
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,160
Would it be nice if they're all in there?

1153
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,160
Sure.

1154
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,160
Would that happen?

1155
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,160
No.

1156
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,560
And that's the reason that all that stuff is all there.

1157
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:10,640
If you take what you're doing and you take the equivalent of just slap together a package

1158
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:14,160
build and call it good and everything's available, you're going to do the same thing and say,

1159
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,880
I'll slap together a spec file and push it up and call it good.

1160
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,800
The only difference between AUR and Copper in that respect is one of them you're building

1161
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,360
locally on your computer and the other one you're not.

1162
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:31,720
And my thing about Arch versus everything else is that Arch is very developer centric

1163
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:38,320
and the Arch user community themselves have been historically very inhospitable to folks

1164
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,760
who are very new to the Linux ecosystem.

1165
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:44,160
Whether or not that actually winds up being true in your circle, that's a different story.

1166
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:47,680
Whether it turns out to be true in the macrocosm, that's a different story.

1167
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:52,040
So I think that would be good if the experience for new users when they come to Arch is somewhat

1168
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,560
of a hostile response, that's probably the signal to the new user that that's not the

1169
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,560
community for them.

1170
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,920
So that probably kind of reinforces what I say, where it's not really the new user distribution

1171
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,920
where they land.

1172
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,200
And here's what I'm kind of getting at, because I actually do, I agree with everything you

1173
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:08,720
just said, but where I think it kind of goes off the rails, and this is what gets me kind

1174
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:12,540
of fired up about it, is because this is where then I struggle with how to talk about this

1175
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:19,680
on air, is fundamentally I think we have created this shame dome for Arch users.

1176
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:25,080
And it's kind of become like this joke, but in reality, we're shaming people.

1177
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:29,800
We're shaming people for choosing to use a distribution, and that's the bit I don't like.

1178
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,580
I mean, you can make a solid argument for why somebody would want to land on a distribution

1179
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:37,920
that is managed versus a distribution that's kind of like a Wild West.

1180
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:38,920
That I don't disagree with.

1181
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:44,180
But what I disagree with is the characterization that A, it's hostile to new users, it's not

1182
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:49,180
for new users, and I don't want to get into a situation where we're advocating to dumb

1183
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:53,320
down tools to appease a theoretical user base.

1184
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,920
I feel like tools should be as powerful as they can be, and then it's up to the distros

1185
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:00,200
to create something that's palatable to new users.

1186
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:04,840
And there is a market for each kind of user, and so we shouldn't shame people if they choose

1187
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:09,180
to run Gen 2, like we laugh at them now if they run Gen 2 or Arch, because it's solving

1188
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,340
a problem for them.

1189
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:17,040
And just like Fedora and Ubuntu and Mandrake and Mandriva and OpenSUSE and you know, etc.

1190
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:21,520
And so that's where I feel like we kind of got to right the ship a little bit, is this

1191
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,620
anti-rhetoric against Arch users is kind of becoming more and more hostile.

1192
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:32,460
And to the point where I realized I didn't even want to admit that I was using it more

1193
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,460
and more.

1194
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:36,960
And that I would maybe talk up more about this distro than I would admit that I'm using

1195
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,800
Arch simply because of this community shaming that's happening.

1196
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,960
And I feel like that's what has to stop, because there's completely valid work problems it's

1197
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:46,960
solving for me.

1198
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,920
It seems confused too when like Neil, you spoke about being upset when people make Arch

1199
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,920
seem easy.

1200
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:57,860
There's certainly problems there, but it seems like in a lot of Linux media, that becomes

1201
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:59,040
the focus.

1202
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:03,720
And it's when we're often a community of folks that are not new users and are experienced

1203
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:07,360
and we're trying to have one conversation, but it gets dominated by this idea that some

1204
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,200
folks out there are leading people astray with Arch.

1205
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:14,160
And we can be upset at that without having to be upset about the happy community of Arch

1206
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,160
users who are talking amongst themselves.
