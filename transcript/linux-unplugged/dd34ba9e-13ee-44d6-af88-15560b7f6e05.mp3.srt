1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Alexa, spell Linux.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,920
Linux is spelled L-I-N-U-X.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
That's not bad.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,880
I'm not sure I could do that.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:32,800
This is Linux Amplug episode 178 for January 3rd, 2017.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,520
Welcome to It's Unplugged.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,520
That's pretty close.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,880
Your weekly Linux talk show that's celebrating the New Year's with robots.

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,880
My name is Chris.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
My name is Wes.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,080
I think I could do a better job than the Echo there.

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
What do you think?

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,000
You have had more practice than she has though, so in fairness.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,880
Hello everybody and welcome back and happy 2017.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,000
This is really Linux Unplugged.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,520
No, I'm not even sure what she said.

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
I don't even know if she...

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,520
Nope.

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
No idea.

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,280
But if you haven't guessed, later on in the show we'll be talking about securing the internet

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,360
of things and how open source might be able to solve this particular problem and take

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,240
something that's typically cloud-based and make it all local.

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
What?

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
Yeah.

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
That's later on in the show.

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,880
We'll be getting our 2017 predictions from our virtual lug, getting all prepped and ready

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,720
for this Sunday's Linux action show, the official predictions episode.

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
It's a big moment, Wes.

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,800
That's a huge moment.

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,840
This last week we put it off to review Solace.

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,840
I saw that.

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,880
Yeah, it's just like we had to go that way.

33
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,320
But I got a couple emails and I can't remember if it was a tweet or a telegram.

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,600
Somebody said, I really missed the predictions episode.

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,080
Now the anticipation is building.

36
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,560
And then the other guys, I got an email that said, I had a bet going on your predictions.

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,680
And then you didn't do it.

38
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,440
So we're going to get a little bit of that taken care of today.

39
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
Not all of them.

40
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
What's your appetite?

41
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,560
Yeah, we've got to make room for some great open source project updates.

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
I don't know.

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,160
Maybe some of these open source developers got a little time off for the holidays and

44
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
they banged out some code.

45
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,160
Come back fresh at it.

46
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
I know that's how I am.

47
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,800
So check it out, guys, because in a little bit we're going to have some great stories.

49
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,760
And what I think could be a great trend for 2017.

50
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,320
But first, let's bring in our virtual hug for the first time this year.

51
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,920
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Time appropriate greetings.

53
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
Happy New Year.

54
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
Hello, everybody.

55
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Hello.

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,880
It is good to see you.

57
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,080
And I want to start out, I want to start Jesus.

58
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,960
There's no way half this beer that you brought us could be hitting me that fast.

59
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:34,080
But I guess by the way, Mr. Mr. West over there really, really outdid himself this week.

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,800
He brought an Odin's gift.

61
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
It's a gift for you.

62
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,200
Which come on, how can you I can't ask for a better gift than Odin's gift.

63
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,400
And it's an amber ale brewed with juniper berries, which is sounds a lot like Jupiter

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
berries.

65
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
It sure does.

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Yeah.

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
So you really you're just pushing all the buttons.

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Is it local to us?

69
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Is it is it a local brew?

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Tequila, Washington.

71
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,360
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

72
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
Well done, sir.

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Well done.

74
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
That is my pleasure.

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Well done.

76
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,440
So I've I've been talking about this since the beginning of last year.

77
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,680
Feels a little weird to say.

78
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,040
And I think I think, gosh, I just I don't mean to say I told you so.

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,040
But I think maybe I told you so I think you did.

80
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,080
There are more and more people these days that are looking for an alternative to Mac

81
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,120
OS, a special group of people.

82
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm not going to sit here and pretend like it's millions of users not going to pretend

83
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,760
like Apple is going to fall apart because of how your average designer or art person

84
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,240
or whatever.

85
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:34,000
But there are there are those like the fellow over a bit cannon bit cannon dotnet wrote up

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
an awesome post.

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,120
And here's why I say it's awesome, because it's it feels like it's from the perspective

88
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,320
of an analytical engineer or somebody who's laying it all out there.

89
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,720
And it really breaks down the process from from the perspective of not not the Apple

90
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,480
user that we we Linux users like to portray that the hipster with the tight jeans and

91
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,880
and it's a concern about the image and the.

92
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,560
This is this is someone who is smart and rational like yourself that.

93
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,740
Chose a different path and is now using that same intellect that shows that path to evaluate

94
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,740
other paths.

95
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,740
And so he's right.

96
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,480
I've used Mac OS since the public beta.

97
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,240
I use it both at home and work.

98
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,360
I've also run various Linux distributions and BSD since around 2000.

99
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,320
So he's got some familiarity working with here, mostly using Ruby and has had some experience

100
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,280
with a PC that he built on the side.

101
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,840
It's got an Intel like I seven run at four gigahertz with lots of RAM and SSD and he

102
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,340
put arch on that.

103
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,640
But he mostly just SSH is into that from the Mac box to do Ruby development.

104
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,320
And it's way faster than the Mac box.

105
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,920
But recently he said there's been more and more appealing to a more and more appeal to

106
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,120
switching from, you know, switching away from the Mac.

107
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,800
He says, I spent a fair bit of time pondering the appeal of the switch.

108
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,840
These are some of the benefits as I see them access to a regularly updated pro hardware.

109
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,520
I'll give that a day.

110
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,880
Not restricted to Apple hardware that makes choices that I don't value, such as removing

111
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,900
the escape key, removing all legacy ports, the set, the set, the set, necessitating cheese,

112
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:12,160
the use of dongles for everything, though that may be our future regardless, I wonder

113
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,300
and prioritizing thinness and weight over everything else.

114
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,080
Also access to hardware that Apple doesn't make such as two in one laptops, getting comfortable

115
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,640
with alternatives before I'm forced to the ability to inspect and contribute to the OS

116
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
I use.

117
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,360
Oh, and using OS where developers are first class citizens.

118
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, also see stagnation of the Mac App Store.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,040
Drawbacks of switching time required to find replacements of the software I use like Alfred

120
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,600
one pass and sketch the lack of access to the iOS SDK because he does maintain an app

121
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
in the iOS store.

122
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Yeah, that's rough.

123
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Yeah.

124
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,200
He evaluated a bunch of different alternatives from Anna Gross and arch and bida and elementary

125
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,400
really quite a good list.

126
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Yeah.

127
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
This is on there.

128
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,480
I see honorary mentions give deep in and haiku and redox.

129
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,560
Here's kind of what he was looking for integrated consistent experience, good design, and simple

130
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,720
easy to use high dpi support, which is underscored and timely updates.

131
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,780
Top pick is fedora.

132
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,320
Actually really top pick he says all three top picks were known based fedora, arch straight

133
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,960
and elementary, which is not actually known three, which is his favorite right now says

134
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,440
elementary is what he's going with human interface guidelines, which are a plus in his opinion,

135
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,120
native programming language, or at least a primary focus, Vala, not Python.

136
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
And that's it.

137
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
That's what he says.

138
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,360
A model for funding ongoing development bug bounties, Patreon asking for payment with downloading.

139
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,160
That's an interesting thing.

140
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,320
I could see why that would absolutely from the professional developer angle, someone

141
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,560
who's used to you know, maybe he had paid for OS X updates back when that was the thing

142
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,940
could be a and you know, and there are a lot of like, if you have an app, especially

143
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,800
in that OS X ecosystem, a lot of really good apps you pay for, but you you know, you value

144
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
them.

145
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,640
Yeah, I just thinking about it, it really does matter to me that the Destro I'm using

146
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,480
maybe has a full time developer to on if I'm using a full on curated distro.

147
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,200
Let's get Ikey funded so we can do this full time is he doesn't think he does it full time.

148
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,360
That's a really good question.

149
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,220
Also designers as well as developers are on the team that he likes that they have a design

150
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,500
angle and then he just sort of wraps it up.

151
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:17,200
My ideal would be elementary on top of free BSD only your ideal man.

152
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,200
He says next I plan to resize the arch partition on my work PC and install elementary alongside

153
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,080
I'll aim to do all of my work duties on that machine and post how it goes.

154
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,000
So I have a link in his in the show notes if you want to follow the blog as he goes

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,740
along.

156
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,920
Now I reason I want to talk about this because we could we could sit here and we could talk

157
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:41,840
about Michael Dominic from Coder Radio or Leo Laporte or or or Bit Cannon.

158
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,440
I mean there's so many there's those are so many example.

159
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,620
Those are three examples of so many what I believe represent so many other people they're

160
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,200
doing the same evaluation and I'm not doing this to harp on the MacBook.

161
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,520
I don't really give a crap about that anymore.

162
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,800
It just I think it's I think this I think this I think there is a new reality and that

163
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,800
new reality is there is a there is an area of the market that Apple's decided it is no

164
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,920
longer worth their investment to target based on the overall importance of the Mac to the

165
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,400
Apple overall profitable ecosystem.

166
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,920
And those people that are realizing that are looking for something else and they don't

167
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,320
want to go to Windows.

168
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,660
They really don't at Windows 10.

169
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,040
The thing is is this is hitting I believe this is hitting when the Windows 10 hype train

170
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,180
is stopped right.

171
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,680
People at this point feel like it's a fine version of Windows.

172
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,920
Maybe it's one of the better ones.

173
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,640
But there are probably still a lot of Mac users especially who aren't ready to go back.

174
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,000
You know they left they probably left or they've been using it a long enough time.

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,240
Well here's the thing about Windows 10.

176
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,600
All the things used that drove you crazy about Windows still exist.

177
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,800
The crazy nightmare of downloading setup.exe to install your drivers.

178
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,000
The crazy high DPI support that is totally non-existent.

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,020
The mishmash of interfaces the 10 different ways to set your power management settings.

180
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,120
All of these the integration of market trend of the year when they release the OS.

181
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
That is so obnoxious.

182
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,560
Like the Cortana features.

183
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Give me a break.

184
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,060
Well and I think there's a difference like the Windows can produce these sorts of Windows

185
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,060
power users.

186
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,640
I think we've talked a lot about switching to Linux in the past.

187
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,000
And they're the kind of people that know that right.

188
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,320
Like they understand that there's going to be three different menus to configure things.

189
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,320
They know how to go deep.

190
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,400
They know how to do the regedit.

191
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,800
That doesn't really exist in OSX to the same degree.

192
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,400
Whereas these people are looking at OSX as like a this was their functional computer.

193
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,800
I think it's interesting because I think I think a class of these people are probably

194
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,720
on MacBooks and using Mac OS because their taste which they would probably classify as

195
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,600
discerning would right would sort of compel them to go that direction.

196
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,760
There's not a lot except for some of the more popular newer distributions I think that might

197
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,680
that meet the level of quote unquote discerning tastes of a Mac user.

198
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:55,000
And I'm not trying to be combative but I think it conveys the image like there is a certain

199
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,040
standard they're going for in terms of quality and consistency and elementary OS is sort

200
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
of unique.

201
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,160
Solus is also pretty great in that way.

202
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,520
And Gnome 3 desktop in general is the best generally available desktop that I think I

203
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,780
honestly believe out of the box is the most consistent.

204
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,840
And there's something about that like I mean obviously we've talked a lot about Plasma

205
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,680
5 and how great it is but there's something about the simplicity of Gnome that matches

206
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,960
more with also bear in mind too that he's specifically requiring high DPI which sort

207
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,520
of focuses.

208
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Plasma is good.

209
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,160
It's great actually.

210
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,640
Plasma is still slightly inconsistent high DPI compared to them three.

211
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,200
And that's really no three ballpark right now.

212
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Yeah.

213
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,960
The GTK three GTK three.

214
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,200
So I think it's sort of a fascinating trend that is going to increase in 2017 and it's

215
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,560
why I just wanted to cover it at the top here because this is sort of what this episode

216
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,600
is about is these types of things.

217
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,400
Mr. Jude you have a point.

218
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Yeah.

219
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,760
A lot of the people that I know that use Mac books it was not so much about the window

220
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,160
manager and stuff but the apps.

221
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,520
The apps and the fact that it has a shell right.

222
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,600
I need my email that's going to be reliable and I want my browser it's always going to

223
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
work.

224
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Yeah.

225
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Yeah.

226
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,400
You know both Chromium and Firefox under open source operating systems are some time

227
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:11,320
a bit not perfect whereas well especially previous versions of Mac OS you could rely

228
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,760
on the OS not to crash and your apps to work.

229
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,400
That's actually not as true anymore.

230
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,800
It's not just the hardware that Apple is falling down on but the fact that NFS and the latest

231
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,600
version of OS 10 will crash if you try to connect to things.

232
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Right.

233
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Right.

234
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
And you know to that point.

235
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,080
And also just people having troubles with even just the web browser and email not working

236
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
properly.

237
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,040
To that point there was a release of Mac OS where I can't remember what the reason was.

238
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,800
I think it was a licensing issue.

239
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,000
They just ripped out Samba and implemented their own.

240
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh right.

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That was pretty recently.

242
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah.

243
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,080
Their own SMB client and it just is absolute shit.

244
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,240
It's shit.

245
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,040
It's bad bad bad.

246
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,640
And it's gotten better now in previous in excessive releases because that's releases

247
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,200
but it's just was awful back then and it was just an example of something that just didn't

248
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
really care for pro users.

249
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
They wouldn't.

250
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
They wouldn't.

251
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,480
And it's another where you know maybe you have these skills you've used SIFs on other

252
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,840
servers and now maybe the Mac implementation is different for perhaps no good reason.

253
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,520
I think too and Alan I wonder if you agree do you think that some of it has to do with

254
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,520
just more people shifting workload into the web browser or do you think it's still more

255
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,360
about the native apps.

256
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,680
I think it's a little bit less about native apps now but I think what we need to look

257
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,480
at from this is actually getting back the idea of the reason any development happens

258
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,000
in open source is developers scratching their own itch.

259
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,040
So this might be the golden opportunity to get more developers back to using Linux or

260
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,080
BSD and refining that desktop experience to make it good enough for them whereas before

261
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,240
it was not quite good enough to drive them to get to go with the Mac instead.

262
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,560
Yeah sort of critical mass thing.

263
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,680
Before I go any further I should mention Alan reminded me I should plug it right now that

264
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:01,200
you can join Alan and I for our last TechSnap episode 300 this Thursday at one o'clock

265
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,400
JB time jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar and then the show goes on with Mr. West and

266
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,320
Dan.

267
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,200
So yeah I should mention that since Alan's here if you're listening you can join us for

268
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
that.

269
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
And thanks for joining us Alan.

270
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,680
Yeah Alan it's good to see you.

271
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,560
I just got back from the dentist and had nothing better to do.

272
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,600
So hang out with those Linux guys.

273
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
That's our audience folks.

274
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Got it Alan.

275
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
I love it.

276
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
I love it.

277
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,520
Well you just also happen to be talking about a topic that's been of interest to me lately

278
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:34,880
because I've seen a bunch of people I've known as hardcore Mac users for you know five or

279
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,520
ten years more being like well they took away my escape key so I bought a Lenovo.

280
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
Yeah right.

281
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,880
Yeah we just had somebody in the chat room that just said that basically.

282
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,520
In fact he said, who was it, I just yeah DeBill are you in the Mumba room DeBill?

283
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
No I don't see him in the Mumba room.

284
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,440
DeBill said that he replaced his Macbook at work for a three year old Lenovo with Linux

285
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,160
because he got tired of it crashing and all those kind of shit.

286
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,840
And I think that's the main reason so many Linux and BSD developers went with a Mac is

287
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,320
because they were having these consistency and polish problems on the open source OS

288
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,160
and a lot of that has gotten better although a lot of it is not.

289
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,640
The thing that we haven't really caught up on is the lightness of the hardware although

290
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,600
like the X1 carbon from Lenovo is nice and light and is getting there but you know reliable

291
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,280
suspend resume and battery life.

292
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,600
The Mac has always been way ahead there but maybe this will be the push to actually make

293
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,000
people spend time on making that happen.

294
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah exactly.

295
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,940
Yeah and I noticed I think specifically Solus and maybe elementary OS too have done something

296
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,000
to make standby really fast and reliable on those distros because like it's with those

297
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,360
distros my benchmark is is this is the password prompt on my screen by the time I finished

298
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
lifting the lid.

299
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
There you go.

300
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Yeah.

301
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,900
And those meet that benchmark and that's as fast as I could possibly ask for.

302
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,720
But then there's other desktops where it does.

303
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
So what line before.

304
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,880
OK so West has closed his laptop.

305
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,680
What log in manager are you using on that you know GDM.

306
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
OK.

307
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
All right.

308
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
So I think that seems to make a difference.

309
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
All right.

310
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,680
Fire it up.

311
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,680
All right.

312
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,000
Not quite about a half second after after the screen was up which is usable.

313
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,840
It was usable but it's not as fast as a MacBook.

314
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
Which is cool.

315
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
Yeah.

316
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,680
You have to see what the Mac is cheating by not doing things like erasing the full disk

317
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,240
encryption password program.

318
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
Right.

319
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
Right.

320
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,760
We covered that in last week's tech snap.

321
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,960
It turns out that it's just sitting there in plain text in the RAM just hanging out

322
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,520
just chilling the password.

323
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,480
And if you plug into Thunderbolt you can DMA and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah just so

324
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,480
just wait.

325
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,900
So plug into the Thunderbolt port lift the Mac lid grab the RAM contents.

326
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,900
There's the password.

327
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,900
You don't have to.

328
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,960
You don't have to crack nothing.

329
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
That's this.

330
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
And there's little devices you know.

331
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,680
You just the Thunderbolt stuff is going to be and USBC is that's what's going to be crazy

332
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
about them.

333
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
We should move on.

334
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,400
But with the MacBook specifically with those USBC ports being Thunderbolt in reality and

335
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,720
that's right there on the bus.

336
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,800
I wonder if that's going to become a security issue.

337
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,480
It's going to have to be a Solus is using LightDM.

338
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Well damn.

339
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,480
I don't know.

340
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
I don't know what to tell you.

341
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,440
Although I don't know if LightDM is specifically specifically fast or slower.

342
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,120
I just have a lot of experience with GDM.

343
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,160
Getting a Solus just really quick since we just put out our review.

344
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,200
They have an update.

345
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,760
We reviewed them on Sunday and that afternoon they put out an update and just thought I'd

346
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,120
mention it really quick because it's sort of the distribution that I'm all excited about

347
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,400
at the moment because that's what I just installed on my machine.

348
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,080
I still have it sitting right here and I just checked and I got all the updates installed.

349
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
Nice.

350
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,080
Yeah.

351
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,120
So there's just a few general improvements including a bump to the Nvidia driver.

352
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,400
The new version of software center version 15 has gone out which includes updates and

353
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,760
new apps that I probably would have mentioned in our review if they were in there at the

354
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,840
time.

355
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,000
And I guess they now are – this is like the last version of the Budgie desktop that's

356
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
going out before they focus on Budgie 11 which is what a lot of the users are excited about.

357
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,820
Also I should mention the Mate edition has been updated and it's got the new Brisk menu

358
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,280
in it which we covered in like two weeks ago I think it was.

359
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,760
That's going to be exciting to watch.

360
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
It shipped.

361
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,960
The first version of the Brisk menu is – gosh that was fast.

362
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
That was really fast.

363
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,000
It feels like we were just like – it was just kind of a dream.

364
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yeah.

365
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It was on the pipeline.

366
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Now it's here.

367
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,640
Now we just start the clock to see how long it shows up in other distributions because

368
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
that thing is going to take off.

369
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
That's for sure.

370
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,160
Just as a quick comment like just looking at that little snapshot overview like you

371
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,600
said like they do snapshots pretty regularly but like there is a lot of stuff in there.

372
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,080
It's so clear how much is going on in this project.

373
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,080
I know.

374
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
I know.

375
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,160
I don't – I feel conflicted because I feel like I could take up a half hour covering

376
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,260
it actually to be honest with you but I don't feel like that probably would be the best

377
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,760
use of all of the audience this time but –

378
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,760
If you're interested go check it out.

379
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Go try it.

380
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
But there is a lot.

381
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,520
There is a lot in there for just a quick update.

382
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
Yeah.

383
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,080
So the momentum – the momentum is high with this one.

384
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
Keep it up guys.

385
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,880
Also it looks like kernel 4.8.15 as well as 13.02 OpenGL.

386
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,600
I don't even – I didn't even – wow.

387
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,440
I don't follow OpenGL at all anymore.

388
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,360
I care – what I honestly was more curious and watch closer is the NVIDIA driver versions

389
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,600
because I do like to have the later versions of that.

390
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,920
So good job to the Solus project.

391
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,280
So Wes you and I were chatting about this before the show today.

392
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,440
This is kind of a nice thing for Nexus 5 phone owners.

393
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,920
Now the Google has stopped updating it right?

394
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Didn't they stop updating it?

395
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
Yes they did.

396
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,360
No 7 for us.

397
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,900
And then I think this year the 6P and the 5X lose support.

398
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,900
They will.

399
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,320
They still get security updates though.

400
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
Oh.

401
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
Oh.

402
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
The new hotness.

403
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Okay.

404
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,320
Yep.

405
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,320
Boy that's pretty.

406
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
I mean they almost feel still new.

407
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Yeah.

408
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
I guess security updates is not the end of the world.

409
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
No.

410
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Yeah.

411
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,320
How long do they get the security updates for?

412
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Do you know?

413
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
I want to say like a full year.

414
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Okay.

415
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Okay.

416
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,480
So you get like two years probably from now if you have a 5X or a 6P.

417
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
That's reasonable.

418
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Exactly.

419
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,960
I feel like the 6P should get another year of –

420
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Yeah.

421
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,320
It does feel like it was – that was an expensive phone.

422
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
It was the last phone.

423
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Yeah.

424
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
It was the last phone.

425
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
Nexus 6?

426
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
Yeah.

427
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
It's –

428
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
Yeah.

429
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,880
Do you not get update 7 and so on?

430
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,660
No it shouldn't be.

431
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,580
I have the 7 update pending.

432
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,820
I just have to press the button.

433
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,820
Do you not get 7.1?

434
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,820
I have no idea.

435
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,820
You might not get 7.1.

436
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,820
That would be –

437
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,820
Yeah.

438
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,820
That would be some real shit.

439
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,820
Put you on the –

440
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,820
Yeah.

441
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,820
Put you on the –

442
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,480
But you don't get the thing where we ironed out the –

443
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
Yeah.

444
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,480
That's the worst.

445
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,920
I just don't know about that.

446
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,480
And of course so this is a real thing.

447
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
This is a real problem.

448
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:30,900
And this is where I think things like Lineage or Ubuntu Touch have some real promise.

449
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,460
The Nexus 5 is now fully working with Ubuntu Phone.

450
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,480
So if you've got a Nexus 5, you can go all in.

451
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,480
We've talked about Maurice's cool software that he created in the past that allows you

452
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,720
to flash these devices super easy.

453
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
So he's been working on it.

454
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,560
He's also got an unofficial port for the Fairphone 2, which is becoming fully working, which

455
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
is awesome.

456
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
Hey, cool.

457
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,160
The GPS still is not working, but otherwise it's fully working.

458
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Wow.

459
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Nexus 5, though.

460
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
All in.

461
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,480
It looks like it's working also on the 1 Plus 1 Ubuntu Touch port.

462
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Still some stabilization improvements that need to happen there, though.

463
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
But wow.

464
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,520
In fact, the developer, Maurice, is using a Nexus 5 running Ubuntu Touch as his daily

465
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
driver.

466
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,480
He even connects it to HDMI and gets the convergent stuff.

467
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,480
Wow.

468
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
That's neat.

469
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,520
So it's full-on Nexus 5 with convergence, while Google's not even updating it anymore.

470
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Nope.

471
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
That kind of makes me curious.

472
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,440
I have one kicking around still, so I'll definitely try it on there.

473
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,400
My mom's using a Nexus 5 still, and it makes me like, maybe I'm better off just flashing

474
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
it with Ubuntu.

475
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,200
She doesn't need a whole bunch of Android apps, so would that be a more secure, maintainable

476
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
thing?

477
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
I think it would.

478
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,160
It would be really interesting to see that type of user's perspective.

479
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,360
Also, if you check the show notes, you can get the link to the article, but you could

480
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:52,040
also just go to ubports.com and learn more, which interestingly enough is powered by a

481
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
DigitalOcean.

482
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,200
Oh, digitalocean.com is our first sponsor this week.

483
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,040
You know, DigitalOcean's awesome like that.

484
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,560
It's not just that open source project they're hooking up, Ubiports is one of them.

485
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,280
I think they also do support for elementary OS's back end.

486
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,560
They're watching elementary OS's back end, yeah, you bet they're not.

487
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Oh yeah, you bet it.

488
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
You bet it.

489
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
You betta believe it.

490
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
They know the movers and shakers.

491
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,560
There's a few different distributions out there they're supplying infrastructure for,

492
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,240
and remember that time Wimpy was on the show working on his releasing a version of Ubuntu

493
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Mate.

494
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
He was running on DigitalOcean service.

495
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
That's right.

496
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,960
There's a reason why everybody's picking this as their infrastructure.

497
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,280
It is so, so easy to get started, so quick to get started, and it's damn reliable.

498
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,480
And it's super fast.

499
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,480
Digitalocean.com.

500
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,720
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, one word, you apply it to your account, you get a ten

501
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
dollar credit.

502
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,200
Now what's great about DigitalOcean is this super simple interface.

503
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,520
It is like, if you were gonna ask for the best interface to manage virtual machines

504
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,280
and data centers all over the world that use KVM for the virtualizer, Linux for the backend,

505
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,360
and SSD for storage, and then you want to do like templates and snapshots and have an

506
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,480
API and multiple distributions including FreeBSD to choose from, you honestly would not come

507
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
up with a better idea.

508
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,380
In fact, it's the gold standard.

509
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,840
And you know, you've probably used some of those other cloud providers interfaces.

510
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

511
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,200
We have to configure like five or six things before you've even spun up a VM.

512
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,440
That is not how it works at DO.

513
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,040
Those are like designed in the 90s.

514
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
I swear.

515
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,160
Or they just scream enterprise throughout the whole thing.

516
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
I swear to Linus.

517
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,800
Those were created in the 90s.

518
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,560
This is modern stuff.

519
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,640
But what I think is truly awesome about DigitalOcean is I've been sitting here raving about that

520
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
UI.

521
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,040
I think that whole UI runs on their API.

522
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
That's why the API is so good.

523
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
It's super great.

524
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
They did it right.

525
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,840
And it also explains why it's simple and straightforward because they got to work with it themselves.

526
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,400
I don't want to paint the answer right now.

527
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
It's awesome.

528
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,720
They got 40 gigabit connections into the hypervisors.

529
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,120
They got data centers all over the world.

530
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
They have team accounts.

531
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,360
They have hourly pricing.

532
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,600
You can run fantastic rigs with two gigs of RAM, two core processor, 40 gigabyte SSD,

533
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,960
three terabytes of transfer for three cents an hour.

534
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
What?

535
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
What?

536
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
Yeah, three cents an hour.

537
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
I know.

538
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,080
Develop locally and then deploy globally.

539
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,240
This is a really, really slick system because you could spin up a rig when you need it.

540
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,020
So you could be working in a Docker container.

541
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,020
You could be working in a VM.

542
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,400
You could be working in a jail for all I care.

543
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,800
I don't care what you're doing.

544
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,560
Maybe you're just running the directory in your opt folder.

545
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,080
I'm not going to judge because when you're ready, you publish it up to DigitalOcean.

546
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,080
You start testing on it.

547
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,800
You get a bunch of users banging on it.

548
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,160
It's so easy to manage the DNS, set up your SSH keys.

549
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
You're going to be doing it at a boss level.

550
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
DigitalOcean.com.

551
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,640
Be like Ubiports.com and become a DigitalOcean customer.

552
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,440
Just use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

553
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,080
the Unplugged program and happy 2017 to DigitalOcean.

554
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,800
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

555
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:53,720
So Wes, do you have any interest in the Firefox inaugural consensus results?

556
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,640
Oh yeah, that sounds interesting actually.

557
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,520
I'm kind of curious who finds themselves a Firefox user these days.

558
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,680
And I didn't even know they did this.

559
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
I didn't know that either.

560
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,120
But it makes sense when you, I mean you probably need that to help grow in the right direction.

561
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,600
So from the fire, here we go.

562
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:14,240
This is making me concerned from the Firefox department of whimsy.

563
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,440
We get this report.

564
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,160
This could be a bad, you know, I'm going to save it.

565
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,160
You know what?

566
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
I'll save judgment.

567
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
Let's see what's happening.

568
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,480
Because I was about to talk about having too much money and people sitting around with

569
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,560
time on their hands.

570
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,700
But no, I'm not going to get in there.

571
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,700
So let's keep going.

572
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,280
I mean you need at least two people making up department names, Chris.

573
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,600
That's how any organization works.

574
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
That's true.

575
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
All right.

576
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
You're right.

577
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
All right.

578
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,400
So a lot of their survey takers were between 18 and 34 years old or 55 plus.

579
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:50,960
80% use a PC, 12% use a Mac, and 6.8% use GNU slash Linux, GNU slash Linux.

580
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,840
However, a bunch of the Linux users bitched that I actually also run Windows a lot.

581
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,200
So I sort of voted Windows, but I still have a Linux machine I run.

582
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,240
So you should have had multi OS.

583
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Don't peg me.

584
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
That's that was in there.

585
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,240
I don't know.

586
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
I don't know what that means.

587
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
I don't know.

588
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Next time just pick Linux.

589
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Just pick.

590
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Yeah.

591
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
I know.

592
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
I know.

593
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
That's what I was thinking when I read that.

594
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
That's not that hard of a choice.

595
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,920
They even they even said, by the way, anyway, I won't go into what they talk about.

596
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,560
Speaking of our Linux folk, we found they tend to speak more languages than other OS

597
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
users.

598
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:26,120
58% of Linux users speak more than one language compared to 38% for Mac and Windows users.

599
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
So more mold.

600
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
That makes sense.

601
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,160
Linux is, you know, those it feels like Mac OS and Windows developed for English first

602
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,600
and then right and then.

603
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,360
But there's other places in the world where the people are developing their own native

604
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,840
language for open source.

605
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,880
So and they can just run it on their desktop.

606
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,040
A couple other things I thought were interesting.

607
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,720
Likes for Firefox users cooking.

608
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,640
At least 66% of good cooks, even if they don't like doing it.

609
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,520
Fall is the favorite season by 32% and 16% for winter.

610
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,200
And Star Wars beat Star Trek.

611
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,040
It was a close call.

612
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,720
Star Wars got fifty four point six percent.

613
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,200
Star Wars on this article.

614
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Yeah.

615
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
Forty five point four percent.

616
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
I know.

617
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
It's true for us.

618
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Dislikes.

619
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,560
Most actors who have played Spider-Man.

620
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,360
Fifty six percent chose no over Tobey Maguire.

621
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,360
Bungee jumping.

622
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,560
Sixty seven percent haven't been bungee jumping.

623
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,000
Twenty six say they never would.

624
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,880
Online dating they don't like.

625
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,560
Seventy nine percent have never tried it.

626
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,600
Nine percent said yes, they've tried it.

627
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,080
But it's a horror show.

628
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,480
Firefox sends their condolences.

629
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
The world.

630
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,920
Here's another thing Firefox users dislike.

631
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,920
The word jowls.

632
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,000
Fifty one percent said it's their least favorite word over synergy, fluid, and moist.

633
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That's a common one.

634
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Moist.

635
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Fluid though.

636
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Come on.

637
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,320
Fluid's a fun word and concept.

638
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,600
If people didn't mind me swearing on this show, I would be swearing about this.

639
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,080
This is what they spend their time and money on.

640
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,240
I mean they probably didn't spend a lot of time and money on it, but still.

641
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,880
I was hoping for like fifty six percent of Firefox users want multiprocessing.

642
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,200
Ten percent of Firefox users know what sandbox tabs are.

643
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
That's what I was hoping for.

644
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,200
The things that people are excited about.

645
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,680
I mean like I've been using Firefox at work and I'm always pleasantly surprised that when

646
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,560
I have a tab open and I try to open a new tab to go to that same URL, it just pops me

647
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,640
back to my current tab.

648
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,900
These are things that I like about Firefox, but I don't, this survey does not tell me

649
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,900
about that.

650
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,900
Oh man.

651
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,040
Oh too bad Alan had to go because this next one would be such a good update for him.

652
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
I should pick up the pace.

653
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
I think we're dragging.

654
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040
Should I pick up the pace?

655
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
Let's do it.

656
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
All right.

657
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
So we'll just go through this really quick.

658
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,080
Huge, huge, huge, huge, huge story everybody.

659
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,880
Linux.com.

660
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,720
How Facebook uses Linux and ButterFS.

661
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
Oh man.

662
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
Whoa.

663
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
This is going to be great.

664
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
Finally.

665
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Finally.

666
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
We've been waiting for this.

667
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Finally.

668
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,040
That pro argument that all ButterFS users always throw in my face when I say ButterFS

669
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,480
is garbage and we should abandon it.

670
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
But Chris.

671
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
But Chris.

672
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Chris.

673
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
Facebook.

674
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Facebook.

675
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
Facebook uses it on their servers Chris.

676
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
Chris.

677
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,480
Are you better than Facebook Chris?

678
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
Actually Chris.

679
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Actually.

680
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Well actually.

681
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,980
Well actually Chris.

682
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,980
Facebook uses ButterFS.

683
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,720
That's what I get.

684
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Every time I get that.

685
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
You've seen it.

686
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
Oh yeah.

687
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
Okay.

688
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
Oh yeah.

689
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
Okay.

690
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
All right.

691
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,720
So we have an interview.

692
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,720
Actually.

693
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
Yeah.

694
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
Thank you.

695
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Thank you.

696
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
Thank you.

697
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
We have an interview with not just somebody who works at Facebook in the server department

698
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,100
turns out to also be a lead developer of ButterFS.

699
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,080
So this guy pretty familiar with the product.

700
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,340
So let's go with what he says.

701
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,340
So we're going to get.

702
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,560
Now this whole article is framed around how Facebook uses ButterFS but in reality I love

703
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,400
you Swampy but it's only two questions in an entire article.

704
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,480
It's not about this at all.

705
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,200
But so Swampy asks, ButterFS has been in development for a long time.

706
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,460
Is it ready for prime time?

707
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,320
I know some distributions are using it as a default file system while others don't.

708
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,080
So the question is, is ButterFS ready for prime time?

709
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
It's right there.

710
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
Is it ready?

711
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,160
The direct quote is, is it ready for prime time?

712
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:03,720
Chris Mason's answer, it's certainly the default in Soos.

713
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,800
Pretty strong answer there.

714
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,920
And then he goes on talking about Soos and how Soos uses it.

715
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,800
And then he says, Red Hat hasn't picked it up in the same way.

716
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Okay.

717
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,800
Okay.

718
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Next question.

719
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,420
What are the areas where ButterFS makes more sense?

720
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:24,480
If I'm not wrong, Facebook also uses ButterFS?

721
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,960
Here's all of the millions of deployments that Facebook has.

722
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
It just has a couple of qualifiers.

723
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,600
Inside of Facebook, again, we pick targeted places where we think the features of ButterFS

724
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
are really beneficial to the workloads at hand.

725
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,220
The big areas we're trying to focus on are system management tasks, the snapshotting

726
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,220
type of things.

727
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,840
In other words, they run it on a tiny fraction of their systems where that specific workload

728
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,000
makes sense for ButterFS.

729
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,520
So when you hear Facebook runs ButterFS, they run it on some of their servers.

730
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,460
And then it's for things like, okay, well, you have snapshots for your root file system,

731
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:05,580
you can do rollbacks, that kind of thing, but it's not their giant storage cluster.

732
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,600
He also goes on to say that they use Gluster and XFS, and that they're all pretty much

733
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,880
Linux, and that they don't really use ButterFS outside of management tasks around distributing

734
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,100
around operating systems and updates by snapshotting features.

735
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,240
And they like checks on the features.

736
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:27,120
So they think ButterFS, and I agree, has some snapshots, checksums, copy-on-write, all things

737
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,800
I would love, sub-volumes, all things I would love to see.

738
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
Those are legitimate uses.

739
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,360
And it's not that I don't like ButterFS, actually that's not true.

740
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,420
I don't like ButterFS.

741
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,400
It's a bad product, it's got a bad brand, nobody's deploying it seriously.

742
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,240
And unfortunately, it's a jalopy, everybody knows it, unfortunately.

743
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,640
I wish it wasn't.

744
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:52,900
Because the world needs ButterFS, because ZFS isn't GPL.

745
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,520
And I really think that's why XFS has been getting a ton of development in the last year

746
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,520
and a half.

747
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,080
Like the development pace on XFS is skyrocketing.

748
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,240
And I think it really is, like they're talking about adding copy-on-write support to XFS.

749
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,320
I really think XFS is trying to now fill that hole a little bit.

750
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,080
And I think it kind of illustrates as well, like I know some of the things people in the

751
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,480
XFS camp have talked about, you know, is ButterFS really wasn't designed in the way where, you

752
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,280
know, stability, production, runnableness came first, where it wasn't going to lose

753
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
your data.

754
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:28,040
But I think it kind of highlights the siloed nature sometimes of kernel development, where

755
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,920
we do have this like thriving XFS community, where it's very much trusted in production,

756
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,960
and they're going to add some features, but they're going to do it in a way where they

757
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,720
ensure they don't break compatibility.

758
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,400
They're not going to break your file system.

759
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,840
Will, go ahead.

760
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,480
So just, it looks like in here, from what he said, pretty much all Linux, the places

761
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,680
we're targeting is ButterFS and really management around tasks and distributing the operating

762
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,680
system.

763
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,400
This pretty much means if we have a server, the operating system is going to be installed

764
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
on ButterFS.

765
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
I didn't read it that way.

766
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
I do get that.

767
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
I see what you're saying.

768
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,760
But see what he says, when he says here, where they have targeted specific work environments,

769
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,120
that to me means that's not all of their systems.

770
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,040
You will want the operating system to be using ButterFS and have Snapshotty and all that

771
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,320
kind of stuff, but you don't need all of the application that they have on top, which is

772
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,500
Facebook or whatever the database is or whatever it's the program, needs to be on the same

773
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,840
file system because that will actually make sense.

774
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,760
It's not needed for that.

775
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,660
It's targeted of environment, doesn't mean the whole environment doesn't actually compensate

776
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,600
or encompasses that part.

777
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
All right.

778
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Okay.

779
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Fine.

780
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
All right.

781
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,820
So William, when usually we're talking about file systems, this is usually what I like

782
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:41,600
to check in with you because you always tantalize me with... I can't remember the name of it

783
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
right now.

784
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
But it's-

785
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
BcashFS, I think.

786
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Yes.

787
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
Thank you.

788
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Yes, it is.

789
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
It is.

790
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
Can we get a little BcashFS update?

791
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
How's it going?

792
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,040
So development's still progressing at a pretty smooth pace.

793
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,280
Encryption still hasn't landed, but there's a branch for it.

794
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,600
A lot of work has been focusing on performance and stability recently in just the feature

795
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,000
set that is there so far.

796
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,480
Those are good things.

797
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,040
Unfortunately, we don't have snapshotting yet, but checksumming works, and he's also

798
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:13,600
working on multi-tiering and replication and those sorts of multi-device type features.

799
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,120
Now, is... Okay.

800
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,120
Is there no work being done right now on Extended 5?

801
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,680
Is that a thing?

802
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,320
I guess that's...

803
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
I think that's a pipe dream.

804
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,320
Yeah.

805
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,320
All right.

806
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,080
Also, I don't really see why you would want to port the X4 code base forward to add those

807
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,560
type of features because it's a mess.

808
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
Right.

809
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,280
It's easier to do that kind of clean room implementation.

810
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,520
Super quick mention, because I said I wanted to pick up the base, Kodi.

811
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
Love it.

812
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
Hey.

813
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
One of our favorites.

814
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,000
Seventeen is just around the corner.

815
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,840
RC2 is out as we record this.

816
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,720
Not much of a difference between RC2 and RC1, so if you're on RC1, don't worry.

817
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,800
But I just wanted to give it a quick mention because it is coming down the pipe soon, and

818
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,240
if you have a Kodi box you can test on, they could probably use the help because this is

819
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,960
a huge release.

820
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,760
The new theme is really what the headline feature is, the new default theme, which does

821
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
look super good.

822
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
You see that?

823
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
It does look really nice.

824
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
That looks really slick.

825
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,040
But tons of new backend stuff, new way... I mean like everything from the PVR stuff to

826
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,640
the video decoding stuff, add-on manager changes, all of that is worth talking... Is Mr. Tennell

827
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,640
still in there?

828
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
Mr. Tennell?

829
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,640
Rotten.

830
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,120
Michael, do you have any Kodi thoughts before... You're usually following Kodi pretty closely.

831
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,080
Do you have any Kodi 17 thoughts?

832
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,000
Is there somebody who has a few add-ons on 16, are there things maybe I'll have to worry

833
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
about for 17?

834
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Do you know any of the... Are you hip to any of that?

835
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,520
Yeah, there's a lot of differences in 16 and 17.

836
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,760
They're mostly appearance things, like the Krypton changes a lot of stuff for the way

837
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,440
the theme is going to change, so it's actually changing a lot of the way the interfaces for

838
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,760
all the different applicant add-ons work.

839
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,160
So it's mostly transparent, you don't have to do that much, but there are some add-ons

840
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,840
that require rewrites, but overall it's not a bad thing, it's more like they got a lot

841
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,640
of extra features they can utilize.

842
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:09,120
What I think is great is the LibreOffice, not LibreOffice, why did I say that, LibreELEC.

843
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,160
The fork of LibreELEC is really fast-paced development with Kodi.

844
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,480
So Krypton's not even out, and LibreELEC already has builds for the Krypton version, so the

845
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,820
alpha builds and the beta builds are already there, whereas OpenELEC doesn't even have

846
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,860
one yet.

847
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,940
So it's really something I would suggest people look at if they're looking at using Kodi.

848
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,960
So I'm going to put a link to this in the show notes if you guys want it.

849
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,120
It's LibreELEC.tv, and their tagline is Just Enough OS for Kodi.

850
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,040
So this is something you install, it gets you a base Kodi box, like an appliance-level

851
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,500
OS that gets fairly close, that tracks the Kodi development fairly closely.

852
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,880
So that's pretty cool, LibreELEC over OpenELEC, I'm going to check that out.

853
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
Thank you, sir.

854
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,480
That's cool, I'm dropping that in the show notes right now.

855
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
17 is...

856
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,480
I can't wait till it airs.

857
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480
Oh, I know.

858
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
I can't wait till it gets out.

859
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,480
I've been just continuously impressed with Kodi.

860
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
I'm using it on...

861
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
All the places you can use it.

862
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,480
I'm using it on the Android TV.

863
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
Oh, really?

864
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
Yeah.

865
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
I'm using it on the...

866
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
I have not tried it on Android yet.

867
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
Super good.

868
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,480
It's super, super...

869
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
I can't...

870
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,040
It's got to be one of the best Android applications ever.

871
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
It's just so...

872
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
Wow.

873
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,640
It's like everything you want from Kodi in an app.

874
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,640
It's so...

875
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,400
I mean, like, I'm sitting there browsing Zomboshare's on an Android app.

876
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,400
It's just totally mind-blowing.

877
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,320
Without having to go tab out to some other app or any of that.

878
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,320
That's so great.

879
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,320
Wow.

880
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,520
And it can browse my local file system, too, which is good because I've got a hard drive

881
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
in that thing.

882
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,520
Ah, I tell you what.

883
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,520
I just...

884
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,520
I really love it on there.

885
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
And it's such a...

886
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,320
It's such a true appliance at that level.

887
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,960
Like, we just unplug it from the wall sometimes, and it's just no big deal.

888
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
It's so awesome.

889
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
That's...

890
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
That's amazing.

891
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Mm-hmm.

892
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
Mm-hmm.

893
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
I did an episode on it of the Linux Action Show for you guys.

894
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
Here.

895
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
Thunderbird development.

896
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,860
So this is a question that came in from Kapi in the subreddit, and he asked, has anyone

897
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,080
tried out Zimbr Desktop as a replacement for Thunderbird because he's worried about it

898
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
dropping off?

899
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Yep.

900
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
And Zimbr Desktop...

901
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
Or...

902
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Well, if you like Outlook, you'll like Zimbr Desktop.

903
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,960
That's kind of being harsh.

904
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,160
It's better than Outlook, I guess, but...

905
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
What does that even say?

906
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,640
I want to check in with you.

907
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,720
Are you still using LASN1 as your email client?

908
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,000
I've kind of fallen off with LASN1.

909
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Oh!

910
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yeah.

911
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,660
I was using it for a while, and I was enjoying it, and I liked it, but I didn't find myself

912
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,080
using any of the pro features.

913
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,080
I don't really...

914
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
I mean, I send emails, right?

915
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,360
I receive emails mostly, but I don't need enough.

916
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:33,440
At work, we have 365, so I end up using the web interface for that anyway, so it was enough

917
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,360
to kind of keep things in the web interface.

918
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,080
That said, I still think it's a good project.

919
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
I'm excited for what they've done.

920
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,400
I like the way they develop things.

921
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,520
I just don't know if I have enough of a use case.

922
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,840
If anybody in the mobile room has thoughts on their favorite awesome mail client, tag

923
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
me in the chat room.

924
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,960
Actually, I'm still using N1.

925
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,760
What are your thoughts?

926
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
It's become invaluable.

927
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,760
Wow.

928
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,320
Not like I'd have to have it, but I definitely...

929
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,920
Like when I installed Solace, I was like, oh my God, can I get N1?

930
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,180
Oh, I can.

931
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,760
What I really like about it is two things.

932
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,000
I super like the fact that I can snooze emails, and I can say, alert me about this email tomorrow

933
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
at 6 PM.

934
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
That is such a nice feature, because it helps me get away from leaving the mark as unread,

935
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
because like...

936
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That gets messy so fast.

937
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Oh my God, dude.

938
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I wonder if it says on my phone, if I pull up the mail icon, does it say how much freaking

939
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
mail I have?

940
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,380
It is an unbelievable amount of unread mail I have at this very moment, and so using what

941
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:42,520
used to be a great horrible system, I suppose, of just leaving messages as unread, and then

942
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,200
if it was unread, then I knew I needed to follow up on it.

943
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
That doesn't work.

944
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,560
You can't do that.

945
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,440
Not when you have like a ton of email to get to.

946
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,200
So being able to set a reminder like that is super useful, because then it goes out

947
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,360
of my inbox.

948
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,360
It clears out.

949
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,120
So it looks like it's been cleared out of my inbox.

950
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,000
Anything that can reduce the complexity of what you have to do, and it can make it easy

951
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,320
at a glance to just be like, this is what I need to deal with now, later, I will check

952
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,680
again and deal with what needs to be dealt with then.

953
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,680
But the other thing I really like about it is this creepy feature that it has.

954
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,080
Talking about the read notifications?

955
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,880
Yeah, which is like read receipts on a whole new level.

956
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,480
Do you have any idea how they're doing it?

957
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,120
I assume they're shipping like a little pixel or element inside there.

958
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:28,320
There's something in the email, but it seems to work even with plain text emails.

959
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,920
But I don't know if that's true.

960
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,800
I guess maybe everybody I email uses HTML mail, but it would have to be damn near everybody

961
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
I email.

962
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,800
So here's what it does, and it even integrates them with Gnome's notifications.

963
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,440
So it's so fun.

964
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,480
So I send off an email to somebody, and when they read it, instead of getting like the

965
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,760
traditional read receipt email that you get in your email box, I get a push notification

966
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,720
to the email client, which shows up as a Gnome notification that Wes has read my email.

967
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,220
And I get that every time Wes opens up my emails, and it turns out, and this is really

968
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,560
valuable for me because I like to dive into email and then get out for a while.

969
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,720
And so I can tell if I'm having an active conversation with somebody because I can see

970
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,960
that they're reading my emails, and then I know if I need to stay present.

971
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,800
The other thing that's really great is if I leave n1 minimize in the background or running

972
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,740
on like my second desktop and I'm on my main desktop, I will often see like Wes has opened

973
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,720
up your email, blah, blah, blah, blah.

974
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:30,240
Because what everybody seems to do in the entire world is instead of, when they go to

975
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,760
email somebody, they just open up the last email from them, hit reply, clear out the

976
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,840
subject line, put a new subject line in, clear out the body, put a new body in, and send

977
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,840
the email.

978
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,920
And so everybody opens up my old emails before they send me a new email, at least a lot of

979
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,200
people, not everybody.

980
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,860
So I end up getting a notification in like five, ten minutes that, hey, you're about

981
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,800
to get an email from Wes.

982
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
So I keep an eye out.

983
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,920
And without fail, it always happens.

984
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,960
Wow, actually that's pretty handy.

985
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,640
It is very handy because otherwise, once I'm out, I'm done.

986
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,440
It might be days until I open up my email again.

987
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,960
You could have like, you know, you could have solved that thing or come to a resolution

988
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,520
with a question you had right there.

989
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,520
So that turns out to be a very super creepy, great feature.

990
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,880
Well, maybe I'll have to give it another try.

991
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:17,360
So that combined with the delay, the way you can snooze emails, and the overall UI is nice.

992
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,120
I mean, it's an Electron app, but it's probably one of the best Electron apps I've ever used.

993
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,120
I never found it to be slow or anything like that.

994
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,880
And I don't mind that it has a pay structure.

995
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,520
I'm glad the company's going to be around.

996
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,880
And they still allow you to host your own server, which works fine on DigitalOcean.

997
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,880
So I'm happy.

998
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,880
Yeah.

999
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,880
I don't disagree with that.

1000
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,840
I never want that feature ever, ever, ever.

1001
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,840
The creepy tracking?

1002
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,840
Yes.

1003
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,840
Yes.

1004
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,840
Please.

1005
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,840
No.

1006
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Please.

1007
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,880
If I want to have that type of knowledge about people being about to text me, I would use

1008
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,680
an instance messaging service.

1009
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,680
There's plenty out there already.

1010
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,600
I'll make another one if you're listening to this, by the way.

1011
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,720
I should also say it has pretty great GPG integration, too.

1012
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,160
It beats even Enigma or whatever.

1013
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
What's the Thunderbird extension?

1014
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
Yeah.

1015
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,160
Enigma.

1016
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,160
There's also the...

1017
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,160
Well, Enigma...

1018
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,160
Yeah.

1019
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,160
It's good.

1020
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,160
It's fine.

1021
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
Yeah, it is.

1022
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,240
I like Enigma a lot, so I'm not trying to disparage it, because I also like that it

1023
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,240
has good key management.

1024
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:21,680
Made it easy, and it came out quickly on the time that FSF was trying to cash on the fears

1025
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,960
because of the revelations and stuff.

1026
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,960
It kind of does work.

1027
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
But you know what?

1028
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,960
Yes.

1029
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,240
So I just wanted to get it out there for Kipi, because N1 might be something, if you're willing

1030
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,000
to host your own server or willing to let them host it for you, because it does require

1031
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
that server-side component.

1032
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Right.

1033
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,480
And that's how the tracking works, but also sending notifications to your desktop.

1034
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:47,920
The other thing that's really great about it is that intermediary server seems...

1035
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,380
It just gets really shitty when you get a lot of email, and sometimes red status doesn't

1036
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,880
get synced correctly through IMAP and stuff like that.

1037
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,160
It's just a pain in the butt, and the N1 client doesn't seem to have those issues.

1038
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,440
So I like that a lot about it, too.

1039
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,900
So there you go, Kipi.

1040
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,240
That's my answer to your Thunderbird question.

1041
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,440
Now, before we go any further in the show, we really got to get to the predictions.

1042
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,560
We got to get to the predictions.

1043
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,820
That's the whole point of the show.

1044
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,240
That's got to be where we're going.

1045
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,800
So let's talk about Ting.

1046
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,320
That's our next sponsor here on the Unplugged program, and Ting is mobile service that's

1047
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,480
perfect for our audience, because it's really quite simple.

1048
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,720
If you just think about how you use your phone a little bit, you can save a ton of money.

1049
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,720
Honestly, it's not really all that bad.

1050
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:33,880
One of the things I've done is we have a nanny for the kids, and she has an iPhone on Ting.

1051
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,020
And I don't go like, Jenny, don't use data.

1052
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,020
Don't make phone calls.

1053
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,240
She just uses it however she wants.

1054
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,440
I don't really bother.

1055
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,040
I am the weirdo that enjoys hacking the system.

1056
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:53,680
I like looking at my bill and going, three phones, and I've only spent 35 bucks.

1057
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,680
That's crazy.

1058
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,400
I like that, because I know how to use Wi-Fi for phone calls and downloading podcasts.

1059
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,960
And you can get the thrill of optimization there.

1060
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,960
Yeah, I know.

1061
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,960
That's great.

1062
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,960
It's like, hey, I won a little bit.

1063
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,960
I cheated the system.

1064
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,960
That's right.

1065
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:06,960
I do deserve this cheeseburger.

1066
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,960
That's right.

1067
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,960
That's right.

1068
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,960
That's a good way to think about it.

1069
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,960
I do deserve a cheeseburger.

1070
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,960
You do.

1071
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,960
Right now.

1072
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,960
You sure do.

1073
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,960
Freak eye.

1074
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,960
Yeah.

1075
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,300
He deserves a cheeseburger, too.

1076
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,600
So here's what's great about Ting is your average monthly bill is like 23 bucks.

1077
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,200
That's your average device cost, like six bucks for your line, and then your usage will

1078
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,720
generally work out to about 23 bucks.

1079
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,720
It's amazing.

1080
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,000
And if you start with our URL, linux.ting.com, you get $25 in service credit, so it'll pay

1081
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
for more than your first month.

1082
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,160
Now, if you don't have a device, you can go get one with that $25, and that's also a great

1083
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,160
way to go.

1084
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,160
They have fantastic customer service.

1085
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,840
They have CDMA and GSM networks to choose from, no contracts, no early termination fee,

1086
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:54,480
and they have, guess what, a really great control panel, a legit, a lit, as the YouTubers

1087
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
say.

1088
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
They have a lit control panel.

1089
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,480
Did you know that?

1090
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,480
I did not.

1091
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,480
Lit.

1092
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,480
Lit.

1093
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,480
Which I thought at first was like you're lit up.

1094
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,480
Yeah.

1095
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,480
Right.

1096
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,480
Sure.

1097
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,480
Getting lit.

1098
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,480
Yeah.

1099
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,480
Or you're getting wasted, getting lit.

1100
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,480
Yeah.

1101
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,480
I guess that's another term, getting lit, right?

1102
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,980
This is quite the overloaded operator we've got here.

1103
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,340
But no, now it's legit.

1104
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,340
Too lit to quit.

1105
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,340
Legit.

1106
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,340
Shouldn't it be le?

1107
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,520
That's le.

1108
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,520
Ting is le.

1109
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,520
It really is.

1110
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,480
I'm going on almost like what, three years with Ting?

1111
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,480
That's le.

1112
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,480
Let me tell you, that's le.

1113
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,480
That's longer than a lot of relationships.

1114
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,480
Look at you guys.

1115
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,480
Also that's le.

1116
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,480
Congratulations.

1117
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,480
I know.

1118
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,480
Me and Ting, you know what?

1119
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,800
I think it's really Kyra that makes it all work.

1120
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,120
I think Kyra behind the scenes, she's pushing all the buttons and making it possible.

1121
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,680
Without Kyra, I don't know what would be going on.

1122
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,080
Who else would explain to us how Ting works?

1123
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,080
We can't do it.

1124
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,080
We need her.

1125
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,080
No.

1126
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,080
Ting keeps rates simple.

1127
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,080
We don't make you pick a plan.

1128
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,480
Instead, you just use your phone as you normally would.

1129
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,580
How much you use determines how much you pay each month.

1130
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,420
You can have as many devices as you want on one account.

1131
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,560
That's good because when you use more, you pay less per minute, message, or megabyte

1132
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,560
of data.

1133
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:05,760
Your usage plus $6 per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill.

1134
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,760
Simple.

1135
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,640
That's what we mean when we say mobile.

1136
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,640
That makes sense.

1137
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,640
Yeah.

1138
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:19,280
Go check out their lit control panel, too, and I got an app, too, which is really nice.

1139
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,840
Sim cards for like $9.

1140
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,220
Put them in a device, security system, anything like that.

1141
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,360
I think you know what?

1142
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,800
I just got a really interesting idea.

1143
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,680
I would love to be able to check the battery status of LadyJuice remotely.

1144
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,840
I wonder if there's a little way I could hook up an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi and a little

1145
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,840
Ting.

1146
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,840
I'm sure you could.

1147
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:45,040
It wouldn't be great if I could SSH into something and get the battery level.

1148
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,040
Yes.

1149
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,040
That would be great.

1150
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,120
Maybe turn the car on remotely.

1151
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,120
Yeah.

1152
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,120
All right.

1153
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,120
All right.

1154
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,120
All right.

1155
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,120
You know what I can do?

1156
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,120
Let me try this.

1157
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,760
I'm not sure if this is the right command.

1158
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,760
Alexa, ask automatic how much gas I have.

1159
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,840
Your Ford Super Duty F53 motor home is 80% full.

1160
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,680
Your RAM 1500 is 72% full.

1161
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,680
Isn't that great?

1162
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,680
Wow.

1163
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,680
Yeah.

1164
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,680
We're going to get into that more later.

1165
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,760
Let's start with our 2017 predictions.

1166
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,580
I don't know what it is this year.

1167
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:26,840
This year, I feel like it's going to be the year of more of the same.

1168
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,440
What do I get excited about if it's more momentum in the right direction?

1169
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,720
We're going to have some fights.

1170
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,040
We're going to have some missteps, but overall, we're going to do pretty good.

1171
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,720
Maybe that means for all the negative 2016 comments, maybe it really wasn't a bad year

1172
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,720
for Linux at all.

1173
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,720
Yeah.

1174
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,720
I don't know about that.

1175
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,720
I don't know.

1176
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,720
I don't know.

1177
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,720
No.

1178
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,720
No.

1179
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,280
Freck Labs is not saying it's 1500% full.

1180
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,520
There's two different vehicles listed there, one motor home, one truck.

1181
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,760
So I want to defer to the virtual lug.

1182
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,640
Maybe they can get us going.

1183
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,640
Maybe they can get us.

1184
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,120
Do you have a quick one off the tip of your tongue?

1185
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,200
Well, we kind of already talked about it.

1186
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,720
I was just thinking at the end, we'll see BcashFS.

1187
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,320
I think by the end of 2017, that's going to be something that we will be talking about

1188
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,320
more.

1189
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,320
Interesting.

1190
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,320
I wonder if he just told Williams.

1191
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,320
All right.

1192
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,320
Sweetloo, what is your...

1193
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,320
Go ahead.

1194
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,320
You'll get first.

1195
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,320
Go.

1196
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:25,680
Well, I still hold on to my prediction about Ubuntu and Microsoft merging when Ubuntu reaches

1197
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,320
the end of the alphabet on this coming April.

1198
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,880
I'm going to keep track of this.

1199
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,880
I'm going to keep track of this.

1200
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:38,600
So Sweetloo's prediction is really what you're...are you really saying that Microsoft buys Canonical?

1201
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,600
Is that what you're saying?

1202
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,600
Yeah, either that or merges with...

1203
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,560
Yeah, it's going to be an acquisition, right?

1204
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,560
Not happening.

1205
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,560
All right.

1206
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,560
All right.

1207
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,560
So and then...

1208
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,560
All right.

1209
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,560
Hold on.

1210
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,560
I got to write this down.

1211
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,560
So that's not...

1212
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,560
Microsoft...

1213
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,560
Okay, go ahead.

1214
00:48:54,560 --> 00:49:00,440
May make a deal with Canonical or actually more likely with Suze to be honest, though,

1215
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,880
because it's the previous deal.

1216
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:10,000
To have them help them support a Linux kernel, I don't believe they will acquire Canonical.

1217
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Is it like an Ubuntu...

1218
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Not now.

1219
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,220
It's like an Ubuntu blast kernel running on Azure?

1220
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:20,920
Not just that, but also because remember my prediction, we're ever closer to the year

1221
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:27,440
of my prediction of Microsoft running with Linux kernel and a Windows desktop environment

1222
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,440
on top that is proprietary.

1223
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,440
God, I would love that.

1224
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,840
Yeah, but I just think they're so allergic to the GPL.

1225
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,840
I think they're...

1226
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,840
They're not, though.

1227
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,840
They're not.

1228
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,640
This is the thing that they've been realizing is that it's actually useful to have other

1229
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:42,560
people maintain your stuff and you will not ever have the issue of not having people to

1230
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,720
hire to fix your stuff because everybody knows it.

1231
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:52,240
That's logical and very cognizant, but do you think they've actually made that big of

1232
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,240
a change?

1233
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,240
Yeah.

1234
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,240
Yes.

1235
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:03,200
Because look at the companies, I just can't not look at the fact that they've been acquiring

1236
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,640
talent more with the acquisitions of the apps companies and so on.

1237
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,360
They're not acquiring just the companies, they're acquiring talent that knows how to

1238
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,280
work in this platform without telling the world that they're doing so.

1239
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,720
Right now, if you want to look at the prospects of any business in IT and you want to know

1240
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,340
what they're up to, there's two ways.

1241
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:25,840
You can ask them and they might say about it or you can look at what they're hiring

1242
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,240
because they can't lie about the hiring because otherwise they'll not get the right people.

1243
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,640
So do you want to go on record and say that you're going to see Microsoft products running

1244
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,680
on an Ubuntu kernel or do you want to actually say Windows because I could actually get behind

1245
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,680
the first one.

1246
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,640
I don't know if I could get behind Windows in 2017.

1247
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm not sure if it will be in 2017, but until 2018, I'm pretty sure there will be a Linux

1248
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,160
kernel with a Windows desktop environment.

1249
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,160
I think-

1250
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,160
That was my prediction.

1251
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,160
It was a five-year span.

1252
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,160
They're three years in.

1253
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,640
They already have a Linux distribution on the server and Azure and all the stuff.

1254
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,160
They love Linux now.

1255
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,160
Here's what I'm going to say.

1256
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,920
I'm going to kind of hijack your prediction a bit and I'm going to say in 2017, Microsoft

1257
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,640
makes a deal with Canonical to run a product on an Ubuntu blessed kernel.

1258
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:19,800
And it might be like the more like the slimmed down Ubuntu stuff, like Ubuntu core.

1259
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,600
I could totally see that.

1260
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,920
I could see them doing that on the cloud.

1261
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,240
I could even see them doing that in like a product.

1262
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:32,000
I really could see that happening, but running their core Windows desktop, I've always thought

1263
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
eventually to go on a VM, but I figured it'd be because it'd be replaced with another Microsoft

1264
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
product.

1265
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Right.

1266
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,200
And it seems like I could see them doing that on a BSD or something, but I feel like they're

1267
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,280
always going to want to withhold that to be able to have their new proprietary drivers,

1268
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,360
their new custom kernel integration that lets them have the one new feature or the HoloLens

1269
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,440
support or something where they have a competitive edge in the business.

1270
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,920
And I don't think, I think there are still enough things at the OS level for the desktop

1271
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,440
world that they wouldn't be willing to share that.

1272
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,880
On the cloud server angle, yes, I think that's a different ball game for them.

1273
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,400
I think you're on the same page.

1274
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:12,240
To be honest, it won't matter that much the feature of Microsoft and like in general what

1275
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:18,120
OS you're running because they're really moving to the assistant world, want to give you Windows

1276
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,120
10 for free.

1277
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,120
Why?

1278
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,120
Because it doesn't matter.

1279
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:25,220
You're going to profit on having you talk with Cortana.

1280
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:29,440
This is the thing that actually is dragging people still to Windows 10 and try and they

1281
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,080
were excited about the experimentation.

1282
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,880
You can run Cortana everywhere, even in your Android phone.

1283
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,280
Alexa, what do you think of Cortana?

1284
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,280
I like all AIs.

1285
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,280
Yeah.

1286
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,280
She's pretty nice.

1287
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,280
Fires.

1288
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,280
Yeah.

1289
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,980
So producer Michael, I would love to hear your predictions.

1290
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:48,980
You wanted to jump in.

1291
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,980
Go ahead.

1292
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:50,980
Yeah.

1293
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:55,480
One of my predictions is I think SNAPs will make a big leap forward ahead of everything

1294
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,480
else.

1295
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,480
Oh, yeah.

1296
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,480
So it's the year of SNAPs, huh?

1297
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,480
Yeah.

1298
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,800
I think the SNAPs are already on the track record of becoming the more standardized way

1299
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,880
of deployment, but I think this year they're going to set themselves apart way farther

1300
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:14,760
than 5X or App Images could be close to catching up.

1301
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,960
I think that won't happen until the end of the year, but I think it'll happen.

1302
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,800
I think 1710 will probably offer a Unity 8 by default.

1303
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,800
Oh.

1304
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,800
Okay.

1305
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,800
All right.

1306
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,800
So that's two right there.

1307
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,800
I'm going to mark you down for it.

1308
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,800
So 1710, Unity by default.

1309
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Unity.

1310
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,800
You mean, you mean Unity 8 by default.

1311
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,800
Unity 8.

1312
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,800
Yeah.

1313
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,800
I meant Unity 8.

1314
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,800
Yeah.

1315
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,800
Okay.

1316
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,800
QT switch and stuff.

1317
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,800
Ooh.

1318
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,800
Ooh.

1319
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,800
Oh.

1320
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,800
All right.

1321
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,800
All right.

1322
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,800
All right, Double.

1323
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,800
You got two predictions for us.

1324
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,800
Go.

1325
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,800
I do.

1326
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,880
One is we're finally getting a proper KMS support as well as the right Wayland support.

1327
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:53,880
Okay.

1328
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,880
I'm down with that.

1329
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,760
The second is Solus is going to become more popular and will eventually come out with

1330
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:06,680
a AUR type solution similar to Arch where you can, you know, the community can maintain

1331
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,200
build scripts for separate packages.

1332
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,760
I get to see that.

1333
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,480
So it's like a Solus AUR equivalent.

1334
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,960
I'm going to vote for, I'm going to, my prediction is that doesn't happen.

1335
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,960
Yeah.

1336
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,960
Okay.

1337
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,960
Yeah.

1338
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,960
Here's the thing.

1339
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,960
Solus is anti AUR, anti other people's packages.

1340
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,960
Yeah.

1341
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,960
Yeah.

1342
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,320
I've already tried to make my own packages with them and they've already told me nah-uh.

1343
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,320
Yeah.

1344
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,320
Yeah.

1345
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,320
Yeah.

1346
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,320
Yeah.

1347
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,800
So I've done this too with Solus and the thing is if you go to install an application that

1348
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:40,040
doesn't support Solus, like you don't have the advantage of a dev or an RPM install.

1349
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,480
So you go into EO package and you copy a couple make files, you create a script, it starts

1350
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,380
downloading the source and you go through this rigmarole to get one thing installed.

1351
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,960
What people are doing is posting those to the Wiki.

1352
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,160
So the Wiki is starting to contain more and more of this third party and I think as they

1353
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,860
gain popularity, they're not going to be able to keep up and so they're going to have the

1354
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:01,160
ability for you to actually compile them, but it's not going to be part of the main

1355
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,160
repo.

1356
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,160
Yeah.

1357
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,240
I think that this is the possibility of happening, but I don't think it'll be Solus back.

1358
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,280
Solus will not like endorse it or anything.

1359
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:15,360
There won't be an SUR and my main reason is because I'm an official maintainer of a package

1360
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,560
for like the official upstream and they still wouldn't let me control the package in the

1361
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,560
thing.

1362
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,560
Yeah, but you just named it, dude.

1363
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,120
The SUR is good.

1364
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,120
I like that.

1365
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,120
That's good.

1366
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,120
You're welcome, sir.

1367
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,120
Yeah.

1368
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,120
I think there's something wrong with that.

1369
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,760
I don't know so much about NVIDIA getting Wayland support this year.

1370
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,880
I would say maybe beta support.

1371
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,280
I don't know about, I don't know.

1372
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,280
Oh, sorry, Wes.

1373
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,240
I was stepping on your pedal, Wes.

1374
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,320
At the end of the year maybe, you know, you start seeing the, yeah, some of the, like

1375
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,680
if you install some of the beta drivers or something that starts working.

1376
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,680
Yes, exactly.

1377
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,680
That's what I was thinking.

1378
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,680
But it's not like the default, it's not shipped in the...

1379
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,680
Yeah.

1380
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,800
And it won't be like the unbelievably great performance that we want or something yet.

1381
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,800
But I don't know.

1382
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,800
But maybe you're right, Double.

1383
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,840
Maybe they'll, they should, right?

1384
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,840
Here's the thing.

1385
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,560
It's not like they haven't seen it coming.

1386
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:04,760
We've been, Wayland has got to be the slowest moving train coming at you and it's like there's,

1387
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:08,080
if you don't see the Wayland train coming, then you're not looking.

1388
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,080
You are not looking.

1389
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,080
You've had like, what?

1390
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,520
Like four years now of gradual buildup?

1391
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,520
Yeah.

1392
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,520
That's ridiculous.

1393
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,520
All right.

1394
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,680
Anybody else in there want to toss into the mix a prediction for Linux in 2017?

1395
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,160
Hmm.

1396
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,680
Really?

1397
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,680
Nobody else has anything else?

1398
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,680
No?

1399
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,680
Nobody else?

1400
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,680
It's not going to be the year of the desktop.

1401
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,680
No?

1402
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,680
Linux desktop.

1403
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,680
Is there ever going to be a year?

1404
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,680
I'm not surprised at that at all.

1405
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,680
Will there ever be?

1406
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,680
I don't think so.

1407
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:34,680
Yeah.

1408
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,680
It depends on your perspective.

1409
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,280
If you want to talk about Linux in general, Chrome OS already kind of did that.

1410
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,960
A little birdie tells me from the Solus project that there's no way in hell the AUR is happening.

1411
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:51,440
I'm not going to, no, no, they say, no, no AUR free, no SUR, which is too bad.

1412
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,880
Can we make wishes too?

1413
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:58,000
I do agree that Solus will become even more popular than it has been before.

1414
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Yeah.

1415
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Yeah.

1416
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I think so too.

1417
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
So the predictions, can we make wishes?

1418
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Oh, I'd love to hear it.

1419
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Yeah.

1420
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:10,200
I just, I just wish that we have one either in a Google play store, like it's something

1421
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,840
that is just across all OSs.

1422
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:18,200
It actually is able to, if the app has compatibility with your multiple OSs, install it, please.

1423
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,200
Yeah.

1424
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,200
Yeah.

1425
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:25,540
Rekai says, if you're looking for crazy predictions, maybe 2017 will finally be the year KDE cleans

1426
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,040
up its mess of settings.

1427
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,040
Ouch.

1428
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,040
Wow.

1429
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,040
Wow.

1430
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,040
I don't know.

1431
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,040
How dare you, sir.

1432
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:36,000
But then how, where, what will we have that the windows users will be comfortable with?

1433
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Wait, where's the refuge?

1434
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,640
Yeah.

1435
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,520
I still feel like I don't have like, I don't have my like succinct prediction.

1436
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,280
I feel like I have good commentary on other people's predictions.

1437
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,280
Go ahead, Delby.

1438
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,840
You can jump in again.

1439
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:58,740
So I wonder if at the end of 2017, we'll look back at the 2016 MacBook Pro release and basically

1440
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:03,440
realize that a lot of developers have switched over to Linux and the wish and the wonder

1441
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,440
is going to be what gains we see on the Linux desktop from that.

1442
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:14,760
Do you think it's possible Apple could hustle and crap out another MacBook in like June

1443
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,360
that is 32 gigs of RAM?

1444
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,200
Do you think that could happen?

1445
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,240
Or are they just like, or do you think they're up there in their Johnny Ive white towers

1446
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,880
going, I don't know what the problem is.

1447
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,000
This is a really powerful machine.

1448
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
It's great.

1449
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
They just need to figure it out.

1450
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I don't think that's going to happen now that they rely on common people to just get their

1451
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
stuff.

1452
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,520
They don't care anymore to make it really high tech.

1453
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,520
Mass consumer.

1454
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,520
Yeah.

1455
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,520
Yeah.

1456
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,560
I was about to say, I don't think they're worried about like, what's the problem.

1457
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,360
I think they're like, there's no problem.

1458
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,360
Yeah.

1459
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,200
I wonder if that ties into that, their IBM partnership and stuff, because it seems like

1460
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,520
some enterprises make Mac works, but it also is particularly a pain point.

1461
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,720
So maybe this is a sphere they exit.

1462
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:57,240
You know, you think, you know, you think that they, they think that you think it's a problem,

1463
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,240
you know, or whatever.

1464
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,320
A lot of people think it's a problem, but remember, they think different.

1465
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,120
Oh boy.

1466
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:09,280
I think, you know, what's weird is my, my thoughts around Linux in 2017, oddly a Microsoft,

1467
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,160
the name Microsoft keeps popping up.

1468
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,160
I keep there.

1469
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,160
It's, which feels strange.

1470
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,160
It's weird.

1471
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,160
It's weird.

1472
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,320
And it's, I wonder if it's, I mean, if they continue that trend, that's, that'll be, that'll

1473
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,640
be noteworthy for sure.

1474
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,320
And it's, I think it's going to be, I think I'm going to, I'll wait.

1475
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,320
I guess I'll wait for last.

1476
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,360
But I think, I think we're going to be surprised by Microsoft in 2017.

1477
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:31,680
And I think, I think we're, we're probably all sort of settled on the fact that distributions

1478
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:36,480
like Solace and those others are getting more important than ever, but there's other distributions

1479
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,960
over 2016 that I think turned it around.

1480
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,480
And I don't know if that gets enough attention either.

1481
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,480
And I think OpenSUSE is one of them to a degree.

1482
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,760
I think it turned it around from a distribution.

1483
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,560
I don't know if it's still, it's not quite, I don't know if it's gotten there yet, but

1484
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:55,040
I, I guess it feels like it's not quite yet a distribution that's changing the conversation,

1485
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,480
that's influencing the conversation, quote unquote, but it's one that's getting a whole

1486
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,320
new tidal wave of excited users.

1487
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:06,360
Like, so they're doing things right as a project that's appealing to a lot of, a lot more people

1488
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,360
than they were, say, at the beginning of 2016.

1489
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,360
Right.

1490
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,200
And they're kind of on the, that like starting point of the curve where it's like they're

1491
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,200
doing a lot of cool things.

1492
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,200
They have some good, interesting ideas.

1493
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,480
And so yeah, maybe 2017 will be the year where we see like, do people flock there?

1494
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,480
No, we don't know.

1495
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,520
But it could be a great, 2017 might end up being a great year for OpenSUSE.

1496
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,520
Yeah.

1497
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:26,120
The 2015 was when they first announced, it was like November, 2015 when they started

1498
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,920
doing this whole new thing.

1499
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,200
So there's only been a year of this massive change.

1500
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:35,080
So I think there hasn't been enough time for them to actually like kind of develop the

1501
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,520
curve completely yet.

1502
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:43,240
And now, now I think you're right, that 2017 will be a much, much more OpenSUSE friendly.

1503
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,240
Unless they screw it up.

1504
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,120
I mean, I think they're pretty much, they're pretty positionable to do well.

1505
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,920
Wecom, you want to jump in with a.NET one.

1506
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,280
All right, go for it.

1507
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,800
I could see.NET becoming a native.NET support for the desktop.

1508
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,800
Oh really?

1509
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,800
For Linux.

1510
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,800
Why do you say that?

1511
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:03,960
I think Microsoft has enough third party applications that if programmers could use their.NET languages

1512
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:09,660
and just port them to Linux, you would see a lot more, people wouldn't be threatening

1513
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:13,680
to move to different applications or different programming languages, which is a big problem

1514
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,680
for them.

1515
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:20,240
So if they could install a.NET application on a Linux desktop, it solves the migration

1516
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,240
of.NET programmers away from Visual Studio.

1517
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:27,120
You mean it helps Windows desktop become a reality on Linux.

1518
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,120
I get it.

1519
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:32,760
I don't know if it helps Windows desktop, but I think what it helps is Windows applications,

1520
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:37,000
Outlook per se, or business applications where people want to run them natively.

1521
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Yeah.

1522
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Or third party developers.

1523
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Yeah.

1524
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,160
People that write in.NET, they can now run it in Linux.

1525
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:48,120
Yeah, Daredevil, they could use that for the.NET, they could release the.NET VM bridge

1526
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:52,120
from your Linux desktop to the Windows VM.

1527
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,120
That's good ones guys.

1528
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,040
So here's what I got.

1529
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:59,200
So Sweetloot says that Microsoft will make a deal or buy Canonical, Daredevil says that

1530
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:04,340
Microsoft makes a deal to run a product on Ubuntu blessed kernel or maybe even Windows

1531
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:09,320
in 2018, which we probably would start hearing about in 2017.

1532
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,600
I'm going to actually, mine is, I have a similar prediction along the same lines, just a little

1533
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,880
more, a little more less ambitious.

1534
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,000
Rotten says it's going to be the year of snaps, they're just basically going to pull ahead

1535
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,200
by a pretty good margin.

1536
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:26,600
And at 1710, Unity by default, Mr. Double says that NVIDIA gets Wayland support and

1537
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,480
Solus will have an SUR equivalent.

1538
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:33,680
And Monkeycom says.NET becomes a mainstream Linux language.

1539
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,160
I got one last thing to throw in there.

1540
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,160
Throw it in there, Mr. West.

1541
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,180
Doesn't make me happy to say, but I feel like at least, I think we're going to be talking

1542
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:44,200
about Linux Mint in a less than positive way at least one time this year.

1543
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,200
You know, interesting.

1544
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:50,000
I don't know if that'll be another security breach or just relevance issues.

1545
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
It's not that I don't like the project.

1546
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,760
I just think that seems like something on the horizon.

1547
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,440
It feels like there is some direction and momentum that way.

1548
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,720
And over the holiday break, I was seeing a lot of threads, and I don't think anybody

1549
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:04,400
in the Mumble Room saw this, I've seen a lot of threads about potentially Linux Mint was

1550
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,400
compromised again.

1551
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,400
Did you see that?

1552
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,400
No, I didn't.

1553
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,400
Did you see any of this?

1554
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,400
I saw someone asking the question about it, but it wasn't really.

1555
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,400
In a few Reddits, yeah.

1556
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:15,600
Well, what happened was, is somebody posted and slash pwned, hey, I just owned Linux Mint

1557
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,600
again.

1558
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:19,800
And then in all the other subreddits, people were asking if it was true or not.

1559
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,800
Trying to validate, yeah.

1560
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,800
Yeah.

1561
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,480
So no word there, though.

1562
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:27,800
Second time I have seen something like that since the initial break-in, though.

1563
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,360
And I hope that prediction is wrong, honestly.

1564
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,360
I really do.

1565
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,360
But we'll see.

1566
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,360
Yeah.

1567
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,360
Hmm.

1568
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,840
Well, I mean, I just want Mint to stop doing the terrible decisions they do.

1569
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:41,480
I can give you one example that they should stop right now.

1570
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,480
Lay it on me, brah.

1571
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,480
Which is incredibly stupid.

1572
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,480
Brah, lay it on me.

1573
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,280
The priority structure that they make their repo higher priority than PPAs.

1574
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,280
Yeah.

1575
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,280
They need to stop that.

1576
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,800
If it's FUD, if it's FUD, why is this happening?

1577
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,160
What kind of FUD is this?

1578
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,320
And who's behind it?

1579
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,320
You're telling me that just somebody-

1580
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,900
Canonical might be behind it.

1581
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:58,900
Come on.

1582
01:03:58,900 --> 01:03:59,900
Joking.

1583
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:00,900
Come on.

1584
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:01,900
Do I have to have my conspiracy bacon clip here?

1585
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:02,900
It spread pretty fast on Reddit.

1586
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:03,900
So maybe that's the part that's-

1587
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:04,900
Because I think the reason-

1588
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:05,900
That particular thing.

1589
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:12,000
Although the problem that they had was so easily avoidable that they should have never

1590
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,280
had the problem in the first place.

1591
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,280
True.

1592
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,800
And it meant that anything can happen at this point.

1593
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,200
Like who's to say that they realized their problem the first time and like because they

1594
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:25,520
should have never had that problem because what they claimed was the whole meant that

1595
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:31,080
they didn't update their WordPress for three years.

1596
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,040
That's just stupid.

1597
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,320
That's literally painting a target on your back.

1598
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,320
Exactly.

1599
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:39,840
And it's also an easy target because there's a plethora of holes for it.

1600
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,840
That has got to be the-

1601
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:41,840
That is-

1602
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,840
Yeah.

1603
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,840
You know, it is Reddit.

1604
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,840
Who knows?

1605
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,840
Yeah.

1606
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,840
Okay.

1607
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,840
Well, that part, yeah.

1608
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:48,840
I mean, the current one is totally probably-

1609
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,840
I mean, I don't know.

1610
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,840
Could be.

1611
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,840
Could be not.

1612
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,840
I mean, I don't know.

1613
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,840
It seems to be garbage.

1614
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,840
Probably.

1615
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,840
Like just not true at all.

1616
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:56,840
I don't like it.

1617
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,840
It just makes me the whole-

1618
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,320
So that is a thought-provoking prediction to end on there, Wes.

1619
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,320
I like that one.

1620
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,320
You know what else is thought-provoking?

1621
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,640
Getting an education, linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

1622
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,720
Go there, sign up for a seven-day free trial, and try out Linux Academy, a platform built

1623
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:13,680
by Linux enthusiasts and educators and developers that came together to create the Linux Academy.

1624
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:17,440
They wanted to create content that Linux users could zoom to learn more, to spread Linux

1625
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,560
and to help you get a job, get a raise.

1626
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:23,480
In fact, a lot of new features they've launched to the platform really enable these goals,

1627
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:28,920
like public profiles to show your accomplishments, core schedulers to match a busy workday, mobile

1628
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:33,200
apps for iOS and Android so that way you can practice on the go, which would be so awesome

1629
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,480
like on the bus or on the train or sitting on the turlet.

1630
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,480
Up your skill game while you're just wasting time otherwise.

1631
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,840
I had an uncle that would seriously take a two-hour crap, really.

1632
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,760
And I tell you what, if I had Linux Academy on my tablet-

1633
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:45,760
You would too.

1634
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,040
That would be a very productive two hours, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1635
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,480
One of the things I think is really great about Linux Academy, it sets them apart from

1636
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,580
everybody else, is instructor mentoring.

1637
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:57,440
Because these topics, they're not fixing the sink.

1638
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,880
They're not something where they could have somebody with a cell phone on call when you

1639
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,280
have a question like that.

1640
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,920
These are dedicated staff members that have to really understand this stuff.

1641
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:06,920
It's a business.

1642
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:07,920
They know what they're doing.

1643
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,800
You know, they've been really good at adding new content and updating old content too.

1644
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,120
And that is also something else that sets them apart.

1645
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:17,820
Plus they have these labs, these hands-on scenarios where you get real world experience.

1646
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:20,720
If you just need to get some certs, they've got great courseware for that.

1647
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,800
They have study tools that you can download, comprehensive guides that you can look and

1648
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,120
print out and listen to for audio.

1649
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:31,200
Seriously people listen in the shower, I can't even believe it.

1650
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,440
I mean, actually, shower thoughts are real, man.

1651
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,540
That's a real thing.

1652
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:40,920
So why not, if I can have brilliant shower thoughts, maybe it is the perfect time to

1653
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:41,920
learn actually.

1654
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,480
I think about it.

1655
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:44,480
It's shower thought time.

1656
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,040
You can check it out.

1657
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,920
Also, just a real quick thing.

1658
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,280
If you've already subscribed to Linux Academy, you've got like just a couple of days left.

1659
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,680
We were on break so I couldn't mention this sooner.

1660
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:58,320
But if you're listening live or you're downloading like day after the next day, they're giving

1661
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,320
away a pixel.

1662
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,320
What?

1663
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,320
Yeah.

1664
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,320
Yeah.

1665
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,320
It ends on January 5th.

1666
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,680
They'll do this from time to time.

1667
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,240
So it's just good for you to watch.

1668
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,000
They have a blog where you can watch these things.

1669
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
You just got to log into your account and help spread the word.

1670
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,480
Well, they got it all on their blog.

1671
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,600
They just go to their Linux Academy blog and learn, but you got a couple of days left to

1672
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:15,600
get a pixel.

1673
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,400
And Wes, would you recommend it now?

1674
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,400
How many?

1675
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,400
What are you like, what, one month?

1676
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,400
Two months into it?

1677
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,400
What do you want?

1678
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,400
Yeah.

1679
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,400
Probably like two, almost three months probably.

1680
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,400
Are you loving it?

1681
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,400
Hating it?

1682
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,400
Caveat.

1683
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,920
I'm not a person who, my whole life is not on my phone.

1684
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:29,920
I mean, I do a lot with my phone.

1685
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,840
Obviously I need it.

1686
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:32,840
It's a great, it's a great phone.

1687
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,840
If you just need like a consistent phone, latest Android.

1688
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:36,840
That sounds perfect.

1689
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:37,840
Yeah, exactly.

1690
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:38,840
It's perfect for that.

1691
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,840
Sounds like an iPhone.

1692
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:40,840
Yeah.

1693
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,400
It's exactly the kind of like, I'm not, I don't have a lot of complaints.

1694
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,040
I don't have a lot of like, I don't need to do anything with it.

1695
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,040
It just works.

1696
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,040
How's the camera?

1697
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,040
Lovely.

1698
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,040
Really?

1699
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:51,040
Oh yeah.

1700
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,040
I'm loving it.

1701
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,040
Yeah.

1702
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,040
Yeah.

1703
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,040
Yeah.

1704
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,040
I could, maybe one day.

1705
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,040
Maybe one day.

1706
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,040
And you know what?

1707
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,040
If I could get, if I could get.

1708
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,400
Linux Academy dot com slash unplug.

1709
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,400
Go there.

1710
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,400
Get a seven day free trial.

1711
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,400
Learn more about the platform.

1712
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,240
And while you're there, I mean, you'd probably be eligible to get a seven day free trial.

1713
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,240
I'm just saying.

1714
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,240
Go to Linux Academy dot com slash unplug.

1715
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,240
Sign up.

1716
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,720
Try to get a Google Pixel.

1717
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:13,720
And you're off.

1718
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,520
Boy, if you get it, tweet me at Chris LAS.

1719
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,240
I seriously want to know about that.

1720
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,240
That would be.

1721
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:20,240
Oh man.

1722
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,240
If a JB member can get, ugh.

1723
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,240
Yeah.

1724
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,240
Yeah.

1725
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,240
Yeah.

1726
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:25,240
All right.

1727
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,800
So are you ready to, are you ready to talk about securing the internet of things and

1728
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,400
smart devices?

1729
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:33,000
I mean, I'm quaking in my boots over here because you said IOT and smart devices in

1730
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
the same sentence.

1731
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I know, right.

1732
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
But.

1733
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Can I put it another?

1734
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
But.

1735
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Yes.

1736
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Let's talk about it.

1737
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Cyber.

1738
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Ugh.

1739
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Ah.

1740
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Well, OK.

1741
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
How about this for a sentence?

1742
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
You ready for this?

1743
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,480
Wes, are you concerned about cyber threats against your smart devices?

1744
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,480
Internet of things?

1745
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:49,480
Huh?

1746
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,960
See, I got cyber threats in there, Wes.

1747
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,960
Isn't that good?

1748
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,480
Can I, is there like a thing I can do with my body that just, I'm like a hundred percent,

1749
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,480
a thousand percent yes?

1750
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,760
Yeah.

1751
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:04,040
You know, so I got to just make a huge disclaimer if we go any further because I got to imagine

1752
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:07,480
I probably should have said this way earlier in the show now.

1753
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,480
Now that I think about it.

1754
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:09,480
Yeah, that's true.

1755
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:13,360
A lot of you are listening going, Chris, what the AF are you doing?

1756
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:18,520
Why do you have a privatized spying device in your studio right now, literally listening

1757
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,520
to every word you say?

1758
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,200
Spied on the whole show.

1759
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,200
Yeah.

1760
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,200
Are you crazy?

1761
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,200
Are you ridiculous?

1762
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,200
Are you nuts?

1763
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,200
Have you lost it?

1764
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,360
Don't you care about open source and Linux?

1765
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,600
My God, Chris, what about Mycroft?

1766
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,840
Before you go down that route, I encourage you to go check out how I use the Amazon Echo

1767
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,960
Dot to automate my studio.

1768
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:43,080
It's a vlog I posted this morning, just posted a couple of hours ago, and it goes over how

1769
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:49,080
we use the Echo Dot in the studio, why we got them, how I've isolated them off on a

1770
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:55,440
separate network, and what our intention is behind all of that.

1771
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,800
So just so you know, if you're concerned about that, go watch that episode.

1772
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,560
It's all covered in there, how we're using it, all of that stuff.

1773
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:07,760
It would be a whole episode to talk about that, so that video is in the show notes.

1774
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,560
Now, I want to talk about the big concern.

1775
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:15,600
The big concern everybody listening has is cloud services, cloud monitoring, things like

1776
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,600
that.

1777
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,100
Well, it turns out I've done a little digging, and there's some interesting things that those

1778
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:24,120
of you who are considering getting a device like this might want to look at.

1779
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:29,320
Now, I'm not like Mr. Expert on any of these devices yet.

1780
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:32,840
I've got three of them at this point for the studio, because the Echo Dot was $40, and

1781
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:36,760
what I decided to do was, well, I should get one for myself to learn with it.

1782
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:40,520
So that's upstairs in my office, and then I wanted one in the studio because I checked

1783
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,520
this out.

1784
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:47,680
Now, actually, we have video, so if you're watching the video feed, Alexa, turn on JB1.

1785
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,160
OK.

1786
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:53,320
Oh, that's so cool.

1787
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,320
Look at that.

1788
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,320
Yeah.

1789
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,320
Yeah.

1790
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,320
Alexa, turn off JB1.

1791
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,320
OK.

1792
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,080
And we're back.

1793
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:08,120
So everything in the studio was sort of in place, and then I can do things like, Alexa,

1794
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,840
turn on studio ambient lights.

1795
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,080
Oh, I didn't say it fast enough.

1796
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,960
Sorry for those of you at home, by the way.

1797
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:14,960
I'll get over this.

1798
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:15,960
I won't do this.

1799
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,680
Just give them like two months, maybe?

1800
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,720
No, give me like two more minutes in this episode, and then you just, there's a mute

1801
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:21,720
button on there.

1802
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:25,840
Alexa, turn on studio ambient lights.

1803
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,320
OK.

1804
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,040
Oh, that's lovely.

1805
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,600
Yeah, isn't that great?

1806
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:34,600
Alexa, turn on studio accent lights.

1807
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,320
OK.

1808
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:42,800
Alexa, ask for a fart.

1809
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,120
Just to prove a point.

1810
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:50,500
So the studio was kind of out of the box just over the years, ready to be integrated, but

1811
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:55,200
we needed, you really kind of need something to centralize the control because this product's

1812
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,320
made by Hughes, this product's made by Belkin, this product over here is made by TP-Link.

1813
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:03,280
They all support some weird subset of the same protocol, but, or maybe not.

1814
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:07,200
And I want them all isolated off on their own LAN, so that way they're not talking to

1815
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,980
any of my other devices, they're not monitoring any of my other traffic, because I don't trust

1816
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:10,980
these things.

1817
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:12,480
I don't trust these things at all.

1818
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:16,360
And so I wanted them off on their own LAN, but in order to actually access them, you'd

1819
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,520
have to take your device and put it on that LAN to talk to them.

1820
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,520
Well what kind of stupid idea is that?

1821
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,080
That is not feasible in a lot of cases.

1822
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:27,280
That only is that a pain in the butt and breaks whatever I'm doing on my device, but it also

1823
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,500
then exposes that device to the very thing I'm trying to avoid.

1824
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,160
It's like the stupidest workaround ever.

1825
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:39,880
And so this device, this Echo, is in that LAN.

1826
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,740
And so it's my bridge, essentially.

1827
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:45,120
So I talk to it, and it talks to them.

1828
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,520
So that's kind of interesting.

1829
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,260
But I wanted to make this even better.

1830
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:52,720
So I'm not here yet, but I've begun looking into two different products that look like

1831
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,960
they could essentially act as the command and control of the cloud for a device like

1832
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:57,960
this.

1833
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:01,640
The first is Home Assistant at home-assistant.io.

1834
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,640
It's a Python app, I think.

1835
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,840
Yeah, Python 3.

1836
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:08,160
Home Assistant is an open source home automation platform for running on Python 3.

1837
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,160
Open source, did you say?

1838
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:10,160
Mm-hmm.

1839
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:11,160
See where I'm going with this.

1840
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,580
You see where I'm going with this.

1841
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:20,200
And the other one, and this is maybe the one I'm more likely to look into, OpenHAB, OpenHAB.

1842
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:24,840
It's a vendor and technology agnostic open source automation software for your home.

1843
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:31,140
And my understanding is, the Echo, I'm trying not to say the hot word, the Echo could actually

1844
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,200
talk to it over Bluetooth.

1845
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:38,520
And OpenHAB could run on something as simple as a Raspberry Pi.

1846
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,520
So it's like-

1847
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,000
Which is even cheaper than the dot.

1848
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Yeah, right.

1849
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Exactly.

1850
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,280
Fully open source, developed in Java.

1851
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,280
Yeah.

1852
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:51,320
It's got a web UI, it's got Android and iOS apps, and a web, of course, works on the desktop,

1853
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,320
so that's already built in.

1854
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,640
It's got notification support, all of these things.

1855
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:03,480
And I've seen some indication that there is a way to tie the device into OpenHAB.

1856
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:08,880
So that way, instead of going to the Echo Cloud, or the Amazon AWS hosted services,

1857
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:09,880
it goes to OpenHAB.

1858
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:10,880
Oh, wow, really?

1859
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:11,880
I'm not sure yet.

1860
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,940
I don't know what you're looking into there.

1861
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:16,960
So it's kind of a fascinating path I've gotten.

1862
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:22,400
And I really kind of think, one of the reasons I want to wrap my head around it now is they

1863
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,000
sold a ton of these over the holidays.

1864
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Oh, yes.

1865
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,800
And I had so many non-tech people in my life asking about them, or if I tried them.

1866
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,240
I was astounded.

1867
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:32,880
And I thought I understood how this all worked.

1868
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,760
I thought I kind of had it all conceptually figured out, until I actually had to set all

1869
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:41,400
of this up, and create smart groups, and do all of these things, and I have such a deeper

1870
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,400
understanding of it now.

1871
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,400
It's like AWS Lite.

1872
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,400
Yeah.

1873
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,400
It is like an entire thing.

1874
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:46,400
You really have to learn.

1875
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,640
There's a command structure, and all of this stuff.

1876
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,280
So it's been fascinating.

1877
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:54,800
And I do kind of feel like it's an interesting thing to know, just the general consumer platform.

1878
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,280
But man, I can't wait until something like Mycroft comes along.

1879
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,640
And then that's really going to be where it gets interesting.

1880
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,480
And that's a space that we need to have open source stuff.

1881
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,720
What's that?

1882
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,880
The API of the Echo is pretty good, too.

1883
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:07,880
Oh, yeah?

1884
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,880
Yeah.

1885
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:14,240
There's a lot of integrations for... You can write your own integrations and commands

1886
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:20,080
for the Echo to do a lot of things that aren't necessarily intended to do.

1887
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,700
They have integrations built into a lot of things, but you can pretty much write your

1888
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,840
own for whatever you want.

1889
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:30,140
It's not really open, but the API itself is very extensive.

1890
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:31,240
That's interesting.

1891
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:35,920
So I got a dot for the beard to do some experimental development with, too.

1892
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:36,920
Ooh.

1893
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:37,920
Yeah.

1894
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,640
I was thinking, maybe we could tie it in with J-Bot.

1895
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,640
Wouldn't it be great if I could execute... So we control different things in the studio

1896
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,640
now with J-Bot.

1897
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,360
Wouldn't it be cool if I could get some of those... If I could bark that at the Echo?

1898
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,360
Yeah.

1899
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:51,040
How many times at the end of the show are you like, oh, I want to stop the YouTube stream?

1900
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:54,320
You can just yell at the Echo.

1901
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:59,720
It's been interesting to just see how many little scattered devices I had around the

1902
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,240
studio that were controlled with it.

1903
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,860
It's a fun experiment so far.

1904
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:06,400
But I think OpenHAB is probably my path.

1905
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,400
So this is sort of my call out to the audience.

1906
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,920
I heard from an individual this morning, which is really awesome, who might be pretty well

1907
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,360
informed on it, but I've also just put the call out there.

1908
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:19,360
At Chris Elias on Twitter, if you've got something set up and maybe you could give me some advice

1909
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,640
on how I could compare it with my Echo Dot.

1910
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:26,920
And if it's feasible, I'd love to be able to have one here at the studio, an OpenHAB

1911
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,600
set up, and one maybe like running at the RV, too.

1912
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,600
Oh, yeah.

1913
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,600
And do I even need the dot?

1914
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,600
I have all these questions.

1915
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,600
Yeah.

1916
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,600
You don't need the dot for OpenHAB.

1917
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:39,680
You can put the software on other devices.

1918
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:44,280
And then like, so I wouldn't get the voice stuff, but I would have like one app that

1919
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,680
controls all?

1920
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:46,680
Yeah.

1921
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:47,680
You can have it.

1922
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:51,560
I've actually played with OpenHAB myself, but I haven't spent a ton of time on it.

1923
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:56,360
But I have dug into it a little bit, and it has ability to use pretty much any device

1924
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:57,760
you want.

1925
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,520
And it just, depending on what hardware you give it, what features it has.

1926
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:07,840
So you can, you can, if you, you can't really like replace the dots or the Echo's like software.

1927
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,400
But if you have something that's similar to it and you put OpenHAB on it, you can use

1928
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,840
it to facilitate most of it.

1929
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:13,840
Wow.

1930
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,520
But you can also make it where OpenHAB and the Echo connect to each other, too.

1931
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,960
That would be great.

1932
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:24,600
That sounds interesting, because I think, I mean, here's where, here's where I feel

1933
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,440
like this is gone.

1934
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:31,480
And as people where we talk about specs, and often we think about open source and community

1935
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:37,920
solutions, we sometimes, I think we fail to see when the market has decided on something.

1936
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:42,920
I wonder if this holiday season, if the Echo didn't tip over to a mass consumer product

1937
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,200
and it sort of won.

1938
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,600
Boy, didn't Google Home try to push hard on the ads, though.

1939
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,600
Yeah.

1940
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,600
Yeah.

1941
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,600
But I don't know that actually translated.

1942
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,720
Can you name a, can you name a single Google direct product that's done well in the mass

1943
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:57,720
consumer market?

1944
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,840
Is there any reason to think that Google's good at doing that kind of product?

1945
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:02,840
Yeah.

1946
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:10,480
Whereas like Amazon at this point has really got, like there are, there is a, there is

1947
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:14,520
a lot of, there is a lot of different functionality built into Alexa, like they have not slowed

1948
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,400
down from the moment they released it.

1949
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,680
There is almost stuff daily they're doing on this thing, like they are very passionate

1950
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,680
about this thing.

1951
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,680
It's a huge thing for them.

1952
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,800
Have you ordered any packages or other things with it?

1953
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,800
No.

1954
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:32,080
I think it is the number one reason why Alexa, why the Echo will always, it's hard, well

1955
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:36,760
I think will, it is a, it is a, it is a core business interest of Amazon to have this thing

1956
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,160
in your home because they don't have physical stores.

1957
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,840
They need to have this in your home.

1958
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,320
This is super important to their business.

1959
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,520
This is their like easy way to interact with you.

1960
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,520
Right.

1961
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,900
For Google, this is another metric.

1962
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:50,600
This is another metric collection device.

1963
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:55,420
It's important, but it's no more important than your Chromecast or your Android TV or

1964
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:59,920
your tablet or your Google Docs account or your YouTube account.

1965
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,140
Those are actually probably great, especially your Gmail account is a much richer, greater

1966
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:07,880
source of metrics than a Google Home will ever be because there is a certain line they

1967
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:08,880
just can't cross.

1968
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,320
They can't, if they could always monitor, if they could listen to every dumb thing you

1969
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:16,840
say and every time you masturbate and every time you cook dinner and every time you watch

1970
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:21,560
TV, if they could listen to all of that, that would be extremely useful for them and that

1971
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:23,320
would also destroy their business.

1972
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,080
It would fundamentally undermine their business.

1973
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:28,720
So I think we're, I just don't think it's, I don't think it's as critically important

1974
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:32,920
to Microsoft, to Apple, to, or to Google as it is to Amazon.

1975
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:37,160
I think it's, it's fundamental to Amazon and here I will disagree.

1976
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:42,480
I think the reason Google does not need to make such a big effort is because they already

1977
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,480
have the phone.

1978
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:48,400
I actually, you can, there is a page you can visit in Google and listen to all of the recordings

1979
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:54,320
of you saying, okay, Google, and basically see all of you said, I'll record it.

1980
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:59,360
You can have access to it, but they already have that and the reason, and the fact that,

1981
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,280
but they're not, but you know what I'm saying, like they're not always listening, you have

1982
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,280
to trigger it.

1983
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,280
Actually, it does.

1984
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,280
Actually, it does.

1985
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:10,160
It is always listening to the point that you go to the recordings page, it includes the

1986
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:14,160
part that you said, okay, Google, so it meant that it's recording all the time.

1987
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:15,160
It is always listening.

1988
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,360
I can set it up where it's not paying attention to me.

1989
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,720
Like right now you said it a bunch of times where my phone's right next to my speaker

1990
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,040
and it didn't do anything because it's not listening.

1991
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:28,960
Well, but in the case of the home, it is, and same with the Echo, it is always listening

1992
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,560
because there's no other way to hear the command word.

1993
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:36,840
Like if I just say the A word in casual conversation, it triggers her immediately.

1994
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:42,000
I don't have to say it like Captain Picard talking to the computer.

1995
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,520
If I just say, you know, Wes, today I tried the Alexa and it's working pretty great, it'll

1996
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:52,880
just pick it up and start running like crazy and the Google Home is the same way.

1997
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:56,960
However, it's just getting, what it does is it just has like a quick buffer.

1998
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:02,560
It has like a 10 second buffer where it's, yeah, because honestly, if you think about

1999
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:08,480
it, it would be like a constant 800 kilobit stream up if it was uploading everything you

2000
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:09,480
always said to the cloud.

2001
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,480
It would.

2002
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,360
Of course it doesn't need to always upload, but this is the thing.

2003
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:19,340
When people saying that, you know, we're moving to these assistant oriented world where your

2004
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:25,280
device doesn't need to be a massive computer, have massive computational power, just get

2005
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:30,880
all of the data from fast connection and basically have a huge battery and this is just the device.

2006
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:35,760
And when you include that alongside having self driving cars, Google actually is working

2007
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,760
on.

2008
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:37,760
Right.

2009
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,840
I don't feel that that's why they don't need to make a huge effort on us because they don't

2010
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,060
care about it.

2011
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:49,280
So today at CES, Amazon announced the Alexa everywhere strategy.

2012
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:59,080
So they're building, cancel, they're building it into watches, dish, whirlpool devices.

2013
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:04,200
Volvo is going to do a series of speakers with it built in.

2014
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,560
And there's probably other devices.

2015
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,880
I think that goes right back to what you're talking about, where like, here are these

2016
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:11,960
companies where suddenly the incentive to work with Amazon on this is huge because they

2017
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:12,960
want to sell them.

2018
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,660
They know that, you know, you want to get your refills, you're like, hey, washing machine.

2019
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:21,080
Amazon gives preferential placement to devices that work with Echo.

2020
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:22,700
You've seen it if you've gone on Amazon ever.

2021
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:23,700
You see it.

2022
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:27,520
And so imagine now that one of the biggest, the Walmart of the internet is now going to

2023
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:32,400
feature devices that come with Echo built in and you've got dish enabling Alexa voice

2024
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,080
control on its hopper, cancel.

2025
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:41,140
You've got whirlpool connected, whirlpool devices, whirlpool freaking appliances.

2026
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:43,160
Imagine that, cancel.

2027
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:46,840
Imagine being able to bark at that thing to start the dishwasher or just get an update

2028
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:49,600
on how much longer the dishwasher has.

2029
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:54,320
I feel like also for these companies, Amazon is less risky.

2030
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:59,680
Because not only do they get preferential placement, but when you partner up with Apple

2031
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:03,360
or when you partner up with Google, you generally get taken to the washer.

2032
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,360
Like, it generally…

2033
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:05,360
And they have their own agenda.

2034
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:09,720
I mean, not that Amazon doesn't, but Amazon agenda you can understand in a much clearer

2035
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:10,720
way.

2036
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,500
And the Amazon one is going to sell you more devices.

2037
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:19,840
So that was sort of, I just sort of, in a long-winded way, which was much more eloquently

2038
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,720
stated in my vlog video, explained part of why I got one.

2039
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:26,760
And so I feel like right now I'm in the phase of wrap my head around how this damn thing

2040
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:31,800
works with all these devices and figure out like all of the limitations and all the little

2041
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,860
like boxes you've got to check.

2042
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:38,740
And then it's like, okay, now that I understand how this consumer product works, how it integrates

2043
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:41,400
with these other consumer products, what their risks are.

2044
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:45,080
Oh, and if you want to know like the monitoring and capturing we're going to do, also check

2045
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,080
out that vlog.

2046
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:50,240
Because we're going to be like packet capturing and all that stuff.

2047
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:52,720
Once I get my head around that, then it's time to roll out OpenHAB.

2048
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:58,600
Then it's time to like really like, now it's, I've lived that, I've walked that walk.

2049
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,600
Right.

2050
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,960
What's the state of the art if you don't care about the compromises?

2051
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:07,120
If you want to build your own secure LAN, don't want to go out to the net, don't want

2052
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:10,180
to worry about all of that stuff, is it possible at all?

2053
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,400
Is it ever possible with a device like this?

2054
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,960
Is it ever going to be possible?

2055
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:14,960
Is that so possible?

2056
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,080
You know what, just one last thing before we move on.

2057
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:27,320
I am shocked at how quickly my son Dylan, who's almost 8 years old, picked up the Echo.

2058
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:33,200
Like he's up in my office right now as we're recording this and he's just sitting there

2059
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:38,520
playing Minecraft and he just casually barks over to the Echo to turn off the fan.

2060
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,520
Or play a fart sound.

2061
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,720
Yeah, definitely that one.

2062
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:46,600
There is something for, there's sort of like a, there's like a, it lowers the barrier.

2063
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:51,000
Like I had all these devices before that I had control from my phone that I would trigger,

2064
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,320
that nobody else had access to, and that's not actually a good thing.

2065
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:58,080
Because now people around me can turn off the lights and stuff like that.

2066
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,080
That lets you delegate.

2067
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:03,040
Well, it just lets them get, like when they're up there too, it lets them get control over

2068
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,360
their environment a little bit.

2069
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:05,360
Anyways.

2070
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,360
And it's a great controlling device.

2071
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:11,640
It is also, yeah, because there's a Simon Says feature and you can just have it, that's

2072
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:12,640
where the magic happens.

2073
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:17,040
So you can Simon Says that thing all day long and it'll repeat it back to you.

2074
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:20,160
There's also, you can have it connect to your phone.

2075
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:23,800
So that's particularly handy too.

2076
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:27,000
It'll connect like a Bluetooth, as a Bluetooth speaker, which is kind of cool.

2077
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Wow.

2078
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,880
Anyways, playing around with it and I would love to hear the audience's thoughts on it.

2079
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,800
So LinuxAction.reddit.com or tweet me at ChrisLAS.

2080
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,080
I personally think this conversation's over.

2081
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,840
I personally think Echo's running away with it.

2082
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,600
It's a solid product and it's one of those products too that people that got it are still

2083
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,160
excited about it.

2084
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,720
So I think that's all in all.

2085
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,720
The barrier to entry is great with a dot.

2086
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:49,720
Yeah, right.

2087
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,720
It was 40 bucks.

2088
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:56,600
I think it's still 40 bucks and that's safe experimental levels.

2089
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,160
Yeah, that's right.

2090
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:00,480
Something you can easily play with.

2091
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:01,480
Yeah.

2092
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,480
Yeah.

2093
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,480
Uh-oh.

2094
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,320
I think Dylan's in here trolling us.

2095
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,320
This is the problem.

2096
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,280
I can't find the answer to the question I heard.

2097
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:13,400
Alexa, Simon says, Dylan, don't interrupt the show.

2098
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,560
Let's see if she says that.

2099
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,760
Dylan, don't interrupt the show.

2100
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,440
Dylan, come over here real quick.

2101
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,440
Come here real quick.

2102
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,160
Come over here and sit on my lap.

2103
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,880
You got a couple of seconds to tell people.

2104
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,760
Dylan, what's your quick review of the Amazon Echo?

2105
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,120
Do you like it?

2106
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,120
Yeah.

2107
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,920
And what's your favorite thing to ask it?

2108
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:38,760
Alexa, ask for farts.

2109
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,240
That's your favorite thing?

2110
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,240
Yeah.

2111
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,680
I'm not sure what you meant by that question.

2112
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:47,000
Jesus, too bad.

2113
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:52,560
Alexa, ask for farts.

2114
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:53,560
There we go.

2115
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:56,200
This is something that Dylan and I were trying earlier.

2116
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:57,200
Let me do it, okay?

2117
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,440
Okay, I'm going to show them.

2118
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:05,280
Alexa, what is the largest state in the United States of America?

2119
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:08,920
The largest U.S. state in the United States is Alaska.

2120
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:13,400
Alexa, how many people live there?

2121
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:17,480
The population of Alaska is about 686,000.

2122
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,840
That contextual awareness is pretty powerful.

2123
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,640
We've been able to go about three or four deep, I think.

2124
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:22,640
Oh, nice.

2125
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,640
Yeah.

2126
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:24,640
Do you have one more thing you want to add before we go?

2127
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:25,640
We're about to wrap up the show.

2128
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:26,640
Did you want to say something?

2129
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,640
All right, get in there.

2130
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,640
Say it.

2131
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:29,640
Bye.

2132
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:30,640
All right.

2133
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:33,440
It's Dylan's last day of winter break, so he's joining me in this studio.

2134
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,440
Well, that's great.

2135
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:35,440
That's actually really cool.

2136
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:38,800
All right, so that brings us to the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

2137
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:43,480
If you've got any advice or thoughts on securing the crazy wild west of Internet of Things,

2138
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:45,160
let me know if you've got any experience with it, too.

2139
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,400
What are you doing to lock it down and any open source projects that are helping you

2140
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,320
make it more secure?

2141
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,760
LinuxActionShow.reddit.com.

2142
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,040
It's also where you go to submit other project updates you think we should talk about.

2143
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,040
At least do.

2144
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,000
And we'd love to have you join us live next week.

2145
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,280
We'll do episode 179 on Tuesday.

2146
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:05,760
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone.

2147
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:09,080
And don't forget jblive.tv is the URL you put in there, where our chat room is, where

2148
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:12,960
you get information about our virtual lug and hang out with us.

2149
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:13,960
We love having all of that.

2150
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:18,680
You can also send us emails at jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact.

2151
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:24,940
And one last reminder, episode 300 of TechSnap, the last Alan and Chris episode, and then

2152
01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:28,000
the new fresh Bigger and Better Blood comes in.

2153
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,040
See you next Tuesday.

2154
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:36,040
Thanks for joining us and have a great week and Happy New Year!

2155
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:10,920
Oh, you know what we should have mentioned?

2156
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,880
The Patch Your Shit shirts have relaunched.

2157
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:13,880
Oh yeah!

2158
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:14,880
Ahhhh!

2159
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,240
You know what, Wes?

2160
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:17,240
This is what I get.

2161
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:18,880
This is what I get for not being a salesman.

2162
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,560
If I was a good salesman, I would have thought of this.

2163
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,560
Yeah, you sure would have.

2164
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:23,320
Teespring.com slash Patch Your Shit.

2165
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,320
Check it out.

2166
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,320
Spread the word.

2167
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:26,920
I guess we should have said something.

2168
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:29,360
I can't find the answer to the question I heard.

2169
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,000
She doesn't ever find anything for me.

2170
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Alexa, buy me some shirts!

2171
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,360
No, don't do that, Alexa.

2172
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:39,440
Alright, jbtitles.com, jbtitles.com.

2173
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,440
Thank you, Mumble Room.

2174
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:41,440
You guys are great.

2175
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,440
Yeah, great suggestions.

2176
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:43,440
Really appreciate it.

2177
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,440
You're welcome.

2178
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:45,440
We didn't actually, we didn't address one thing that's very important.

2179
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,640
I can't find the answer to the question I heard.

2180
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:48,640
What?

2181
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:49,640
What is that?

2182
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:50,640
What did we address?

2183
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:51,640
What's very important about the Echo?

2184
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:52,640
What?

2185
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,640
Perverting free software.

2186
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,640
Oh, that's true.

2187
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:58,840
Sorry, I didn't understand the question I heard.

2188
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,160
She doesn't understand it.

2189
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:01,960
She doesn't understand about free software.

2190
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:02,960
No, she doesn't.

2191
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,760
I kind of felt like the reason why we didn't really address the free software angle of

2192
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,640
it is because that's kind of a foregone conclusion.

2193
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:10,520
Oh yeah, it's totally not ever going to be.

2194
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:11,520
Yeah, no.

2195
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,080
And I think really we've got to wait for the Mycroft.

2196
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:15,080
Yeah, that's probably true.

2197
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:19,320
But Mycroft is still using Google on the back end.

2198
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:23,480
Well, no, it uses whatever you tell it to use.

2199
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,640
You can tell it not to use Google.

2200
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,600
You can tell it to use Alexa, if you want.

2201
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:28,200
What I meant for the speech recognition.

2202
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:32,400
Remember that time I hooked Alexa up to the Big Sur?

2203
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,400
Yes, I do.

2204
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:38,160
They built their own speech recognition as well.

2205
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,160
I don't think so.

2206
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:40,160
Just because, yes.

2207
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:43,520
I think they're still using the web service through Google.

2208
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:44,520
Nope.

2209
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,960
They built their own.

2210
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,080
Alexa cancels 2017.

2211
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,080
That's one title.

2212
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,700
Dude, this is not duct tape.

2213
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:53,020
This is gaffer's tape.

2214
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:54,280
This is what we use in the studio.

2215
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:58,360
They're working on their own infrastructure so that you don't have to use Google and you

2216
01:30:58,360 --> 01:30:59,360
can use whatever you want.

2217
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:03,400
And you can actually self-host their own protocol and their structure.

2218
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,120
Chris goes IoT.

2219
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,400
Chrysler minivans will run Linux.

2220
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,280
Alexa predict cancer.

2221
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,280
Cancel.

2222
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:16,120
Farting in 2017 with Alexa.

2223
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,120
That's good.

2224
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,120
That is good.

2225
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:20,080
Ooh, Alexa engage 2017.

2226
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,680
I like the Alexa prediction cancel.

2227
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:25,120
Are you guys still recording?

2228
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,120
Yeah.

2229
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:27,120
We're still doing our show.

2230
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,120
Oh.

2231
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:29,120
Yeah.

2232
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,120
I know.

2233
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:31,120
We do these shows forever, huh?

2234
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:32,120
Oh, yeah.

2235
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,120
I told you we'd be done at 3.30, didn't I?

2236
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,120
Yeah.

2237
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:35,120
Jeez, well.

2238
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,120
You know, it's Wes.

2239
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:37,120
He just talks so much.

2240
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:38,120
You just can't get me to shut up.

2241
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:39,120
Oh, Simon says the spiders are coming.

2242
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,800
I don't have you hooked up to it.

2243
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:42,800
Richard Stalmazan.

2244
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,400
That's a pretty good pizza, dude.

2245
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,400
I like it.

2246
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:50,440
He won't like it.

2247
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:51,440
No.

2248
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,920
What does he like?

2249
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:53,920
Emacs, mostly?

2250
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:54,920
Yeah.

2251
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:56,920
That's the first one I was gonna say.

2252
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,040
Don't say the A word.

2253
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,040
That's pretty good.

2254
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,480
I like that, too.

2255
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:04,360
Dot the cloud of things.

2256
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:05,800
Chris has gone full retard.

2257
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,800
Fair.

2258
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,320
Big sister is watching you.

2259
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,320
That's pretty good, too.

2260
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:10,320
Yeah, that is pretty good.

2261
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,320
Big sister.

2262
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:12,320
I like that.

2263
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,320
Dylan, unplugged.

2264
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:20,480
Boy, I feel like this is the hardest year to do predictions ever, and it's not because

2265
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:25,760
I know, I know, I'm a horrible person.

2266
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,760
Aren't we all?

2267
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:31,240
That's what we've learned in 2017.

2268
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:32,240
Alexa, cancel 2017.

2269
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:37,080
2016 is proving that anything can happen, so we're just like, okay.

2270
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:40,360
Yeah, I suppose so.

2271
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:43,320
I don't know.

2272
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,320
I don't know.

2273
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,600
Do you like Big Sister is Watching You?

2274
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,800
I mean, it might not be the best title.

2275
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,800
Should it just be Big Sister is Watching?

2276
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:50,800
Oh, maybe.

2277
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:51,800
Alexa, you're big sister.

2278
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,200
I can't find that skill.

2279
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:58,000
To find skills, go to the skills section of the Alexa app.

2280
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,400
Oh, they actually got a skill, too.

2281
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,400
Interesting.

2282
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:04,400
Ask for cards.

2283
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:09,480
Sorry, I didn't understand the question I heard.

2284
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:12,440
What's great is you can turn that skill off.

2285
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:13,440
That's great.

2286
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:16,440
Ask for cards.

2287
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:20,960
Sorry, I didn't understand the question I heard.

2288
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:22,440
He is determined to get a fart.

2289
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:23,440
Yep.

2290
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,880
I mean, we've all been in that position.

2291
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:29,480
Ask for farts.

2292
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:30,800
I found a few matches.

2293
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,080
Do you mean for a fart?

2294
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:34,080
Fart sound jokes.

2295
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,080
Or fart detective.

2296
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:36,080
Ooh, what's that last one?

2297
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,080
Alexa, fart sound jokes.

2298
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:38,080
What is that?

2299
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,080
I can't find that skill.

2300
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:44,360
Alexa, what is a fart detective?

2301
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:47,480
Sorry, I didn't understand the question I heard.

2302
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:49,800
Gotta control your laughter there.

2303
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:55,000
Alexa, ask for farts.

2304
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,400
I'm not sure what you meant by that question.

2305
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,400
What is a fart detective?

2306
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,400
Find who dealt it?

2307
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,400
Is that what it is?

2308
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,400
I like how calm she is, though.

2309
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:04,580
I'm going to start, hmm, I don't know what the answer to that is.

2310
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:05,580
Not that I should know.

2311
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:07,720
There you go.

2312
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:08,720
You got it.

2313
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,640
Yeah, that's the Alexa.

2314
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:11,640
Don't you want one now?

2315
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:12,640
Yeah.

2316
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:15,920
Can I give one to Wes?

2317
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,400
You gave a fart to Wes?

2318
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,980
No, let's give...

2319
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:19,980
Give a dot to Wes?

2320
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:20,980
Wes, you should get a dot.

2321
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:21,980
I should get a dot.

2322
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:28,240
You know, one thing the Google thing has going for it, I will say, is Google Home.

2323
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:30,720
If they could connect all of the...

2324
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:35,800
If OK Googs and Google Home and Google Assistant were all connected...

2325
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:36,800
Yes, that would be powerful.

2326
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,800
Yeah.

2327
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:38,800
Assistant is, I think.

2328
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,520
Because then you have it with you.

2329
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:42,800
Because this thing, you know, the Echo is only...

2330
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,800
If you're with it.

2331
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:48,480
Yeah, if I could have my home then do all the assistant stuff, yeah, that would be nice.

2332
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,880
So big sister is watching is now the number one.

2333
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,520
They just made an Echo Alexa thing for your phone.

2334
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,880
Well, they do have them for watches.

2335
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,360
I wonder why they don't make an app.

2336
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,360
Yeah.

2337
01:34:58,360 --> 01:35:06,360
Oh, speaking of which, you know, earlier you asked for what is a product that Google

2338
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,200
made that isn't a failure?

2339
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,200
Yeah.

2340
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,200
Chromecast.

2341
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,200
OK.

2342
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:14,400
I don't know if it's super mass consumer, but it's definitely the biggest hit they've

2343
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,400
ever had.

2344
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:17,040
The $35 price point doesn't hurt.

2345
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,040
Doesn't hurt.

2346
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:19,680
Yeah, that's a good point.

2347
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,820
What is the home selling for?

2348
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:22,880
Like $100 or something?

2349
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,880
Or $220.

2350
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:24,880
$120 or $130.

2351
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:25,880
Oh, wow.

2352
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:26,880
Yeah.

2353
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:27,880
Yeah, it's already back in stock.

2354
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,920
It was out of stock in our local Best Buy.

2355
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:34,480
It's the same price as the regular Echo, except Amazon made three versions of the Echo.

2356
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:39,160
So people who don't want to spend the money that would be comparing to the home can get

2357
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:44,840
a cheaper version, and also people who don't want it to constantly listen and get another

2358
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,840
version which costs a little more.

2359
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:51,600
So I think that's probably a really good strategy on Amazon's part.

2360
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:52,600
But you know what?

2361
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,120
I'll tell you.

2362
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:58,200
The Google Home did sell out, but the Echo, everywhere.

2363
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:03,520
So I had a couple days off before Christmas, and I wanted to get them in the studio.

2364
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:11,400
And I literally called every store, everything from Best Buy to Sears to Bed Bath and Beyond

2365
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:17,280
to Kmart and Fred Meyer and Home Depot, I called all of them, and they were all sold

2366
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,280
out.

2367
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:19,280
They sold out everywhere.

2368
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,280
Five months ago?

2369
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:23,360
I mean, yeah, we talked about it a little bit, but it didn't feel this hot.

2370
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,080
Well, Amazon sure pushes it.

2371
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:27,320
Every box comes with Echo stuff all over it.

2372
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:28,320
It's all over the front page.

2373
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,320
The stickers, the packaging.

2374
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,560
