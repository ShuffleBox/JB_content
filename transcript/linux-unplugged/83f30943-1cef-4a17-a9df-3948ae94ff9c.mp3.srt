1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Guys, I just got a new little surprise at the door here, some new hardware.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,740
It did not arrive via DHS, so that was what I was going to ask next.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,540
But but Alex did help me get this.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,540
It's a Alex.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,900
You don't even know this yet.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,300
X 250 used just came in my door and I unboxed it.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,940
And it has a pro Windows sticker on it, which might have to come up right away.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,800
And my display port looks like it has a dent in it.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,360
But I'm not very happy about.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,500
But oh, no, but we'll see.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,800
So this is a new upgrade for me.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,040
I'm going from X to 20 to 50.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,600
And Alex and I, when I'm there later this week in Raleigh, we're going to switch out

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,560
the monitor and IPS and do a whole bunch of stuff to it.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,060
So we'll see how that adventure goes.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,160
Are you telling me you're going to crack open a brand new ThinkPad and replace the screen

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,960
with a different one? Yes.

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,240
Yeah, I don't even know if I'm going to boot it first.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,860
I'm just going to kind of I love you guys.

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,240
Why wouldn't you do that?

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,060
What possible reason could you not do that?

22
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,760
You know, I think we have some work to do, Chris.

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,240
No, I want to see what it looks like when it's all said and done.

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,060
Here's the thing, right?

25
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,500
I mean, in terms of bang for buck, we were looking at two, I think an X 270.

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,340
And that came out at five hundred dollars or so.

27
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,960
This 250 came out, I think, Brent, correct me if I'm wrong, like 250, something like that.

28
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,640
Two twenty. Two twenty US.

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,900
OK, so even cheaper. Great.

30
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,800
And then by the time we've done the upgrades and stuff, you know, you're looking at just

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,640
approaching three hundred dollars.

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,260
And for Brent, this is like a 60 percent speed bump over his X 220.

33
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,800
So, yeah, we did the comparison.

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,560
It's like it's it's easy to say yes to something like that.

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,160
And who doesn't love an old ThinkPad?

36
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,440
Hey, it's new to me.

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,860
What do you have on your existing system CPU wise and what are you going to?

38
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,360
Well, right now I'm on an X 220.

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,300
It's got an I3 in it.

40
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,440
I am hoping Alex can remember the exact.

41
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,300
It's the potato version of the I3, the really, really like the baby one.

42
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,040
Yes, the potato. And therefore I have lots of room to grow, I guess.

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,360
He was surprised that I could do as much magic as I can on a potato.

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,900
But it seems potatoes are pretty good.

45
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,260
Alex is not alone.

46
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,660
That is one of the number one things I probably haven't vocalized when I've been around you is I am

47
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,560
amazed at the work you get done on the machine you have now.

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,700
Well, thank you. It's not what you got.

49
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,100
It's how you use it.

50
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,160
I'll be curious if you get sloppy now that you've upgraded a bit, you know.

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,200
I think the improved screen is a big deal.

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,060
I think that IPS display is going to make a huge difference for you, Brent.

53
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,200
Absolutely.

54
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,440
As a photographer, the IPS was a must.

55
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,100
And it's hard to find ThinkPads that are IPSs that are also in good condition and all this other stuff.

56
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:44,840
Right. So when Alex suggested that we could just swap it out and upgrade the resolution on the monitor, I was all in.

57
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:58,300
Yeah, you currently have an i3-2350M chip, which is from Q4 2013, and you're going to an i7-5600U, which is from Q1 2015.

58
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,500
So it's still two cores, four threads, but it's going from Sandy Bridge to Broadwell.

59
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,400
So there's a significant architectural change there.

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,460
And like we said, a 60 percent speed bump.

61
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,200
So I think you're going to enjoy it.

62
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,940
This also gives you a bump in RAM, right?

63
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,400
Yes. In RAM, currently I'm using 8 gigs.

64
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,500
I know this X220 can handle 16 and 8 gigs allows me to suffer quite regularly.

65
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,100
Therefore, I will be looking towards upgrading quite quickly, for sure.

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,400
Hello, friends, and welcome into a very special edition of your Unplugged program.

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,860
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello there, Wes.

68
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,740
Hello. It is very special. It is quite, isn't it?

69
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:51,400
This week, we're just talking about one thing, which is two things, technically three things, but just this one thing.

70
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,740
If there are just two things you love about your distro, I want to know about them.

71
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,000
But if there's one thing you could change to make it perfect, to make it better, what would it be?

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,100
That's what we'll ask everyone on our panel today.

73
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,100
So let's bring them all in. Hello there, Cheese and Alex.

74
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,000
Hello, guys. Hello.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,800
Hello, Chris. I'm going to say hello to you directly today instead of last time, where you got all upset because I said hello, internet.

76
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,000
Alex, I don't even know what you're talking about. It just sounds ridiculous.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,400
Who could possibly be upset by that?

78
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Ridiculous.

79
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Hello, Mumble. Roomtime appropriate greetings.

80
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,800
Hello, internet. Good evening.

81
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,500
Howdy. Hello.

82
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,100
Wow.

83
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Whoa.

84
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
Oh, my.

85
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,000
Wes said, after the show last week, he said, how many people do you think will show up in Mumble for the special recording?

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,600
And I said, five people.

87
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,100
That's not what happened at all.

88
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,200
I think you were wrong there, buddy.

89
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,500
You guys are so awesome.

90
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,300
So thank you so much for being here this week.

91
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:47,600
We wanted to do a special recording because I am traveling, taking care of the business, as I do, Wes.

92
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,200
You know me.

93
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,400
You're important. Yeah, we know.

94
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,200
I got to take care of the business, Wes.

95
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,400
I don't know what that business is.

96
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,600
I believe you say TCB. You're saying that all the time.

97
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,200
Yeah, take care of the business.

98
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,100
That's what I say. I say it. But that's also a yogurt, isn't it?

99
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,500
I think. I don't know.

100
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,200
So this week, we're going to do something a little different than the regular show.

101
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,700
We're going to just focus in on what we love about the distributions that we use.

102
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,500
And we're going to kind of go around the horn here and see what each of us loves about the distributions we've chosen.

103
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,200
And maybe the one thing we could make.

104
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,600
Just a small tweak.

105
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,500
Maybe if we had a magic wand, we could change something to make it better.

106
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,700
Now, I want to make it really clear here at the top.

107
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,200
There is no perfect distribution yet.

108
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,400
Now, by the time we're done with this episode, I'm pretty sure we'll have a perfect distribution.

109
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
I mean, clearly, we're going to solve it right now.

110
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,800
We can do it, I believe.

111
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,700
But I just want to keep that in mind.

112
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,300
We're really just here to share. This is going to be positive stuff.

113
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,400
This is what we love about the distributions we've chosen to use.

114
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,100
Having really myself started, started with Red Hat, tried Debian.

115
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,200
I think I really fell in love with Linux once I started using Debian.

116
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,800
With Red Hat, it felt like a tool.

117
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,300
And with Debian, it felt like it was solving problems for me.

118
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,800
You know what I mean?

119
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,400
Just flexible enough that you could use it for anything?

120
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,700
It was apt.

121
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,500
100% apt.

122
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,700
That's an interesting theme.

123
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,500
I think we'll hear more about package management today.

124
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,800
When did you start?

125
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,300
How new were package managers and were they any good at that point?

126
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,100
I think he just called you old.

127
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,800
I think, Chris, he's trying to date you.

128
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,400
I know.

129
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
I know.

130
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
I'm like, wow, man.

131
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,900
Well, it did feel like computer magic, like the fact that apt could just

132
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,200
figure out that one package depended on these other packages, which

133
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,900
could possibly depend on additional packages.

134
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,400
That felt very new.

135
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,200
It was definitely mid to late 90s.

136
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,800
Apt was introduced into Debian in 99.

137
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,000
The first release was in 98.

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,600
Okay, sounds about right.

139
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,600
It was definitely kind of magical because just a year later, it got

140
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,100
forked and ported to RPM distros, which is how Connectiva had it.

141
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,100
They were a fork of Red Hat that used apt instead of up-to-date.

142
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,400
And I remember Yellow Dog Linux had like the...

143
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,000
There was two things.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,600
There was two distros back then that really had solved RPMs.

145
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Like Debian had a totally different approach, but Mandrake had URPMI.

146
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,500
Yellow Dog had the Yellow Dog Update Manager, yum.

147
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,700
And those two had really kind of solved using RPMs, whereas Debian

148
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,400
had gone a totally different route.

149
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,100
And looking back at it, yum survived and then became DNF, but URPMI,

150
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,100
which was the Mandrake approach, kind of just died off.

151
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,700
So here's an interesting factoid that I think a lot of people don't

152
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:46,900
know.

153
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,100
URPMI and apt were released the same year within a month of each other.

154
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,900
They were the first ever dependency-resolving repository software

155
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,700
managers for the Unix world, or arguably all of the computer

156
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,600
operating system world.

157
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,700
They're obviously predecessors of different types and whatnot, but

158
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,600
like of the specific kind that we understand as package managers

159
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,200
today, those two were the first.

160
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,700
And Yellow Dog had the Yellow Dog Update, or YUP, which got forked

161
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,600
to become the Yellow Dog Updater Modified, yum.

162
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,100
And that one was the one that we all know won out in the RPM world

163
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,300
and eventually became, we have the dandified Yellow Dog Updater,

164
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,500
which is DNF.

165
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,600
Alright, now, before we go too much further down the package route,

166
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,500
because I think it's going to come up again in the show, let's talk

167
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,700
about what some of our favorite distributions are and what it is

168
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,500
about those distributions that we love.

169
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,500
And I wanted to give each person in the Mumble Room a chance to

170
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,100
chime in. So, Ace Nomad, let's start with you.

171
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,100
What distribution is your distro of choice and what is it about it

172
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,500
that you love?

173
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,500
I'm running Kabuntu on pretty much all of my main machines and I,

174
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,100
for the most part, just use it for KDE.

175
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,800
I'm kind of distro agnostic.

176
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,900
My passion comes from KDE.

177
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,300
I can understand that.

178
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,300
I mean, it's a great desktop environment.

179
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,100
Mr. Brent Foto, I imagine a bit of it has to do with Plasma yourself.

180
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, it's actually your fault.

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,100
You kind of dared many of us to give Plasma a try, I think, like a

182
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,600
year and a half to two years ago.

183
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,300
And at the time, I was using Linux Mint Cinnamon version, which was

184
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,200
working fairly well for me.

185
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,800
And I am more in a production style system, I'll call it.

186
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,900
But I was like, oh, well, I haven't tried KDE in like a decade.

187
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:46,300
And so gave it a try using Entergos and basically fell in love.

188
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,800
And I've been in love ever since.

189
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,100
And it's been quite an amazing ride.

190
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,600
So I've really enjoyed that setup.

191
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,200
Same.

192
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,700
He showed me his laptop at Texas Linux Fest when I met him last

193
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,900
year. This being him being Chris, by the way.

194
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,200
And yeah, he had a really, really nice setup.

195
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,000
I think it was an XPS 13 at that point.

196
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,400
He had it on and KDE Plasma 5 since then has just been my desktop

197
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,700
daily driver ever since.

198
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,900
It's been really, really solid.

199
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,800
I have typically reached for XFCE or Cinnamon, generally for the

200
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,400
lower resource part of it.

201
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,500
I was really surprised, really surprised with Plasma 5 and just

202
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,300
how wonderfully it runs on this potato.

203
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,200
So it's just so solid.

204
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,000
I know and yet customizable in a way that I really appreciate,

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,800
especially with some of the photo workflow that I do.

206
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,400
It's nice to have Windows always coming up in the right places.

207
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,300
You can almost grow closer to it than other other managers because

208
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,300
you can change it so much, right?

209
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,100
You really make it your own.

210
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
It fits like a glove.

211
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Yeah, certainly.

212
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,300
I feel the only problem now is that because I'm I'm needing to

213
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,300
move to some new hardware.

214
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:59,800
I'm feeling very afraid of changing the setup because I've grown

215
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,700
into it so much.

216
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,700
There's just it's almost like I know everything about it and it

217
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
knows everything about me.

218
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,700
It's like a pair of comfortable shoes.

219
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,300
I actually think that something that is worth commenting about is

220
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,200
so about two years, right?

221
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,400
About two years of using it.

222
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,800
That's several different versions of that desktop environment.

223
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,800
And it's mostly carried forward all of the settings, I would

224
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,100
assume. So it hasn't really disrupted your workflow, even though

225
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,800
it's been updating pretty frequently.

226
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,200
One thing I wanted really fundamentally from a rolling release.

227
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,900
I was a little bit tired when I jumped into this from doing upgrades

228
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,500
and having that disruption in my production, which is also, you

229
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,800
know, comes with a little bit of fun too.

230
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,600
But there's something about having this solid machine that I can

231
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,500
depend on all the time.

232
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,100
And I wasn't quite sure how that experience would go.

233
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,300
But now two years in, I'm, you know, I've hit very few problems

234
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,000
that have really got me to my knees in that respect.

235
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,800
And so it's been a real treat to see it evolve because of course

236
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,600
new features are coming all the time, but not evolve in a way that

237
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,800
makes me dislike it.

238
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,500
It's been just more and more features and more pleasing really.

239
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,800
I have a question for both you and Alex.

240
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,100
Brent, you first.

241
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,600
How often are you running updates?

242
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,200
Yeah, I'll give you the best case and worst case.

243
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,500
So how often typically I do about once a week if I'm in a place

244
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
that has good Wi-Fi.

245
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,100
Now as many of you know, I travel quite a bit and so I tend not to

246
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,000
do the updates while I'm traveling both because I don't want to

247
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
eventually introduce problems, but mostly because I'm relying on

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,800
some mobile Wi-Fi and usually I can wait like a week or two to do

249
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,300
updates in a place where I can have time and space and a good

250
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,600
internet connection to deal with that.

251
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,800
But I will admit these days I'm running out of disk space in a way

252
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,100
that I need to desperately fix and so I haven't run an update.

253
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Chris, you're going to love this.

254
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,900
I haven't run an update.

255
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,500
It's embarrassing.

256
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,500
It's almost like since maybe the sprint.

257
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,200
Really?

258
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,800
I did not expect that.

259
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Which is in August, late August, and I'm afraid now.

260
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,300
What are you doing after the show, Brent?

261
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,300
I mean, it's probably time.

262
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
What do you say about the post show there, Brent?

263
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:24,200
Really, I will bring up how many packages are in need of update

264
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,800
and we can talk about that.

265
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,000
What about you, Alex?

266
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,800
How often are you hitting the old update there?

267
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Every single day, multiple times a day, honestly.

268
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,500
It's Arch, so that's why I have it.

269
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,700
You know, I just have a muscle reflex that I type yay every time

270
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,000
I sit down at a blank terminal.

271
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,400
I don't know why, I just do it.

272
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
You're kidding me.

273
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,100
Multiple times a day for real?

274
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,700
Yeah, why not?

275
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,800
I mean, yeah, there's always fresh stuff.

276
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,900
You don't even want to see what updates.

277
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,800
Because I don't know.

278
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,400
It makes sense.

279
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,900
It reduces the amount of churn you have to deal with each day.

280
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,900
You're doing it multiple times and taking them in smaller chunks.

281
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,100
Makes it more manageable.

282
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,500
But every now and then, it's something massive.

283
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,400
I don't do it before I need to record a show, though.

284
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,200
I'm not okay, and I'm not crazy like that.

285
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,800
It almost sounds like it's a tick.

286
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Yeah, it is.

287
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,000
So, Brent, you're worried about not updating since the end of August, okay?

288
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,300
When I put this system, when I emigrated last year, I put this system in a box

289
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,800
and then I put it on a container ship for the best part of four, four and a half months.

290
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,100
The Arch install that came out the other end was like a time capsule.

291
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,000
It was really strange.

292
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,400
Like, I went back into my home directory and it was exactly as I left it in August.

293
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,400
And I just logged in at the beginning of January.

294
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:40,400
I ran update and there was something like 2,000 packages or something crazy that had to be updated.

295
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,500
And it was fine.

296
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,000
It was just fine.

297
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,700
So, give it a go.

298
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,200
Okay, thank you for that.

299
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,100
The last time I checked, it was at about 500 to 600 packages needing.

300
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:57,000
And I just ran Pac-Man now and it's not looking good.

301
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,600
What if I could tell you there was a way to have fresh software

302
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,100
and not worry about breaking changes until major version releases occurred?

303
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
What if?

304
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,700
Well, it would be all ears in many ways.

305
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:14,600
But that's such an anti-pattern argument because major releases, by their very nature,

306
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,400
require you to have a risky upgrade.

307
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:27,700
Whereas I'm having the very small risk over the lifespan of a system of two, three, four years, whatever.

308
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,100
The cumulative risk is the same, I believe.

309
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:37,500
But I'm taking that risk 0.01% every day instead of 100% every nine months.

310
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,200
Definitely possible.

311
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,900
It is also possible you're playing Russian roulette with a gun that just happens to have 22 bullets instead of 14.

312
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,500
You're eating every now and then.

313
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,700
There's a possibility that there's a change in there that's going to be really disruptive.

314
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,200
You've been away from Arch for a while.

315
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,000
I think you have some PTSD from your Arch days from breaking things.

316
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,300
No, I ran Arch for years.

317
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,600
I think it's actually really great.

318
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,800
I also really appreciate the idea of, say, you're going to make a breaking change,

319
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,900
hold that, and then make it really clear at a certain release cycle.

320
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,300
Although the Arch system does definitely try to communicate changes.

321
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,400
Here's a great example.

322
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,700
You know the Linux VFIO stuff that we talked about in LUP?

323
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,500
Was it 3.1.4, maybe?

324
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,400
A while ago, anyway.

325
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Linux kernel 5.3 came out and had some breaking changes in it for VFIO.

326
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,100
Do you know how long it took me to roll back?

327
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,900
I mean, maybe kernel's not the best example.

328
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:39,800
But rolling back a package, because I know it's only a couple of packages that have changed every day,

329
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:48,000
takes five minutes, if that, as opposed to spending an entire weekend debugging why my major upgrade didn't work.

330
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,400
I mean, maybe I have PTSD from that in the past, same as you have Arch PTSD, you know?

331
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,300
Right. I mean, both ways.

332
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,100
It does mostly just work, as we've seen in the recent 31 upgrades.

333
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,500
I will say it's actually an important discussion.

334
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:11,000
Like, I have approached Arch knowing that problems may occur if you are updating as frequently as, say, Alex is.

335
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,200
But one of the reasons I do or have done updates, ignoring this last little piece,

336
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,000
have done updates on a weekly basis at least, and only when I'm not, you know,

337
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,100
obviously in need of production, is so that those sort of problems get flushed out by some people who are more risk tolerant,

338
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,000
such as Alex, or have the tools to easily deal with problems.

339
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,500
And so I found that to be a really nice cadence for me.

340
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:43,300
I will run into things, you know, maybe once or twice a year that I really have to put some time towards.

341
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,700
But other than that, it's been really smooth. I've been really impressed.

342
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,200
I got to say, I used to use Arch myself, and I worked with a lot of people that got into it.

343
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,300
It got real popular right around that time. I know Chris was talking about it a lot on the shows.

344
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:01,400
And the thing is, if you can religiously update every single day, it's a lot smoother experience.

345
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Not everyone has that discipline. A lot of people, if they go a week, a month without updating,

346
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,400
they'll end up running into problems. And I've had to help a lot of people fix broken Arch installs

347
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,500
just because they went, you know, five weeks without updating and then things didn't work.

348
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:22,700
And the Arch upstream, they don't test any scenarios like that other than you better be up to date all the way with every package all the time.

349
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:28,000
And because the Pac-Man package manager is somewhat stupid compared to a lot of other ones.

350
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,600
Oh, it's very dumb. But it's so fast.

351
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,200
Well, it's fast because it doesn't do a lot, right?

352
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,900
Yeah, so because it doesn't do a lot. One of the major things I've seen trip up people who are Arch users

353
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:48,200
is that the package they have put it that you do an update and you break your system because well,

354
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,800
you didn't go to the Arch website and go check. Oh, wait, you need to do a manual transition yourself

355
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,800
before you can run the package manager because otherwise you will just break your computer irreparably, right?

356
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,400
Those kinds of transitions are painful and they're really difficult to do,

357
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,000
especially when your package manager cannot help you.

358
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah, isn't there one actually pending right now? I can't remember. We're tracking it, but we're not tracking it super closely.

359
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
There's about like if you use like an old version of compression,

360
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,500
which was people were warned about a year ago, but if you still happen to be using it on Arch, you're about to get broken.

361
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:31,100
Yeah. So if you haven't upgraded Pac-Man in a while, you're kind of screwed because they just switch compression from XC to Z standard.

362
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,600
And so you're broken. That's what it was. Oh, no.

363
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,700
They do say you've had a year. So we expect you already did update.

364
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,300
This is one of those rare instances where they they've actually done a good job of like preparing you for the worst.

365
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:49,500
But, you know, like take, for example, when the C++ ABI change happened,

366
00:19:49,500 --> 00:20:02,200
lots and lots of people wound up like actually getting really hurt by that because the mixture of ABI has caused things to not link properly at runtime and then things just blew up.

367
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:09,100
And so, like, there's all kinds of unexpected side effects that come from things like, oh, you're running programs,

368
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,800
but it's after your loop standard C++ was updated, but before everything else that linked to it was updated.

369
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,600
And because there is no order dependency resolution at that level,

370
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,600
you can't make sure that everything that leads up to that package is actually installed first.

371
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,600
So pretty much every kind of package manager is going to check that type of linkage other than Pac-Man.

372
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,900
There it is. I will give a quick update on my Pac-Man situation here.

373
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,300
Am I OK? All right. Real time here. I like it.

374
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:49,300
So this is error, failed to prepare transaction, could not satisfy dependencies, and the next line you'll love, installing Pac-Man to 5.2.1-1 breaks dependency Pac-Man rather than 5.2.

375
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,500
Yeah, that's not good. So you don't think I'm in a bad situation.

376
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,200
I'll be best to just uninstall Pac-Man completely and start again.

377
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,500
Oh, OK. That's the best advice.

378
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,100
You wanted new Pac-Man, so I broke your Pac-Man to make your Pac-Man so you could have your Pac-Man.

379
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,600
Pac-Man installed DNF.

380
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,100
All of a sudden, I feel it's important that I play the Arch-Defendant for some reason.

381
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,900
Ed mentioned that I'm sure if you search that error message on the forum, you'll probably find a resolution pretty quick.

382
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,000
Do you want to try that next? Try that.

383
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,300
All right. I'll update you guys on that.

384
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:22,900
All right. So, Byte, I want to give you a chance to tell us what your favorite distro is and what it is about it that you just love so much.

385
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:32,200
Well, so as many of you know, I'm a Debian Ubuntu guy, and on my laptop, my daily driver is a Budgie Ubuntu.

386
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,100
I got a bit hooked on Budgie when I tried Solace.

387
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,300
And then you eventually wound back on an Ubuntu base, but with the same desktop environment?

388
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,300
Oh, yeah.

389
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:48,400
Now, I have to ask you, if you could change one thing to make it perfect, what would it be?

390
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,100
Well, I did notice a bug and I'm trying to describe the bug, but no one can replicate it.

391
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,800
So that's an interesting thing.

392
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah. Yeah, I follow you.

393
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,300
Yeah, I feel that way with my glitchy mouse up on my desktop.

394
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,800
Meanwhile, I hear from everybody, it's great on my machine.

395
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,400
That's what I keep hearing. Meanwhile, it's getting worse than ever.

396
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,300
Like, I open up tabs just in the background.

397
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,400
Like, say you're reading something, you like, you know, you middle clicked, like open something in the background.

398
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah.

399
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,900
My mouse just bit, bit, bit, bit, bit.

400
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,800
That's how it moves across the screen.

401
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,200
I can't believe you haven't changed something.

402
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,300
Why are you just sitting here?

403
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,200
What am I going to do? Go to Mac OS?

404
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,000
What am I going to do?

405
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,600
I mean, there's a lot of other apps. Have you tried Arch?

406
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,200
Well, no, I think I have to, I think I'd have to go to Plasma.

407
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,600
Go to Plasma. Come on. You won't regret it.

408
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,500
I know the thing that really needs to be fixed, the toolbars.

409
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:41,800
You can shove them to the right or the left, but they're still the full size if you hit your mouse on the bottom.

410
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,700
Ah, okay. All right. Good one.

411
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,800
You know what? You ought to, you know, you know, maybe always submit that there as a bug report.

412
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,600
Okay, Carl, I've got a pretty good idea.

413
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,800
Your default setup is Linux Mint from two years ago and you love it.

414
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,500
Am I right?

415
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,700
Absolutely.

416
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,200
Okay. Tell me about your current setup.

417
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,400
What it is you love about it and if you could change one thing to make it perfect.

418
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,000
Sure. Well, I know your little joke there.

419
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,700
You know that I run Fedora.

420
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
I know you love it too for your servers.

421
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
I'm using it pretty much everywhere.

422
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,200
Servers, desktop, laptop, everything.

423
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,200
The very first thing that really attracted me about Linux was package management in general.

424
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Started getting into it more.

425
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,400
Was able to get a job doing a lot of work with that with the IUS project there at Rackspace

426
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,200
and just got real deep into the RPM ecosystem.

427
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,800
At that time, I was still running Arch on my desktop

428
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,300
and I was doing a good bit of Arch packages in the AUR just for,

429
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,600
you know, scratching my own itches, things that I wanted to use

430
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,100
and rather than just doing a one-off install, I was like, no, of course,

431
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,200
it needs to be a package and I'll just make it myself and upload it to the AUR.

432
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,500
Learned enough about the, around Pacman and their package format

433
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
to realize just how much better RPM was in it.

434
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,400
I mean, it's new and it's fast,

435
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,300
but there are just so many edge cases, things like the linkage stuff we got into earlier

436
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,600
that, you know, all of that, all those years of robustness

437
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,900
and maturity just really comes in handy for a lot of things

438
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,300
and especially at Rackspace, you see those kinds of things all the time

439
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,000
where customers add random repos or do different kinds of updates, break things

440
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,900
and just having a robust package manager is absolutely essential.

441
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,700
That's one of the things that I really like about it

442
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,500
and the way that Fedora is changing now, the thing that's really great

443
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,000
besides just being a total RPM nerd around this stuff and liking it a lot,

444
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,800
they have a real low barrier to entry to getting updates, changes and updates to their packages.

445
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,400
They've got it set up now where once you get your Fedora account,

446
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,300
you can actually send pull requests to update RPM spec files,

447
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,800
which unlike Debian packaging stuff is actually one file understandable

448
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,400
that you can just look at and see what it's doing in a snap.

449
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,200
It's not quite as simple as, you know, a bash script like Pacman stuff is,

450
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,000
but there's other problems there with that simplicity.

451
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,600
I think RPM spec files strike a really good balance

452
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,900
between simplicity and capability and flexibility and robustness.

453
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,900
So being able to send pull requests just to change things,

454
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,300
a good example, I think it was a week or two ago with the Fedora 31 show,

455
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,800
she's noticed that the Ferronix test suite was a major version behind.

456
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:19,700
During that show, I forked the repo, sent a pull request to update it to the latest version, to version 9.

457
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,100
That just got accepted and built today.

458
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:27,200
So pull requests are the way to do open source, you know, stuff now

459
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,000
and with Fedora getting that natively integrated with the low barrier to entry, it's awesome.

460
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,800
That's great.

461
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,400
That really is great.

462
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,500
I can't argue with any of that.

463
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,500
Makes a lot of sense and I echo a lot of that as well.

464
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,200
So, Neil, what about you?

465
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,400
What's your distro of choice and what's your favorite thing about it?

466
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,600
Oh, Carl, you actually, hold on, Neil, before we go to you, Carl,

467
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,500
you didn't say if you could change one thing about Fedora, what it would be to make it perfect.

468
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,800
The thing that bugs me and I've gotten away from this myself,

469
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,000
being a problem for myself just by switching everything to Intel and AMD,

470
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,100
but NVIDIA drivers, it comes up time and time again for new users

471
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,500
and it's just a bad experience having to add other repos to get it working

472
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,700
and I know that there's all kinds of licensing and firmware problems around it.

473
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,000
A lot of it honestly is well over my head,

474
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,800
but what I do know is that Fedora has exceptions for firmware,

475
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,900
for proprietary blob firmware in their kernel to get things working.

476
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:27,200
I know that Red Hat puts a lot of proprietary software and kernel binary blobs in their kernel

477
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,900
to get enterprise hardware, especially storage solutions working

478
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,800
and I just think Red Hat should be able to put their weight behind getting this problem fixed,

479
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,600
whether it's a partnership, some kind of exception, some kind of licensing deal.

480
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:46,600
I mean, Red Hat and Canonical, I know they did something with Microsoft to get UEFI working

481
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,400
and I just feel like that there's some kind of solution there if everyone put their weight behind it

482
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,200
to get NVIDIA drivers working correctly out of the box on Fedora.

483
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,300
Ah, from your lips to their ears, Carl, from your lips.

484
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,100
Neil, what about you? So your favorite distro and of course what you love about it

485
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,900
and the thing you'd love to just sort of tweak, change, make different to make it perfect.

486
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,800
So I've got two favorites, but I'm going to talk about the latter one

487
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,400
since Carl did a great job with the former.

488
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,000
So I run Fedora and OpenSUSE pretty much all over the place.

489
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,100
I've got a little bit of Agios sprinkled right here and there,

490
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,400
but the two major ones I run are Fedora and OpenSUSE.

491
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,600
What I really like about OpenSUSE is,

492
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,200
honestly, I like that I have a rolling release distribution that actually gets tested and integrated

493
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:41,000
and I get a good feeling whenever I'm using Tumbleweed versus the brief time I've used Arch

494
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,600
or the time where I ruined myself doing Gen 2, stuff like that.

495
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:53,700
Having a little bit of a peace of mind when you're doing a rolling distribution really goes a long way.

496
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,500
And the KDE experience, because I've been a KDE guy for several years now,

497
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,700
the KDE experience in OpenSUSE is mostly amazing.

498
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,200
It works really well.

499
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
They've got a good visual experience.

500
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,800
They've got a design language around it.

501
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,300
They've got good backgrounds and all that stuff.

502
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:17,000
It feels like it's a loved part of the distribution.

503
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And not to say that Fedora doesn't have a great KDE experience.

504
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,700
It's just that in OpenSUSE, they've tweaked it.

505
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,300
They've made it their own.

506
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,500
Right, feels more a part of it and loved.

507
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:34,100
Right. As far as what I really wish I could change, I don't like the Package Manager.

508
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,300
I don't.

509
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:40,100
Zipper has bitten me enough times now and done enough weird things that I actually,

510
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,900
on my personal OpenSUSE systems, have switched to DNF.

511
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,400
So I use that everywhere.

512
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,500
I even patched PackageKit to switch to it.

513
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,800
I just cannot see them having the will to go through yet another Package Manager transition.

514
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,600
They haven't done one in 10 years, so why the hell not?

515
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,200
You've got to be kidding me. It feels like it's been two months ago.

516
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,600
You're telling me we've been using Zipper for 10 years?

517
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Zipper was introduced in 2006.

518
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,400
Oh, I remember when Zipper was around, but I don't...

519
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,200
I mean, no way has it been the default Package Manager.

520
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,800
Yep.

521
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,100
Really?

522
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,700
I feel like that's sort of when they started to lose me, to tell you the truth,

523
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,600
is when they went through a series of Package Manager changes.

524
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
I just couldn't really be bothered.

525
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Remember how I called you out for being old, Chris?

526
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,500
Full circle.

527
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,100
I hate you.

528
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,800
It took longer in SLE than it did in OpenSUSE.

529
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,300
Huh. Okay.

530
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,700
All right. I remember Zipper as a tool to manage software across multiple Linux systems.

531
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,100
I don't, you know, that's how I remember Zipper.

532
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,100
I want to hear from Frank SMB over there on his favorite distro,

533
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,700
what he loves about it, and the one thing you would change, Frank.

534
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:45,500
So I use Ubuntu MATE, and to be completely transparent,

535
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,400
I do a little bit with Wimpy and the team.

536
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,100
Fair enough.

537
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,400
Why I chose it.

538
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,900
So I've used Linux for a while.

539
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,600
I took a break, came back to it on the desktop,

540
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,700
and I was using Ubuntu because I've used XFCE for a long time.

541
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,600
And I got a little tired of a few issues with sleep,

542
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,800
and I'm not trying to throw XFCE under the bus at all.

543
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
And I started looking at MATE,

544
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:19,000
and when I looked at it, I did not like the advanced MATE menu.

545
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,800
For me, a menu is a big deal.

546
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,300
And as soon as they brought the brisk menu in, I got really interested.

547
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,200
Sure.

548
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,700
Started using it and really kind of figured out this is where I wanted to be.

549
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,200
The balance of performance to like battery power is really great.

550
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,100
And there's, especially with what they've done in 1910,

551
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,500
a lot of the key binding, so you can either do it really mouse driven

552
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,500
or keyboard driven, which is really awesome.

553
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,700
And the amount of work that Luke and Wimpy have put into the welcome

554
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,200
and the software boutique is just wonderful.

555
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,000
So I think it's really something that's great for ease of use for a new user

556
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,200
and for someone that is really experienced.

557
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,500
Completely agree.

558
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah.

559
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,200
And if you could change one thing about it to make it perfect?

560
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,500
So there's two things.

561
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,400
One is a little bit outside of the scope,

562
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,000
and that's to have more of a scalable, high DPI setting.

563
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,300
And maybe Wayland will get that for us.

564
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,300
My biggest one is to do some work on the panel.

565
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,800
So right now, it's kind of a little bit more difficult

566
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,700
than it should be to make the panel look exactly like you want it.

567
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,500
So you have to go in and make some changes that are not exactly for a new user,

568
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,200
the best experience.

569
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,600
But doing that opens up another can of worms.

570
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,600
But that's really my only thing that I would really want to have changed.

571
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,900
Yeah, fair enough.

572
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,300
I love it.

573
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,900
You're making me want to try it out again.

574
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,400
Yeah, right?

575
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,700
It's such a great environment.

576
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,200
All right.

577
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,000
Mr. Minimac, I'm curious to hear what your favorite distro is,

578
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,400
what you love about it, what you'd change.

579
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,800
I think I can say I'm a first Ubuntu user.

580
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,600
So when I started, it was the late 90s.

581
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,000
I started with C64.

582
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,500
I even bought a distribution.

583
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,000
I had a 300-page book that came with it.

584
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,300
Then I switched to Mandrake, and I really love it.

585
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,500
And then I felt ready for Debian.

586
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,900
And just after a year of Debian, I felt really at home.

587
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,800
Ubuntu started with their releases, and then I switched to Ubuntu.

588
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,000
Mainly the graphical stuff was much nicer,

589
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,200
and configuration was a little bit easier than Debian.

590
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,000
And for most of my machines, I stay in Ubuntu now.

591
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,900
And I love it.

592
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,700
Yeah.

593
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,400
That's how I really got into Ubuntu early on, too,

594
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,300
was I was a pretty happy Debian user,

595
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,900
but wanted just a little bit more.

596
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,100
And yeah, Ubuntu had that.

597
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,500
A little bit special for my main desktop,

598
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,900
I don't use a default Windows environment.

599
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,400
I use Enlightenment for decades now.

600
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,100
So I guess if you could change one thing,

601
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,600
would it be to ship Enlightenment by default?

602
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,900
No, no, no, not really.

603
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,700
I just love the way they handle dual-screen setups

604
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,300
or multiple-screen setups.

605
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,900
But on my laptops now, I use GNOME,

606
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,800
and that is no problem for me.

607
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,900
For me, it's easy to switch between the different interfaces,

608
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,900
so it's no problem.

609
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,300
I do a lot with shortcuts, so it's very easy for me.

610
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,100
What is it that Enlightenment does about the multi-monitor

611
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,400
that you like so much?

612
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,500
Enlightenment treats the screens completely independent.

613
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,900
So I can switch screens on the left

614
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
and have the same screen on the right,

615
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,500
so the same desktop and all that stuff.

616
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
You can add desktop,

617
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,100
and you have completely independent monitors.

618
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,300
That is really cool.

619
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,900
So you know, GNOME Shell does that now,

620
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,600
where you can have, so in my case,

621
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,500
I have a center horizontal 27-inch monitor,

622
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,700
and then I have two 27-inch vertical screens.

623
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,000
Those remain static.

624
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,700
So whatever I have on the 27-inch vertical screens

625
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,800
remains static,

626
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,200
but then I can switch virtual desktops in the center screen.

627
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,500
And I like that quite a bit.

628
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,100
Okay, okay. Well, that was a try then.

629
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,200
So at the time, I started using Enlightenment.

630
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,300
Enlightenment was the only one, I think,

631
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,600
rather developed some environment that did that.

632
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,800
I could give it a try,

633
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,200
but I really fell in love with Enlightenment.

634
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,600
I'm also a minimalist user

635
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,100
when it comes to my graphical layout.

636
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,600
So I have a hidden panel,

637
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,700
and I have a hidden Enlightenment shelf,

638
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,700
and the rest of the screen is blank with the background.

639
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,600
Oh, that's nice and clean.

640
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,300
And if you could just tweak something or change something

641
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,000
or even wave a magic wand and make it perfect,

642
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,800
what would it be?

643
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,300
It's in fact an experiment I'd like to start.

644
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,900
It's having a Debian-based rolling distro,

645
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,900
like using Debian SIDs,

646
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,700
and then just try to use it as a rolling distro.

647
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,900
That would be cool.

648
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,600
The thing is, I guess they would need to give

649
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,700
a little bit more love to the packages

650
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,800
when they first put it into their SID repos,

651
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,700
because when I used Debian,

652
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,900
but, well, it was decades ago,

653
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,600
when you used SID, you often had some package breakage.

654
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,200
Yeah.

655
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,100
Now I guess we could give it a try,

656
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,200
and now it could work,

657
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,100
because then you have a rolling distro.

658
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,400
All right, that's a good one.

659
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,600
I like that.

660
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,900
All right, so let's now go to Mr. Tweets over there.

661
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,400
So Mr. Tweets, what's your favorite distro?

662
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
What do you love about it,

663
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,600
and what would you change to make it perfect?

664
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,500
So on the desktop, for the last little while,

665
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,400
I've been using KDE Neon.

666
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,800
You know, it's kind of a nice rolling Plasma user land,

667
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,600
and it gets out of my way, and it's customizable,

668
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,400
and I can just do what I need to do.

669
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,000
It kind of forces me into knowing a little bit about,

670
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
you know, the way to set my machine up,

671
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,300
and I can kind of grow into it.

672
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,900
And the KDE Pim suite, I really like as well.

673
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,700
Really, really good.

674
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,300
Yeah, boy, if that works for you,

675
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,400
that's such a win.

676
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,200
It is well-developed.

677
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah.

678
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,600
I love Neon as a workstation,

679
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,000
because I really have not had a single issue.

680
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,500
This machine that I'm sitting at to read the show notes

681
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,500
is on Neon, and it's sort of perfect,

682
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,700
because the base of the OS just is a good old

683
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,500
what you get is what you expect Ubuntu LTS,

684
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,000
and then it's fresh desktop environment all the time.

685
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,500
But I really haven't had a break yet,

686
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,700
and I attribute that besides hard work,

687
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,400
and bug testing, and all those things.

688
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,100
I attribute it to the fact that most the developers

689
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,000
that are creating Plasma are using this themselves.

690
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,900
So if they break it, it breaks their desktop.

691
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,700
Right, they got to fix it.

692
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,600
Silly Freak Quick.

693
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,100
Yeah.

694
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,200
How often do you update?

695
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,700
That's one question I have.

696
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,500
Yeah.

697
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,700
It depends on what the machine is.

698
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,900
So on my laptop, like every couple of days,

699
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,800
I'll say, on my workstation at home,

700
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
maybe once a week,

701
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,300
just because I need it to be a bit more stable.

702
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,300
Yeah.

703
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,900
I like updating.

704
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,500
I enjoy it.

705
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,700
You've got that look in your eye.

706
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,600
I just like seeing like how many packages are changing,

707
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,100
and often it's like a pretty insignificant amount

708
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,200
of disk space that's changing.

709
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,800
Or sometimes it goes down, and you're like, oh.

710
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,400
Yeah.

711
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,100
It's just the coolest thing.

712
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,400
I don't know.

713
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,500
So I really enjoy updating.

714
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,400
But I also enjoy a computer that works.

715
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,700
But I'll save mine.

716
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,900
So Mr. Payne, what about you?

717
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,800
Well, don't we need, well, Mr. Tweets here will change?

718
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,400
Oh, right.

719
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:13,700
Yeah.

720
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,000
So what would you tweak, Tweets, to make it perfect?

721
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
The one thing I'd like to see from the Neon project,

722
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,100
and it kind of goes for what I use on servers mainly as well,

723
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,600
is a base that I can use that's on the Ubuntu interim releases,

724
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,700
just because of hardware enablement that

725
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,300
gets there a little bit quicker than it

726
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,700
does to the long-term support releases.

727
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,500
That would be really great if they could just

728
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,200
make an ISO that was based on 1910, for example.

729
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,400
I kind of agree.

730
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
When it comes to a workstation that's

731
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,200
doing a reoccurring task, maybe not.

732
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,900
But when it comes to my system that I use

733
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,400
as both a workstation and a machine

734
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,200
to have a little bit of fun, it is really

735
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,000
really nice to have maybe like the new ZFS stuff

736
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,200
or have a little bit newer kernel stack.

737
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,700
Yeah.

738
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,200
Yeah.

739
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,600
Yeah.

740
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,400
Great one.

741
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,100
All right, Mr. Payne, what about you?

742
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,600
You know, I've been thinking about this.

743
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,400
It's a tough question.

744
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:01,900
It is.

745
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,400
It's hard to declare favorites.

746
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,700
Oh, yeah, definitely.

747
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,600
I can excuse you from that since we hop so much, if you'd like.

748
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,800
Yes, thank you.

749
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
It's especially funny to say this because I'm not,

750
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,500
I don't have this distribution installed anywhere

751
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,900
on this laptop at the moment.

752
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,500
And I'm, in fact, using KDE neon for the show.

753
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,100
It just keeps working.

754
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,900
But I got to say Arch, I think.

755
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:25,000
It's just the, you know, it's the simplicity

756
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,900
that I come back to.

757
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,300
And despite what many people think,

758
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,400
it's not, you know, it's not necessarily easy.

759
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,000
But it just, it's aesthetically pleasing

760
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,500
because it's so simple and then combined in a clean fashion.

761
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,000
And I feel very much in control and linked with my system

762
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,300
and feel like I actually can understand everything.

763
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,500
Or, well, I don't pretend to understand everything.

764
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,100
But I can understand as much as is possible about how

765
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,000
my system works and is set up.

766
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,400
And because of that, when you have the time to engage,

767
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,100
I find it to be very robust.

768
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,200
So if you had to set up a system this weekend

769
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,300
to, like, be a home server, Arch is the way you'd go?

770
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,000
Well, it depends.

771
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,700
I mean, it perhaps, depending on how you use it,

772
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,600
may work less well in a case of a machine

773
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,400
that you don't want to interact with very well.

774
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,300
So for this case, I was really thinking mostly

775
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,500
of the workstation.

776
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,000
But the server, these days, I've been using probably

777
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,800
an Ubuntu LTS.

778
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
You're saying you've never built a router based on Arch?

779
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,000
Oh, no.

780
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,100
I mean, yes, that is absolutely a longstanding appliance

781
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,900
of mine that works very well.

782
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,000
And part of it is because it was very simple, right?

783
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,500
I didn't have a lot of cruft to remove to get it into the way.

784
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,300
I could build it exactly as I needed it.

785
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,800
So there weren't a lot of moving pieces.

786
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,800
Yeah, there's really not.

787
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,100
It's pretty surprising how light you can make it.

788
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,400
I totally get that.

789
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,800
I wonder, with our recent testing of Fedora,

790
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,400
if it hasn't touched on some of those notes for you.

791
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,800
It absolutely has.

792
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,000
Fedora also feels just very modern.

793
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,400
It's well integrated with SystemD.

794
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
All the new sorts of bits and pieces

795
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,300
that come available in the Linux ecosystem,

796
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,700
you can find them there, just like you can find them in Arch.

797
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,500
I think I'm still a little less familiar.

798
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,300
I'm growing more familiar with that ecosystem

799
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,800
and some of the newer tooling, as I've checked back

800
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,100
in this time around.

801
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,500
There's more going on.

802
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,500
It doesn't feel quite as individualized,

803
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,800
decomplected, simple, necessarily.

804
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,000
But what's there is very well done and put together.

805
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,500
So I find it very enjoyable to use.

806
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,800
That also has been my experience with it, as well.

807
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,600
I enjoy both Arch and Fedora very much in a similar way.

808
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,900
So if you could just tweak one thing about Arch

809
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,100
to make it perfect, what would it be?

810
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,900
I don't pretend I think this is reasonable

811
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,500
or in any way will happen, but CFS in the kernel.

812
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,600
Just there, ready to go.

813
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,900
Boy, can I get a ding for that.

814
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,200
If I could change, I'll just tell you mine right now.

815
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,300
If I could change one thing about Fedora,

816
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,300
it would be CFS in the kernel.

817
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,200
I love you Fedora, but we have Fedora on our NAS here.

818
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,400
And every time you do a major update of just,

819
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,200
not even like an upgrade to the next release,

820
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:01,200
just an update inside Fedora 30, it's a real crap shoot.

821
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,900
I mean, we were down for 45 minutes last time, maybe?

822
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,200
Well, we were distracted while troubleshooting.

823
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,200
But every frickin' time there's a big kernel update,

824
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,700
the CFS stuff breaks.

825
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,100
And it's like you got to go through and really be diligent

826
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,800
about the order that things come up in the system

827
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,200
and how things respond to that.

828
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,000
And you really have to make sure that you get your DKMS

829
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,300
modules built and that your system can boot far enough

830
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,800
to get that done before it needs to get

831
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,100
to those other file systems.

832
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,100
And it really is just a frickin' nightmare.

833
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,800
Totally solvable.

834
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,300
You can admin your way around all of those problems.

835
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,100
It's just things you have to do.

836
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,300
Blame DKMS.

837
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,100
You really, yeah.

838
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,800
You really just, if we were using XFS

839
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,700
or we were using Extended 4, it would literally be a non-issue.

840
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,800
But because we want CFS, it's a fight.

841
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,400
Or if we were using Ubuntu.

842
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,600
So I'd really like to run Fedora on my home server.

843
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,200
But because of those, because I refuse to use DKMS,

844
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,600
that's still running CentOS with the Kmod packages

845
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,400
from CFS on Linux.

846
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,000
All right, so I want to get Cheesy a chance to jump in here.

847
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,500
So Cheesy, if you were going to throw a system together

848
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,000
this weekend, what distro would you go with?

849
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,900
And what is it that you love about it?

850
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,800
And what's the thing you'd change to make it perfect?

851
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,000
Well, first up, I'd like to back it up a little bit

852
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,300
and date myself maybe a little more.

853
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,300
So you guys are talking about package managers.

854
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,600
And Debian and Apt was a thing for me, obviously.

855
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,800
And getting into Debian as my third distro

856
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,500
to ever install Apt was a great one.

857
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,400
Because before that, it was tar.gz files.

858
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,100
So it was that human package manager part.

859
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,300
But no, for me, Debian and Debian-based systems

860
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,100
I've always been comfortable with.

861
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,900
The software can be a little old,

862
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,900
but all the derivatives that are available now.

863
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:49,700
So I ditched Debian straight up for Ubuntu back when,

864
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,900
I think it was 4.10, so Warty Warthog,

865
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,000
and started using it there just because it

866
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,700
was bundled with additional pieces of software

867
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:03,000
back then when we had CD and DVD burners and stuff.

868
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,300
So it was nice to have that sort of software

869
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,200
right out of the gate.

870
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,400
But it has never really been a visually appealing.

871
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,200
Debian really had never been a visually appealing distribution

872
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,700
and desktop to use.

873
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,900
And I think Ubuntu kind of filled that void.

874
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,200
A little more polish, a little more focus on that?

875
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,100
Absolutely.

876
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,800
And then you push on through Ubuntu into other derivatives

877
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,300
like Pop!

878
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,100
OS.

879
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,000
They've done a wonderful job building a distro

880
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,200
that they're shipping on production hardware.

881
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,400
It's always nice to see that.

882
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,700
And to me, I think they have one of the best setups for gaming

883
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,700
on Linux overall.

884
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,100
So just jumping in with the nightmare

885
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,700
that is NVIDIA drivers and getting stuff to work

886
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,900
and pushing the FPS that you want out of your games.

887
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,200
So I really appreciate Pop!

888
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,800
OS for that.

889
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,300
And they're also just a great group

890
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,500
of people that are doing some fantastic work.

891
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,100
And then sliding over into elementary,

892
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,400
who have really kind of cultivated a really polished

893
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,800
Linux desktop experience, which as a designer,

894
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,800
I just have huge admiration for those guys.

895
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,200
And it truly shows how much pride they take in their work.

896
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,800
And so I keep bouncing back over there.

897
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,300
And of course, I've got to give a shout out to Ubuntu Matei.

898
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,200
Because I really feel like as far as the Ubuntu spins

899
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:35,100
or derivatives, it really does give you the most customization

900
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,400
out of the box.

901
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:42,700
So if you want to mix Pantheon with,

902
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,000
or if you want to throw in any sort of desktop configuration,

903
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,500
it's just super easy to do with Matei.

904
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,100
So I really love it for that.

905
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,700
And then Arch has a special place in my heart

906
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,800
because it's bleeding edge software, which

907
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,700
a lot of distributions are a little bit behind the curve

908
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,200
on that.

909
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,000
And I understand why that is.

910
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,500
Also, the Arch Wiki is fantastic.

911
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,900
And if we really didn't have the Arch Wiki,

912
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,500
there would be a huge void in the Linux community.

913
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,900
Because quite often, even if I'm searching

914
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:21,400
for an Ubuntu derivative answer to some problem that I'm having,

915
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,000
I can go to the Arch Wiki and generally find that answer.

916
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,600
But obviously, it's not always the easiest for a new user

917
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,800
to jump in.

918
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,600
So that's why I would also recommend Manjaro,

919
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,000
because those guys are doing fantastic work.

920
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,100
They've really stepped up to the plate

921
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,700
and given us that polished desktop,

922
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,900
but also given us a ton of choices.

923
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,800
So to me, it's kind of a blend between Pop Elementary

924
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:51,000
and Matei is Manjaro on the Arch side.

925
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,700
And from what I haven't done any gaming, serious gaming

926
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,500
under Manjaro, but I would expect

927
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:02,200
that to be just as excellent as, say, Pop OS would.

928
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:07,240
As far as changes, it's more of an overarching theme for me.

929
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,400
I'd like to see more commercial and or proprietary software

930
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,160
come to Linux.

931
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,840
Again, working in design, I would

932
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,060
love to see more design, commercially available design

933
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,960
software, GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus, Krita, Blender.

934
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,800
They're all super awesome pieces of software,

935
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,160
but they always seem like a step behind the commercial offerings.

936
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,360
And there really isn't a substitution out there right

937
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,280
now for, say, After Effects.

938
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,080
So we've got a way to come there, I think.

939
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,600
And also, going back to gaming on Linux,

940
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,400
it's gotten a lot better in the last few years,

941
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,560
but we're still kind of struggling.

942
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,120
And I think that that will pick up as more,

943
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,840
as Linux gains a little more market share

944
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,440
and we start to have developers that

945
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,380
are more interested in making sure that these games work

946
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,920
under Linux, I think that'll be great,

947
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,440
because it's just so spread out right now.

948
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,120
Yeah, we've got Steam, but then we've got Lutris.

949
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,920
So it's trying to get everything under one umbrella,

950
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,440
I think, would be great.

951
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,280
And then again, just kind of a global theme with all of this

952
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,120
is within the community itself, I

953
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,400
would like to see us just end this distro wars.

954
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,240
I love the conversation that we're having now

955
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,520
where we're not beating each other up about what we use

956
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,360
or why we use it.

957
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,000
We might be beating up different package managers,

958
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,400
but we're not beating ourselves up

959
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,520
over the actual distributions.

960
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,240
So if we could all put our big boy, girl, and pants on

961
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,520
and understand that what's always the best distro for you

962
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,960
is not the best distro for someone else.

963
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,160
So just show a little empathy toward one another

964
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,000
and lend a hand wherever you can and just really try

965
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,880
to help out and help our community grow and thrive.

966
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,800
And let's not cut each other down.

967
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,520
Oh, I got it.

968
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,040
There you have it.

969
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,640
Wise words from Mr. Chase Bacon.

970
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,360
I think we've got to call it right there.

971
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,560
I was going to go into mine, but you all

972
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,640
know what my stuff is by listening to these shows.

973
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,680
So let's do instead a little bit of housekeeping.

974
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,800
I was hoping you were going to do Millionaire.

975
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,680
We could.

976
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,560
Do you want to?

977
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,640
We should.

978
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,560
We totally could.

979
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,160
We need Neil's questions, though.

980
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,760
Neil's going to have to create some questions for us.

981
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,520
Oh, we should totally have Neil play Millionaire

982
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,280
in the post-show.

983
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,360
All right, we'll do just a little bit of it.

984
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,920
All right, so a little bit of housekeeping

985
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,400
before we get out of here.

986
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,960
Check out Brunch with Brent.

987
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,520
It's cooking up a storm these days.

988
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,520
Wimpy was just on there.

989
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,560
We talked about that last week.

990
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,600
Jill joins this week.

991
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,560
She's often in the Mumble Room.

992
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,400
And Brent, rumor has it, good chat.

993
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,440
Yeah, I learned so much about Jill,

994
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,840
and we had an amazing good time, so I

995
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,400
think everybody else will, too.

996
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,880
Extras.show for that.

997
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,560
A new batch of Linux Academy community courses

998
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,760
is out for November.

999
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,480
Link in the show notes for information about that.

1000
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,760
And I think it's also worth calling out here.

1001
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,240
Closed captions have been added to the Linux Academy mobile app

1002
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,440
for some offline videos with closed captions.

1003
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,240
Oh, fancy.

1004
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:00,920
I like that.

1005
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,800
That's my mind blowing right there.

1006
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,640
That's really nice.

1007
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,360
And transcripts are on their way to the iOS app,

1008
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,880
as well as really everywhere.

1009
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,640
The web platform, everywhere else, too.

1010
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,480
It's pretty great.

1011
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,000
It's such a great feature.

1012
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,560
So check that out.

1013
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:19,000
110 hands-on labs added in the last month.

1014
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,840
That's incredible.

1015
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,480
Think about how much goes into one of those.

1016
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,240
I mean, whoo.

1017
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,920
Because that's really what makes the difference is actually

1018
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,960
getting your hands on it.

1019
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,960
Doing it for real.

1020
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,800
You can read it.

1021
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,080
Messing it up a few times.

1022
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,360
Putting it into practice.

1023
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,600
And to have it all just curated for you

1024
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,800
and ready to go with the click of a button, gosh, 110?

1025
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,080
That's nuts.

1026
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,440
That's really great.

1027
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,320
That is really great.

1028
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,200
Check that out.

1029
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,960
Also, go check out extras, extras.show.

1030
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,960
And that, my friends, just a quick little housekeeping

1031
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,000
right there.

1032
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,920
I think that's it for us.

1033
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,200
We did things a little bit out of order this week,

1034
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,320
because it's a special episode.

1035
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,400
I enjoyed it, though.

1036
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,080
I feel like I learned a little bit about everybody this week.

1037
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,040
And I was going to go into what I

1038
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,080
love about my distros of choice, which everybody knows

1039
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,320
at this point is primarily Fedora and Ubuntu.

1040
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,880
But what would you change?

1041
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,520
That's really what I want to know.

1042
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,640
Obviously, we all know what you run and why you run it.

1043
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,720
But what would you change?

1044
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,200
All right.

1045
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:16,480
All right.

1046
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:16,920
That's fair.

1047
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,880
Yeah, you're right.

1048
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,000
I mean, this show documents what I like.

1049
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,520
So what would I change?

1050
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,040
All right, well, I already gave you mine for Fedora,

1051
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,040
which was ZFS.

1052
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,880
I think that's just copied me, but whatever.

1053
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,960
Oh, really?

1054
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,040
Copycat.

1055
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:36,640
Well, the one for Ubuntu is a little more complicated.

1056
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,760
I would really love to see.

1057
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,000
And I know it's like the worst case scenario,

1058
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,680
because Canonical can't really take this on without getting

1059
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,720
a whole bunch of pushback.

1060
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,440
But I'd really love to see apt modernized.

1061
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,720
And in the case of Ubuntu, I would

1062
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,280
love to see something that combines

1063
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,380
snaps and Debian packages together in one user

1064
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,280
experience, but gives me clear indications what's

1065
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,040
a snap versus what's a deb package,

1066
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,600
and lets me manage and update both of those two

1067
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,040
different things from one command line utility.

1068
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:10,920
Sounds nice.

1069
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,960
That's really what I'd love to see.

1070
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,800
But I also, at the same time, I really

1071
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,000
appreciate what a tricky position that

1072
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,240
would be for Canonical to come along and be like,

1073
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,700
here's a replacement for apt.

1074
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,760
Because every keyboard commentator on the internet

1075
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,400
would be like, oh, what's the matter?

1076
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,400
Apt isn't good enough?

1077
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,840
Not invented here, Canonical?

1078
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,340
You know, there'd be no winning.

1079
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:29,840
Right.

1080
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,840
It's sort of a hard flip side about Ubuntu.

1081
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,960
One of things I love about it is how pragmatic it

1082
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,720
feels as an operating system.

1083
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,400
But at the same time, yeah, going back,

1084
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,400
especially every time I'm on Fedora,

1085
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,000
using apt again is just not as pleasant.

1086
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,120
What's Neon using?

1087
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,480
Neon has replaced apt.

1088
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,460
Well, not replaced it, but has something

1089
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,080
that sits on top of package kit, right?

1090
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,320
Pecan or whatever it is?

1091
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,040
Yeah, you use package kit to make sure everything updates.

1092
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,800
I don't love that.

1093
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,760
It's not as great.

1094
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,640
I'd love to really see that addressed.

1095
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,560
So funny about that, Gustavo Niemeyer

1096
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,680
actually moved to Canonical from Mandriva

1097
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,080
because they were considering replacing apt for smart.

1098
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,720
Because smart supported running on both Debian systems

1099
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,240
and RPM systems, he wrote it to replace apt

1100
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,400
because he hated working on the apt code base

1101
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,000
and the frustrations of working with Debian upstream

1102
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,560
and trying to integrate the RPM back end into the upstream

1103
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,000
apt project back then.

1104
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,480
So the whole point of him being at Canonical initially

1105
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,700
was that they were going to replace apt with smart,

1106
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,640
and then they didn't do it for, well, you

1107
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,120
can guess the reason why they didn't do it.

1108
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,720
You kind of mentioned it already.

1109
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,560
And there's some irony in it because one

1110
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,160
of the things that really took Linux to the next level for me

1111
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:50,040
where I was like, oh, this is way better, was actually apt.

1112
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,440
I mean, Red Hat I started with, but when I actually

1113
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,560
put a Debian box into production and it

1114
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,280
was self-resolving dependencies and apt-get-update

1115
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,820
and apt-get-upgrade were so awesome back in the day

1116
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,500
when you were using RPM distros that

1117
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,540
installed their RPMs from CDs.

1118
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,800
It was really a game changer.

1119
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,640
And now here I am at the end of 2019,

1120
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,040
and I'm the guy that's saying, I think it's time to replace apt.

1121
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,160
And of course, obviously, because it's my fantasy wish

1122
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,160
list, this is a unicorn package manager,

1123
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,400
it would have the speed of Pac-Man

1124
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:26,040
with the endurance and efficiency and safety of DNF,

1125
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,640
but with the speed and efficiency of something

1126
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,760
like Pac-Man with the AUR.

1127
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,760
And the transactional kind of rollbacks

1128
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,520
that you could get with ZFS.

1129
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,160
Yes.

1130
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:36,800
There we go.

1131
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,760
Yes, exactly.

1132
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,880
So there you have it.

1133
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,280
That's what I would change, but otherwise, gosh darn it,

1134
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,800
it's my favorite freaking operating system.

1135
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,400
And we just sat here, and I just feel

1136
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,240
like I got to learn a little bit about everybody else, too.

1137
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,760
We'd love to hear your thoughts, too.

1138
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,080
Let us know what you love about your distro

1139
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,160
or what you'd change.

1140
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,920
linuxunplug.com slash contact, linuxunplug.com slash subscribe.

1141
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,840
And don't forget about that new live time we're trying out.

1142
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,840
It's now noon JB time, which is Seattle time,

1143
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,680
which is Pacific time.

1144
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,200
Time is a construct.

1145
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,000
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

1146
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,560
to get it in your local construct.

1147
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,960
Thanks so much for being here.

1148
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,880
We'll see you right back here.

1149
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,840
Not on Monday, not on Sunday, not on Friday.

1150
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,320
Oh, no.

1151
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:19,920
No, no.

1152
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,280
But on Tuesday!

1153
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:50,280
And we'll see you right back here.

1154
00:54:50,280 --> 00:55:04,000
All right, JBtitles.com, let's go boat.

1155
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,360
And in the meantime, Neil, why don't you

1156
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,960
step into the Linux millionaire seat?

1157
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,680
Oh, yeah.

1158
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,680
Are you ready, sir?

1159
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,440
I guess.

1160
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,640
For fake internet money that's worth absolutely nothing,

1161
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:23,280
Neil, when was Richard Stallman born?

1162
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,080
Now hold on, I'll give you a couple choices.

1163
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,800
You got a couple choices here.

1164
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,920
You ready?

1165
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:38,360
February 20, 1955, April 13, 1960, or March 16, 1953.

1166
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,520
March 16, 1953.

1167
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,120
Is that your final answer, sir?

1168
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,120
Yes.

1169
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,400
All right, locking that in.

1170
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:47,900
Sure.

1171
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,520
You are correct.

1172
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,640
You nailed it, Neil.

1173
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,600
You nailed it.

1174
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,160
Good job.

1175
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:57,480
All right.

1176
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,160
Nicely done.

1177
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,320
You're stepping up, then you're going up in the difficulty here.

1178
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:07,840
Now, for $1,000 of fake internet money that doesn't matter,

1179
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:17,880
how do you save and exit a vi session, or a vi session, colon w, colon x,

1180
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:25,000
or colon wq, or shift zz?

1181
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,320
Colon x.

1182
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,720
Final answer?

1183
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,240
Yes.

1184
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,600
The answer is don't use vi.

1185
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,960
Well done.

1186
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,480
All right.

1187
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,400
And then, oh, it tells you how to quit.

1188
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,920
All right, here we go.

1189
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,800
We're going up in difficulty now.

1190
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,240
Now, see, we have a whole bunch of questions that

1191
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,280
have been submitted by the audience.

1192
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,840
We should put the link out again soon.

1193
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,280
This is pretty great.

1194
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,240
So we're going off of a list that the audience has submitted.

1195
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,680
So I do have to mention that the answers are also from the audience.

1196
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:05,120
But, Neil, for $5,000 of fake internet money,

1197
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:11,320
when was version 0.01 of the Linux kernel released?

1198
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:23,720
November 23, 1991, January 5, 1992, September 17, 1991,

1199
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:28,200
or November 17, 1991?

1200
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,280
September 17, 1991.

1201
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,640
Ooh, you sound pretty confident.

1202
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,720
Is that your final answer?

1203
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,240
Naturally.

1204
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,440
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner right here.

1205
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,080
Neil, congratulations, sir.

1206
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,040
$5,000 winner of fake internet points.

1207
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,200
I think you got everyone right.

1208
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,840
So you are now our reigning champion of a game show that we don't,

1209
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,480
when nobody else has played.

1210
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,200
Well, the funny thing, I like the Vim question,

1211
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,200
because there were two correct answers in there.

1212
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,160
Yeah, that's true.

1213
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,800
I think there were three correct answers.

1214
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,360
The only one that was like, shift-z-z.

1215
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,360
It was like, OK, now we've got to throw that in.

1216
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,680
Yeah, shift-z-z.

1217
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,920
You said write and then quit.

1218
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,760
So colon W is wrong.

1219
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,240
It's true.

1220
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:20,720
That's true.

1221
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,080
Colon W is wrong.

1222
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,200
I did just drop the link there for the form into the IRC.

1223
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,960
So feel free to jump on there and fill it out.

1224
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,600
Do it.

1225
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,720
We need your brain, Neil.

1226
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,040
All right, so I don't, as a small update on my ARCH system here.

1227
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,000
I don't have it fixed yet, although there's

1228
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,920
lots of information out there.

1229
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,840
But I'm only 644 packages behind, so not the worst.

1230
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,200
I did a distro sync using DNF of my Tumbleweed machine

1231
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,360
while I was talking about Tumbleweed.

1232
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,560
And it just finished, and I just rebooted into it.

1233
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,320
It's like, oh, yeah, I hadn't updated since July.

1234
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,080
And I just pulled into the November one,

1235
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,360
and everything came out fine.

1236
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,440
Oh, good.

1237
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,560
Well, that's nice.

1238
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,840
Yeah, that does feel good.
