WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.780
There hasn't been a version since March 11th, 2017,

00:02.780 --> 00:05.840
but today, well, a couple days ago,

00:05.840 --> 00:10.720
WindowMaker 0.95.9 was released.

00:10.720 --> 00:13.080
And you remember Next, that Next desktop?

00:13.080 --> 00:16.360
Yeah, I mean, from ages ago, before Apple got good?

00:16.360 --> 00:19.080
Yeah.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.160
Gigi, you were just shopping Next boxes, weren't you?

00:21.160 --> 00:25.040
Yeah, so I was, after reading the new update

00:25.040 --> 00:27.560
for WindowMaker, which, when are they gonna hit 1.0?

00:27.560 --> 00:28.700
That's gonna be an amazing release.

00:28.700 --> 00:31.760
But I was looking at old Next machines

00:31.760 --> 00:37.200
and $800 on eBay for a full Next station right now.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.920
Did you catch the age or the vintage of that machine?

00:39.920 --> 00:42.960
1991 was the release date of that machine.

00:42.960 --> 00:48.800
25 megahertz, Motorola 80, I forgot the exact CPU,

00:48.800 --> 00:50.840
but yeah, 25 megahertz.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.200
25 megahertz.

00:52.200 --> 00:56.000
Originally sold for $5,000.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.120
That's a steal of a deal, man.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.040
I think you gotta get it.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.920
I wonder if you could run Linux on that thing.

00:59.920 --> 01:10.920
Oh, hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk

01:10.920 --> 01:11.420
show.

01:11.420 --> 01:12.080
My name is Chris.

01:12.080 --> 01:12.840
My name is Wes.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.600
Hey there, Wes.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.200
Hello.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.700
We have a really fun episode today.

01:15.700 --> 01:19.880
We're hanging out with some killers, some memory killers.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.400
So you've probably heard the term out of memory manager,

01:22.400 --> 01:24.980
and you've probably also heard that Linux isn't always

01:24.980 --> 01:27.200
that great in a low memory situation.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.840
And you might wonder why, because one

01:28.840 --> 01:30.800
of the very first things I learned about Linux

01:30.800 --> 01:33.180
is that kernel will start to kill processes to survive,

01:33.180 --> 01:34.960
and I thought that was so cool.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.920
But it seems like it's used so sparingly.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.360
And if you're on the desktop and you run out of memory,

01:39.360 --> 01:42.760
you get in a 10% memory zone, you'll

01:42.760 --> 01:45.320
notice that your desktop just starts to thrash

01:45.320 --> 01:48.640
and sometimes never really fully recovers until you reboot.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.840
Yeah, I've certainly been there, right?

01:50.840 --> 01:52.780
You see the mouse move every once in a while,

01:52.780 --> 01:55.480
but ultimately you just have to hold the power button down.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.400
And you're thinking, I'm sitting here

01:57.400 --> 02:00.880
on a supercomputer-grade operating system,

02:00.880 --> 02:02.040
and this is happening.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.400
What the heck?

02:03.400 --> 02:06.520
Well, one of the first projects to try to solve this

02:06.520 --> 02:08.960
will be Fedora, on the desktop at least.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.040
There's lots of solutions, but Fedora

02:11.040 --> 02:13.720
is one of the first distros to ship something

02:13.720 --> 02:17.780
enabled by default. It's called Early Out of Memory Manager,

02:17.780 --> 02:19.520
and we'll talk about it in a little bit.

02:19.520 --> 02:23.880
And we've set up two boxes, a Fedora 31 box and a Fedora 32

02:23.880 --> 02:25.240
preview box.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.680
We're going to slam them into low memory conditions,

02:27.680 --> 02:30.200
absolutely punish them, and we'll

02:30.200 --> 02:33.560
show you how Fedora 32 handles that situation a lot

02:33.560 --> 02:36.120
better than 31 does.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.240
It's kind of exciting.

02:37.240 --> 02:37.800
You like this?

02:37.800 --> 02:39.240
This is a real-world improvement,

02:39.240 --> 02:42.000
and the nice part is it's all enabled by default in 32,

02:42.000 --> 02:43.160
so you don't have to do anything.

02:43.160 --> 02:43.760
Nope.

02:43.760 --> 02:46.960
And so I loaded up a 31 machine over here.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.240
Wes has a 32 machine over there.

02:49.240 --> 02:52.000
We've come up with the same way to stress them at the same time,

02:52.000 --> 02:53.760
and then it'll just be a versus, and we'll

02:53.760 --> 02:55.200
see how 32 and 31 compare.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.680
I know which one I'd rather have.

02:56.680 --> 02:57.720
That'll be in a little bit.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.440
We'll also have some community news and some housekeeping,

03:00.440 --> 03:02.160
but before we get to any of that,

03:02.160 --> 03:03.920
I'm going to say hello to Alex and Cheezy.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.200
How are you guys doing?

03:05.200 --> 03:06.560
Hello, internet friends.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.080
How are you?

03:07.080 --> 03:08.240
Hello, hello.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.960
I forgot my water, Wes.

03:09.960 --> 03:10.960
Wes, I forgot.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.800
Wes, will you do me a favor and grab my water?

03:13.800 --> 03:14.520
Thank you.

03:14.520 --> 03:15.960
And while you do that, I will say

03:15.960 --> 03:18.000
time-appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.160
Hello, Mumble Room.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.560
Hello, Mumble Room.

03:20.560 --> 03:21.060
Hey, hey.

03:21.060 --> 03:21.560
Hello.

03:21.560 --> 03:22.680
Bienvenido.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.360
Hello.

03:23.360 --> 03:23.880
Hello.

03:23.880 --> 03:27.040
I hope you stay.

03:27.040 --> 03:27.640
Got it in there.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.280
We got 21 people on air today, and 35 people total.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.800
We'll sum up in the Quiet Listening.

03:32.800 --> 03:33.920
Thank you, Wes.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.120
I got to drink the water during the show,

03:35.120 --> 03:36.640
or else my mouth sounds really annoying,

03:36.640 --> 03:38.800
and then people have to listen to me smacking my lips.

03:38.800 --> 03:39.920
And Joe will complain.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.080
There's that, too.

03:41.080 --> 03:44.160
All right, well, before we get to abusing our Fedora installs,

03:44.160 --> 03:46.160
let's cover some community news.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.360
Besides WindowMaker, there are other things happening.

03:49.360 --> 03:52.320
Microsoft has announced essentially its own version

03:52.320 --> 03:53.660
of SE Linux.

03:53.660 --> 03:56.600
You're probably familiar with the LSM, the Linux Security

03:56.600 --> 03:57.100
Module.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.440
You have things like AppArmor, SE Linux.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.960
And there's others, actually, I wasn't really aware of.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.480
But like everything in Linux.

04:03.480 --> 04:04.600
Once you make it a module, people

04:04.600 --> 04:05.760
are going to write modules.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.840
And there's multiple versions of something.

04:07.840 --> 04:12.080
So Microsoft's is named the Integrity Policy Enforcement,

04:12.080 --> 04:15.020
or IPE for short, as they like to say.

04:15.020 --> 04:17.360
And it is indeed a full-fledged LSM,

04:17.360 --> 04:19.440
which is an optional add-on for Linux kernels.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.160
It's not necessarily mandatory.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.080
It's if you want these security features.

04:23.080 --> 04:26.040
According to the docs just released on Monday,

04:26.040 --> 04:29.360
IPE is Microsoft's attempt to solve the code integrity

04:29.360 --> 04:31.080
problem for Linux.

04:31.080 --> 04:34.760
Mostly because they deploy a whole bunch of Linux on Azure,

04:34.760 --> 04:36.560
they want to make sure it's secure.

04:36.560 --> 04:37.520
Go figure.

04:37.520 --> 04:39.920
So on Linux systems where IPE is enabled,

04:39.920 --> 04:43.200
system administrators can create a list of binaries

04:43.200 --> 04:44.760
that are allowed to execute.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.520
And then they can add verification attributes

04:47.520 --> 04:49.880
to the kernel that can check each binary before allowing

04:49.880 --> 04:50.360
it to run.

04:50.360 --> 04:53.160
Little things it needs to make sure of per binary.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.160
And if the binary has been altered by an attacker,

04:55.160 --> 04:57.560
well, then IPE can just block the execution

04:57.560 --> 04:59.720
of that malicious code altogether.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.840
If that sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through,

05:01.840 --> 05:04.320
well, Microsoft says IPE is not intended

05:04.320 --> 05:06.040
for general purpose computing.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.920
The IPE LSM, say that twice, was designed

05:08.920 --> 05:12.480
for a very specific use case where security is paramount.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.920
And administrators need to be in full control

05:14.920 --> 05:16.260
of what runs on their systems.

05:16.260 --> 05:17.840
And that's where you want to start

05:17.840 --> 05:20.600
monitoring every single executable that runs.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.440
Examples of this include things like embedded systems, maybe

05:23.440 --> 05:26.120
like your network firewall running in Azure,

05:26.120 --> 05:28.780
or Linux servers running strict and immutable configurations

05:28.780 --> 05:30.720
where you need to verify and make sure really

05:30.720 --> 05:32.920
that nothing changes once you've deployed it.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.520
I have pretty good faith that Microsoft could pull something

05:35.520 --> 05:37.240
like this off overall.

05:37.240 --> 05:40.240
And like SE Linux, they have a permissive mode

05:40.240 --> 05:41.240
and an enforce mode.

05:41.240 --> 05:44.200
So you could put it in permissive, log what breaks,

05:44.200 --> 05:46.840
and then try to fix that before you turn it on.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.640
I'm curious to what just your off the top reaction

05:49.640 --> 05:52.040
is to Microsoft creating essentially an SE Linux

05:52.040 --> 05:52.840
alternative.

05:52.840 --> 05:55.240
Yeah, it's interesting to see them working at scale

05:55.240 --> 05:55.760
like this.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.320
I mean, they have a lot of experience with enterprises

05:58.320 --> 05:59.680
and also working with governments

05:59.680 --> 06:01.400
where you have a lot of strict controls

06:01.400 --> 06:03.160
that you have to meet.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.560
Clearly, none of the other systems

06:04.560 --> 06:07.960
allowed them to really target exactly the certain use cases

06:07.960 --> 06:09.320
and scenarios that they had.

06:09.320 --> 06:12.400
So it's kind of great to see them contributing this backup

06:12.400 --> 06:14.280
in a way that surely other systems are

06:14.280 --> 06:15.100
going to be able to use.

06:15.100 --> 06:15.640
Right.

06:15.640 --> 06:16.640
I'm going to go with that.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.960
But I really don't know what to make of it.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.680
I hate the not invented here stuff.

06:20.680 --> 06:21.760
But at the same time, I have faith

06:21.760 --> 06:22.960
that Microsoft is probably pretty

06:22.960 --> 06:24.600
familiar with their deployment scenarios

06:24.600 --> 06:26.160
and deems this necessary.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.540
And they're not going to just go off and create something

06:27.540 --> 06:28.840
that's not necessary.

06:28.840 --> 06:31.220
And I mean, we already had multiple versions

06:31.220 --> 06:32.920
right of Map Armor and SE Linux.

06:32.920 --> 06:36.640
So you weren't really going to get your one true tool anyway.

06:36.640 --> 06:40.080
I took a kind of a quick look at what

06:40.080 --> 06:43.600
IPE is designed around.

06:43.600 --> 06:47.720
It seems to be very much oriented around.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.120
Your system essentially has to be immutable.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.920
It has to be paired with something like DM Verity.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.720
It has a lot of specific things that

06:57.720 --> 07:00.840
are very useful for embedded devices and things like that.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.880
But I also think that this is likely

07:02.880 --> 07:06.960
going to be structured as what's known as a minor LSM that

07:06.960 --> 07:10.000
can be stacked on top of a so-called major LSM,

07:10.000 --> 07:13.240
like SE Linux, for example, is a major LSM.

07:13.240 --> 07:17.440
So in the LSM framework, there are

07:17.440 --> 07:19.920
limited stacking capabilities.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.120
I know that Canonical has been pushing very hard for making

07:23.120 --> 07:25.640
what are so-called major LSMs to stack,

07:25.640 --> 07:28.240
like App Armor and SE Linux stacking on each other,

07:28.240 --> 07:31.060
aside of the complexity disaster that I personally

07:31.060 --> 07:32.320
think that will cause.

07:32.320 --> 07:36.520
And I also don't think anyone is going to reasonably be OK

07:36.520 --> 07:38.920
with such a configuration ever existing in production

07:38.920 --> 07:43.920
because it would make it a total nightmare to debug and analyze.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.440
Minor LSM stacking on top of major LSMs

07:47.440 --> 07:51.760
is actually quite common, like Yama on top of SE Linux

07:51.760 --> 07:54.680
or SMAC or App Armor and things like that.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.880
So I think we will see that things that

07:57.880 --> 08:00.600
need to exist within the LSM framework that support

08:00.600 --> 08:05.160
very specific use cases, if they aren't considered quote unquote

08:05.160 --> 08:09.120
major and are considered complementary to the major LSMs,

08:09.120 --> 08:12.520
which at this point are SE Linux, App Armor, and SMAC,

08:12.520 --> 08:16.080
we'll probably see this be used actually

08:16.080 --> 08:18.240
in more than just the embedded space.

08:18.240 --> 08:21.280
It seems like a pretty streamlined, minimal approach

08:21.280 --> 08:22.640
right now as well.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.880
So you could see adoption there.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.580
I want to just bring up another story that is probably somewhat

08:28.580 --> 08:29.740
applicable to our audience.

08:29.740 --> 08:31.400
This isn't getting a lot of coverage.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.280
It's getting covered in a couple of places.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.920
I'm hoping WRT has a pretty important security advisory.

08:36.920 --> 08:38.840
Essentially, the short version is

08:38.840 --> 08:41.280
there was a flaw that caused the package manager to ignore

08:41.280 --> 08:46.480
the SHA256 checksums embedded in the signed repository index.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.520
In other words, effectively bypassing

08:48.520 --> 08:52.040
integrity checking of the downloaded.ipk artifacts.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.280
Not good.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.160
Obviously, very easy for an attacker

08:55.160 --> 08:58.480
to exploit that if they could just put up a bogus package.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.440
So worth an update.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.800
Now I wanted to bring it up here because I'm

09:02.800 --> 09:06.400
curious if the Mumba Room or Cheese or Alex or yourself,

09:06.400 --> 09:09.120
Wes, if you guys are still using OpenWRT,

09:09.120 --> 09:13.640
if you're using something else, is OpenWRT still the project

09:13.640 --> 09:15.920
to go with for these kind of jobs?

09:15.920 --> 09:18.760
Somebody want to educate me because just kind of re-looking

09:18.760 --> 09:20.480
at my setup at home.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.560
And I would love to have a Linux operating system

09:22.560 --> 09:25.760
that I could put on a piece of hardware.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.040
So I'd love to not have to run a full-fledged machine

09:28.040 --> 09:29.640
if I can avoid it.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.600
And I'd just like to have a dynamic DNS server.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.520
I'd like to have a little firewall capability.

09:33.520 --> 09:38.440
I'd love to have a WireGuard VPN UI.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.080
Is OpenWRT the way to go?

09:40.080 --> 09:43.420
The juggernaut in this space is PFSense.

09:43.420 --> 09:47.780
And I think most people will kind of make that trade-off

09:47.780 --> 09:49.120
that, OK, it's not Linux.

09:49.120 --> 09:52.120
It's BSD instead, based on.

09:52.120 --> 09:55.240
But it's been the go-to for people

09:55.240 --> 09:57.120
looking to solve that and scratch that itch

09:57.120 --> 09:58.640
that you've just mentioned.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.840
You want something that's open source,

10:00.840 --> 10:03.920
is free, is really flexible, has all the power

10:03.920 --> 10:06.840
of the enterprise, can do multiple WANs.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.800
It can do dynamic DNS.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.760
Now, PFSense can't yet do WireGuard,

10:11.760 --> 10:13.600
which actually about two months ago

10:13.600 --> 10:17.200
led me to switch to something called OpenSense.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.080
There was a whole bunch of licensing drama,

10:19.080 --> 10:23.000
which Wes and Jim covered in great detail on TechSnap

10:23.000 --> 10:25.760
around PFSense, which led OpenSense

10:25.760 --> 10:27.760
to come into existence.

10:27.760 --> 10:31.400
And I've actually found it to be quite a nice little upgrade.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.680
I think we'll talk more about that on self-hosted, too,

10:33.680 --> 10:35.240
because I will try that one.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.800
There are various similar sort of solutions based on Linux,

10:37.800 --> 10:40.120
like IPFire is one that comes to mind.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.200
But I just roll myself on Linux.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.840
I know you know how to run DNS mask,

10:43.840 --> 10:45.520
so you can get a lot of that stuff

10:45.520 --> 10:48.360
if you're willing to set up the config files yourself.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.040
So legitimately have been considering that.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.480
It's less work than you think.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.080
I know a lot of people that just have

10:53.080 --> 10:56.700
a bunch of random IP tables rules on their Linux box,

10:56.700 --> 10:59.560
and then they say, yeah, that's good enough to be my firewall.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.560
Personally, I don't object to having a firewall with a UI

11:02.560 --> 11:04.480
so I can see what is easily available

11:04.480 --> 11:07.200
and what isn't available.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.880
But Brent and I actually recorded an extras not long ago

11:09.880 --> 11:12.640
talking about his setup and how you separate Wi-Fi

11:12.640 --> 11:15.120
from the firewall, all that kind of stuff.

11:15.120 --> 11:18.400
And he's still running, I think, Tomato

11:18.400 --> 11:23.700
as a version of DDWRT on some 10-year-old embedded thing.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.080
So something that Alex and I want

11:25.080 --> 11:28.040
to focus on for a couple of episodes in Self-Hosted,

11:28.040 --> 11:29.480
starting with next week's episode,

11:29.480 --> 11:33.400
is some of the basics of fundamental good networking,

11:33.400 --> 11:35.240
fundamentally getting good, strong Wi-Fi

11:35.240 --> 11:37.440
throughout your entire place, that kind of stuff.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.680
So check out Self-Hosted for that.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.600
Now, Colonel, you're a daily driver, if you'll allow it,

11:41.600 --> 11:43.440
of OpenWRT?

11:43.440 --> 11:48.160
Yeah, so I run the OpenWRT for friends and family,

11:48.160 --> 11:51.720
because trying to slot in an actual real router

11:51.720 --> 11:54.720
or something like a PF Sense scares the dickens out of them.

11:54.720 --> 12:00.060
They want that little consumer-grade all-in-one unit.

12:00.060 --> 12:02.460
And so for them, I put that on there

12:02.460 --> 12:04.400
because it's more secure and easier

12:04.400 --> 12:08.160
to manage than half a dozen different types of web

12:08.160 --> 12:09.440
UIs and all this other.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.880
And they just like it better.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.000
One of the things that I think you have to consider

12:14.000 --> 12:19.120
is that a lot of these smaller devices and less power-hungry

12:19.120 --> 12:24.640
devices are going to be running an embedded OpenWRT, DDWRT

12:24.640 --> 12:29.600
tomato or various different projects out there.

12:29.600 --> 12:35.000
In fact, the GL Inet Slate that you have runs OpenWRT

12:35.000 --> 12:38.280
and, as you know, has WireGuard built in.

12:38.280 --> 12:43.080
The GL Inet, I think it's the MT300 that I have,

12:43.080 --> 12:48.400
it's the baby brother to yours, also runs OpenWRT.

12:48.400 --> 12:51.960
And a lot of the Netgear Nighthawk routers

12:51.960 --> 12:55.560
support OpenWRT straight down the box.

12:55.560 --> 12:56.080
Oh, really?

12:56.080 --> 12:57.920
I didn't know that.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.000
I think it's one of those things that depends on the level

13:01.000 --> 13:02.080
of security.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.040
I mean, the way that I've always felt about it

13:04.040 --> 13:08.280
is that if you really want all the configurations, everything

13:08.280 --> 13:10.400
at your fingertips, then go with PFSense.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.800
If you want something that's a little more consumer-grade

13:13.800 --> 13:18.600
nicer generally than your manufacturer's UI,

13:18.600 --> 13:22.200
then go with something like OpenWRT.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.520
And you get a slew of packages.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.200
There's a ton of stuff available there.

13:25.200 --> 13:29.400
I mean, if you wanted to set up an IRC server on your router,

13:29.400 --> 13:30.040
you could.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.840
Well, like you said, I have it on the Slate.

13:31.840 --> 13:35.960
And I really just think it's the perfect spot for OpenWRT

13:35.960 --> 13:40.400
because they have provided a bit of a skin average user

13:40.400 --> 13:43.600
GUI that just shows you if you're on a Wi-Fi connection,

13:43.600 --> 13:45.640
if you're on a Wi-Fi, if you're repeating LAN.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.680
Because it's kind of designed as a travel router

13:47.680 --> 13:50.080
that you'd take with you to a hotel or something.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.200
And so it has a really nice GUI that just gives you

13:52.200 --> 13:54.120
that status and where you can program

13:54.120 --> 13:55.960
what the button on the side of the case does.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.920
And you can give it all these kinds of functions

13:57.920 --> 13:59.920
like initiate and close a WireGuard VPN

13:59.920 --> 14:01.880
by just clicking a button on the side of the case.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.560
You can assign it to a function, which is neat.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.320
Then they have the advanced UI, where you can actually

14:07.320 --> 14:11.680
manage interfaces and see data about what's being transferred.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.480
And then on top of that, you can also terminal into it.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.240
They have a web UI, or you can just turn on SSH.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.760
And then, yeah, you're essentially on a Linux system.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.760
It does feel limited.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.400
It does feel like I would like something

14:22.400 --> 14:23.600
a little more advanced.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.880
But at the same time, I was concerned

14:26.880 --> 14:27.980
I would not be able to use the Slate

14:27.980 --> 14:30.400
as a full-time, quote unquote, router.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.920
But it has been totally fine.

14:31.920 --> 14:34.080
And OpenWRT works great on there.

14:34.080 --> 14:35.960
But it's a very unmanaged version of it.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.400
It's not something I'm maintaining, really,

14:37.400 --> 14:39.920
other than just doing OEM updates.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.960
So is that something that you use primarily

14:41.960 --> 14:45.640
for LadyJuice connections when you're on the road, or like?

14:45.640 --> 14:46.460
All the time.

14:46.460 --> 14:49.280
It's always it picks and chooses between the best.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.520
Sometimes I have to coax it.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.140
It could be a little better at that.

14:52.140 --> 14:54.480
But at my home base, I have an ethernet connection.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.960
And then when I'm on the road, I'm

14:55.960 --> 14:58.920
either on Wi-Fi or some Wi-Fi somewhere.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.920
And I can pick and choose between them.

15:00.920 --> 15:04.560
But what's nice is the LAN IPs, everything behind the net

15:04.560 --> 15:06.280
always stays the same.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.480
Nice and simple.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.380
It's just the external connection that changes.

15:09.380 --> 15:11.960
And the devices on the LAN are none the smarter.

15:11.960 --> 15:15.280
What I like that you can toggle features super easily.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.880
So if you wanted to, say, do DNS over TLS or something

15:17.880 --> 15:20.880
like that, it's literally just flick a switch in the UI,

15:20.880 --> 15:23.280
and you're off and running that.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.120
So it's great.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.400
It does make that really easy.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.680
And it was really easy to just sort of get in there

15:27.680 --> 15:31.400
and turn off the DNS stuff when I wanted to go with PyHole.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.440
All that's very simple.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.160
One thing I want you to investigate,

15:35.160 --> 15:36.960
this is self-hosted show research,

15:36.960 --> 15:38.360
but one thing I want to investigate

15:38.360 --> 15:41.320
is site-to-site WireGuard VPNs from the slate

15:41.320 --> 15:43.720
to an OpenSense instance.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.800
Now, I used OpenVPN from PFSense to PFSense

15:46.800 --> 15:49.360
for a couple of years, and that worked really, really well.

15:49.360 --> 15:52.640
I haven't yet managed to have two OpenSense systems

15:52.640 --> 15:54.020
to do a site-to-site.

15:54.020 --> 15:57.120
So I'd be curious to get your take on that, Chris.

15:57.120 --> 16:00.080
Wonder how it would do that behind the double-grade net,

16:00.080 --> 16:03.360
the double-enterprise-grade carrier-grade net.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.900
Maybe if I had a droplet in between that

16:05.900 --> 16:09.760
did like the go-between, so I WireGuard out from the RV

16:09.760 --> 16:11.640
behind the double-carrier-grade net

16:11.640 --> 16:14.040
into the digital ocean droplet,

16:14.040 --> 16:15.680
and then the digital ocean droplet connects

16:15.680 --> 16:18.240
into the other land that I'm bridging to.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.440
I don't know, there's probably a way I could do it.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.820
Some sort of network tomfoolery.

16:21.820 --> 16:22.660
We'll figure it out.

16:22.660 --> 16:24.020
We did deep dive at one time,

16:24.020 --> 16:28.020
and that double net really is a complicator

16:28.020 --> 16:29.320
for that kind of stuff.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.160
It's just tricky.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.120
Sometimes it works when you're lucky.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.080
It's gosh-darn tricky.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.440
Even software that's designed to get around double nets

16:36.440 --> 16:39.480
still sometimes with that double-carrier-grade net

16:39.480 --> 16:40.900
still has issues.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.260
That's how you gotta say it, too.

16:42.260 --> 16:45.760
All right, it's time for a little housekeeping here

16:45.760 --> 16:47.880
on the old Unplugged podcast.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.320
Keep things fresh, keep you informed on what's going on.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.720
You know, you gotta clean yourself from time to time

16:52.720 --> 16:53.960
for you guys, you know.

16:53.960 --> 16:58.960
First and foremost, check out the recent Brunch with Brent.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.160
Daniel Foray, the founder of Elementary OS,

17:01.160 --> 17:03.600
sits down with Brent for brunch,

17:03.600 --> 17:06.880
and it was a really great Linux origin story.

17:06.880 --> 17:09.440
It's fantastic, so definitely go check that out.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.060
You can find that at extras.show.

17:12.060 --> 17:14.120
Slash 68, is it, Wes?

17:14.120 --> 17:15.640
I'm gonna say 68.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.360
Going once, yes, got it right.

17:17.360 --> 17:19.700
Ha ha ha, pretty great.

17:19.700 --> 17:23.560
You know, rumor has it, there's a lot of great brunches now.

17:24.420 --> 17:26.080
You could probably just go there

17:26.080 --> 17:28.480
and click on that brunch tag and see them all.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.840
That sounds like a nice way, yeah.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.400
You know you wanna escape the world outside?

17:33.400 --> 17:35.280
Have some brunch, just continuous brunch

17:35.280 --> 17:36.680
for several days in a row.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.000
I liked it so much I slapped my leg.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.560
I went, yeah, slapping my leg, Wes.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.400
Yee-haw, woo, woo.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.740
Now you know we do this here show live.

17:43.740 --> 17:45.820
We've got a great mumble room,

17:45.820 --> 17:47.000
and we're all hanging out here

17:47.000 --> 17:50.620
having ourselves a virtual lug, and you can be part of it.

17:50.620 --> 17:54.580
If you're like me, you're not actually making it to a lug.

17:54.580 --> 17:55.840
You know it'd probably be good for you,

17:55.840 --> 17:57.720
but you're not going, you know.

17:57.720 --> 17:58.600
Sometimes they're not near.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.960
Sometimes you got a couple options

17:59.960 --> 18:00.800
and you're still not going.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.960
Like Wes and I, we have options and we still don't go.

18:02.960 --> 18:03.780
We should go.

18:03.780 --> 18:07.900
About twice a year, I might go to one.

18:08.860 --> 18:10.480
But usually it's not one that's in my neighborhood.

18:10.480 --> 18:15.020
So it's, anyways, I'm getting off.

18:15.020 --> 18:15.860
I had too many Red Bulls.

18:15.860 --> 18:16.860
Lugs can be hard.

18:16.860 --> 18:17.700
It is, that's what I'm trying to say.

18:17.700 --> 18:18.860
When you have to meet in meet space

18:18.860 --> 18:20.860
because you gotta like take the time and get there.

18:20.860 --> 18:21.940
And here we are, look at this.

18:21.940 --> 18:25.340
We're hanging out with 37 other Linux users right now.

18:25.340 --> 18:26.560
37 other Linux users.

18:26.560 --> 18:27.860
And the thing is is we're all chatting

18:27.860 --> 18:29.420
in between the shows.

18:29.420 --> 18:31.340
You know like maybe we had to take a break

18:31.340 --> 18:32.380
a couple of minutes ago

18:32.380 --> 18:34.420
because we got disconnected from a couple of people.

18:34.420 --> 18:36.220
So we're just chatting.

18:36.220 --> 18:37.260
I mean, you could be part of that.

18:37.260 --> 18:38.260
It really is, it's great.

18:38.260 --> 18:40.120
It's good for the Linux soul.

18:40.120 --> 18:44.520
We do this show live, jblive.tv on Tuesdays, 2 p.m.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.900
Nope, it's been a little while.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.700
Noon, Pacific.

18:47.700 --> 18:48.660
But you can get that converted

18:48.660 --> 18:51.220
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

18:51.220 --> 18:52.740
You can also find that Mumble Room info

18:52.740 --> 18:56.340
if you just go Google search Jupiter Colony Mumble.

18:56.340 --> 18:58.980
Or if you get in the IRC room, you can do Bang Mumble.

18:58.980 --> 18:59.980
That makes it easy.

18:59.980 --> 19:03.640
I just mentioned that because we'd love to see you.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.640
Also, the conversation continues after the show

19:05.640 --> 19:08.420
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash telegram.

19:08.420 --> 19:09.920
How we doing on numbers there, cheese?

19:09.920 --> 19:11.800
Do we get, we're over 1,700 now?

19:11.800 --> 19:15.080
Yeah, we're like 1,736 I think was the last.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.480
No, it's slowed, it's slowed.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.680
It slowed a little bit, but 1,700 people.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.000
I've never asked the number.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.600
I've never cared.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.400
But then I got this stupid idea of getting it to 2,000.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.220
And now I care.

19:26.220 --> 19:27.120
It's stuck in your head.

19:27.120 --> 19:27.960
It's dumb.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.120
We will get there.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.680
You're not gonna hear me stop complaining about it

19:30.680 --> 19:31.560
till it gets to 2,000.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.400
So let's just get it over with.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.780
Please, for my sake.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.400
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash telegram.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.560
Get over there and get involved.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.940
You know, you get links to stuff, you know?

19:41.940 --> 19:43.620
You can talk to Wes Payne in there probably,

19:43.620 --> 19:45.720
you know, if he's around.

19:45.720 --> 19:46.560
Sure can.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.920
Just make sure you add him at really weird times.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.400
You're welcome, Wes.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.240
All right, that's all the house.

19:53.240 --> 19:54.080
I'm gonna get out of there

19:54.080 --> 19:56.280
before I wreck somebody else's day.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.540
Don't, don't add Wes at weird times.

19:58.540 --> 20:00.800
So I'm feeling a little silly

20:00.800 --> 20:02.660
because I just love this idea,

20:02.660 --> 20:05.840
thanks to Carl who suggested it in the post show last week.

20:05.840 --> 20:10.760
And that was just punishing the heck out of Fedora 32

20:10.760 --> 20:12.940
and seeing how it handles it differently

20:12.940 --> 20:14.920
than a Linux system in the past.

20:14.920 --> 20:19.920
Now, as you know, there is this out of memory manager

20:20.160 --> 20:21.520
that we've talked about, the OOM.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.560
And there's different, well, you may not know this part

20:23.560 --> 20:25.680
because I didn't know all of this until recently.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.040
There's many out of memory managers

20:28.040 --> 20:29.680
out there on the market.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.580
One created by Facebook, others created by other folks,

20:32.580 --> 20:35.560
ones that may be better for the desktop long-term.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.720
But easy, I'm sorry, early OOM

20:38.720 --> 20:41.560
is a very easy one to implement.

20:41.560 --> 20:42.760
So that's an easy way to remember that

20:42.760 --> 20:46.440
because early OOM is kind of a simple,

20:46.440 --> 20:49.600
straightforward out of memory manager

20:49.600 --> 20:53.400
that lives in user space versus kernel space.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.280
And that's a pretty significant differentiator

20:56.280 --> 20:59.920
because the kernel memory space killer,

20:59.920 --> 21:02.040
I don't know if I'm properly giving it

21:02.040 --> 21:06.080
full characterization, but it sort of has a bad reputation

21:06.080 --> 21:07.920
and it doesn't really get invoked

21:07.920 --> 21:10.360
until your system is already wrecked.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.800
Yeah, I mean, we've talked before on the show

21:11.800 --> 21:12.920
about Facebook's efforts.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.000
They actually have their own daemon to do this

21:15.000 --> 21:18.200
in user space and added some pressure stall metrics

21:18.200 --> 21:20.160
to the kernel to help that work.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.240
Early OOM does not take advantage of that,

21:22.240 --> 21:23.940
but it has a similar goal.

21:23.940 --> 21:25.720
It's basically, as Facebook acknowledged

21:25.720 --> 21:27.480
when they released their version,

21:28.720 --> 21:30.720
the in-kernel solution, it works sometimes,

21:30.720 --> 21:32.680
but we've all seen those situations.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.880
They've seen the situations where you have a live lock

21:34.880 --> 21:37.520
and your system, it is technically still doing work.

21:37.520 --> 21:39.520
It's swapping stuff back and forth from disk,

21:39.520 --> 21:41.760
but you're not gonna get anywhere.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.040
Yeah, we'll do a live demonstration in a moment.

21:44.040 --> 21:48.140
But the way early OOM or OOM works

21:48.140 --> 21:51.840
is if both your RAM and swap go below 10% free,

21:51.840 --> 21:54.680
then early OOM issues a SIG term to the process

21:54.680 --> 21:57.920
with the largest OOM score.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.720
So this must be something that the kernel is watching

22:00.720 --> 22:02.420
or that this is always watching the background

22:02.420 --> 22:04.960
and it's assigning certain weights to processes.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.120
Yeah, and you can also influence that

22:07.120 --> 22:08.300
both in the kernel version

22:08.300 --> 22:10.760
and then early OOM has its own config file.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.080
So if you wanna change that from 10% to maybe 5%

22:13.080 --> 22:13.960
or something like that,

22:13.960 --> 22:16.280
you can tune it separately for both RAM and swap.

22:16.280 --> 22:20.520
Yeah, now this is turned on by default now in Fedora 32,

22:20.520 --> 22:22.240
only for the workstation version.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.880
The other spins, you could turn it on.

22:24.880 --> 22:27.560
It's in the repo and it's just a,

22:27.560 --> 22:29.960
essentially a command to turn it on.

22:29.960 --> 22:31.880
And there are other options out there.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.760
So when Fedora 32 does release,

22:33.760 --> 22:35.260
you'll probably hear conversations about,

22:35.260 --> 22:37.560
well, why didn't they go with no hang?

22:37.560 --> 22:40.360
That's early OOM on steroids

22:40.360 --> 22:42.860
and it's got all these cool features or OOM or OOM,

22:42.860 --> 22:44.660
or why didn't they use the Facebook backed one?

22:44.660 --> 22:46.060
That's got the Facebook pockets.

22:46.060 --> 22:49.560
It's gonna be the most well-developed and financed one.

22:49.560 --> 22:50.800
So there'll be some debate

22:50.800 --> 22:52.520
about why they went with early OOM.

22:52.520 --> 22:55.560
But I think the simplest way to understand it

22:55.560 --> 22:59.560
is it's just very simple, it's stable, it's tiny,

22:59.560 --> 23:00.440
it's written in C,

23:00.440 --> 23:03.280
which is a good choice for like embedded systems

23:03.280 --> 23:04.600
that might have low memory.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.800
And it has a small set of dependencies

23:07.800 --> 23:09.680
and can work with much older kernels

23:09.680 --> 23:11.480
than a lot of these other killers.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.360
Yeah, I mean, so Facebook's the OMD,

23:14.360 --> 23:15.400
theirs looks very flexible.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.920
You can write plugins that execute your own custom code

23:17.920 --> 23:18.960
with hooks into the daemon

23:18.960 --> 23:21.440
to really configure how you want precise control

23:21.440 --> 23:22.760
over this application.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.080
That sounds like it would work really well

23:24.080 --> 23:25.400
for an application that you're designing

23:25.400 --> 23:27.420
and custom hosting yourself,

23:27.420 --> 23:29.540
but for a wide array of desktop uses.

23:29.540 --> 23:31.080
I mean, when I've been playing with it,

23:31.080 --> 23:33.160
the config file is just a few lines

23:33.160 --> 23:36.440
and it's basically just specifying the command line options.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.940
The system dunit file is very nicely documented

23:38.940 --> 23:40.680
and also sort of explains what's going on.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.600
So it'll take anyone who needs to mess with it

23:43.600 --> 23:44.760
all of a few minutes

23:44.760 --> 23:46.620
to understand exactly what's happening.

23:46.620 --> 23:48.560
I think if I was looking towards the future

23:48.560 --> 23:53.560
and I'm thinking about like the ultimate Linux workstation OS,

23:53.560 --> 23:55.320
it's something that has built-in snapshots

23:55.320 --> 23:57.040
and it's something that has one of these

23:57.040 --> 23:58.620
early memory killers.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.760
But I wonder if maybe my perfect scenario

24:01.760 --> 24:03.680
wouldn't be No Hang.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.680
Not only is it nice and configurable,

24:05.680 --> 24:07.480
but it seems like its real goal

24:07.480 --> 24:10.320
is to sort of preemptively keep your system responsive.

24:10.320 --> 24:13.120
So it sort of kicks in even sooner and a little smarter

24:13.120 --> 24:15.500
of following a certain rule set.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.120
I think maybe that's the one that's a little more tuned

24:17.120 --> 24:18.920
for the desktop as well.

24:18.920 --> 24:22.640
Whereas early OOM is O-O-M,

24:22.640 --> 24:24.240
I just try to cover my bases,

24:25.540 --> 24:27.860
is also perfectly I'd say usable on the server as well.

24:27.860 --> 24:29.840
It's a little brutal, it's a little hard handed,

24:29.840 --> 24:32.320
but it's usable on the server as well.

24:32.320 --> 24:33.400
So let's try it.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.280
You wanna try it?

24:34.280 --> 24:35.120
Ooh.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.120
Mm-hmm.

24:36.120 --> 24:37.880
Yeah, well, I figured it'd be fun

24:37.880 --> 24:38.920
to actually experiment with it

24:38.920 --> 24:40.000
and see what the differences are.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.680
So what Wes and I did here

24:41.680 --> 24:43.920
to try to keep a low memory situation,

24:43.920 --> 24:46.000
there's a few ways you can play with this,

24:46.000 --> 24:49.400
is we have set up identical VMs.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.640
He's running Fedora 32,

24:50.640 --> 24:52.840
the latest preview or beta, whatever.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.000
Is it actually beta yet?

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
It is beta.

24:55.000 --> 24:55.840
Oh, is it?

24:55.840 --> 24:56.680
Good, perfect.

24:56.680 --> 24:57.500
Thanks, Carl.

24:57.500 --> 25:01.640
This is fun because both Ubuntu 20.04 and Fedora 32

25:01.640 --> 25:02.520
are really close

25:02.520 --> 25:04.280
and they both have really cool new features.

25:04.280 --> 25:05.360
So I think this is one of the reasons

25:05.360 --> 25:07.200
we wanted to dive into this right now

25:07.200 --> 25:10.980
because you could obviously do an entire episode on this.

25:10.980 --> 25:14.560
So what we did is we set up identical VMs in KVM

25:14.560 --> 25:18.740
and each assigned exactly eight gigabytes of RAM

25:18.740 --> 25:21.600
and otherwise pretty basic installs,

25:21.600 --> 25:24.400
fully up to date on both sides.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.520
We have three terminal windows open under Gnome Shell.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.300
I'm using Gnome Shell Classic.

25:29.300 --> 25:31.240
So are you on Gnome Shell Classic as well?

25:31.240 --> 25:32.960
Okay, that's one thing I didn't think to check.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.760
So we're both on Gnome Shell Classic.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.640
I have Firefox open with NetData running,

25:38.640 --> 25:40.360
as does Wes, and three terminals.

25:40.360 --> 25:42.200
So what we're gonna do,

25:42.200 --> 25:47.200
it turns out it is so easy to thrash a Linux box.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.480
It is so easy.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.800
What we're gonna do is we're just gonna simply

25:50.800 --> 25:53.400
tail slash dev slash zero.

25:53.400 --> 25:56.360
And that will fill up memory pretty quickly,

25:56.360 --> 25:57.820
depending on how much memory you have.

25:57.820 --> 26:00.720
If you have a system with like 64 gigs of RAM,

26:00.720 --> 26:02.040
it'll take a little while.

26:02.040 --> 26:03.920
If you don't, if you're like me

26:03.920 --> 26:05.200
and you only have eight gigs of RAM,

26:05.200 --> 26:06.120
it goes pretty quick.

26:06.120 --> 26:06.960
Sure does.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.520
So now what we're going to observe when we run this

26:09.520 --> 26:12.740
is how these two different systems react.

26:12.740 --> 26:15.840
Will either one of them remain usable

26:15.840 --> 26:19.460
in a low memory condition and how will they perform?

26:19.460 --> 26:22.720
So I'm on 31, Wes is on 32.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.640
Do you have your tail dev zero ready, sir?

26:24.640 --> 26:25.720
Yeah, let's do it.

26:25.720 --> 26:26.800
All right, you ready?

26:26.800 --> 26:29.840
Three, two, one, go.

26:30.720 --> 26:31.920
Okay, my memory usage is,

26:31.920 --> 26:34.000
I'm watching a NetData, it's climbing quickly.

26:34.000 --> 26:34.820
Oh boy.

26:34.820 --> 26:35.660
I also have top running.

26:35.660 --> 26:38.280
We both have top going up and I just maxed out.

26:38.280 --> 26:39.920
Wow, that went quick.

26:39.920 --> 26:40.760
Are you still running over there?

26:40.760 --> 26:41.600
I was just at the top.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.540
Okay, it looks like my NetData metrics

26:43.540 --> 26:45.160
are going a little slow, but I can-

26:45.160 --> 26:46.880
My Firefox is totally frozen.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.040
Okay, and my thing is killed.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.560
So it just terminated the tail command.

26:50.560 --> 26:51.400
Really?

26:51.400 --> 26:53.440
Yep, and I'm seeing here in the early OOM logs

26:53.440 --> 26:55.960
that you can configure it so it'll print out

26:55.960 --> 26:58.120
all the metrics it sees and it just went,

26:58.120 --> 26:59.080
oh, nothing's left.

26:59.080 --> 27:00.080
Everything's frozen.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.680
My system is totally locked up.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.360
Every terminal window is locked up,

27:03.360 --> 27:04.200
Firefox is locked up.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.760
Well, I think I'm just going to get some work done.

27:05.760 --> 27:06.920
I mean, while you're, you know.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.520
Wow, that's a significant,

27:08.520 --> 27:10.200
yeah, you can use Firefox right now?

27:10.200 --> 27:11.360
Yeah, well, I mean, my-

27:11.360 --> 27:12.200
What's your memory usage?

27:12.200 --> 27:15.160
My tail command, it just all dropped back down.

27:15.160 --> 27:16.540
Mine is unmodable now.

27:16.540 --> 27:17.960
Even my terminals have frozen.

27:17.960 --> 27:19.920
Top is frozen, everything's frozen.

27:19.920 --> 27:21.920
You weren't trying to use that system, were you, Chris?

27:21.920 --> 27:23.200
Wow.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.000
Is it going to come back?

27:25.000 --> 27:27.560
This is a pretty significant difference.

27:27.560 --> 27:28.920
Imagine like on a Raspberry Pi

27:28.920 --> 27:31.200
where you've only got two or four gigs of RAM, right?

27:31.200 --> 27:32.120
Because this is just eight gigs.

27:32.120 --> 27:34.180
That's not an uncommon amount of RAM.

27:34.180 --> 27:35.220
I just did it again.

27:35.220 --> 27:38.080
And it seems to just sort of replicate the same behavior.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.160
You just lapped me?

27:39.160 --> 27:40.400
He just lapped me?

27:40.400 --> 27:41.840
Wow, it's totally locked up.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.960
Now imagine if I had set this limit, you know,

27:43.960 --> 27:46.100
like to like 1% for your, or less,

27:46.100 --> 27:47.600
then you might get into a similar situation

27:47.600 --> 27:48.440
where you could live lock.

27:48.440 --> 27:49.260
So you probably-

27:49.260 --> 27:51.440
Shouldn't my kernel killer kick in now though?

27:51.440 --> 27:52.320
Sometimes.

27:52.320 --> 27:54.360
It's interesting because we've actually run this test

27:54.360 --> 27:57.780
before and usually the kernel killer does kick in now.

27:57.780 --> 28:00.300
We, in our prep, we ran through this

28:00.300 --> 28:04.220
and a couple of different takes to make it reproducible.

28:04.220 --> 28:07.560
And usually by now, ah, there it goes.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.400
Here we go.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.600
All my terminal process,

28:09.600 --> 28:11.640
all three terminal windows were just killed.

28:11.640 --> 28:14.320
And now Firefox is starting to come back to life.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.160
So that's another difference.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.400
Oh, it's sluggish.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.680
In my case, all of my terminals stayed open.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.840
Oh my God, one, 1000, two,

28:19.840 --> 28:22.760
three seconds for a tab to open.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.440
Oh man, it is brutal.

28:24.440 --> 28:25.280
It's picking up now.

28:25.280 --> 28:26.200
It's starting to pick up.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.160
It's acting a little better now.

28:28.160 --> 28:29.200
Oh man, it's still sluggish.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.980
It's taking a solid second for those tabs to close.

28:31.980 --> 28:32.820
So-

28:32.820 --> 28:33.720
This system is thrashed.

28:33.720 --> 28:35.440
For me, it was just the tail command that got killed.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.200
So all the rest of my terminals stayed open

28:37.200 --> 28:38.640
and I can still see the logs.

28:38.640 --> 28:39.960
Wow.

28:39.960 --> 28:40.800
Wow.

28:40.800 --> 28:43.120
Yeah, for me, it killed all my terminal windows.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.520
It didn't just go for the tail command.

28:44.520 --> 28:46.880
It just, it just was brutal.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.760
That's a significant difference.

28:49.800 --> 28:53.000
You can actually turn that on in 31 and 30 as well.

28:53.000 --> 28:53.840
It's, you don't have to wait for 32.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.000
Yeah, it's already, it's already packaged.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.640
You can find it on Debian systems as well.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.960
It's really easy to get going.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.280
I wonder if there will be instructions

28:59.280 --> 29:00.680
on how to get that working on 2004

29:00.680 --> 29:02.040
and other distros like Manjaro.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.800
I mean, it must be simple, right, to get it set up.

29:03.800 --> 29:06.080
There's probably an ArchWiki on it.

29:06.080 --> 29:08.160
That is really significant.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.040
You could have probably run that a whole other time too.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.160
You just didn't do it right away,

29:11.160 --> 29:12.920
but you probably could have lapped me three times.

29:12.920 --> 29:13.960
I think so.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.320
And your system, and that's the other thing is

29:15.320 --> 29:17.040
not only does it recover quicker,

29:17.040 --> 29:19.040
but it's more responsive when it does recover.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.760
You know, there was still some sluggishness

29:20.760 --> 29:22.160
just after it got killed as the system

29:22.160 --> 29:23.760
was sort of catching up and it looked like net data

29:23.760 --> 29:27.640
maybe lost some of its data or at least dropped its caches

29:27.640 --> 29:28.960
to be nice to the system under pressure.

29:28.960 --> 29:29.800
Yeah, look at this.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.960
I have a gap in my, in my metrics log.

29:31.960 --> 29:36.960
Starting at 12.50 and going to almost 12.50, 3.30.

29:37.560 --> 29:40.240
So for about three minutes there.

29:40.240 --> 29:41.440
Yeah, okay, so I have a little gap,

29:41.440 --> 29:42.680
but it's a much smaller gap.

29:42.680 --> 29:45.720
I have a three and a half minute gap in my logging.

29:45.720 --> 29:46.680
How long was your gap?

29:46.680 --> 29:47.520
Do you still have it on your chart there?

29:47.520 --> 29:48.760
I was like 10 seconds.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.120
Really?

29:50.120 --> 29:51.760
That shows you the difference right there.

29:51.760 --> 29:54.120
It's, that's, huh.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.160
That's a fun little experiment.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.760
I think, I think we are looking at such an awesome

29:58.760 --> 30:01.600
Linux desktop future when you look at the speed

30:01.600 --> 30:04.200
at which Manjaro is humming along now

30:04.200 --> 30:06.280
and how solid Ubuntu has been.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.600
And now with Wimpy at the lead of the desktop there,

30:08.600 --> 30:10.240
like, you know, that's going in good directions.

30:10.240 --> 30:13.200
2004 integrating snapshots is fantastic.

30:13.200 --> 30:16.160
Fedora 32 integrating not only the latest

30:16.160 --> 30:20.360
gnome shell improvements, but also this cool little trick

30:20.360 --> 30:22.680
is going to make it a really solid workstation.

30:22.680 --> 30:25.040
All of these are just getting to be such good workstation

30:25.040 --> 30:26.720
OSs, which is what I really care about.

30:26.720 --> 30:29.080
Well, it's these exact sort of corner cases, you know,

30:29.080 --> 30:32.080
as we saw the kernel killer does eventually work.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.680
And you don't get into this sort of situation every day.

30:35.680 --> 30:37.640
It's nice that we've reached the level where this is,

30:37.640 --> 30:39.360
these are the problems that we can work on now

30:39.360 --> 30:41.680
because we have solid foundations underneath

30:41.680 --> 30:44.400
and can, you know, add a little more levels of polish.

30:44.400 --> 30:48.400
Well, and imagine that scenario on the server for a moment.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.360
You know, your server is essentially unresponsive

30:50.360 --> 30:51.240
that entire time.

30:52.320 --> 30:53.640
That's, that's horrible.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.080
Yeah, and that's where some of the options

30:55.080 --> 30:58.160
that you'll find too for either preferring to kill programs

30:58.160 --> 31:00.840
or to totally not kill programs might be especially useful

31:00.840 --> 31:02.800
if you're like, well, don't ever kill my logging program,

31:02.800 --> 31:05.280
but yeah, you can shoot this application

31:05.280 --> 31:06.440
that we have to reboot sometimes.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.160
It seems the Red Hat developer, Chris Murphy,

31:08.160 --> 31:11.960
was the proponent to include this early gnome killer

31:11.960 --> 31:14.560
in Fedora 32.

31:14.560 --> 31:18.440
And that's one killer I can get behind, you know?

31:18.440 --> 31:20.320
I had a whole intro that I was going to do

31:20.320 --> 31:22.320
that was such a bad joke, I dropped it.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.920
But I was, I'm going to tell you now that I've, you know.

31:24.920 --> 31:25.920
Lay it on me.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.680
Today we make nice with a killer.

31:27.680 --> 31:29.120
No, not Hans Reiser.

31:29.120 --> 31:29.960
Ha!

31:33.960 --> 31:35.760
Too soon or are we good?

31:35.760 --> 31:36.760
Is that okay now?

31:36.760 --> 31:37.600
I can't ever tell.

31:37.600 --> 31:40.760
I think you should, you need to use some Reiser FS.

31:40.760 --> 31:41.600
Yeah, I should.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.440
It's probably great.

31:42.440 --> 31:44.480
I'm not sure that was funny even five years ago.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.400
Damn it, Alex.

31:47.040 --> 31:49.040
Millions of unread users are really upset

31:49.040 --> 31:50.040
with you about now.

31:50.040 --> 31:53.280
Hey, I used Reiser FS on a bank check imaging system

31:53.280 --> 31:55.000
back in the day because you needed a file system

31:55.000 --> 31:56.600
that was really good with small files,

31:56.600 --> 31:59.240
lots of small files, and I believe I needed support

31:59.240 --> 32:00.440
for extended attributes.

32:00.440 --> 32:04.840
So that's how I both got going with Reiser FS and XFS.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.760
Back in the day, back in the day.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.280
So we will have links for all the stuff

32:08.280 --> 32:11.520
about the different out of memory managers,

32:11.520 --> 32:14.640
including ones that I think are pretty cool.

32:14.640 --> 32:16.520
Maybe a little more server focused.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.040
Yeah, I would give No Hang and Try

32:18.040 --> 32:19.360
if you just want to go try one of these out

32:19.360 --> 32:22.560
because it also has desktop notifications integrated,

32:22.560 --> 32:24.520
which you can also get for early OOM.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.200
It looks like you might need another component there.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.560
Oh yeah, that's something we didn't even touch on,

32:28.560 --> 32:29.880
but that's something they're looking at

32:29.880 --> 32:33.840
is giving you a notification mechanism via your desktop

32:33.840 --> 32:36.040
to say, hey, I just had to go kill something

32:36.040 --> 32:36.880
in the background.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.400
It does make a journal entry.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.800
And so you could actually just look at the journal

32:40.800 --> 32:41.640
for that stuff.

32:41.640 --> 32:43.120
But if you're not looking at your journal,

32:43.120 --> 32:46.280
which you're probably not, it's nice to get a notification.

32:46.280 --> 32:47.760
Good old D-Bus.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.880
Well, it's just one of those like first class

32:49.880 --> 32:52.040
sort of entities where you should tell the user

32:52.040 --> 32:53.000
what's going on with their system.

32:53.000 --> 32:53.840
That's a good point.

32:53.840 --> 32:54.760
That's a good point.

32:54.760 --> 32:56.720
So if you don't have the desktop application,

32:56.720 --> 32:59.320
you have to refer to the logs to see what was killed.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.600
And if you're running on a low memory box

33:01.600 --> 33:05.440
and say you're trying to, I don't know,

33:05.440 --> 33:08.360
edit video and encode video,

33:08.360 --> 33:10.480
and it's eating up all your RAM,

33:10.480 --> 33:13.800
is it by default just going to kill the tasks

33:13.800 --> 33:16.560
that's eating up the most RAM

33:16.560 --> 33:18.920
like it did with the tail command?

33:18.920 --> 33:22.080
How does it pick which app or which process to kill

33:22.080 --> 33:25.160
whenever you're running these out of memory errors?

33:25.160 --> 33:26.760
I don't remember the exact particular,

33:26.760 --> 33:28.040
so I could be wrong about this,

33:28.040 --> 33:31.520
but I believe it works off of determining

33:31.520 --> 33:33.440
the memory pressure through PSI

33:33.440 --> 33:37.000
along with the OOM score that is associated with it.

33:37.000 --> 33:41.040
It also takes into account priorities.

33:41.040 --> 33:43.960
If you set a priority for a process ID,

33:43.960 --> 33:46.360
it does take that into account as well.

33:46.360 --> 33:50.920
You can, however, configure early OOM

33:50.920 --> 33:54.320
to have different specific priorities,

33:54.320 --> 33:57.280
or like, for example, if you're doing video encoding

33:57.280 --> 33:59.720
and you know that's intensive and you don't want it to die,

33:59.720 --> 34:02.840
you can have early OOM try very hard to ignore it

34:02.840 --> 34:04.280
and try to do something else

34:04.280 --> 34:07.280
to relieve the pressure as needed.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.720
We went a lot back and forth

34:08.720 --> 34:09.880
in the workstation working group

34:09.880 --> 34:12.080
about how to configure this and how to deal with this.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.360
I know that we had to implement

34:14.360 --> 34:17.000
in the configuration workaround specifically for Chrome

34:17.000 --> 34:21.120
because Chrome does somewhat bad things

34:21.120 --> 34:23.640
for how it sets up its child processes.

34:23.640 --> 34:27.800
But yeah, so the exact details, not sure,

34:27.800 --> 34:30.880
but I think that kind of gives you the gist of it.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.240
And also one last thing, Chris.

34:34.600 --> 34:37.040
Chris Murphy, who's actually doing this,

34:37.040 --> 34:38.040
who suggested all this

34:38.040 --> 34:40.320
and kind of leads the workstation working group,

34:40.320 --> 34:42.000
he does not work for Red Hat.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.840
That's a different Chris Murphy.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.440
Oh, then I emailed the wrong guy.

34:45.440 --> 34:48.360
Yeah, you probably did.

34:48.360 --> 34:49.680
Oh, well, there you go.

34:49.680 --> 34:51.640
It's hard tracking people down online.

34:51.640 --> 34:53.080
Sometimes you get it wrong.

34:53.080 --> 34:56.720
Well, hopefully Chris Murphy will pass my email along.

34:56.720 --> 34:57.840
I was also curious,

34:57.840 --> 35:01.120
is this going to be implemented into Fedora server

35:01.120 --> 35:02.400
when it rolls out as well?

35:02.400 --> 35:04.800
Because I could definitely see this being useful on,

35:04.800 --> 35:07.000
like Chris was saying, low-end servers,

35:07.000 --> 35:09.160
a droplet with limited resources.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.680
I personally wanted to.

35:10.680 --> 35:15.680
The problem was that we kind of ran out of time

35:16.040 --> 35:18.720
in terms of turning this into like a full,

35:18.720 --> 35:21.040
all Fedora edition system-wide change.

35:21.040 --> 35:22.720
It's pretty simple to enable though.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.400
It is simple to enable.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.240
Honestly, my suggestion is,

35:26.240 --> 35:29.120
if you want to see this in Fedora server,

35:29.120 --> 35:31.360
drop an email or something

35:31.360 --> 35:32.800
to the Fedora server working group

35:32.800 --> 35:34.880
to let them know that you're interested in this.

35:34.880 --> 35:35.800
And that, like,

35:35.800 --> 35:37.440
cause the main reason it didn't get done

35:37.440 --> 35:40.040
was that there was nobody from this server,

35:40.040 --> 35:41.640
nobody on the server team

35:41.640 --> 35:43.200
particularly expressed any interest

35:43.200 --> 35:46.720
cause they didn't hear of anybody who wanted it.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.080
So, I mean, I obviously believe

35:49.080 --> 35:51.440
that it would be useful across all the variants.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.840
Wouldn't something maybe like Facebook's OOMD

35:53.840 --> 35:55.040
make more sense?

35:55.040 --> 35:57.000
Because that's really kind of designed for data centers.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.040
That was some of the argument as well.

35:59.040 --> 36:02.000
Some of the issue with using Facebook's OOMD

36:02.000 --> 36:04.520
or O-O-M-D or whatever,

36:04.520 --> 36:09.520
is that it is a lot more aggressive than early OOM.

36:09.520 --> 36:12.840
And depending on what type of workloads

36:12.840 --> 36:14.240
you put into a server,

36:14.240 --> 36:16.760
that may not be great.

36:16.760 --> 36:17.640
That being said,

36:17.640 --> 36:20.440
one of the other reasons why we didn't do OOMD

36:20.440 --> 36:21.960
is because it's in the process

36:21.960 --> 36:23.800
of being reworked completely.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.320
One of the, they're working with the SystemD folks upstream

36:28.320 --> 36:30.040
to re-implement it as a service

36:30.040 --> 36:31.200
that's more tightly integrated

36:31.200 --> 36:33.800
with SystemD service management facilities.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.760
Facebook themselves heavily leveraged this

36:35.760 --> 36:37.880
and their contributors to SystemD upstream,

36:37.880 --> 36:39.520
as well as into the Fedora project.

36:39.520 --> 36:42.120
So they're working on making this

36:42.120 --> 36:43.880
a more comprehensive solution,

36:43.880 --> 36:46.560
better integrated with the service management capabilities

36:46.560 --> 36:49.560
within SystemD and exposing a better interface

36:49.560 --> 36:52.160
for desktops and other things to take advantage of it.

36:52.160 --> 36:54.760
And if that pans out the way that we all hope it does,

36:54.760 --> 36:58.840
we'll probably see within my guess is about a year or so,

36:58.840 --> 37:03.440
we will look at transitioning from early OOM to that.

37:03.440 --> 37:04.280
We're not there yet,

37:04.280 --> 37:06.320
but I think it's fascinating that this development,

37:06.320 --> 37:08.640
there's these parallel solutions and development

37:08.640 --> 37:12.360
to make Linux handle low memory solutions better,

37:12.360 --> 37:13.760
or situations I should say.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.520
And the thing that's interesting about them,

37:15.520 --> 37:17.200
and this is where my mind was going,

37:17.200 --> 37:18.720
is that they're user space, right?

37:18.720 --> 37:21.040
They're all user space solutions,

37:21.040 --> 37:22.640
but there definitely seems to be a need here.

37:22.640 --> 37:23.880
And I think we just demonstrated

37:23.880 --> 37:25.520
there's a real benefit on the desktop.

37:25.520 --> 37:26.440
Yeah, absolutely.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.360
But you could easily see how that

37:27.360 --> 37:28.600
would apply to the server too.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.120
Yeah, I mean, the end of it was that we all just gave up

37:31.120 --> 37:32.960
waiting for the kernel to solve the problem.

37:32.960 --> 37:36.440
So, I mean, if you really, really look at it,

37:36.440 --> 37:38.360
all of this is just a way to try to make

37:38.360 --> 37:42.680
the kernel OOM behavior happen more deterministically,

37:42.680 --> 37:45.400
more repeatably, more reliably,

37:45.400 --> 37:49.080
and more in a manner that a user expects.

37:49.080 --> 37:52.800
And potentially maybe as if you have a user space solution,

37:52.800 --> 37:54.440
then maybe the kernel one can be,

37:54.440 --> 37:56.280
it's okay that it's so much more conservative

37:56.280 --> 37:58.320
and heavy handed because it's kind of a backup.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.680
It's a parachute to your glider.

38:00.680 --> 38:01.520
Exactly.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.760
Maybe, we'll see.

38:02.760 --> 38:03.800
I could say, and that would be,

38:03.800 --> 38:06.200
and the thing that's nice about the user space one,

38:06.200 --> 38:08.640
although it's so Linux to have multiple solutions

38:08.640 --> 38:10.120
to do the same thing.

38:10.120 --> 38:11.840
I'm sure other operating systems,

38:11.840 --> 38:13.840
they just have one and they just implement it.

38:13.840 --> 38:17.240
At the same time, it's clear that there's nice uses for it.

38:17.240 --> 38:20.920
Like OMD or UMD from Facebook is great for the server,

38:20.920 --> 38:22.520
but NoHang looks like it's gonna be

38:22.520 --> 38:23.640
a lot better for the desktop.

38:23.640 --> 38:26.200
And there are different use cases there.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.760
And so it's so perfectly Linux

38:27.760 --> 38:28.640
that there are multiple ones,

38:28.640 --> 38:30.680
but we'll get to some common ground.

38:30.680 --> 38:33.240
There'll probably be some easy way

38:33.240 --> 38:34.840
to swap these all out too, right?

38:34.840 --> 38:37.240
Well, yeah, I mean, they're just a single binary

38:37.240 --> 38:38.160
and oftentimes that run.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.600
So just stop the service, start the service to the new one.

38:40.600 --> 38:41.600
It's a user space thing.

38:41.600 --> 38:42.440
Exactly.

38:42.440 --> 38:43.680
It's a very powerful user space thing,

38:43.680 --> 38:45.920
but yeah, I think it's fascinating.

38:45.920 --> 38:50.680
And I might always now run a desktop with one, I think.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.320
I think that's my takeaway from this.

38:52.320 --> 38:53.760
It's a little bit of a paradigm shift in that sense

38:53.760 --> 38:54.680
is why not?

38:54.680 --> 38:55.520
Why not?

38:55.520 --> 38:56.640
I mean, would you implement it on your,

38:56.640 --> 38:59.040
say if you were to go back into your Neon installer?

38:59.040 --> 39:00.040
Yeah, I think so.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.120
I mean, you might need to do a little tuning perhaps

39:02.120 --> 39:04.400
if you have some applications that are memory hogs

39:04.400 --> 39:06.640
and end up getting killed, but that's easy to do.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.320
Like it probably might not make as much sense

39:08.320 --> 39:09.840
on the OBS machine.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.320
And we also don't see those problems there.

39:11.320 --> 39:12.920
So it probably does make more sense to write it

39:12.920 --> 39:14.040
for a machine where you've got

39:14.040 --> 39:15.720
perhaps a little more dynamic workload,

39:15.720 --> 39:18.400
where you do see large changes in how much RAM is used,

39:18.400 --> 39:19.920
like a web browser.

39:19.920 --> 39:22.160
Yeah, and specifically my laptop.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.240
Yeah.

39:23.240 --> 39:25.840
With three electron apps open and.

39:25.840 --> 39:26.880
At least.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.000
Yeah, it's on a good day.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.360
So there is one other case

39:29.360 --> 39:30.560
where you might want to think about

39:30.560 --> 39:35.120
for using early OOM or any other user space

39:35.120 --> 39:37.000
out of memory management solution.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.600
It's if you know that you're doing a workload

39:39.600 --> 39:43.280
which dynamically spawns lots of threads

39:43.280 --> 39:46.320
and those threads can at any given time spike

39:46.320 --> 39:47.480
and use lots of memory

39:47.480 --> 39:49.600
and you don't really have a good way

39:49.600 --> 39:52.080
of immediately dealing with that

39:52.080 --> 39:55.000
or otherwise controlling it within the application itself.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.320
So for example,

39:56.320 --> 39:59.400
if you are dynamically letting video encoders

39:59.400 --> 40:01.840
just run wild on your computer,

40:01.840 --> 40:04.240
that's probably an avenue where you,

40:04.240 --> 40:07.320
if you cannot do any control in the application itself,

40:07.320 --> 40:10.120
which thankfully most of them let you,

40:10.120 --> 40:12.040
that is something where early OOM would benefit.

40:12.040 --> 40:13.960
But another is if you're compiling code,

40:13.960 --> 40:17.320
killing threads for out of control compilations

40:17.320 --> 40:20.320
doesn't necessarily bring down the whole compilation process.

40:20.320 --> 40:23.040
In most cases, it causes it to reschedule them

40:23.040 --> 40:24.200
or do something different.

40:24.200 --> 40:27.120
So, you know, it depends,

40:27.120 --> 40:29.800
but like when you consider these workloads,

40:29.800 --> 40:31.600
you also have to consider, you know,

40:31.600 --> 40:35.160
what is the modeling for how these processes

40:35.160 --> 40:37.440
and how the memory allocation is going to go.

40:37.440 --> 40:38.560
Right, and what are the consequences

40:38.560 --> 40:39.400
for things getting killed

40:39.400 --> 40:41.080
in terms of how that work can continue?

40:41.080 --> 40:41.920
For sure.

40:41.920 --> 40:42.880
Yes, absolutely.

40:42.880 --> 40:46.520
Yeah, that is definitely the other side

40:46.520 --> 40:47.800
to this double-edged sword.

40:47.800 --> 40:48.920
I think that's what makes it so interesting

40:48.920 --> 40:50.600
to see it as a new default too,

40:50.600 --> 40:54.360
is sort of the workstation team saying

40:54.360 --> 40:57.160
this works well enough that let's push it out.

40:57.160 --> 40:59.280
Yeah, and I think you'll see other distributions

40:59.280 --> 41:00.280
pick it up, especially the ones

41:00.280 --> 41:02.200
that want to be seen as performance focused.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.360
Well, I could see this, you know,

41:04.360 --> 41:07.480
the out of memory killer along with immutable systems,

41:07.480 --> 41:10.360
you know, all kind of coming together under one umbrella

41:10.360 --> 41:14.320
to maybe form the next, you know,

41:14.320 --> 41:16.960
the next season of Linux distros and stuff,

41:16.960 --> 41:18.880
you know, like what Silverblue is doing now

41:18.880 --> 41:21.800
and being able to stack OOM right on top of that

41:21.800 --> 41:23.640
would be, you know, a nice little...

41:23.640 --> 41:25.560
All running on Wayland backed by flat pack

41:25.560 --> 41:28.720
or app images or snaps, it's happening.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.520
And the IRC XMN has a point about mobile devices

41:31.520 --> 41:33.560
and yeah, I kind of want this for Android already.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.800
Funny you should mention all of that.

41:35.800 --> 41:39.120
So Silverblue, the goal with this

41:39.120 --> 41:41.840
is like combined with low memory monitor and early OOM,

41:41.840 --> 41:44.040
I believe that in the very near future,

41:44.040 --> 41:47.280
Silverblue will also have this functionality active

41:47.280 --> 41:49.000
and more tightly integrated.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.560
And because of some of the stuff

41:50.560 --> 41:52.280
that's going on in the flat pack side,

41:52.280 --> 41:54.160
it can be slightly more intelligent

41:54.160 --> 41:55.720
than your average application

41:55.720 --> 41:58.760
about handling memory pressure situations.

41:58.760 --> 42:01.680
Oh, and as far as Android goes, they already do this.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.040
That's really one of the reasons

42:03.040 --> 42:06.080
why there's been a lot of impetus

42:06.080 --> 42:08.120
towards trying to fix this for desktop Linux

42:08.120 --> 42:10.080
is because every other platform,

42:10.080 --> 42:14.000
including the Android one already has something set up.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.640
Well, that's the advantage to a unified focused

42:17.640 --> 42:20.360
sort of sprint based, like we're gonna focus on this

42:20.360 --> 42:21.520
and this and this and yeah,

42:21.520 --> 42:24.120
the Mac does similar things, Windows does similar things.

42:24.120 --> 42:25.840
Mini Mac though had a question that I bet

42:25.840 --> 42:27.080
is on the mind of a lot of listeners.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.240
So I wanted to let you jump in.

42:28.240 --> 42:29.360
Thank you.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.640
My question was how is swap involved in all this?

42:31.640 --> 42:33.200
I mean, we're talking about a ROM now,

42:33.200 --> 42:36.400
but we all have a little small swap partition.

42:36.400 --> 42:37.840
Yeah, and I think there was some thought

42:37.840 --> 42:40.120
in the design of this when it comes to swap

42:40.120 --> 42:42.840
is it looks at your RAM and your swap.

42:42.840 --> 42:44.520
And if they're less than 10% free

42:44.520 --> 42:45.480
or if they're around that range,

42:45.480 --> 42:47.200
that's when it'll generally kick in.

42:47.200 --> 42:49.600
But one, I think Wes and correct me if I'm wrong,

42:50.640 --> 42:53.680
but I think one of the tunables is you can say,

42:53.680 --> 42:55.640
start sooner than 10% swap

42:55.640 --> 42:58.160
because if I'm using that much swap,

42:58.160 --> 42:59.840
then my system is already thrashing

42:59.840 --> 43:01.200
way more than I would like it to be.

43:01.200 --> 43:03.080
Yep, yeah, you can tune both of those separately.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.000
Yeah, so you could go in there and say,

43:05.000 --> 43:08.200
you know what, once I'm at 50% swap, start getting crazy.

43:08.200 --> 43:10.000
Now that would probably be too much,

43:10.000 --> 43:14.280
but by default, once your free swap goes below 10%,

43:14.280 --> 43:15.360
that's when it starts kicking in

43:15.360 --> 43:18.160
for both your swap and your RAM by default.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.640
And part of the reason for setting that way

43:19.640 --> 43:24.640
is that there are some people who are either putting anemic

43:24.840 --> 43:25.960
or no swap at all,

43:25.960 --> 43:28.400
and so we need to cover those grounds as well.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.000
And people who have anemic swap,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.480
this can cause interesting side effects.

43:32.480 --> 43:36.400
So that's why we consider both free RAM and swap together

43:36.400 --> 43:40.840
to make sure that we don't kick in unnecessarily aggressively.

43:40.840 --> 43:43.000
Yeah, this is an example where sometimes

43:43.000 --> 43:46.080
just blasting defaults and not letting the user change it

43:46.080 --> 43:48.240
has some advantages because then you know

43:48.240 --> 43:50.280
what their configuration is for things like swap.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.280
You know it's exactly the amount of RAM

43:52.280 --> 43:55.880
or maybe the distribution policy is 20% of the amount of RAM

43:55.880 --> 43:57.960
or something, you just always know what that number is.

43:57.960 --> 44:00.440
But this is a power user workstation OS

44:00.440 --> 44:02.040
and we can tweak those things, thankfully.

44:02.040 --> 44:03.000
Well, that's what I was just thinking

44:03.000 --> 44:04.640
because with Android, I'm not very satisfied

44:04.640 --> 44:06.560
with the version there because it seems

44:06.560 --> 44:07.760
I have more stalls on Android

44:07.760 --> 44:09.640
than I have on my Linux laptop.

44:09.640 --> 44:11.000
So I want more knobs.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.440
Yeah, very good point.

44:12.440 --> 44:13.280
Yeah, very good point.

44:13.280 --> 44:15.320
And I think it's gonna be there for you, Wes.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.640
I think you will be able to.

44:16.640 --> 44:18.880
Like I say, I mean, this changes everything

44:18.880 --> 44:19.800
for me going forward.

44:19.800 --> 44:22.680
I will forever going forward on my Linux boxes.

44:22.680 --> 44:25.160
I mean, I'm gonna go start after the show installing it.

44:25.160 --> 44:26.400
And now it's gonna be one of the things

44:26.400 --> 44:27.760
like along with tweaking my fonts

44:27.760 --> 44:29.800
and installing themes, Wes, and getting extensions,

44:29.800 --> 44:32.680
I'll be installing an early memory out of memory killer

44:32.680 --> 44:34.960
because that's how I roll.

44:34.960 --> 44:35.880
That's pretty cool.

44:35.880 --> 44:37.320
And I'm glad to see it getting turned on.

44:37.320 --> 44:40.120
Now we'll see where it goes from here.

44:40.120 --> 44:41.440
All right, now how about a couple of pics?

44:41.440 --> 44:43.200
Not just one, but two pics.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.080
Yes, please.

44:44.080 --> 44:46.520
The first one, new shell.

44:46.520 --> 44:49.560
It's a new type of shell.

44:49.560 --> 44:51.680
Okay, all right, I'm gonna admit it.

44:51.680 --> 44:52.520
I didn't put this one in,

44:52.520 --> 44:54.680
so I hadn't really looked at this.

44:54.680 --> 44:55.920
This looks pretty great.

44:55.920 --> 44:56.960
You'll be pretty pleased to hear

44:56.960 --> 44:58.960
that it's written in Rust, so.

44:58.960 --> 44:59.800
What, what?

44:59.800 --> 45:00.640
What was that, Wes?

45:00.640 --> 45:02.200
Yeah, that's right, it's written in Rust.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.240
Oh my gosh.

45:03.240 --> 45:04.240
Yes, yes.

45:11.560 --> 45:13.520
Yes, it is hammer time.

45:13.520 --> 45:14.600
Very good.

45:14.600 --> 45:16.160
It's got all kinds of smart support

45:16.160 --> 45:18.520
for different formats and natively understand things

45:18.520 --> 45:22.640
like XML, JSON, INI files, other configuration files.

45:22.640 --> 45:25.000
And as you will see, if you visit their website,

45:25.000 --> 45:27.320
when you run just the average old LS command,

45:27.320 --> 45:30.480
instead of getting the normal sort of pure text LS output,

45:30.480 --> 45:32.800
you get a lovely little table.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.720
And new shell has a bunch of built-ins

45:34.720 --> 45:35.640
to help you sort with that.

45:35.640 --> 45:38.400
So instead of having to use flags to LS to configure,

45:38.400 --> 45:39.520
like I only want to see things

45:39.520 --> 45:41.120
that are this new or whatever,

45:41.120 --> 45:42.920
you just sort of pipe it and say,

45:42.920 --> 45:44.920
well, when the date is after this.

45:44.920 --> 45:46.440
Oh, Wes, this is really cool.

45:46.440 --> 45:48.880
Oh, I love what it does with PS and LS.

45:48.880 --> 45:51.720
Oh my gosh, that, oh, that's so nice.

45:51.720 --> 45:55.400
So it's basically making mcurses tables,

45:55.400 --> 45:58.840
just a UI to just outline the data easier to see.

45:58.840 --> 46:00.320
Well, but you can also interact with that data.

46:00.320 --> 46:01.600
So you can filter on the different things.

46:01.600 --> 46:04.880
You can load a JSON document into the exact same table

46:04.880 --> 46:07.000
and use all the same tools to interact with it

46:07.000 --> 46:08.360
and pipe it back out again

46:08.360 --> 46:10.920
to traditional command line programs.

46:10.920 --> 46:12.680
It's definitely, as I admit,

46:12.680 --> 46:14.320
inspired by things like PowerShell, right?

46:14.320 --> 46:16.920
That have these sort of rich objects behind the scenes.

46:16.920 --> 46:19.160
And it's almost like a little subdomain

46:19.160 --> 46:23.400
that you get with this rich capability in this new shell,

46:23.400 --> 46:24.560
while still having access

46:24.560 --> 46:26.640
to a somewhat traditional command line experience

46:26.640 --> 46:28.200
to go do all the rest of the programs

46:28.200 --> 46:30.480
that might not be supported by, you know,

46:30.480 --> 46:32.280
what the additional superpowers.

46:32.280 --> 46:34.040
Stay a while and listen.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.160
And now one more.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.960
And you know, this one's a hot market one

46:36.960 --> 46:38.800
because it's just got a launchpad page.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.240
Does it not have a homepage?

46:40.240 --> 46:41.080
What's the matter with this thing?

46:41.080 --> 46:42.640
It doesn't, I wasn't able to find one.

46:42.640 --> 46:45.640
There might be one out there, but I wasn't able to find it.

46:45.640 --> 46:47.240
All right, so tell me about Timekeeper Next.

46:47.240 --> 46:52.120
So Timekeeper, Time KPR, which it was originally known as,

46:52.120 --> 46:53.640
and then they changed the name a few times,

46:53.640 --> 46:56.320
and now it's Timekeeper Next,

46:56.320 --> 46:59.240
essentially allows you, you know, everyone's at home right now

46:59.240 --> 47:00.840
and their kids are using their computers.

47:00.840 --> 47:02.560
And likely, if you're listening to the show,

47:02.560 --> 47:05.640
your kid is using a Linux-based computer.

47:05.640 --> 47:09.760
You can install Timekeeper through a PPA currently.

47:09.760 --> 47:11.480
It's also in the Arch repos,

47:11.480 --> 47:14.080
but you can install a Timekeeper to keep track

47:14.080 --> 47:17.760
of the time used on these desktop environments

47:17.760 --> 47:20.440
on the computer for any other user on the system.

47:20.440 --> 47:23.240
So say your kids log in and you want to allow them

47:23.240 --> 47:28.240
to log in and use the machine through the certain hours,

47:28.440 --> 47:31.880
or if you want to maybe allow them to use the machine,

47:31.880 --> 47:36.200
they can't use it past midnight until 8 a.m. in the morning,

47:36.200 --> 47:39.040
and then you only want them to have three hours

47:39.040 --> 47:41.360
of computer access for the day.

47:41.360 --> 47:44.400
You can set all this up on a per-user basis.

47:45.280 --> 47:47.640
So it's a nice little way to kind of, you know,

47:47.640 --> 47:50.080
keep your kids off of the computer a little bit

47:50.080 --> 47:52.120
while you're stuck at home.

47:52.120 --> 47:53.400
Yeah, or yourself.

47:53.400 --> 47:54.240
Yeah, absolutely.

47:54.240 --> 47:55.880
Honestly, I have a hard time.

47:55.880 --> 47:57.880
Just in the last couple of days,

47:57.880 --> 47:59.120
well, really yesterday and today,

47:59.120 --> 48:01.960
I'm trying to get myself to move more

48:01.960 --> 48:04.160
because I used to have this mindset

48:04.160 --> 48:05.920
that I would just sit down and marathon a day

48:05.920 --> 48:07.920
and just work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work,

48:07.920 --> 48:08.760
all day long.

48:08.760 --> 48:09.600
Yeah, it doesn't work.

48:09.600 --> 48:10.920
Oh my God, like I get sore all over

48:10.920 --> 48:13.120
in places I didn't know you would get sore.

48:13.120 --> 48:14.920
Serious, like it's bad, so.

48:14.920 --> 48:15.800
The sitting sore.

48:15.800 --> 48:17.960
Yeah, well, and it's really, it's in my shoulders,

48:17.960 --> 48:19.960
in my elbows, and in my wrists.

48:19.960 --> 48:22.160
It's just getting, I'm getting like RSI, essentially,

48:22.160 --> 48:23.000
is I think of what it is.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.480
And so I gotta move around more.

48:24.480 --> 48:27.000
And so something like that to help me just practice that

48:27.000 --> 48:29.160
is always good.

48:29.160 --> 48:31.240
So that's timekeeper next.

48:31.240 --> 48:33.680
Yeah, I think for me, I would be tempted

48:33.680 --> 48:35.840
just to go in and flip the switch and turn it off, though.

48:35.840 --> 48:37.000
Yeah, I know.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.920
If I was administrating it myself,

48:38.920 --> 48:40.960
like it would have to be something like

48:40.960 --> 48:44.480
I wasn't able to get in and turn off myself, you know?

48:44.480 --> 48:46.680
I don't use like any of the digital wellbeing stuff

48:46.680 --> 48:48.040
on my phone.

48:48.040 --> 48:50.040
Here's the thing, you just change your root password

48:50.040 --> 48:50.880
when you're drunk.

48:50.880 --> 48:52.560
Get it all configured.

48:52.560 --> 48:55.920
That is the best idea I've ever heard.

48:55.920 --> 48:57.280
That's a Westpain pro tip right there.

48:57.280 --> 48:58.320
Yeah, no doubt.

48:58.320 --> 48:59.960
Yes, it is hammer time.

49:03.800 --> 49:08.080
Hey, does anybody know if you can run OpenSense on ARM

49:08.080 --> 49:09.520
hardware, like the Pine 64?

49:09.520 --> 49:11.320
Because I think that'd make a, I was just thinking

49:11.320 --> 49:12.520
about our firewall segment.

49:12.520 --> 49:17.160
They did make a PF Sense box that was ARM-based.

49:17.160 --> 49:20.280
From my understanding, it wasn't super great.

49:20.280 --> 49:23.600
It was kind of limited on the throughput side.

49:24.640 --> 49:27.600
Like you couldn't saturate the gigabit connections.

49:27.600 --> 49:30.320
But yes, from my understanding,

49:30.320 --> 49:33.440
there is already ARM hardware out there

49:33.440 --> 49:35.520
running PF Sense and OpenSense.

49:35.520 --> 49:36.920
I could sniff around.

49:36.920 --> 49:37.760
We'll see.

49:37.760 --> 49:39.640
Alex says he can do a low-power cheap setup,

49:39.640 --> 49:41.320
so I'm waiting to see, but I'm just trying to think.

49:41.320 --> 49:42.320
Yeah, 100 bucks.

49:42.320 --> 49:44.880
100 bucks are used, I'm going to write a blog post

49:44.880 --> 49:46.920
before the next self-hosted episode.

49:46.920 --> 49:49.480
100 bucks, and you'll build an x86 system

49:49.480 --> 49:52.000
that draws about 15 watts.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Okay, all right.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.600
Okay, you got me with that, because I was going to say

49:54.600 --> 49:58.360
my entire setup right now draws like 50 watts,

49:58.360 --> 50:00.440
and I am so stinking proud of that.

50:00.440 --> 50:04.400
That includes router, Wi-Fi, and switch, and now four Pi.

50:04.400 --> 50:05.920
So it might be actually, I haven't actually checked it

50:05.920 --> 50:08.280
since I added the fourth Pi, so.

50:08.280 --> 50:10.240
But I'm going to shut down one of them, so it won't matter.

50:10.240 --> 50:11.280
Yeah, I am, so.

50:11.280 --> 50:14.160
You know who else is running a super inexpensive

50:14.160 --> 50:19.160
and low-powered PF sense box is our buddy Tyler Condulo.

50:19.520 --> 50:24.520
He runs a, I think it's a Wyze thin client.

50:27.200 --> 50:28.040
Oh yeah.

50:28.040 --> 50:29.280
As a PF sense box, yeah.

50:29.280 --> 50:30.920
Wow, that's wild.

50:30.920 --> 50:33.040
I remember those old boxes.

50:33.040 --> 50:35.480
All right, well, I just have a quick disclaimer,

50:35.480 --> 50:38.200
really quick, but I just want to get it out there.

50:38.200 --> 50:42.800
Alex and I have decided together

50:42.800 --> 50:44.520
that we're going to take things to the next level

50:44.520 --> 50:47.040
in our self-hosted relationship,

50:47.040 --> 50:49.840
and we have launched a Discord server.

50:49.840 --> 50:52.840
I think you need the hallelujah.

50:52.840 --> 50:53.680
Now, okay.

50:53.680 --> 50:55.320
A beautiful baby server.

50:58.240 --> 51:00.720
Now listen, if you don't use Discord already,

51:00.720 --> 51:02.280
don't sign up on our account.

51:03.440 --> 51:05.360
We're not trying to convert anyone to use Discord.

51:05.360 --> 51:08.520
We're making a community there for people that use it,

51:08.520 --> 51:10.600
selfhosted.show slash Discord.

51:10.600 --> 51:11.800
I want to get the word out there,

51:11.800 --> 51:13.920
because I know some of you already have Discord accounts

51:13.920 --> 51:15.600
and you want to use it.

51:15.600 --> 51:18.440
And something that Alex and I have talked about on the show

51:18.440 --> 51:20.640
is trying to strike these balances from time to time.

51:20.640 --> 51:23.440
We obviously lean towards hosting it yourself,

51:23.440 --> 51:25.360
and we're very aware of ways we could do that

51:25.360 --> 51:27.280
from IRC to Matrix.

51:27.280 --> 51:31.360
But Discord is where the community is.

51:31.360 --> 51:33.600
And so for the people that are there,

51:33.600 --> 51:36.000
we have created a Discord server.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.480
And Alex, do you have any other thoughts

51:39.480 --> 51:40.320
you want to add to that?

51:40.320 --> 51:42.000
Well, for some people, it's just like crazy

51:42.000 --> 51:44.120
that the self-hosted show is using Discord.

51:44.120 --> 51:46.360
I know, we're a pair of heathens, aren't we?

51:47.440 --> 51:48.640
We knew that was coming though,

51:48.640 --> 51:50.280
within 20 minutes of launching it.

51:50.280 --> 51:52.360
It just boils down to pragmatism in the end.

51:52.360 --> 51:54.080
I've written a blog post to try and outline

51:54.080 --> 51:56.520
some of our thoughts in a bit more detail

51:56.520 --> 51:57.960
as to how we came to that decision.

51:57.960 --> 52:01.600
So blog.katyz.me is the first post on there at the moment.

52:01.600 --> 52:04.480
And yeah, there'll be a link in the show notes.

52:04.480 --> 52:05.760
It's a truly contentious issue.

52:05.760 --> 52:07.680
It's why we're still on IRC for this show,

52:07.680 --> 52:10.240
even though I think we'd probably have

52:10.240 --> 52:13.560
maybe a thousand people in there if we were on Discord.

52:13.560 --> 52:14.560
And you know, it's interesting

52:14.560 --> 52:17.440
because it's just really, it's the audience.

52:17.440 --> 52:19.720
I launched a Discord server for Unfilter recently.

52:19.720 --> 52:21.440
It was like two weeks ago.

52:21.440 --> 52:24.440
It took until this weekend, like two days ago.

52:24.440 --> 52:26.280
Somebody said, hey, how come we're doing this on Discord?

52:26.280 --> 52:28.480
But when we launched it for self-hosted,

52:28.480 --> 52:30.200
it was within 20 minutes of launching it

52:30.200 --> 52:31.640
that somebody said, what?

52:31.640 --> 52:32.960
All about those expectations.

52:32.960 --> 52:34.960
Yeah, and we're totally aware of that.

52:34.960 --> 52:37.040
And that's something we'll address in self-hosted

52:37.040 --> 52:38.280
if you check out self-hosted.

52:38.280 --> 52:41.840
And also, if you start and go through our early episodes,

52:41.840 --> 52:44.160
like we had one with Wendell very early on,

52:44.160 --> 52:45.960
we really kind of get into our rationale there

52:45.960 --> 52:48.680
about when it's absolutely vital to self-host

52:48.680 --> 52:51.440
versus when you can make a compromise.

52:51.440 --> 52:53.600
And I think that's important even just for Linux users.

52:53.600 --> 52:55.040
It's not just a self-hosting thing.

52:55.040 --> 52:56.400
It's also a software thing.

52:56.400 --> 52:58.680
Linux isn't always the right solution.

52:59.800 --> 53:01.000
Sometimes.

53:01.000 --> 53:01.840
Now, it's true.

53:01.840 --> 53:09.080
And I think when you judge someone for using Windows

53:09.080 --> 53:11.920
or for Mac OS, in a way, what you're actually doing

53:11.920 --> 53:14.720
is you're judging them for choosing something

53:14.720 --> 53:16.520
that you did not choose.

53:16.520 --> 53:19.200
You're sort of projecting a moral value onto them.

53:19.200 --> 53:21.600
And then you're judging them for that projection

53:21.600 --> 53:24.360
of a moral value that they never subscribed to.

53:24.360 --> 53:26.640
And it's a complicated thing to judge people

53:26.640 --> 53:30.040
for what they use because you're essentially shaming them

53:30.040 --> 53:32.760
in your head or publicly for choosing something

53:32.760 --> 53:33.600
you didn't choose.

53:33.600 --> 53:35.960
And that is a slippery slope.

53:35.960 --> 53:37.840
Well, and you know, it's rare that you actually understand

53:37.840 --> 53:40.000
the complete context of all of those choices

53:40.000 --> 53:41.320
that other people are making.

53:41.320 --> 53:44.200
Yeah, very typical because it's very hard to, you know.

53:44.200 --> 53:45.680
You may not understand them for your own choices.

53:45.680 --> 53:47.320
Yeah, sometimes.

53:47.320 --> 53:48.520
So I agree.

53:48.520 --> 53:51.400
I think it's sometimes very, very likely

53:51.400 --> 53:52.600
that Linux is gonna do a great job,

53:52.600 --> 53:54.000
but it's not always the right tool.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.960
And we shouldn't judge people for not using it.

53:55.960 --> 53:59.040
I happen to like it a lot, but it's fine if you don't.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.000
Really.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.080
I stumbled into a conversation thread

54:04.080 --> 54:06.760
on YouTube and on Reddit over the weekend

54:06.760 --> 54:11.280
where somebody was being outed for running Windows

54:11.280 --> 54:14.000
who was supposed to be like a Linux developer.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.280
And they were outed for using Windows 10.

54:17.280 --> 54:21.960
And I just felt like it was, like it's sort of old now.

54:21.960 --> 54:23.600
It's like we kind of moved past all that.

54:23.600 --> 54:25.040
It seems like it's one of those things

54:25.040 --> 54:27.160
that people like to just hang on.

54:27.160 --> 54:29.040
And I get being a purist,

54:29.040 --> 54:32.000
but in that same vein, I think it's always just right

54:32.000 --> 54:34.640
to use the tool that's good for the job,

54:34.640 --> 54:36.200
that's perfect for the job, you know.

54:36.200 --> 54:37.520
And when a lot of us came to this,

54:37.520 --> 54:39.480
I mean, before you learned about licenses

54:39.480 --> 54:40.560
and all of these things,

54:40.560 --> 54:41.560
or maybe you came into computers

54:41.560 --> 54:44.480
before the open source and free software movements,

54:45.760 --> 54:47.200
computers are tools to do things.

54:47.200 --> 54:49.160
We're excited about playing with them and using them.

54:49.160 --> 54:50.320
And yes, I think for a lot of us,

54:50.320 --> 54:52.120
once you discover open source and free software,

54:52.120 --> 54:53.320
you're like, okay, this makes sense.

54:53.320 --> 54:56.120
This is how we should try to be doing things for computers.

54:56.120 --> 54:57.480
It's just a natural fit,

54:57.480 --> 54:59.280
but there's still a whole bunch of tools out there

54:59.280 --> 55:02.960
that are very useful in a huge range of fields.

55:02.960 --> 55:03.800
And they're still great.

55:03.800 --> 55:04.640
Yeah, well said.

55:05.600 --> 55:09.760
It's funny because while we look at things like Fedora 32,

55:09.760 --> 55:12.640
and we talk about Ubuntu 20.04,

55:12.640 --> 55:14.800
it doesn't seem like I have this view,

55:14.800 --> 55:17.720
but I truly do see this as sort of a post-distro show.

55:17.720 --> 55:18.920
Like it's all great.

55:18.920 --> 55:20.040
It's all good.

55:20.040 --> 55:21.680
And it's just different kinds of good

55:21.680 --> 55:23.240
for different use cases.

55:23.240 --> 55:24.840
Like this show can get into Mint.

55:24.840 --> 55:26.320
I can put myself in that head space

55:26.320 --> 55:28.440
and I can appreciate things like time shift

55:28.440 --> 55:29.760
and the way the updates are labeled out

55:29.760 --> 55:32.200
or I can get myself in the head space of,

55:32.200 --> 55:33.920
even we tried out Regolith recently.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.320
I was like, actually kind of like this.

55:35.320 --> 55:36.600
I get it.

55:36.600 --> 55:38.840
And it's because when you step back and you remove

55:38.840 --> 55:40.320
that sort of like, well, it should be like

55:40.320 --> 55:41.360
this kind of thing.

55:42.240 --> 55:44.480
And you just roll with kind of the awesome software

55:44.480 --> 55:45.320
that it is.

55:45.320 --> 55:47.160
It sort of doesn't really make sense

55:47.160 --> 55:49.120
to have these different camps and tribes

55:49.120 --> 55:50.000
in different distros,

55:50.000 --> 55:51.800
cause they're all using the same upstream stuff.

55:51.800 --> 55:53.360
They're all struggling with the same problems.

55:53.360 --> 55:57.480
And often in almost, not all, but in a lot of cases,

55:57.480 --> 55:59.360
maybe the majority of cases, behind the scenes,

55:59.360 --> 56:02.000
the developers chat with each other.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.440
They work on multiple projects.

56:04.440 --> 56:06.800
It's not uncommon for them to work on several.

56:06.800 --> 56:08.280
Especially in the open source world, right?

56:08.280 --> 56:09.920
Where there's all these shared fundamentals.

56:09.920 --> 56:11.560
Neil, what are the different distributions

56:11.560 --> 56:13.280
you contribute to on a regular basis?

56:13.280 --> 56:15.520
Oh boy, let's see.

56:15.520 --> 56:18.160
Primarily I'm involved in Fedora and OpenSUSE,

56:18.160 --> 56:21.120
but I also work in Magia, OpenMandriva.

56:21.120 --> 56:23.360
A little tiny sliver in Debian.

56:23.360 --> 56:26.680
I've got a little bit more than a sliver in Ubuntu.

56:26.680 --> 56:29.680
I used to work on a couple of other distributions

56:29.680 --> 56:32.720
like Unity and a few other,

56:32.720 --> 56:35.800
Unity Linux and a couple of others.

56:35.800 --> 56:39.960
I have done a little bit in Alpine, some in Void.

56:39.960 --> 56:41.720
There was a little bit of time

56:41.720 --> 56:43.520
where I was working with the Exervo people.

56:43.520 --> 56:45.560
But Neil, some of those are competitors with Fedora,

56:45.560 --> 56:46.680
you madman.

56:46.680 --> 56:52.760
I'm sorry to break your heart, Chris, but for the most part,

56:52.760 --> 56:56.840
all of us talk to each other and work with each other fairly often.

56:56.840 --> 56:58.360
Some more than others.

56:58.360 --> 57:00.960
There are some that like to live on their little islands.

57:00.960 --> 57:05.920
But in general, at least within the larger distro communities,

57:05.920 --> 57:08.160
to a great extent,

57:08.160 --> 57:11.760
we do talk to each other and work with each other on common problems.

57:11.760 --> 57:13.240
It's common software.

57:13.240 --> 57:15.080
That's why the tribalism between the distros,

57:15.080 --> 57:17.920
I think is sort of silly and that's why I call this a post-distro show

57:17.920 --> 57:19.200
in that sense.

57:19.200 --> 57:23.360
And I apply that same logic to judging people for other tools that they use.

57:23.360 --> 57:25.160
I just don't think it really makes a lot of sense.

57:25.160 --> 57:30.560
I do find a certain important moral value in free software,

57:30.560 --> 57:34.440
but I don't need to have somebody else subscribe to that same moral value.

57:34.440 --> 57:38.920
And just like I happen to like the Linux flavors I like,

57:38.920 --> 57:42.400
but there's such a range and variety of different distros and Linux users

57:42.400 --> 57:43.240
that it's fine.

57:43.240 --> 57:44.280
Yeah, we just celebrate that.

57:44.280 --> 57:45.600
We're all using the same stuff.

57:45.600 --> 57:51.400
What is the purpose of this show of JB in general of what we're doing here?

57:51.400 --> 57:53.800
It's to further the open source agenda, isn't it?

57:53.800 --> 57:54.640
Absolutely.

57:54.640 --> 57:56.840
Free software rules the world.

57:56.840 --> 58:01.200
Yeah, and to help others find it and be part of a community.

58:01.200 --> 58:05.640
And sometimes, to quote the orange one in the chat,

58:05.640 --> 58:08.720
sometimes it's about using the best tool rather than the right tool.

58:08.720 --> 58:12.440
Yeah, and I think Linux is the right tool for a lot of jobs.

58:12.440 --> 58:14.320
And that's what we talk about here.

58:14.320 --> 58:19.440
And for a lot of us, it's sufficient that it's all you need.

58:19.440 --> 58:27.520
I had a great chat with Neil about Pagoo, a GitLab alternative.

58:27.520 --> 58:30.240
We just dedicated an extras to that that came out this morning.

58:30.240 --> 58:32.120
It's 14 minutes long, so it's just a quick one.

58:32.120 --> 58:34.240
Extras.show slash 69.

58:34.240 --> 58:36.960
If you are curious about a self-hosted GitLab alternative

58:36.960 --> 58:42.040
that few projects are involved with these days, some less than before,

58:42.040 --> 58:44.800
and then, of course, the free software is rolling out,

58:44.800 --> 58:48.880
it's GitLab-like solution that we based on.

58:48.880 --> 58:49.560
Pagoo?

58:49.560 --> 58:50.720
Prager?

58:50.720 --> 58:51.320
Pagger.

58:51.320 --> 58:51.800
Pagger.

58:51.800 --> 58:53.920
Troll.

58:53.920 --> 58:55.680
Oh, am I trolling again?

58:55.680 --> 58:57.480
Sometimes I do that.

58:57.480 --> 59:00.920
All right, well, go find more of my work at chrislast.com.

59:00.920 --> 59:04.400
Go find more of Wes at wespain.

59:04.400 --> 59:07.520
And of course, at techsnap.systems.

59:07.520 --> 59:08.960
What else should we plug?

59:08.960 --> 59:09.880
At Cheese Bacon?

59:09.880 --> 59:11.080
Is that your handle cheese?

59:11.080 --> 59:13.280
Yeah, that's me on the Twitter, at Cheese Bacon.

59:13.280 --> 59:14.480
There you go.

59:14.480 --> 59:16.880
And of course, you can find us in the Telegram as well.

59:16.880 --> 59:19.120
We'd love to have you join us live on Tuesday.

59:19.120 --> 59:21.560
Get that converted at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash

59:21.560 --> 59:22.640
calendar.

59:22.640 --> 59:24.200
And you can always jump in that IRC.

59:24.200 --> 59:27.760
It's irc.geekshed.net pound jupiterbroadcasting.

59:27.760 --> 59:29.440
You don't want us to switch to Discord.

59:29.440 --> 59:30.320
Use the IRC.

59:30.320 --> 59:30.960
It's real easy.

59:30.960 --> 59:34.760
Just go to jblive.tv to get the stream and IRC embedded right there.

59:34.760 --> 59:35.320
Boom.

59:35.320 --> 59:37.280
See you next Tuesday.

59:37.280 --> 59:42.280
Bye.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.520
Unplugged program.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.280
All right, jbtitles.com.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.240
Cool, bro.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.680
Is the bot working?

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.760
Let's check.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.760
I rebooted it earlier.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.200
You snuck in there and rebooted it before we started.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.280
Good thinking.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.640
You know, you just got to reboot the bot.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.240
You know what we need is a bot command that reboots itself.

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.000
Metabot.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.760
Yeah, a master bot.

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.680
We need to start porting JBot to Discord right away.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.320
It's not a horrible idea, actually.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.640
Ideally, though, in the same crippled format.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:38.560
We don't want to improve it too much.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.400
Right, absolutely.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:43.200
Something you have to kill from time to time.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.840
It's troublesome personality.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.960
What I think is interesting, too, is that, you know,

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.000
this talk about Discord and tools and so on and so forth,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
we all know that Discord's using open source technologies

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:53.840
under the hood.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.640
Oh, yeah.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:55.960
They're written in Elixir.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.640
Yeah, well, and you know, their servers

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:58.720
are all on the back end.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.560
I know that's so true for so many services.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.440
It's a tricky line there.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.920
So first, I actually would have been

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.480
real interested if you guys had decided

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:11.480
to do like a JB network matrix to replace Geek Shed.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.080
But one thing I know, I mean, I think

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.080
it'd be way more successful than the IRC server is.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.120
But when it comes to things like Discord and Slack

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.800
and all of those, like, they're all proprietary solutions.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.320
And I'm kind of stuck having to use them for various reasons

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.360
and like whatever.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.080
Like, I grit my teeth and deal with it.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.080
But the thing that annoys me more

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.520
is the fact that they're so bad at contributing back

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.360
to the community.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.720
Like, they build lots of stuff.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.520
They clearly do.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.880
They build really innovative things.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:48.440
But they don't, to some degree, share the wealth back

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:51.960
to the community to help build bigger and better solutions.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.840
And that's the part that I get more annoyed

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:56.520
about more than anything else.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.240
Hmm.

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.000
Hmm.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
That's what I say there.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.120
That doesn't sound good.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.520
Until those engineers move on to another job with the skills

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:07.560
they picked up at Discord and build something else better,

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.000
maybe this time it will be open.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:09.640
Who knows?

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.160
Possibly.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.000
Possibly.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.800
That's what I always hope for.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.720
Well, I certainly picked up most of my skills

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:18.040
working on software that will never see the light of day

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:21.080
publicly for companies that are obviously

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.800
paying me money to do so.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.240
And here I am contributing.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.320
So it does happen.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.440
Just maybe not quite in the ways we hope.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.440
I would say you probably also picked up

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.000
a lot of hardware skills when you worked at the Apple store.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.160
And now you're building home-assisted controlled

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:34.720
devices.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:38.680
So we all kind of come full circle.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.960
Alex, tell me about the printing factory

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.200
you've turned into over there.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.000
Oh, my god.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.640
I'm so bored of 3D printing.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.460
I've printed nearly 300 face shields for medical workers

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:49.560
over the last seven days.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.640
Ooh, very nice.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.000
That's great, though.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.640
About $500 in donations and lots and lots

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.080
of folks in local nursing homes and hospitals and stuff.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.080
Very, very grateful.

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:02.480
So I'll be so happy when the big molds come online

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.160
and I can stop.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.660
But for now, I think it's a valuable public service.

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.160
Do people come by and pick them up,

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.280
or do you have to deliver them?

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:08.920
Yep.

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:11.280
All hours of the day, I have given out

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.840
batches of 20 or 30 at a time.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.960
They cost about $0.50 to make each.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.760
And people generally seem to be donating about $1 each

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.840
to cover filament costs and electric and time

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.880
and that sort of stuff.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.880
So it's been really great to see the community pull together.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:26.840
That is really neat.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.320
I'll drop the link to the blog post you wrote there, Alex.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:33.080
I jumped on it, too, and had been printing them and was lucky

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.560
enough that the school donated their filament

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.360
from their 3D printer that's on the fritz

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.880
and also donated a ton of transparency sheets

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:45.280
for the actual face shield part.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.240
But if anyone out there is interested,

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.760
I'd know, Neil, you have a 3D printer.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.440
Jump on it.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.200
You know what?

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.640
You guys just earned a taco.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.560
Good job.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.920
Yes.
