00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
This is the Linux Unplugged, episode 191 on April 4th, 2017.

00:18.000 --> 00:27.000
My name is Wes and welcome to this week's episode of Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's throwing a party while the boss is away.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
We've got an awesome show for you this week, but we're mixing things up.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Chris, oh Chris, he is traveling the country, headed to Texas, as I'm sure you all know.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
We don't need him though, that's right, no, we don't need him, we've got a huge show.

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
We're gonna talk a lot of stuff, we've got the latest from all your favorite open source projects, plus something from Telegram,

00:47.000 --> 00:54.000
some cool pictures that can finally explain containers in Docker, and an elegant Vim distribution that will make you say,

00:54.000 --> 01:01.000
is this Emacs? Plus the latest from Libreboot and their relationship with the Free Software Foundation.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
Some stuff, interesting stuff from Fedora. They claim, hey, Hacker News, you're picky about desktops?

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Wait, wait, Fedora and Gnome, we've got what you need.

01:12.000 --> 01:21.000
Then, did you know Android, yeah, that's right, Android has overtaken Windows as the Internet's most used operating system?

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
We discuss, what does that mean for Linux, for Windows, for the world at large?

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
And then, we get into, I'm sure, what will be a heated discussion.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
What does it mean to be a proper distro?

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
So, how are we gonna do all this?

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
Can't be just me, no, we have a special guest this week, that's right.

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
It's a little bit interesting this week, we are joined by our friend, new to the network, you heard him here last week, Joe Ressington.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Welcome to the show, Joe.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Hey, thanks, man.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Wonderful to have you.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Hopefully, I'm sounding a bit better this time.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Absolutely, sounding great. I think we're in for an excellent show today.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Let's see, we're gonna cover some, got some just interesting news updates,

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
some follow-ups to projects that we've been following along in past episodes.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
Before we get to all of that, though, let me introduce the thing that makes this show what it is,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
our wonderful Mumble Room.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Greetings.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Hello, Wes.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Welcome, everybody.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
It's wonderful to have you here, thank you for joining me.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Chris is away, he's venturing across the country down to Texas.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I'm sure you've all been following along, go check out his vlog.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
If not, it's a lot of fun.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
So, Joe and I are running the show today with your gracious help.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
So, let's see, first up, you may have heard this, a lot of people on the network are using it.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Our friends over at Telegram, why they've introduced voice calling,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
and I believe it's coming to Linux as well.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
This is just a little bit of an update, but it really highlighted for me some of the things like

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
why I have mixed feelings about Telegram.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
So, over the past few months, we've worked hard to make sure Telegram calls are the best

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
in terms of quality, speed, and security.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
The wait is over.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Today, we're rolling out voice calls in Western Europe.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
The rest of the world will get them very soon as well.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
So, that seems pretty exciting.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Does that mean I get it before you, Wes?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Yes, I think it does.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Ah, I'm jealous.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
I mean, I don't know.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I don't know about you, Joe.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I don't use video calls all that often.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
I mean, I have occasionally maybe like a more for like a work conference really than, you know,

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
casual acquaintances or spouses or anything like that.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Yeah, and the thing is, it's not like there aren't enough options already.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
This is just yet another one, which I suppose is good in a way, but it just, it feels a bit redundant to me.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I can't see myself really using it.

03:38.000 --> 03:46.000
Yeah, so some of the things that stood out to me, like they have a quote here from the article.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
That's why we've improved the key exchange mechanism.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
To make sure your call is 100% secure, you and your recipient just need to compare four emoji over the phone.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
No lengthy codes or complicated pictures.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Now, the emoji idea is kind of interesting, but it really brings back to like kind of the questionable security.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
Telegram rolling their own security, and like I understand the marketing you want, you know, especially today,

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
especially after all the news with FTC, etc.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Privacy is important.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
It's nice to see that they think that their base likes privacy, but just saying things like 100% secure, I'm not sure.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
They also talk a lot about how each time you make a voice call on Telegram, a neural network learns from you and your devices feedback.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I don't have a problem with that.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
They highlight that they're not listening to your calls necessarily.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
It's more just metadata about it.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Just the hype. I was excited to see the feature.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
I won't use it, but the hype around the article kind of rubbed me the wrong way.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
What do you guys think?

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
Well, I mean, I'm looking at this emoji thing, and why can't they just use four numbers or four characters?

04:43.000 --> 04:52.000
Surely it's easier to just say B-A-U-O or something rather than kind of a sun smiley face thing and kind of two things.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
What if they were saying P-E-B-C-D?

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
And it's basically the same sound where as you say goat, broccoli, something like that.

05:03.000 --> 05:12.000
It's because there are lots and lots of emoji and there are only 10 numbers and there are only 26 alphabetic characters in the Latin alphabet.

05:12.000 --> 05:22.000
It's way easier to generate very long keys and then turn those into one of a number of like a small number of emojis

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
than it would be to generate a long key and then get you to read that long key out.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
That's a better point.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I still think it's easier to just say it as well.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
So there's like multi factor.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Yeah, that may be true.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Anyway, I'm still using Telegram.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I've been playing with wire a little bit.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
There are you know, there's also signal.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
I saw some progress on signal no longer needing or acquiring the Google Play libraries.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
I'm not sure what the status of that is.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Telegram for me just has kind of the people that are using it in my life.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
But I really would I would like to not be as hooked to the platform.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Well, the thing is, you're going to end up hooked to yet another platform, aren't you?

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Because even if you get a few friends on that.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Right, that's the danger of even trying it out.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
And if I'm still using WhatsApp, I'm using Telegram, do I really need another one?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Yeah, exactly.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
The wire one is interesting because it has the open sourcing of the server.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
So that one is the most interesting because you can do like a private wire.

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
And that's what that's what I'm most curious about when they say the end of quarter one, which is basically over now.

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
But they could still say, you know, somewhere in April, they could release it and still be technically around quarter one.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
Right. Yeah. OK. Interesting. Well, we'll have to have to stay tuned for that then.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
The Telegram phone calls I've played with it and it is interesting.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
They are bugs where if you don't have your phone on, it doesn't ring.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
But if you are on your phone, it rings like a regular phone call and you just answer it from the notifications or whatever, however you want.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
And it is pretty cool. It does work pretty well.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
And the quality of the sound is a lot higher than I would have expected.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
And the second the last thing that's important is that I don't think there's any video.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I think it's just audio.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
Ah, OK. I see. I think I think the video part is new that it's just coming. I don't think it's hit the states yet.

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
Oh, yeah. They said that the other phone call was going to go to the was Europe, then the states.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
And then I guess they're going to do the video rollout the same way. OK, that makes sense. Excellent.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
Well, yes, I will say the one thing about it that that has always in the past, it has just I mean, it's snappy.

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
It works. I don't have a lot of problems with it generally. So so in that case, I look forward to seeing what they continue to do.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
OK, so on to our next story this week, this one also just like a quick little update.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
I really like seeing things explained with pictures. It's not always easy to do.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
But in a world filled with man pictures, which don't get me wrong, man pictures are great. I love them.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
I use them all the time. And personally, I prefer kind of longer form articles over necessarily like a video.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Videos have their place. But for me, I generally will read like a longer tutorial.

08:05.000 --> 08:14.000
But especially for communicating something in a presentation or a talk or to people who perhaps don't have an hour to read an article.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
I think explaining complex ideas and pictures really can be a big win. So I just want to talk.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
There's a Consolia comic dot com. I had not seen it before.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
It's mostly about programming and nerd stuff drawn by a back end developer, which explains why it looks so bad.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
But really, I think it looks pretty good. It's not amazing. It's not, you know, beautiful design work or anything like that.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
But I like the concept. So just looking at their most recent issue, containers and Docker.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
And so especially on Linux where containers aren't necessarily, you know, a first class concept.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
You've got cgroups and namespaces and other things. I thought this was a nice little just a nice little drawing to come check out.

08:47.000 --> 08:54.000
Explain to people who maybe, you know, they come from somewhere else. They haven't used this concept. They're migrating from Windows.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I thought it was a useful diagram. So maybe you guys will, too.

08:57.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah, it breaks it down nicely and just makes it kind of visual, which is, as you said, rather than trying to read through loads of stuff, there's quite a lot of writing with it as well.

09:05.000 --> 09:11.000
But even if you just scroll down and just catch the pictures, you can get an idea of how containers and Docker and all that kind of stuff works.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
So, yes, worth checking out.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
Do you use containers, Docker, that sort of technology very much on your end, Joe?

09:18.000 --> 09:25.000
Not really. I tend to be more old school, really. I don't have the requirement for it, really.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
Experimenting with snaps and stuff like that, and Maro uses containers.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
But no, I mean, I don't get in depth enough with the kind of servers I have to run.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
It's all very straightforward stuff. So not yet.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
Maybe this is a good opportunity. You know, I got to talk to you last week, but other than that, we haven't done a show before.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
So I don't really know that much about your background. I've listened to some of your podcasts, of course, which I enjoy very much.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
But what do you do as your day job or other things?

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Oh, that's a mystery. I don't let anyone know that.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Oh, excellent. That's even better.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
I solve problems, basically, as my day job.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
No, I don't solve cases. I solve problems for people. All sorts of problems for people is what I do.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
Oh, excellent. Jack of all trades, or Joe of all trades, whatever.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Yeah, pretty much.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
All right. So on to our next story.

10:16.000 --> 10:24.000
Recently, I've been doing some development work in a language called Clojure, which is a Lisp for the JVM, in search of a very good development environment for that.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
I ended up using Emacs, but I have never been an Emacs user.

10:27.000 --> 10:37.000
I've always kind of used Vim very minimally, especially, you know, if I'm just writing Python or for other dynamic languages where I don't need a heavy IDE, really.

10:37.000 --> 10:48.000
Then I found SpaceMax, and SpaceMax is an Emacs distribution that's kind of targeted towards Vim users and people who want easier setup or kind of a pre-built thing that has a lot of pluggable options.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
And then I saw SpaceVim, an elegant Vim distribution inspired by SpaceMax.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
What is SpaceVim?

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
SpaceVim is a Vim distribution for Vim plugins, resources, and is compatible with both Vim and NeoVim.

10:59.000 --> 11:06.000
It is inspired by SpaceMax and mimics SpaceMax in a high level, especially in the whole architecture, key bindings, and GUI.

11:06.000 --> 11:17.000
So I don't know if this will be interesting or anything, but I've had some very positive experiences with SpaceMax as a newcomer to the Emacs realm where I really, you know, maybe if I like it, I'm going to keep using it over the next years,

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
then sure, I can, you know, dive in, learn Emacs Lisp, figure out how to actually configure it, those kinds of things.

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
But SpaceMax made it really easy for me to kind of pick up and go and just focus on doing the development work that I was trying to do.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Joe, Mumble Room, do you guys have any strong preferences?

11:32.000 --> 11:40.000
I don't want to get into an editor war here, but do you see value in maybe an extra configuration layer, especially for things where, you know, there's different plugin systems?

11:40.000 --> 11:52.000
This can kind of provide a way to have one, one might argue, an additional way to do it, but one kind of higher level way to get started with configuration.

11:52.000 --> 12:08.000
So, you know, I'm not much use on this, but I can see if you're, you know, if you're a dev and you're using it every day, then this could be a useful way to, as you say, like a higher level config,

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
certainly getting into it if you're making the transition from Nano to a proper text editor.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I really started a war there.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Proper, yes.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
No, I know, I know many Nano users, Chris included, of this program.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
It's a fine, it's a fine editor.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
And, you know, one thing you can say about it is it lets you focus on the text that you're editing and nothing else.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
So that's nice, too.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Yeah, the Unix philosophy, do one thing and do it well.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Yeah, right. Yes, exactly that.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
There is, there is no Space Nano, so it's dead to me, this whole initiative.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah, no, that's fair.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Space Nano, maybe we'll have to do that.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
So listeners, if you like the Space theme, maybe you like these editors,

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
I do think you should give them a shot if you're new to Vim or Emacs, though I've not tried Space Vim yet.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Maybe someone will make a Space Nano.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
Well, if you want to, you know, better configure Nano to be better, you can use Emacs or Vim.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Yeah, there you go.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Good one.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Or Sublime Text.

13:10.000 --> 13:18.000
Yes, that's true, Sublime Text, Atom, VS Code, there's kind of a plethora of options, even if you don't go into the full IDE space.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Or just use Pluma.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Yeah.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Or gedit.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Good choice, it's a fine, fine editor.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I know I've seen a couple like more minimal ones.

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
I think one's actually called Joe that are kind of trying to fill that same.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Yeah, there's Joe and Jed.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Yeah, Jed, right.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
And Mike Cronow as well, which is very good.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
I think it's a good problem to have here.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Okay, so moving on, that was just some updates.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
We've got another update.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
We talked about this recently about Libreboot in general, kind of what their mission is,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
some of their interactions with other projects.

13:58.000 --> 14:07.000
You guys may remember that Libreboot and the Free Software Foundation have been kind of in a state of discord.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
So now there's an update from the Libreboot project.

14:10.000 --> 14:19.000
You can argue about the interpretation, but one way that it's been stated is Libreboot no longer opposes the GNU project or the Free Software Foundation.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
We have made peace.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
So they write, over the past six months, the Libreboot project has been in a state of discord.

14:25.000 --> 14:34.000
After an issue with a transgender employee at the FSF escalated, Libreboot publicly left GNU with little consultation from the community.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Relations with so many people were strained.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
They were broken, lines of code never written.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
The chaos needs to come to an end.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
With all this in mind, were the allegations against the Free Software Foundation true?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Perhaps, perhaps not.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
At this point, it doesn't matter.

14:48.000 --> 14:55.000
Indeed, it is unlikely that Libreboot will ever rejoin the GNU, but feuding in an already fragmented community helps nobody.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
The world of free software is shrinking and under attack.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Though the FSF may make mistakes from time to time, so do we.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
We do not need another divide.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
No more royal we, no more notorious surprises, no more late-night typo fixes.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Transparency and collaboration are the way forward.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
So that's what we get from the latest from the Libreboot project.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Joe, what did you think about this?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Had you followed?

15:18.000 --> 15:25.000
You know, they only joined the FSF, it looks like, I was reading some old The Ferronix articles, in May of 2016.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
So really, it's barely been a year, not even.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
There's been a lot of drama in that short time.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
Yeah, I mean, I've been following this story for what feels like a year or more now.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
Well, actually, probably less than that, about six months, maybe.

15:39.000 --> 15:48.000
And yeah, the head dev of Libreboot just fell out with the Free Software Foundation and decided to divorce from GNU.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
And then it sort of went quiet for a while.

15:50.000 --> 15:59.000
And then we heard from Storm and I think he piped up and said that, well, it's not your decision to make, but we'll let you do it anyway, we'll let you go.

15:59.000 --> 16:07.000
Whereas now, it turns out that I think it's Leah Rowe was in charge or was in charge.

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
But now it's looking like she has admitted that it wasn't a great way to kind of go on.

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
And she wasn't in the right kind of mental place, I suppose, to make those decisions.

16:19.000 --> 16:27.000
And I suppose it highlights that if you've got one person in charge of a project, how that can cause problems.

16:27.000 --> 16:36.000
If you don't have a kind of democracy or at least a team of people there, if it's one person calling all the shots for it, then that's when these things can happen.

16:36.000 --> 16:42.000
And at the end of the day, drama and politics, it's great for shows like this for us to talk about something.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
But really, we want harmony, don't we?

16:44.000 --> 16:55.000
We want people getting on with porting Libreboot to as many different chipsets as possible, trying to get some properly free software running machines top to bottom.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
And drama like this is not going to help that.

16:59.000 --> 17:17.000
Well, also, let's point out that the reason the Libreboot decided to leave was because the person who was fired from GNU or the FSF was a completely different person from the fallout of what happened.

17:17.000 --> 17:31.000
And the person who was fired was claimed by the leader of Libreboot that the person was fired because of being a transgender, which was not true.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
And the person who was actually fired has never made a statement on it.

17:35.000 --> 17:57.000
So it's really an overreaction situation, but it's nice to know that they calmed down and started reacting to a normal state of we should be working on getting things done rather than freaking out over the employment of other people.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
Yeah, I mean, we don't really know exactly what went on is the main problem there.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
You know, we only got kind of, you know, a hearsay, basically.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
So it's pointless to really speculate on the politics of it.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
And I think that that's why really the best thing to do is concentrate on, look, this seems to have been resolved now.

18:14.000 --> 18:22.000
And, you know, hopefully we can get some code written and some machines running totally free software.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Yeah, that sounds that sounds awesome.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Yeah, we can get back to.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
So, I mean, I was hopeful about the tone.

18:28.000 --> 18:39.000
Hopefully people can can really have some peace and feel better about things and just get to get to work, get some awesome things, de-blobbed, continue the march to freedom.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
Anyone else have anything they'd like to add on that story?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I feel like it's a non statement.

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
And it's like, oh, we've settled things, but we're not going to tell you what actually happened or be transparent about you.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
We just started drama for some reason.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
We're not going to state that reason.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
And I understand that there may be privacy.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Maybe the person's involved at one state.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
I feel like it's just causing it could just be causing drama for drama's sake.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
And it's really not helpful.

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
So, Debbie, would you describe that as and the value of this is negative?

19:17.000 --> 19:25.000
Yes, I would just say if it's personal, take it up with them, solve it, don't make it public.

19:25.000 --> 19:36.000
There was a recent problem with the Drupal project that was personal about someone's personal life and did not need to be brought up at all.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
You don't really need this.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
You know, so it really is a double negative for me.

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
It's like, OK, why would I use sleeper then if this is how you react?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
So I don't know.

19:48.000 --> 19:59.000
I haven't really kept up to as much as other people, but it just seems like a not newsworthy item to me when they're just creating trauma.

19:59.000 --> 20:09.000
The other piece that's important and why I agree with actually everything you guys have brought up is that what ended up happening now is that Libra Boot has sort of spun off.

20:09.000 --> 20:15.000
And now we have Libra Core, which is sort of a broken up piece from Libra Boot.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Right. So this is the actual community members from Libra Boot.

20:18.000 --> 20:30.000
So Leo who was really the only person behind Libra Boot, which of course just takes core boot and doesn't ship with the blobs that come with core boot.

20:30.000 --> 20:42.000
And so now there's actually an effort to have a completely freed stack that's called Libra Core, which is outside of Leo's domain.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
And that's starting to gain traction within the core boot community.

20:45.000 --> 20:58.000
And the reason happens to be because of the kind of, I'll say, ridiculous nature of bringing in personal preference to something that shouldn't have ever been brought in to begin with.

20:58.000 --> 21:10.000
Right. It was a project, a community based project with a lot of people involved with one person that controlled the Wiki and the GitHub account and could kind of go rogue.

21:10.000 --> 21:17.000
So that's one of the reasons that Libra Core is now gaining traction, just so you guys know.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Does this speak to a larger problem?

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
Does this speak to a larger problem in the kind of community driven software?

21:23.000 --> 21:32.000
Whereas, you know, with more with commercial software and a lot of proprietary software that is commercial, you've got a human resources department that is probably going to stop this stuff going public.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
You know, it will be dealt with internally.

21:34.000 --> 21:44.000
Whereas with community projects, you don't have that management structure there and things just end up leaking out onto the Internet and drama happens as a result.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
You know, I think that's a great point to raise.

21:49.000 --> 22:00.000
I think that Libra Boot sort of is the quintessential example of what not to do in the case of a community driven project.

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
And I don't really know of many others that we can point to that sort of have that issue.

22:06.000 --> 22:23.000
So in most cases, I'd say people would be saying about something that they is hearsay from a friend of theirs and they might they would actually take that up through the proper channels rather than turning it into a very public flame war.

22:23.000 --> 22:34.000
So if there were a bunch of examples, then I think that it could be start to become a concern. But as it is right now, I can literally only think of that one as the example.

22:34.000 --> 22:46.000
It reminds me of all the times that Linus gets called out in press because he said something harsh about someone's code and they end up taking it personally because that's how they take it.

22:46.000 --> 22:59.000
That's what this kind of reminds me about. And the reporting upon it by whoever, because they're focusing on the personal aspect and not the technological aspect.

22:59.000 --> 23:11.000
So where I actually think that is a valid point that my only counter to that is that Linus is speaking about something that is taken out of context.

23:11.000 --> 23:24.000
In this case, Libra Bout or specifically Leah Rowe is the one who took it all out of context on her own and then announced everything and basically making a big deal of it.

23:24.000 --> 23:34.000
So that would be the same analogy. The same analogy would be that Linus basically starting to have a blow up fit and trying to take it to the press and make sure that everybody's aware of things.

23:34.000 --> 23:49.000
But your point's not lost in that a lot of times these personal attacks or even a non-intentional personal attack can sort of explode.

23:49.000 --> 23:57.000
I think that's a very good summary of this whole incident and we'll just kind of have to wait and see what happens next.

23:57.000 --> 24:08.000
I think now that brings us to some happier news. It's time to talk about our first sponsor of this fine Linux Unplugged program and that is our friends over at Linux Academy.

24:08.000 --> 24:19.000
What is Linux Academy? Linux Academy is the best place to go learn all the latest Linux DevOps system administration skills that the market is craving for.

24:19.000 --> 24:35.000
Go check out them. Go to linuxacademy.com. That's our little promo code. That gets you a seven day free trial where you can get started learning Ruby, Python, Chef, basic Linux server administration.

24:35.000 --> 24:41.000
You can study for a Red Hat certificate. They've got so much great stuff at Linux Academy.

24:41.000 --> 24:50.000
One thing I've always really liked about them, I mean I've kind of been following this since they got started, even before they became a sponsor on this show, and they really are Linux advocates.

24:50.000 --> 24:59.000
They're people who use Linux. They eat their own dog food. They use Linux to run their company. They've used Linux in their personal lives and they understand how Linux gets used.

24:59.000 --> 25:10.000
I've also been very impressed and even among kind of older, crafty sys admins who would say they don't need this site or what is this new thing.

25:10.000 --> 25:17.000
No, Linux Academy has seen massive adoption across the industry. It's quickly becoming something that you can point to and say, look, I've done these courses.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
Yeah, it doesn't mean that I'm a senior level principal expert, but it does show that you've got real hands on experience.

25:23.000 --> 25:32.000
It gives employers a way to kind of assess, well, if they've passed these courses, if they've had these real instructors there to teach them these things, they know it's a good environment to learn.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
Plus, they've really got a lot of good stuff for DevOps.

25:35.000 --> 25:43.000
So even if you've been doing Linux for years, but maybe now your company's moving to the cloud, you have to embrace AWS, you're suddenly using a new configuration management system,

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
Linux Academy is a great place to turn to figure all that out in a structured way.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
I know when I'm learning something, a lot of times it's fun, right?

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
Especially here in this community, we like these kinds of technologies. We like playing with them.

25:56.000 --> 26:04.000
I can find it can get pretty easy to get distracted and, oh, I'm learning this new language and something got engrossed in this feature, but really that's not what I need to be doing.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
What I need to be doing is learning the high level fundamentals.

26:07.000 --> 26:15.000
The rest, you know, you learn as you do on the job when you're working on a project and Linux Academy has distilled these things down to step by step video courses.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
They've got downloadable comprehensive study guides.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Plus, you know, you want to learn AWS.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Don't worry about their weird free tier.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
Don't worry about putting your credit card on the line and then leaving the server running and getting a big bill in the mail.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
I think that's happened to just about everyone who has done that.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Now, Linux Academy, they take care of that for you.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
They spin up the servers.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
They make sure that the distribution you're studying, that's the distribution you get.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
If you want to study a different distribution, they remap all the commands for you.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
They've got their guides for those different distributions.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
They've customized it for you.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
It's just always getting better.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
So don't waste any more time.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Go learn in a structured way.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Give it a try.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
Head on over to Linux Academy dot com slash unplug.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Start your seven day free trial today.

26:54.000 --> 27:01.000
And if you have a good time, let them know that the Linux unplugged program sent you over.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Ah, good old Linux Academy.

27:03.000 --> 27:09.000
So if that's gotten you excited for Linux, and it should if you're here for the Linux unplugged program,

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
I think our next little bit of news item, it struck me, it's interesting.

27:12.000 --> 27:22.000
So this is an article over on blogs dot gnome dot org talking about Hacker News feedback on what they want from their desktop.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
Fedora and Gnome say, hey, we've got it.

27:26.000 --> 27:34.000
So it starts out that there was a thread on Hacker News based on a question from a canonical employee asking for feedback on what people want from the next version of Ubuntu.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
I always try to read such threads, even when they are not about Fedora or Red Hat.

27:38.000 --> 27:48.000
In fact, I often read such articles and threads about non-Linux systems, too, to help understand what people are looking for and thus enable us to prioritize what we do with Fedora Workstation even better.

27:48.000 --> 27:56.000
Over the last few years, I do feel we've managed to nail down what the major pain points are and cross them out one by one or gotten people assigned to work on them.

27:56.000 --> 28:02.000
So a lot of the items people ask for in that thread, we already have in the Fedora Workstation or have already on our roadmap.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
I mean, those two things are different, but whatever.

28:04.000 --> 28:10.000
So I thought it would be nice to write them up and maybe encourage people to take a look at Fedora Workstation if you haven't done so already.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
So just some things they highlight here on this list.

28:12.000 --> 28:18.000
They've got handling of DPI scaling and high DPI – what am I saying?

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
He does admit that things are not perfect yet, but there's active work ongoing.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
I've had some pretty good experiences with GNOME on Wayland and high DPI screens, but I only have a couple.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
I don't have one at home.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
I have some at work, so I don't have the most experience.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
It's nice to see that they take it seriously, though.

28:34.000 --> 28:40.000
Another one here, which I think a lot of people we may talk about later in the show struggle with, is multi-touch gestures.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
They really come from an OS X world.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
They're really used to those very nice touchpads.

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
Lots of algorithms going to determine just what you want, very nice gestures that have been developed over the years.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.000
So they say, this is another item that we've put significant effort into.

28:56.000 --> 29:02.000
Over the last three years, we've made sure we went from almost no touch support in the desktop to now supporting touch throughout the stack.

29:02.000 --> 29:09.000
The one big remaining item that was holding items like proper gestures back is that until kernel 4.12 is out,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
the Synaptics touchpad are using PS slash 2.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
This causes only two gestures to be reported, which is not great when you want three-fingered gestures.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Yeah, I think that's true.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
So just to quickly summarize some of the rest of the things, battery life is an item here on their list.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
I think that that's definitely an important one if you're using a laptop.

29:26.000 --> 29:32.000
They kind of show some of the nice, the GNOME battery bench here, which is kind of an interesting tool.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Next up is UEFI issues.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
There are people on the Hacker News thread talking about issues with UEFI.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.000
Once again, this is an era we have a dedicated engineer assigned to UEFI and making sure it works great.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
In fact, Peter Jones, who is our UEFI point man, is on the UEFI Standards Committee

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
doing ongoing work to ensure the standard is open source friendly and well supported by Linux.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
I will also add that Fedora did do a lot.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
Matthew Garrett helped there as well back in the day getting UEFI support.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
They built that shim bootloader.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
Some of the things that we rely on today, if you are in a required secure boot kind of environment

30:04.000 --> 30:09.000
or if you just want to take advantage of the UEFI that comes standard on so many laptops now.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
Just to round out the list, they've also got, hey, we've got Wayland support.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
That's true.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
If you install the latest Fedora release, you'll get GNOME on Wayland.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
I think that is pretty neat.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
It's nice to see them pushing things forward.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
They've also got something like Redshift.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
I know when I saw the news of Apple releasing the Redshift in their new OS X,

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
I was like, hey, are they copying GNOME there?

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
But you know what's missing from this list, Wes?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Yes, what?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Configurability.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Now, is it just me?

30:39.000 --> 30:45.000
Is it just that I want to be able to configure my desktop or is it just missing?

30:45.000 --> 30:51.000
Because could it be that people want a desktop like GNOME or Unity, which is pretty much this is how it is.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
You can configure it a tiny bit, but take it or leave it.

30:55.000 --> 31:01.000
Do people just want to fire up a desktop and just get on with it and not spend hours and hours configuring it?

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
I do think a lot of times I may fall into that location.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
I certainly have enjoyed configuration in the past, don't get me wrong.

31:09.000 --> 31:15.000
But for whatever reason lately, I really haven't had a main desktop, a main computer that I'm always at,

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
or one that doesn't kind of float between distributions or get re-imaged.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
And so I've kind of found a lot of value in GNOME for that.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
I mean, I do install a couple of plug-ins, maybe add a theme, but it's pretty minimal.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
And it gets me to a consistent environment that I can kind of just drop into, get some work done,

31:31.000 --> 31:37.000
pull up a terminal, pull up Slack, pull up Chrome and get to work.

31:37.000 --> 31:43.000
When I read through Dustin's post on Hacker News, the whole idea of configuration

31:43.000 --> 31:50.000
and exposing more options to rearrange the desktop didn't feature.

31:50.000 --> 31:59.000
It was really about refining things to a level that meet the expectations that people have come to expect from,

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
for example, Mac OS X.

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
So it was really about improving and making Bluetooth support bulletproof,

32:07.000 --> 32:14.000
improving high DPI support, although that one's interesting because the Unity 7 high DPI support is quite decent

32:14.000 --> 32:21.000
because you've got fractional scaling, whereas in GNOME it's integer only.

32:21.000 --> 32:27.000
So you can scale one, two, three, not 1.25, for example, which in that one, you know,

32:27.000 --> 32:34.000
the fractional scaling is quite handy because on like a 13 inch laptop with a 1080p screen on Unity,

32:34.000 --> 32:40.000
you can scale that to 1.25 and just make everything that little bit bigger.

32:40.000 --> 32:45.000
And it's quite a useful feature. And likewise, on laptops with, you know,

32:45.000 --> 32:54.000
the old 1280 by 800 resolution screens, the way you can zoom out, artificially create,

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
you know, additional desktop real estate.

32:58.000 --> 33:04.000
But it was, yeah, the things that I got out of that was it was about improving the essential stuff,

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
everything to do with input and output, basically human interaction.

33:08.000 --> 33:14.000
So trackpad support needed to be multi-touch and gesture. Bluetooth needed to be better.

33:14.000 --> 33:21.000
Wi-Fi needed to be more reliable. And that wasn't just in the wake of the recent issues.

33:21.000 --> 33:30.000
It was being competitive and power competitive with power usage, power consumption competitive with Windows

33:30.000 --> 33:37.000
and battery endurance needed to be improved on, you know, Linux in general.

33:37.000 --> 33:43.000
So that it was all about refinement rather than wholesale changes.

33:43.000 --> 33:48.000
Yeah, it does seem like something that people are kind of want to expect these days.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.000
I mean, new things are exciting, but you really want to see those kinds of refinement that you can really get.

33:53.000 --> 34:00.000
I know the last really positive review of Mint on this network was exactly what they felt, right?

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
Was like, yeah, you've hit it here. You've really dialed it in what you were doing.

34:03.000 --> 34:09.000
You've taken the time. You didn't make crazy improvements, but all those little details have been ironed out.

34:09.000 --> 34:14.000
That's a hard place to get to.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
May I jump in here?

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
Please do.

34:17.000 --> 34:25.000
My wish for mainstream desktops would be the independent treatment of monitors and virtual desktops on dual or multi-screen setups.

34:25.000 --> 34:32.000
Because I have that in enlightenment, but I haven't seen another window manager of Windows in my environment that can do that.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
Maybe it's possible on tiling managers too.

34:35.000 --> 34:40.000
So do you mean like a separate virtual desktop for each monitor?

34:40.000 --> 34:46.000
It's like, imagine you have a dual screen setup and you have four virtual desktop on each monitor.

34:46.000 --> 34:53.000
So on Unity, for example, if you switch the virtual desktop from one to two, you switch the two monitors.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
So imagine you only switch the left one and the right one stays the same.

34:57.000 --> 35:09.000
So in GNOME 3, on dual screen setups, you have one monitor that only stays on one virtual desktop and the other one has multiple virtual desktops.

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
So in enlightenment, the two monitors are completely treated independent.

35:14.000 --> 35:23.000
So I can have five virtual desktops on the left screen and four virtual desktops on the right screen and I can switch them independently.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
That's really cool.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
Yeah, that's a toolkit feature which some of the toolkits lack, unfortunately.

35:29.000 --> 35:39.000
Yeah, it's something you can do somewhat work around with Plasma, but I've tested it and most tiling window managers have the ability to do that.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.000
Yeah, I guess so. Tiling managers are easier to handle that, I guess.

35:44.000 --> 35:49.000
Yeah, I3 for sure, Xmodad for sure, I think Awesome does too.

35:49.000 --> 35:58.000
Enlightenment can do that too, so I run Enlightenment 21 now, but it was possible with Enlightenment 17 too.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
Nice. Well, I think that's a natural segue to our next article today.

36:03.000 --> 36:09.000
Report, Android overtakes Windows as the Internet's most used operating system.

36:09.000 --> 36:17.000
So kind of in the opposite vein of a tiling window manager, we have Android, which only recently got even multi-window support.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
Joe, are you an Android person? Do you have much Android in your life?

36:20.000 --> 36:29.000
What do you think this means for Linux users, mobile users, and everyone else? Is this the trend that we should expect to continue to see?

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
Definitely. You say to me, do I have a lot of Android in my life?

36:33.000 --> 36:41.000
Well, often people will ask me, what is the primary operating system or desktop or whatever that I use on my main machine?

36:41.000 --> 36:47.000
And I say to them, LineageOS, I used to say Cyanogenmod, because my phone, I've got a OnePlus One that's still trucking away.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Nice.

36:48.000 --> 36:55.000
And the fact is that with a 5.5 inch screen, and I've traveled around quite a lot.

36:55.000 --> 37:01.000
I mean, yes, I have my laptops, I have a desktop as well, I have tablets, but I generally find myself using the phone.

37:01.000 --> 37:09.000
And everyone I know and everyone I meet, it seems to me that they are using phones and tablets these days.

37:09.000 --> 37:16.000
Everyone has gone mobile. And it used to be, I'm the techie person that friends know and friends of friends know.

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
And I would always have to reinstall Windows for people, try and convince them to go to Linux.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
But I'm not quite as good as Noah, it seems, when it comes to that.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
He has an uncanny ability, that's for sure.

37:26.000 --> 37:34.000
Yeah, that's true. But these days, over the last few years, I've just had less and less of that to the point where I can't even remember the last time I dealt with that.

37:34.000 --> 37:40.000
Now it's, can you deal with this phone? Can you change my cracked screen? And I say, no, no, I can't do that kind of stuff.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Well, I can, but I don't want to do it for them.

37:42.000 --> 37:51.000
So, you know, the reality of the situation is that in our little Linux bubble where there's a lot of devs and, you know, hardcore gamers and stuff like that.

37:51.000 --> 37:57.000
The Linux on the desktop and the desktop computing generally and laptops are still very prevalent.

37:57.000 --> 38:05.000
But the reality is out there in the big, bad world, unless you are at work, most people are not using laptops anymore.

38:05.000 --> 38:13.000
And so that's why it's not a surprise to me at all to hear that Windows has now shrunk below Android in terms of web users.

38:13.000 --> 38:19.000
I mean, you can never be truly sure whether these stats are, you know, accurate.

38:19.000 --> 38:27.000
But I think it seems to reflect what anecdotally I have seen out there in the real world and what I keep hearing.

38:27.000 --> 38:36.000
Yeah, no, I would say the same thing. So having expressed like the sentiment for configurability and maybe even control, that sort of thing.

38:36.000 --> 38:43.000
How do you feel about Android as a platform? I mean, clearly you have gone a little bit less than mainstream exploring other operating systems.

38:43.000 --> 38:53.000
Does Android or some of the, you know, the Forks or open source versions or ROMs, do they meet your need for, you know, what you like about a Linux desktop on your phone?

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
Or are your needs sufficiently different that it doesn't really make sense?

38:56.000 --> 39:11.000
Well, my needs are definitely different. But I would, for me, it's more about the freedom that, you know, the free software, open source aspect of it and how realistically I, well, I can't use a Google free Android phone.

39:11.000 --> 39:17.000
You know, that's just as simple as that. Yeah, there's a lot of people in that boat, unfortunately, or fortunately, whatever you may feel.

39:17.000 --> 39:25.000
Yeah, I mean, thanks to Open GApps Pico, I flashed the Play Store and that's it. And then, you know, I don't have any of the craft.

39:25.000 --> 39:35.000
Even a Nexus phone has a lot of bloatware as far as I'm concerned. That might sound controversial, but all of the, you know, Google Play magazines and all that kind of stuff, I'm not interested in it.

39:35.000 --> 39:42.000
So, I mean, in terms of configurability, yes, it is certainly my needs and I can install my custom launcher.

39:42.000 --> 39:50.000
I use ADW1 launcher and I have a very minimal desktop, well, I suppose you'd call it a desktop experience on it.

39:50.000 --> 39:56.000
But in terms of the freedom, more and more of Android is creeping to being proprietary.

39:56.000 --> 40:06.000
Google are replacing more and more of it with proprietary blobs and meaning that even if you run just F-Droid and lineage with no Google apps,

40:06.000 --> 40:13.000
you're going to struggle with some of the apps because they, you know, they require the Google Play services.

40:13.000 --> 40:21.000
I mean, I suppose not as much with F-Droid applications, but it's not as useful to me anyway.

40:21.000 --> 40:27.000
It's nowhere near as useful. I need certain proprietary applications is the bottom line, a lot of the Google stuff.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
And certainly WhatsApp, I need that for work all the time.

40:31.000 --> 40:36.000
So, yeah, I mean, in terms of functionality, it's there, but in terms of freedom, it's not.

40:36.000 --> 40:46.000
And that's why I stick to the Linux desktop and why if we could get something like Ubuntu phone to the standard of Android, which, you know, it's a long way off.

40:46.000 --> 40:52.000
And especially now that Ubuntu phone is somewhat on hiatus. I don't know if people correct me on that.

40:52.000 --> 40:59.000
But, you know, it feels a long way off. But if we could get it to the point where it was as good and as usable,

40:59.000 --> 41:05.000
then I'd be much happier about it having a truly free software operating system running on my phone.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
Do you mind if I chime in? Please do.

41:09.000 --> 41:17.000
Because we're actually at this purism and we're actually going to be coming out with a phone campaign in September.

41:17.000 --> 41:28.000
We've been working with a bunch of the open moco developers and we've pinned our hardware on Intel Z CPU that we can actually separate the baseband.

41:28.000 --> 41:34.000
And so we'll be able to run PureOS, which, of course, is a Debian fork on the phone.

41:34.000 --> 41:42.000
The development cycle is probably going to be Q2 of next year, 2018, by the time our hardware will be shipping to users.

41:42.000 --> 41:53.000
But and the reason, of course, is because so many people are wanting to have an actual Linux kernel on a phone that they can control.

41:53.000 --> 42:02.000
So we've actually tested Gnome 3. We're working with the Gnome Foundation to develop the couple of remaining applications that are needed.

42:02.000 --> 42:10.000
Primarily, actually, if you can believe it, a simple phone dialer phone dialer app that's missing.

42:10.000 --> 42:16.000
So that is something that you'll see from us coming out in the next handful of months.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Interesting. That's very interesting.

42:18.000 --> 42:24.000
That's very interesting. But the big question I would have is how much of that hardware is going to work with truly free software?

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
I mean, are you going to get to a situation where the Wi-Fi isn't working properly?

42:27.000 --> 42:33.000
And, you know, how well is it actually going to work with completely free software is the question.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
It's going to be 100 percent.

42:35.000 --> 42:42.000
Wow. That's presumably the cellular modem is not going to work because that just you can't do that, right?

42:42.000 --> 42:50.000
So you can. What it's going to be is it's going to be a separate USB device that will allow us to have a baseband via USB.

42:50.000 --> 42:58.000
So it will have its own, of course, firmware within the baseband, but it's going to be a separate isolated baseband, which is not an issue.

42:58.000 --> 43:05.000
The main issue from a baseband standpoint is by using Qualcomm that the baseband is connected to the CPU.

43:05.000 --> 43:11.000
So what we're looking at then is having a separate baseband option.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
But the wireless, of course, will be free.

43:14.000 --> 43:20.000
And you can actually also have it be a hardware kill switch for the baseband to be able to then use it via a wireless only device.

43:20.000 --> 43:28.000
Interesting. So the separation of the baseband from the CPU is the biggest hardware hurdle to accomplish.

43:28.000 --> 43:42.000
And that's where, you know, again, we spent an awful lot of time doing the research to figure out how we can separate that baseband so we can actually isolate it as a simple chip that communicates to the baseband provider.

43:42.000 --> 44:00.000
So the goal for us is to have it be a completely unlocked phone that you can walk into any carrier, get a SIM card, slide it in the baseband slot and then have have carriage if you want or have it be a Wi-Fi only device where all of the services would be VoIP services.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
Do you think this sounds expensive to me?

44:03.000 --> 44:11.000
Yeah. Well, so, you know, they're not going to be cheap, but they will be within the range of buying a phone off the shelf.

44:11.000 --> 44:18.000
So we're looking at somewhere in the ballpark of $599 or $699 type of end customer price.

44:18.000 --> 44:25.000
So at that price, what kind of hardware fit and finish should people expect to see?

44:25.000 --> 44:35.000
It's going to be a metal case around a five inch size and you're running an Intel Z CPU and of course Intel GPU.

44:35.000 --> 44:40.000
Right. OK. So where can people go if they're curious about this, Todd, to find out more about this new project?

44:40.000 --> 44:48.000
Well, it's right now, it's a lot of it. We ran a survey on our website. So that's of course Purism, P-R-I dot S-M.

44:48.000 --> 44:58.000
And people can follow along there. We're sort of doing a lot of the research behind the scenes at the moment until we can pin down the hardware.

44:58.000 --> 45:13.000
The process overall is now that we have our we'll call it the shopping list as we've narrowed down all the hardware through, you know, past projects like Open Moco and we've narrowed down the shopping list.

45:13.000 --> 45:24.000
So the next step for us is to take that to a number of fabrication houses who already have fabricated five inch screens and five inch phones.

45:24.000 --> 45:32.000
And there's actually a fair number of them. Then we see have you also done Intel CPUs and then we can leverage a reference design for that process.

45:32.000 --> 45:39.000
And so we're at that stage now. Once we have picked a fabricator and then we can actually know our cost.

45:39.000 --> 45:50.000
At that point, we're going to run a crowdfunding campaign to say, hey, how many people are interested in basically having Linux driven phone that you can control?

45:50.000 --> 45:56.000
It will come for us. Of course, we're dovetailing that into a PureOS distribution.

45:56.000 --> 46:05.000
But since you guys are bringing up the phone and especially the Ubuntu Edge that, you know, had such a great run at the crowdfunding campaign, but they just, you know,

46:05.000 --> 46:20.000
pinned to an astronomical price. For us to fabricate, we're looking at around maybe a million dollars, which we feel as though we'd be able to easily meet, especially looking at how many people are interested in the Ubuntu at the time.

46:20.000 --> 46:29.000
Excellent. Well, thank you for updating on this, letting us know. I know I certainly look forward to hearing about it more in the future and best of luck to you.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
As a side benefit, it sounds like no maps might actually have a purpose now.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Hey, there we go.

46:35.000 --> 46:41.000
Have you prototyped running the GNOME desktop on a small screen like that?

46:41.000 --> 46:51.000
We've run it on a 10 inch screen so far. But for the five inch screen, it's a pretty colluged, you know, environment.

46:51.000 --> 46:59.000
So 10 inch screen works fine in our tests. It actually works great with everything with the exception of a dialer.

46:59.000 --> 47:06.000
But the area of software development to get to that five inch screen, we know is an undertaking that we will have to invest in.

47:06.000 --> 47:18.000
And that's actually why we're looking at giving such a long lead time between running the campaign in, let's say, September timeframe, but actually delivering product in June of 2018.

47:18.000 --> 47:31.000
Because of those really the software usability on a five inch screen with GNOME is we still need to address the fat fingers on such a small screen.

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
Well, if Wes gets hold of one of these, I know what SIM card he's going to put straight in it.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
Yes, I do. That's a perfect segue. Thank you very much, Joe.

47:38.000 --> 47:44.000
Let's take this time and hear from our next sponsor, which is our friends over at Ting.

47:44.000 --> 47:49.000
Ah, Ting. They're on a mission to make mobile make sense, and I think they're accomplishing it.

47:49.000 --> 47:58.000
So if you are going to get one of those fancy new Purism phones, or you've got a OnePlus, another niche product that you know you really love, you're really excited about, but you're like, well, what carrier am I going to do?

47:58.000 --> 48:06.000
Don't go to one of those big carriers. Do something cool. Go check out Ting. Go to litix.ting.com.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
There you'll find pay for what you use service. It's that simple. It's so easy.

48:11.000 --> 48:16.000
It starts at six dollars a month. Then you just pay for what you use, right? Minutes, megabytes, messages.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
Maybe you don't use any of those things. If so, then, hey, that's pretty cheap.

48:19.000 --> 48:26.000
But probably you use at least one. For me, that's data, text messages, maybe a phone call here or there, but ideally over Wi-Fi.

48:26.000 --> 48:31.000
And Ting makes it so easy to do that. You don't have to pay for things that you don't use and you know you won't use.

48:31.000 --> 48:36.000
And you don't have to make those those crazy calculations where you're like, hmm. All right.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
Well, I know I like to use this many things per month, but what if I need like a little bit more next month?

48:40.000 --> 48:45.000
Well, I don't want to have crazy over discharges, so I better get the next plan up and overpay the rest of the year.

48:45.000 --> 48:51.000
With Ting, if you need to use more, just use more. It's easy to find out. Their prices are just right on their rates page.

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
Go click the rates button. You'll see a nice little table right here. You can figure out ahead of time.

48:55.000 --> 48:59.000
Oh, yeah, I'm going to go over. What's the next bucket pricing? OK, it's very clear.

48:59.000 --> 49:06.000
It's very easy to use. So if you do go check out linux.ting.com, you're going to get a twenty five dollar service credit.

49:06.000 --> 49:13.000
Or or. If you don't already have a phone that you want to bring, go check out their store.

49:13.000 --> 49:19.000
They've got a lot of awesome unlocked devices, very reasonable prices, and they've got those SIM cards from nine dollars.

49:19.000 --> 49:25.000
Yeah, that's right. Nine dollars. Super reasonable. And sometimes sometimes check their blog.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
They have a lot of good stuff there. You'll see SIM card sales for only a dollar. Yeah.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
You heard it here first. That's right. One dollar. So stay tuned. They have a lot of cool stuff on their blog.

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
They have a lot of good cord cutting things. And that's one of the other things about Ting that is so great.

49:37.000 --> 49:42.000
There are people just like us. They're nerds. They like the latest developments and androids and open source roms.

49:42.000 --> 49:47.000
They like seeing what the industry is doing and how to get away from the from the regular providers.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
And Ting doesn't have to deal with, you know, putting up new polls.

49:51.000 --> 49:57.000
They get to focus on doing what they do best, which is awesome support and making it easy for you.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
So whether you need to use their really great app to configure your service, which works wonders,

50:01.000 --> 50:07.000
or their website, which is also amazing, or if you even need to call in, you'll talk to a real human who will help you

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
and is very dedicated to making sure that you get the service that you need.

50:11.000 --> 50:17.000
Everyone I know that I've switched to Ting, they love it. They're having a great time and they're saving a ton of money.

50:17.000 --> 50:26.000
So don't waste time. Go over to Linux.ting.com and go find yourself in a far better phone provider situation.

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
Yeah, I think I definitely would use Ting with my fancy Purism phone.

50:31.000 --> 50:38.000
So we're running we're running a little bit short today, mostly because we got to text up program.

50:38.000 --> 50:43.000
I got here a bit late. So sorry, everyone. I know we love we love Unplugged.

50:43.000 --> 50:48.000
So I just want to mention something really quick. Then we're going to do the last sponsor.

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
And then we're going to turn to some discussion as we wrap the show up.

50:51.000 --> 50:58.000
So let me just say I saw kind of an interesting thread over on Linux, the Linux subreddit.

50:58.000 --> 51:03.000
And I just thought after after the ad read, maybe we can talk about it and then kind of transition.

51:03.000 --> 51:09.000
I just thought it's kind of interesting to someone who does work for a company that has Linux desktops in the office.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
You know, we're pretty we talk a lot about Linux desktop. We talk about the usability of it.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
We were just talking about how Android is supplanting Windows.

51:15.000 --> 51:21.000
One of the places that Windows still has a huge footprint, obviously, is enterprises in the office.

51:21.000 --> 51:28.000
So this was just a thread talking about how often is Linux really used in Linux related jobs?

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
And so bone master 69 here is asking, you know, he has it.

51:31.000 --> 51:37.000
He's been frustrated that his management wants him to use Windows, claiming that, you know, hey, everyone every all these real developers,

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
they use Windows and you just use a VM or pull up a terminal.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
You talk to your Linux machine that you do development on.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
And it's turned into a pretty good discussion, at least for Reddit.

51:46.000 --> 51:51.000
And there's also some good stats just about like hearing it kind of from a diverse range of people about.

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
What do they use at work? What are they allowed to use? How many?

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
You know, are you do you get to pick your own distribution?

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
Do you have to say both on the server and or for your desktop?

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
Do you get even get a Linux desktop? Is it all Windows and Mac?

52:03.000 --> 52:08.000
So I thought that was useful. Maybe the member will have some stuff to chime in before we do that.

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
Let's just go here from our last sponsor, which is DigitalOcean.com.

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
Maybe you don't get the chance to use Linux at work.

52:16.000 --> 52:20.000
You know, you're just not that lucky to use it. You know, you don't have it on your desktop,

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
but you still need to deliver things to clients, right? You still want to use Linux.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
You still know that, like, hey, I need a Web server. What am I use?

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I know you're going to use Linux, right?

52:29.000 --> 52:39.000
So going over to DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED and get yourself a $10 credit.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
Yeah, that's right. That's right. And wait till you hear this DigitalOcean prices.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
They start at $5 a month. And what do you get?

52:45.000 --> 52:53.000
You get an awesome virtual machine. Choose from FreeBSD, Container Linux, Ubuntu, Debian.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
They have they have all the things that you want. And if not, guess what?

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
They use KVM. So it's a real hypervisor. None of this open BZ stuff.

53:00.000 --> 53:05.000
None of these fake virtual things. No, you get real Linux right in the cloud,

53:05.000 --> 53:10.000
40 gigabit each straight to that KVM hypervisor. That's what makes DigitalOcean awesome.

53:10.000 --> 53:15.000
And in less than 60 seconds, you can have one all for yourself with that $10 promo code.

53:15.000 --> 53:19.000
It makes it really easy to get started. I know, you know, I had found one of those.

53:19.000 --> 53:23.000
I was like, oh, yeah, OK, promo code. I guess I could I could start trying this service out.

53:23.000 --> 53:28.000
And I did. And since then, I've pretty much always had at least one droplet running,

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
probably more like three or four. If you don't need something that runs all the time,

53:32.000 --> 53:37.000
but you probably do, right? Like, you know, go put Quasl up there or, you know, another IRC Bouncer

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
if you're not cool enough to use Quasl. But there's a ton of there's a ton of applications.

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
You can run your own VPN. You can host your own email server if you really want to.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
There's like there's so many options that you can do, you know, run Nextcloud up there.

53:49.000 --> 53:55.000
But if if you don't need any of that, you should still consider it for their hourly pricing.

53:55.000 --> 54:00.000
That's another thing that makes DigitalOcean really nice is that it's just the pricing model is simple.

54:00.000 --> 54:09.000
The API is simple. They have great, detailed, documented documentation that really the community has embraced.

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
You'll see sometimes, you know, you go Google something. How do I do X on Linux?

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
Usually like the first thing you see is a DigitalOcean article.

54:16.000 --> 54:25.000
They hire real editors to help take community submissions, curate them, package them and turn them into awesome documentation.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
Go check them out. Look at this hourly pricing. You click that button.

54:28.000 --> 54:35.000
Three cents an hour for two core, 40 gig of SSD disk. Yeah, that's right. It's all SSD disk.

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
How can you resist that? Plus, they've really got a ton of nice new features.

54:39.000 --> 54:44.000
They've got monitoring in the works. They've got load balancers. They've got attachable storage.

54:44.000 --> 54:49.000
All SSD. They've got private networking if you have two droplets in the same data center.

54:49.000 --> 54:53.000
So really, if you need a Linux machine, you don't have it at work, just don't waste time.

54:53.000 --> 55:00.000
Go over to DigitalOcean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED and go play with Linux today.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
All right. So we have the topic of Linux at work.

55:04.000 --> 55:10.000
Joe, we were also going to talk a little bit today about what makes a proper distribution.

55:10.000 --> 55:15.000
So I'll turn that to you. You can answer either one of those questions or whatever else you'd like.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.000
And the next 10, 15 minutes, let's just discuss.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
Okay. Well, so what makes a proper distribution?

55:22.000 --> 55:32.000
So on one end of the spectrum, if you look at DistroWatch, you see these respins of Ubuntu with a new wallpaper and XFCE,

55:32.000 --> 55:37.000
and they call it a new distribution. And everybody knows that that isn't a real distribution, right?

55:37.000 --> 55:45.000
It's not a proper distribution. But then you get things that kind of blur the lines, right?

55:45.000 --> 55:50.000
So, I mean, I'm specifically thinking about Linux Mint and elementary OS.

55:50.000 --> 55:58.000
Now, the two of those have some of their own code and binaries that they build, some of their own packages that they build,

55:58.000 --> 56:06.000
but at the same time, they're pointing their repos at canonical servers, right? At the Ubuntu mirrors.

56:06.000 --> 56:14.000
Now, obviously, everyone reuses code. I mean, that's the whole point of Linux and distributions, open source and all that.

56:14.000 --> 56:18.000
Reusing code is just a no-brainer. That's how these things work.

56:18.000 --> 56:26.000
But the question that I have is, if you're reusing binaries from another distribution, which arguably,

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
well, you are basically allowed to do under the terms of most open source licenses, so there's no problem with that.

56:32.000 --> 56:37.000
But am I going to take you less seriously as a distribution if you do that? Then yes, I am.

56:37.000 --> 56:44.000
Now, let me put some caveats in here. I mean, there are certain distros that don't sort of claim to be totally independent,

56:44.000 --> 56:51.000
like the Ubuntu flavors or the KDE, sorry, like the KDE spin of Fedora, for example, or XFC spin.

56:51.000 --> 56:57.000
You know, they are using the infrastructure of a bigger project that might be backed by a company.

56:57.000 --> 57:02.000
And, you know, I think that's fine because they're not pretending to be their own independent distribution.

57:02.000 --> 57:08.000
Whereas if you look at things like elementary and mint, and there are others as well, but they're just the obvious examples to me.

57:08.000 --> 57:16.000
I find it very difficult to take them seriously because they're not properly building all of their own packages.

57:16.000 --> 57:21.000
You know, something like Solus, for example, which is a totally independent distribution built from scratch.

57:21.000 --> 57:30.000
Ikey there, he takes the code and builds his own packages and puts them on his own server and, you know, it completely controls it.

57:30.000 --> 57:38.000
So do you worry then, you know, that if they don't have that level of insight, right, like they may not have even needed to ever have done the build,

57:38.000 --> 57:45.000
if they can get binary packages, et cetera, that, you know, you could potentially run into problems that they just don't have, you know,

57:45.000 --> 57:53.000
a good system to be able to fix it, you know, without having to start building their own build infrastructure, which doesn't seem like they really want to do?

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Well, I mean, they do build some of their own packages.

57:55.000 --> 58:02.000
So I assume that they have got the infrastructure there, you know, that they could probably scale up to do that if necessary.

58:02.000 --> 58:11.000
But for me, it's more of a just them having the chutzpah to say we're a proper distribution.

58:11.000 --> 58:16.000
I see. Right. I mean, like, yeah, it's not like they hide it, but obviously they have totally different marketing.

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
They're not saying, you know, derivative of this or spin or anything like that.

58:20.000 --> 58:23.000
It's exactly what I mean.

58:23.000 --> 58:27.000
They don't do it in like in every marketing, because that would be terrible marketing.

58:27.000 --> 58:33.000
But they do have it when you go to the about sections, especially elementary, they do explain that it is based on Ubuntu.

58:33.000 --> 58:39.000
And they have like they have good news slash Linux and the core like the information about the distro and stuff like that.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
So they are acknowledging.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
But I have a question about like, where do you draw the line?

58:44.000 --> 58:52.000
Like if you point if you're getting your packages from a different distro, is it because they're hosting the packages or because they're making the packages?

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
Because Ubuntu kind of does that, too, with Debian.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Well, I mean, that is a very good question.

58:57.000 --> 59:02.000
I think that for me to take you seriously, you've definitely got to host your own packages, the building of them.

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
I mean, it depends. Sometimes it makes sense to rebuild them.

59:06.000 --> 59:11.000
Sometimes it's just a waste of electricity at the end of the day, a waste of resources.

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
So I think that certainly hosting and building.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
I don't know that that is up for debate, I think.

59:18.000 --> 59:24.000
OK, so I'm going to throw you a curveball. What do you think of Intergos?

59:24.000 --> 59:34.000
Well, that and Manjaro as well, to some extent, right now, because Manjaro would technically fit your proper thing about hosting their own packages.

59:34.000 --> 59:40.000
True. Yeah, well, with well, and of course, it's just making Arch easy, right?

59:40.000 --> 59:48.000
I mean, but there are there are technically consider its own distro and they have their own packages and their own infrastructure for their own build servers.

59:48.000 --> 59:52.000
But all the other things, right, like but that's just their extra features.

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
Repos and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, that's why I'm bringing this up.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
I'm not saying it's black and white. I'm not saying it is a definite thing.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And that's why I wanted to bring it up, because it is an interesting question to me, because it's not it's not a black and white argument here.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:18.000
There's a lot of nuance. So I'll chime in with the Free Software Foundation does have a sort of a I'll say black and white, since most things from Free Software Foundation tend to be that way.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Yeah. Which is exactly as you're describing.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:36.000
If you if your apt get resources list says that it's a pointing to your own for all the packages plus the source, that means that you're hosting yourself.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Then then they consider that a distribution. If they if you're pointing to anybody else for any package that you're installing, then you're not a distribution.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
So they are aligned with what it is that you're describing.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And I'll grant it. There's other all sorts of ways around that.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000
But that's that is their litmus test for determining if it's a distribution or not.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Where do you stand on this then, Wiz?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:14.000
You know, it is it is kind of a gray area and I can see I guess it kind of makes me think a little bit and I don't know where I fall on.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:21.000
You know, is there room enough for the value add?

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
You know, I really do respect a lot of the independent distribution. Solace is a great example.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
They have, you know, kind of whole cloth built some amazing things.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I wonder for some of the distributions that are maybe more, you know, resource constrained.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Does that open up a path where by piggybacking on those things, they can innovate in smaller areas or areas where other people have overlooked because they don't have to duplicate all this other effort?

01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Yeah, but if you look at something like Ubuntu Marte, I mean, Martin could have, Wimpy as you lot know him, could have taken the Ubuntu base and Marte and pointed at the repos and called it something completely different.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:11.000
But instead, he was honest about it and called it a Ubuntu Marte remix, I think at first, and then when it became an official flavor.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
But that hasn't stopped him innovating with things like the software boutique and stuff like that.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:31.000
No, that's a that's a good point. I could see from the creator's perspective, you know, that that may I suppose it depends on what you're, you know, what you're branching off of, what their policies may be about spins and branding and that sort of thing.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:42.000
And I can I can see how people might also want want to control issue, you know, we've seen some projects and distributions that have switched from, you know, hey, we were based on this before and now we're this but hey, it's still kind of the same project.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000
We have the same goals, but we're no longer pointed at those people's packages reported at these people's packages.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And so from that perspective, I can see why they might want to have have their own unique identity. But I do I do take your point that, you know, on some of these, you might not, you know, you go to their front page, and without digging, you might not even know that it that it relies on these things.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And it does make me wonder about it seems like it could certainly cause problems between those distributions and make working together. If one party doesn't feel like they're being respected or their contributions or that, you know, these people are taking their work and not appreciating all that goes into it.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:41.000
That would not. Yeah. I mean, what do you think of going to bypass the problem completely and just use the term distribution to describe anything that is a kind of a distribution, and then use other things like a fork or a respin or a derivative of it, or maybe create a completely different word that describes like a proper distro.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:04:03.000
We can't, we can't all agree on what a proper distro is, though, can we? You can, you can put an arbitrary limit, and then it wouldn't matter. Because if you make a new word, and you say this is to be a proper distro, or be it to be blah, you would have to be hosting your own packages and be not be 100% reliant on anything else.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Like if you are pointing to someone else's repos, you are reliant on those repos to not go down. So you're not technically a proper distro or whatever we decide to be call it. So if there was another word, what about operating system? Yeah, that's a big one.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Well, you can argue that they all kind of are. That's kind of a generic term is just distro is too. Yeah, they're both broad. They're both too broad. I was thinking that maybe we should understand distro or distribution as I thought was meant like a redistribution of the Linux kernel.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And then you have other things upon that, that maybe there needs to be further definition of what makes a distribution a distribution, and not a fork or a respin, and further talking with other members of the community.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Well, you can also go into the concept like this is more of a nuanced argument of like, you know, fork is still a distribution. You can like Ubuntu is a fork of Debian, and it's also kind of derivative of Debian too.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:21.000
But it's also still its own entity thing. So like it doesn't necessarily need Debian, but it uses it anyway as a foundation.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I always thought that a fork and a derivative are one and the same in the Linux world.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Because you could be a derivative and not fork everything. Forking is where, like for Ubuntu's sake, they take everything that they use from Debian is taken from Debian and put into their own infrastructure.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Whereas a derivative would use something that's not like they would maybe point to other other repos and stuff like that.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Well said, I think. I think that's a natural point to wrap up this episode. I think it's been a ton of fun. Let's see here we can get some outro music.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:10.000
That's the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show. This has been episode 191.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:19.000
And as usual, it was you, Mumble Room, that made it all possible. If you want to see more of this fine program, head on over to jupiterbroadcasting.com.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:26.000
There you can find our archives, other shows' archives, plus go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash schedule.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000
There you will meet a wonderful robot who will tell you what time this show is live in your time zone.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Then you can be a part of our fabulous Mumble Room or just hang out in our IRC room. They help out a ton too.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Thank you for being here. We'll see you next week.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Woo! Alrighty, that was the show. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Joe, especially. I thought that was a lot of fun.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I certainly enjoyed chatting with you and thank you for helping host today.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Yeah, no problem, man. It was good to be on. And I didn't even plug late night Linux once.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Oh, man, I meant to do that. I have it sitting here on my notes.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000
I should know that.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Oh, well.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Post show.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Yeah, that's true. That's true. I've really been enjoying late night Linux. You guys get up to some fun conversations.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Yeah, we had a bit of a controversial one that we released this week. We interviewed Yoss from Nextcloud.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Oh, right.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:07.000
The scanning thing and interviewed is one way of looking at it. Locking him in the kitchen and beating him up with some bats verbally is another way to look at it.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
I mean, as long as you provided food in the kitchen as well.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Yeah, but yeah, Aiki and I were very harsh on him. Probably a bit too harsh, to be honest. I feel a bit bad.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000
About all the like them scanning for old versions and that sort of thing?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Yeah, exactly that stuff. Yeah.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Right. What was your main criticism? I mean, maybe I shouldn't spoil it.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Well, the main criticism is that it's free software. If I want to run an outdated version on my server, it's none of your business even if you made it.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:51.000
But then the other argument is the greater good, the commons. It's the spam that gets sent from these things and the fact that the internet at large suffers as a result.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:58.000
So there's definitely two sides to the argument, but I'm pretty firmly on one side.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Yeah, I'm firmly on the other side.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
That's what makes this all so fun.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I have the issue where I've had projects where people would send me reports about, oh, there's this bug that is in your software.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Yeah, we fixed it three years ago. Stop using a three year old software.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Like that happens all the time. And it's in some cases, it's not necessarily the fault of the user.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Sometimes it's not. Sometimes it's all the distribution that's providing those packages.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000
But that's also an issue that Nextcloud has a problem with as well.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:36.000
So if you go to most distros, the version of Nextcloud is super old.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Or an own cloud, for example, they even had a press release saying, please don't use the default packages from whatever distro you're using for that particular reason.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Because if you keep sending, essentially it's spam. If there's a problem you have and there's a bug report already and then that bug report is fixed.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:06.000
And then two years pass by and you continue to use something and continue to complain about a bug report that is already fixed.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000
At that point, it's absolutely user stubbornness.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Surely there's a solution though. Pseudo snap install Nextcloud.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Yep. Snap solve that.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Yep. Or some people would probably use Docker.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000
They also solve the perpetual update problem because when I installed Nextcloud, I had 10 point something.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
And when 11 came out, it just upgraded automatically in the background.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Nice. Yeah. See, that's a big win right there.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Yeah. I mean, maybe it does highlight some of the pain points of the distribution model that we have relied on and kind of makes it a point right at snaps is something that we do need so that we can have these independent channels, but still keep all the other benefits we get.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:11:06.000
But to be fair, a PHP application like that can update itself if you've configured it correctly. Sure. Yeah, that's true. My WordPress installations update themselves all the time.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:25.000
So that's what the solution is to me, really.
