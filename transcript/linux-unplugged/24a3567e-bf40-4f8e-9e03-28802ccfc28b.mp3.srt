1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,380
I know I know a little something you guys don't know West told me before the show started that he managed to pull off a

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,120
heroic measure with one of his arch Linux systems

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,660
And I gotta give respect because both beer and I have been there you got an arch box something falls off your radar

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,660
You don't update it for weeks

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,840
Maybe even months and then it comes it comes due and you got to fix that box. Maybe even years. Yeah

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,560
Maybe what happened not quite a year is probably like nine months. I moved this laptop perfectly serviceable laptop

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,440
But right now it doesn't have a working battery. So it's like a desktop laptop. Let's call it hadn't updated, right?

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,440
So I finally set it up set it up on a desk

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,500
Started looking around. Oh, yeah, right. I was running. I had awesome set up and some other things

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,820
Couldn't install anything

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,540
But it really wasn't I had to add a update a bunch of GPG keys

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,700
I had to purge all the caches get rid of all the key stores that I had then

13
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,900
Work my way back through the arch home page

14
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,860
resolving each and want every one of the little you know

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,860
user intervention required example, but I

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,940
Mean, I've done those before I would have had to do them anyway, so it was really just paying my dues

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,580
Work just fine now. I'm really no problems. It's the GPG keys that that you really got a that was the that was the

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,820
Triggiest bit. So what does this box do? It's like a home server. No, it's just a it was another laptop that I have

19
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,340
Oh, okay

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,340
I was about to give you a hard time for on your home server on arch because I have been there

21
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,540
I do have a home server on arch my route my router runs arch you maniac

22
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,260
This is Linux unplugged episode 214 for September 12

23
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:47,580
2017

24
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,180
Oh

25
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,920
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show. That's loading snaps installing sound boards and playing clips

26
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,700
My name is Chris. My name is what and of course the beards here. Hello beard. Hey, hello, sir

27
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,160
Beards fresh off rebuilding our mumble PC

28
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,720
I could do the show today like legitimately four minutes before the show started. I told you I timed it, right?

29
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,300
We got a good show today. So I'm really glad you got a fix cuz holy smokes

30
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,900
You've been hearing about this Equifax breach. There is a small open source story. We'll tell you about that aspect of it

31
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,700
Linus has got some good ideas

32
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,680
We'll tell you about those after we get through some community updates including some potentially new man. Jarrow hardware

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,360
Thank you. Gnome 3.26 goodness and benchmarks our replacement for Nileus and an update from Ubuntu

34
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,980
We're gonna get into Kali Linux for a bit. I revisited Kali Linux

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,640
I'll tell you about my adventures and why I decided to hack my IOT devices

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,940
I decided to blow off some steam and try to break all my IOT devices. You've never been very trusting anyway

37
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,620
So I'll tell you the tools that I used and the way you could audit your own network with Kali Linux

38
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,900
It's been a little while. We'll give you a little history on Kali as well. And then

39
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,060
at the end of the show

40
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,060
By popular demand you've been waiting to macOS

41
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:10,220
Pretty close to that. We'll cover the new iPhone event. No, no, no, no. No, it's the Gentoo challenge

42
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,900
finally

43
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,860
Finally after a month of waiting after absences and travel

44
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:24,480
We're gonna get to the Gentoo challenge. We've been building software for weeks and we're here to tell you how it all goes through

45
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,000
the roof

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,900
But before we get to all of that, we got to bring in that mumble room time appropriate greetings L mumble

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,040
Hello

48
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,260
Hello everybody good to have you here today. So

49
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,760
There's not a lot that I feel like we could add to this Equifax story

50
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,840
In fact our friends over there at the Techsnap program just covered it today

51
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,080
So that'd probably be where I would point you but at this point in time

52
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,240
Everybody's heard about the credit bureau here in the States getting hacked

53
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,120
nearly 200 million identity and really personal identification information has been stolen and

54
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,560
It turns out it's all open sources fault

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,180
It's all not again. It's not Equifax's fault. It's not shoddy

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,160
Network hygiene it's not poor update practices. It's not bad security auditing

57
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,440
It's open sources fault you I know you know about this story because you're talking about it on Techsnap sure did

58
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,640
So it comes down to they're simply blaming a patch Apache struts

59
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,800
Mm-hmm, and Apache struts is like a it's a obviously it's from the Apache projects

60
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,160
it's an open source offer programming model view controller like an MVC framework for Java and

61
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,400
it's

62
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,840
it is at the core a lot of these old business applications and

63
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
And

64
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,640
They had Equifax they Equifax hired an auditor to come in and this auditor

65
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,020
Discovered that they were using a version of struts that has a vulnerability

66
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,280
That's just recently been disclosed as of a couple of days ago, September 5th

67
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,400
But of course the hack happened earlier in the year

68
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Somewhere between mid May through July

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,400
So we're not actually sure if it was this vulnerability or baby a different one that came out in March that they just never patched

70
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,640
again right and then those two stories are like are very different it is totally possible that at the core of its struts was the

71
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,040
Issue, but I'd like like your take on this West because in my opinion. Maybe I'm wrong

72
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Maybe I'm just too much of an open source defender

73
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,600
But to me it seems pretty obvious you can have vulnerable software be a proprietary or open software

74
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,840
And it's about like an onion layered approach to security you you build your network assuming. There's going to be compromises

75
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,600
Yeah, I think so. I mean you're definitely right about that and while there there may be cases where you know some software open-source

76
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:45,920
Or proprietary does lead to information disclosures despite best practices being followed but before before that and like obviously we want to get this patched and

77
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,240
upgraded

78
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,800
You do have to understand some of the like what is the update hygiene patch policy Etc that Equifax is is is using?

79
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,840
And if that's not up to speed that is really the problem not whatever vulnerabilities may exist in the

80
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,280
I'm sure myriad of different open-source software that they're using yeah at the end of the day there is a there is a flaw in struts

81
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,280
There's right. There's a problem. No one is disputing that well plus

82
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,400
You know Chris the codes open so they can just look at that code and find all the vulnerabilities

83
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,760
Yeah, that's how it works. You just read it like you would a nice book. Yeah. Oh

84
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
I need something else to make me feel better

85
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,480
I need something nice like wimpy you got a new piece of hardware

86
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,600
I see you talking about there in the discord like that like the smallest little portable phone

87
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,760
I think I've seen in a long time. Do you have it with you? I?

88
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,880
Put it down, and I can't see it because it's so small

89
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,440
What what is this little thing is this is this an Android device? You've got here the jelly Android device the jelly Pro

90
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,300
Yep, and you have it next year to a pie zero to give us some scale in this picture Wow

91
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,280
Yeah, so it's about the size of a pie zero so if you imagine a business card

92
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,620
It's about the form factor of a business card, but a bit narrower nice

93
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,180
And is it is it a performant device?

94
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,420
It works very well. It's a quad-core

95
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:08,120
Cortex a53 it's got two gigs of RAM. It's got 16 gigs of internal storage

96
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
to SIM cards

97
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,040
microSD card

98
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,480
Wi-Fi with 2.4 and 5 gigahertz

99
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,780
And Bluetooth front and rear facing cameras a torch and FM radio

100
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,700
How did you get this is this is not even shipping yet? I?

101
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:32,220
Backed it. Oh wow, so they're so they're really on top of it there. That's great. This looks so cool

102
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,060
It's it's a a really nifty device. I'm

103
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:43,100
Very impressed with it. I have to say and I got mine with a few accessories and the accessories are extremely well made as well

104
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,020
What kind of accessories?

105
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,620
Well the reason I got this is because when I go out and do my walking and exercising or having a strapping a bloody great

106
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,700
Big you know five and a half inch phone to your arm is a bit much

107
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,100
This is why we and I were just talking about watches like this is almost a reason to get a watch these days

108
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,700
So yeah

109
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:05,860
I got this with a an armband a case with an armband and I'm gonna use this as my effectively my fitness tracker

110
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,480
So I've got my fitness tracker and Spotify installed on it

111
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,060
And this is what I'll go out and use for exercising so this thing is small enough to fit in a jeans

112
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,100
watch pocket

113
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,740
Yes, it's really small and it has to sim and an SD slot. Yep. Wow

114
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,940
Holy smokes

115
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,460
What's this thing called?

116
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,100
It's the my ones the jelly Pro and then there's the the smaller that well, it's not physically smaller

117
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,300
But there's a lower a lower spec version just called the jelly. Is it USB C?

118
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:44,460
No, it's micro USB. Okay, so almost perfect does have a headphone jack though. So it does have a headphone jack

119
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,260
There's something for that luxury. This thing looks so neat

120
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:55,820
It's it's actually very good. I mean, um, I'm genuinely surprised at how good it is

121
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:02,100
What about reading on that screen like the Twitter feed or a news article? Is it is it just painfully? No, it's it's perfect

122
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,900
It's perfectly usable. I mean you can imagine how big you know watch screens are and this is about three times the size of a watch

123
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,180
screen

124
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:15,260
It's quite low resolution, but it's it's remarkably good. I mean as a small device, obviously, you know

125
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:22,160
You're not going to be typing long messages into it, but you can overcome that using the you know, the voice input. So

126
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,820
I'm not very good at using voice but on this device you kind of use it by default for everything

127
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,980
Surprise, it's just it's very very good. It's a really nifty little device

128
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,540
I'm not sure how long I'm gonna hold on to it because my daughter's seen it and she quickly worked out

129
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:43,860
This is sort of exactly the right size. Yeah. Yeah, my son would love this too. Yeah

130
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,880
It's and also they're not expensive either. I think I

131
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:53,820
There are about 120 bucks. Yeah. Yeah, they have some early birds that are still available for under $100 even

132
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,060
Yeah, so, you know for a phone for a child that you just want them to you know

133
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:05,240
Be able to make calls and get in touch and not worry, you know, if the phone gets ruined. It's it's quite a nice device

134
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,240
Yeah, that is

135
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,720
Hmm. Hmm. And with the dual SIM when you come over to the States into into New York you could in theory

136
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,680
Put a ting sim in there and just pay for what you use while you're here. Yeah, I feel like that

137
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,720
You know, this is totally totally spontaneous, but I'm gonna mention that go to go to linux.ting.com

138
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Just do that. Just do it right now

139
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,360
You know

140
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,480
Seriously when you come to the States and anybody else that's coming to the States that wants to be able to use their phone

141
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,360
And doesn't want to get totally just unless you have some amazing plan

142
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,920
Go to linux.ting.com when you're coming

143
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,400
I hear from the audience that they do this because one of the things people always give us feedback on is well ting is a

144
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,640
US only

145
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,080
Opportunity so I can't get outside the US but when you travel here Alan Alan has done this

146
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,660
This is this is something that I really think I wish I could do

147
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,780
I wish I could do the opposite of this when I leave the States

148
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,200
Linux dot ting comm it's a really great simple way to get easy pay for what you use wireless

149
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,960
You just pay for the minutes you use and the megabytes you use while you're here and there's no contract

150
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,680
No early termination fee you can log into the website and turn off the line

151
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,040
It's really nice pay for what you use nationwide coverage CDMA and GSM with a great dashboard

152
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,480
That's I'm gonna do like a quicker one because I didn't plan to do the ting read there

153
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,040
but then when I see that device, it's so it's so perfect because

154
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,960
You can buy this thing for a hundred bucks 140 bucks. You can put a ting sim in there

155
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,440
I wonder if you could switch between CDMA and GSM live too. Oh, that would be slick. Hmm

156
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,080
Well, that's really really cool wimpy and I'll be curious to hear your thoughts on it later

157
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,400
Have you tried like the built-in speaker? How's the sound on like for podcasts?

158
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:45,120
It's good enough. I mean, it's it's just it's for what it cost and its size

159
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,280
It's a pretty remarkable little gadget. I am I am very very happy with it. Nice

160
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,200
Yeah, I'm

161
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,120
Surprised surprised and impressed by just how good it is

162
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,080
I was just reading an email on here just to answer your question. Yeah, perfectly read

163
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,600
I assume you put telegram on there telegram performs. Okay, I haven't put telegram

164
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,280
I've kept it just to the things because there's only two gigs of RAM. I've just decided to keep it to the minimal

165
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,840
Exercising yeah, but I was thinking I I did put a 32 gig

166
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,960
microSD card in it and used the option to

167
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:29,640
Merge that with the internal storage. So it's now got about 40 gigs of internal storage available

168
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,160
You know as it reports as a a single file system, so it's um, yeah, it's pretty great, really

169
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,280
Yeah, I say good on you to to keep the distractions off the exercise device

170
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,000
That's pretty neat and it's you know cheaper than a Fitbit a decent Fitbit

171
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,640
So that's pretty cool the jelly the jelly smartphone

172
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:53,560
This jelly probe the smallest everybody's going big and this is the smallest and then you know like again just free free pluggy here

173
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,240
But you put on the ting network. That's that's two things. I like this. I like small indie stuff. That's that's cool

174
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,280
If you break it, it's not the end of the world. Mm-hmm. It makes me a bit jelly. Yeah

175
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,840
I see what you did there. I see what you did there. So Linus has an idea. How about instead of hacking Linux?

176
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,720
Okay, stay with me instead of hacking Linux

177
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,440
You join and participate, huh? You mean hack online? Yeah, whoa

178
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,760
Actually, you know I joke but this is legitimately an advantage that open-source software has so Linus is you may not be able to reach

179
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:31,080
Absolute security but people that deploy default models are so much better off today. We're making obvious improvements

180
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
He's talking by the way

181
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,760
about the kernel

182
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:41,440
Torvalds also noted that technical persons that have that have been impressed that have impressed him have been people who go after the Linux

183
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,800
Code there are smart people doing bad things

184
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Yeah, yeah exactly I wish they were on our side and they could help us Torvalds said

185
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,480
Where I want us to go is to get as many smart people as we can before they turn to the dark side

186
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:04,080
We would improve security that way and get those who are interested in security to come to us before they attack us

187
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
That's all it would take Wes

188
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,840
I mean you're right that that is an advantage of open-source is that like yeah, come join us come make it better

189
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,560
Yeah, yeah, you know, maybe I mean you can still still exploit it on the side to make money

190
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,440
He's not saying that you can't do that. Just also fix it upstream afterwards. We'll save that part for the Kali Linux

191
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,840
Yes, right. That's right. Well, so gnome three two six lands tomorrow

192
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:36,280
I think is it this Wednesday this coming coming up? Yeah tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah, so if all goes well, which I believe it will

193
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,480
Yeah

194
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,000
By the time most people here in this show, it'll be old news, I guess

195
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,760
Think about that guys. That's frightening right now. We're living in the pre gnome three two six world

196
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,040
But the people listening they got the edge up on us. They're already in a gnome three two six world

197
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,800
It's just if I just pac-man a little harder. Is it well I get it now. Can I do that?

198
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Yeah

199
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,100
And there's some interesting benchmarks over at Veronica

200
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,540
Michael larbel has posted benchmarks of gnome three dot two six on

201
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,820
Wayland

202
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
versus your x11 and

203
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,820
notes at the Wayland desktop loads slightly faster I

204
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:23,140
Like that, there's no real significant difference in memory and battery consumption between Wayland and X at this time on

205
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:31,480
the benchmarks that use Wayland directly there's no significant difference between mutter and using with modern Wayland or mutter and X org and

206
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,000
On benchmarks that were forced to use X Wayland

207
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:43,000
There's about a five frame per second loss using X Wayland versus straight X org. Hmm

208
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,160
But what struck me about this? This is my summation of reading his article. What struck me about this is

209
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,400
That it wasn't a huge penalty to use Wayland that it wasn't a dramatic issue to use Wayland

210
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,440
like we that Wayland is essentially at

211
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,040
Competitiveness with X org right now. Don't you think that's kind of don't I don't beer we then to me?

212
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,360
That seems pretty remarkable. Actually, I would have figured it would have either been way behind or way ahead

213
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,760
Yeah, right. I mean this it isn't in performance

214
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,640
This is what these benchmarks are talking about like it doesn't talk about the fact that it's missing a ton of features, right?

215
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,000
It's just frame rate low desktop time. Yeah, I guess I expected Wayland

216
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,920
I thought we'd be palin a Wayland price for sure. We'd be disappointed that it's not a lot faster

217
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:34,480
Well, that's what the Internet's taken away from this the the average internet comment reads like see I told you X works fine

218
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,360
That's always fine. We don't need anything else. There's this guy. He's flying around an airplane outside the studio right now

219
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,360
He's running excellent. He has a big banner says X org is fine. Yeah. Yeah, that's that is that is what's happening right now

220
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,040
And I take I take from this at least that part of the transition this

221
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,440
Singular isolated part of the transition to Wayland. Hopefully won't suck too bad. That's what I took from it

222
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,520
No, I'm three dot two six gonna be in that there Ubuntu too. I believe gonna be there then that's it is

223
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,160
Gonna know there's a there is a there's a negative side to 326 though

224
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,480
Removal of the API for the system icon. Yes, we talked we talked about it a little bit

225
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,480
And it's worth touching on because I don't really understand what I'm gonna do other than load the top icons extension

226
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,120
It's like they've forced my hand

227
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,640
There's actually like a weird situation where the top icons extension currently works now and will not work in the future

228
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:34,080
So they pointed out that you know in the in the post they're like, well if you're going to continue using top icon stuff

229
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,800
That that'll be available

230
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:42,360
Yeah, but they didn't point out in the comments that in the blog post that GTK for removes the support for what top icons

231
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,800
uses oh

232
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:49,700
So that it's not even gonna be possible to use type icons. It's going to be deprecated automatically. This is why I'm switching a unity

233
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
well, there's there's actually a

234
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,680
One to notice that and saw that that's that's going to be a going away. There is a different

235
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:05,280
Extension called case status notifier app indicator or something like that. It's it's really long. It's hot. Yeah, they

236
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,680
They forked that and are using that because it doesn't depend on the same API that top icons uses

237
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,560
That's why the new Ubuntu version has that so in theory if you in the future

238
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,920
You could use that extension instead of hot top icons. Okay, I

239
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,720
Look at I'm looking at mine right now and I see Spotify

240
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:32,040
I see Dropbox and I see Skype and I see mumble and I think out of all of those the only one that has any chance

241
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,240
Of updating you with any reasonable amount of time is mumble. Mm-hmm

242
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,600
Dropbox isn't gonna give two shits. Are they is what do you know anything about that rotten is is is this uh, I

243
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Don't think mumble is gonna carry that I don't honestly either but if any of them was going to right, I mean, yeah

244
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,520
They're the best likelihood. Yes, I I think that

245
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,000
it's it's

246
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,440
It's because they're their gnome is looking at it as if because they don't like something they think something is antiquated

247
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:07,640
That means everybody else should just follow suit. Whereas, you know the platform people switch from have this incredibly

248
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,720
No

249
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:18,120
Long ingrained. Yeah, they're expecting this type of thing to exist and then you just remove it regardless of what people think like

250
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,840
Yeah, yeah, that's problematic at best. This is this is my issue now that is tempered by the fact that

251
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:32,680
Gnome 326 also has the new settings pain. Oh, yeah new redesign and excited for that more like

252
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,640
Mac OS 6 I know if you guys remember Mac OS 6 from the 80s

253
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,320
But it's more like that control panel and it's way better what what is old is new again. Yeah

254
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,280
That's really is but that is how computers work

255
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,560
It's way easier for my brain to process a list on the side and then I click it and then the you it's gonna be

256
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,560
More like gnome tweak, but it looks way better

257
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,400
and um

258
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,880
That's in 326. So like 326 is like a mixed bag for me because it's a good release

259
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,240
It's got updates to epiphany. It's got updates to gnome photos, which I just like for just basic photo viewing

260
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,480
But it's got this like like producer. Michael was just talking about this removal of the system tray icon support

261
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,880
Which every time we go through this is a huge pain in my arse and it's a constant source of questions

262
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,480
And it's probably like one of the top five extensions people use in the first

263
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,360
Yeah, I got all I got all worked up. I think was it last week about the gnome project recommending people install an extension

264
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:32,840
Yeah, no, I think are yeah, that's just they also they recommend other things too for extensions because they don't really want they don't see

265
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,560
So little things they want to do is default

266
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:42,120
Default it's uh, it's problematic. But if if they were managing the extensions that'd be one thing

267
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,200
But they just you know letting the community do it. What if someone what if they remove some api like they're doing for this?

268
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,320
What if they?

269
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,960
Just annoy someone enough where they just give up and stop maintaining them. Like I mean you're you're exactly you're setting it setting it up to fail

270
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,480
Do you uh when you hear stuff like this?

271
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,280
Do you think boy if I wasn't already using plasma as my main desktop i'd switch

272
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,960
Because it makes me think I got to be honest ron. It makes me think just screw this

273
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,400
i'm, just going to go use the plasma desktop and make it work because I was a gnome maintainer for extensions

274
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:20,360
At one point and I quit because they the example I gave people abandoning it is because I was one of them

275
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,640
yeah, I maintained 10 10 extensions and

276
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:31,000
Every single time there was a new update all of them broke and and there was nothing wrong with my extensions

277
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,200
Like they they all worked. I even adopted other extensions from other people and like fix them

278
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:42,040
And most of the time like the auto the audio input switcher like there was nothing wrong with it

279
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,480
It worked perfectly fine. The only thing it needed was to have a version update

280
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,040
so

281
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,040
Like the fact that that's like, you know

282
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,440
Not only you're not going to make a system where when it updates it's going to like check to see if it works and then

283
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,440
Say if it works or not and give you like a flag where you have to update it or something

284
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,920
Update it or something. It's just we're going to assume it's automatically broken and just break it

285
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:09,480
So like at that point where I had to update 10 and then I started getting requests from people updating stuff

286
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
and then I was like, you know, I

287
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,080
After about I think I tend like the most I ever had was like 16 at one release and I was like i'm i'm done

288
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:24,040
I don't i'm not trying to fix this right? Yep. And so here's where i'm at right now and um

289
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,080
Um, i'm kind of waiting to see but I feel like maybe as gnome grows

290
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,960
And as the as they move the platform forward and as they make decisions that they feel are the best that

291
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,440
the decisions to make for them, uh

292
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,320
Maybe we are moving into a world where if you're going to use the gnome desktop

293
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:48,200
You need a high level curator like canonical to come along or like fedora to come along and

294
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,080
Really sort of think about this stuff think about how to do the doc extension

295
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,240
Think about the system tray icon notification problem. Think about the theming issues

296
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,080
Uh, think about all of the things around that and implement it correctly

297
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,880
and that's really the only way to have a usable workhorse gnome desktop perhaps and

298
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,720
And rolling it yourself on a gentoo or an arch which we'll get to here in a moment. Um,

299
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,360
You know is is it's two hacked together unless you really follow this stuff

300
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,320
Like if you listen to every episode of this show, you could probably make it work

301
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,080
So yeah, I would agree with that except I would point out that fedora is on the same side as gnome as far as like

302
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,280
The top icons and stuff like that. They made a blog post about yeah

303
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,520
it was hilarious because they made a blog post about like

304
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,800
And these developers are not getting uh are not updating their application. What's wrong with all these developers?

305
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,600
They're not following the whims of the gnome team. What's wrong with them?

306
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,440
And I mean I do feel the alter of like they want to be able to update but

307
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,400
When you are shipping things that people use in a stable way

308
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,360
You have to do that in a non-breaking way or at least try especially hard not to like producer michael's saying

309
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,760
Especially when it's something that is a is like a paradigm of how you interact with your desktop. Yes

310
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:01,800
The the question then becomes for me is do I really want to be using a desktop where the developers?

311
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,720
Can't do that work themselves and you have to have an additional maintainer to make the desktop good. Well, at least it can be done

312
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,960
You know at least you can have somebody create their quote-unquote saying defaults

313
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,120
Yeah, maybe there's a there's another issue of what about you know, how like for a long time gnome has been like

314
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,280
I don't know like the powerhouse as far as like what de's are based on

315
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,840
but if you look at like budgie where it was

316
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,840
Um, there's they did announce that they're going to switch to cute and other applications other things that are switching to cute already

317
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,760
Like LXQT, yeah, but like if you look at the code of budgie

318
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,960
There's some weirdness in there like where they actually have to pretend to be gnome in certain cases. Yep

319
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,040
It's like so like it when you said that they were making decisions that worked best for them

320
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,880
It's like I think that's like the detriment to them. Yeah, maybe you know

321
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,440
They're trying to have a vision and they're trying to have a philosophy. And so part of this

322
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,880
Notification tray icons thing is that philosophy in their world?

323
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,680
The user never had any control

324
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,840
You installed that son of a bitch application and that sucker put that tray icon down there. You never asked for that

325
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,520
You never asked for that stupid notification or that spinning sync icon

326
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,680
Spinning sync icon and you you know

327
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,600
You really have no other way to interact with the application other than guess what that tray icon?

328
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,880
And so gnome wants to give the power back to the user

329
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,520
It's a philosophy and it's one that I can I can I can understand and appreciate

330
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,240
But there's a there is a practical aspect to this and it feels like they're kind of far away

331
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:33,560
Separated from like the day-to-day support concerns of someone using that right? Whereas a bunch who knows how to do that

332
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
That's a great point. So let's pause right there because that's

333
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,960
Damn, you just nailed it. Um, because I want to talk about what they're doing and uh,

334
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:47,880
Specifically there's a new post, uh about uh, uh gnome shell in ubuntu 1710

335
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,120
I'm trying to trying i'm trying to be like cautious about what I say because I don't want to give too much away because I

336
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,360
Really want us to roll into it. So let me start by saying thanks to linux academy for sponsoring this here show

people that honestly I think

344
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:34,680
Have the intention of getting more users to linux and I really could connect with that because anthony the guy that founded linux academy

345
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,760
I talked with him for ages before he was

346
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,200
An advertiser before he launched the platform just talking about how to get linux out into the hands of more people

347
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,760
So when they launched I was so excited

348
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,600
To be one of their launch partners to have a sponsorship here

349
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,880
I remember talking to anthony while they were building the virtualization system

350
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:59,400
That'll spin up servers on demand that match the courseware you've chosen for debian or redhat or ubuntu. They'll also do aws azure

351
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
Open stack courseware. They're really high level stuff

It's a real platform for this kind of stuff

354
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:16,360
It's the linux academy new to the world of linux azure and aws open stack and devops

355
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,440

Slash unplugged

362
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:55,100
so we have another post from didrocks and we've been linking to these for quite a while in the show notes and

363
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:03,260
I love this. It's the it's like a blog journey to 1710 and the decisions that they're making and this week we talk about gdm

364
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
collaboration and theming

365
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:13,080
Now i'm covering this for many reasons because uh, it's it's historical to watch canonical make the switch here on the show

366
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,240
Can't believe we're documenting this

367
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,040
Think about that for a second

368
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,600
Wow

369
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,280
Wow, it's really hitting me like right now as i'm talking to you guys. It's really hitting me that

370
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
I watched I have been podcasting

371
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,840
I have been podcasting since ubuntu was created

372
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,880
I podcasted

373
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,640
The announcement of unity wow brian lunduke and I covered it at linux fest that because it was news then

374
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,960
I remember the episode that we covered the announcement of unity

375
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,240
I remember watching the um

376
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,640
Netbook edition of ubuntu. I remember watching that be born and unity inspired from that

377
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,160
Gnome 3

378
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,320
All of it i've watched all of it and now i'm watching them transition back to ubuntu

379
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,840
No, and the weight of that is really hitting me as we record this episode right now

380
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:10,600
Like I am I i've really watched the transition here and I got to tell you watching them re-land back into gnome

381
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,360
um

382
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,520
If if you had asked me to make the most optimistic prediction of how they would handle this

383
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:23,240
I wouldn't have gotten it this close. I I couldn't have I couldn't have asked for a better re-landing into the gnome world

384
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,880
So this week we're talking about gdm. It turns out gdm

385
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:33,480
The gnome display manager that login screen that ugly login screen that runs in the background and takes up a ton of memory

386
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,080
It's a really a son of a bitch

387
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:40,520
Uh, it's also hard to theme and it's one of the areas where the gnome developers have been particularly protective of

388
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,560
Because if you're having any kind of problem in your gnome session

389
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,840
They don't want gdm to be affected because you got to get back to your login screen

390
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,320
Right so you can choose like it keeps everything running in that sense. So one of the ways that they have

391
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,300
Accomplished that the gnome team is they have hard coded the theme for gdm

392
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,060
So that way it just uses something simple and it always works

393
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,820
and it's

394
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,820
rock-solid regardless of whatever

395
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:10,700
Crazy lunatic theme you've loaded in your gnome shell your gdm session rock-solid add wadia, buddy

396
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,500
Unless you don't want that

397
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:19,340
Which pretty much no distro maker wants they want to re-theme gdm to make it match the login

398
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:24,240
Of course, and they want the login. I mean the desktop sessions the login session matches the desktop session. It's a big kumbaya

399
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:32,380
And it's something that i've noticed some people are commenting in the early betas of ubuntu about already the gdm theme here and there

400
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,180
Um, and it's something that the poppa west folks have been working on

401
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,540
And this is where we end up today this little problem

402
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,380
The guys over at system guys and gals over at system 76. They want to solve the problem of an ugly gdm

403
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:52,140
And canonical also has a problem. They want to solve they want to be able to apply their ubuntu style

404
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,380
Without stepping all over the toes of anybody that might be deriving off of ubuntu

405
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,660
And they'd like to do it in a way that is maintainable and upstreamable

406
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,780
And uh, I believe these two things are not 100 aligned, but they're pretty close

407
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:10,460
So it sounds like over the last couple of weeks canonical worked with system 76

408
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:16,780
Worked with jeremy over at system 76. Wow, and together they came up with a way to sort of fix this problem to sort of

409
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,020
Apply a patch to gdm that would work upstreams that people could change the theming

410
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,900
Now I don't really know I don't really you know when I start to gloss over when you start talking about applying css themes to gdm

411
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,940
But I do see that this is a wider problem that we've been running into for a while and

412
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,260
It's nice to see a proposed solution. Nothing's going to happen. Nothing's going to happen

413
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,820
Proposed solution. Nothing's really been accepted upstream yet

414
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,700
but uh

415
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,980
I I feel like there might be there might be a a larger ramification larger impact here, which i'll get to in a moment, but

416
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,340
uh

417
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,820
wimpy if your ears are burning because i've missed or i've gotten something wrong if you want to jump in with any corrections at

418
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,820
This point probably a good chance before I keep going

419
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,860
Well, you have me a disadvantage actually because i've i've been away. Oh, yeah for a while

420
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,580
So, um, I haven't had the chance to catch up with my colleagues and so let me wrap this real quick

421
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:13,580
And let's talk about that. So, uh, uh short the short version of this is is that diddler and uh,

422
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:22,540
And jeremy are working together to come up with an upstreamable version where patches can be applied where people won't be stepping on each other's toes

423
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:28,220
Uh, I I will save my commentary for now on how this could be our first example of pop os

424
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:34,780
Development colliding with the wider ubuntu development. I'll save that for future commentary because i'd love to hear about

425
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,940
Wimpy's trip to perry. He just got yeah. Yeah, I saw some I saw some

426
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,500
Once in a lifetime selfies come across wimpy's twitter feed over the last week

427
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,540
I've got to go find those because you know, whenever you can get the eiffel tower in your selfie

428
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,220
That's a that is a rather good selfie. So where were you wimpy?

429
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:58,700
Uh, well, we were in paris so and we were at uh ubucon europe

430
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,140
Uh, which was being hosted by the french

431
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,540
loco

432
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,340
At a massive museum, uh in paris

433
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,980
That is too cool. That sounds awesome

434
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:16,380
Ubucon ubucon boy all these conferences you got new york coming up soon. You got paris. You are a world traveler wimpy

435
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,360
Yeah, so ubucon is an entirely community

436
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,620
Um created event and they happen

437
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,340
all over the world and different

438
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:31,900
Locos and lugs and what have you organized these events around the world. So when the ubucon happens in

439
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,900
uh, california, it's usually

440
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,200
Coinciding with scale and happening at the same

441
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,360
Venue, um, you know a day or so beforehand. Yeah

442
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,640
Uh, but this one's just a standalone

443
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
This was um

444
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,640
Yeah, it was um, it was a four day four day event

445
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,080
um

446
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,640
so it started when it was a a three day event for the ubucon, but there was um

447
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:03,540
Um, I sort of a get together the day before it started with sort of the um, the core organizers

448
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,320
um to come together

449
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,520
Uh and sort of, you know, make sure they were all set and ready to go

450
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:16,000
Uh, and we were fortunate enough to be there and catch up with them that evening and some of the early arrivers

451
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:23,360
uh, some of you know our friends from the ubuntu community from around europe and it's you know, great to catch up and socialize so

452
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,000
you know during the day it's um,

453
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,640
tracks of talks and workshops and um

454
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,440
Uh, there's even a gaming room set up, you know with pcs with games running and all the rest of it

455
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,920
um and rooms with

456
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:46,560
All the audio equipment. So, um the various podcasters can go and record, you know live podcasts and what have you

457
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,960
So there's you did right? Yeah, so poppy and I participated in two podcasts whilst we were there

458
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:02,560
We um, we both appeared on the on the spanish podcast and then we were part of

459
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,160
a podcasting panel so we had um

460
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,160
Uh the guys from lubuntu podcast in france poppy and I from ubuntu podcast

461
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,320
I don't know the name but the I think it's um ubuntu podcast portugal and then ubuntu fun

462
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,560
so there were six or seven of us

463
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
and sort of um

464
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,640
Scripted by the german guys, you know, we had some show notes and then very much ad hoc

465
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:34,240
In front of um a live audience. That sounds like a lot of fun. It's always good fun. Yeah

466
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,560
That's some fun. I uh, so I was inspired by a slide that uh

467
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,960
It was from a talk that I think dustin kirkland was giving at ubicon where he listed like the top 10 features

468
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,340
Uh or the top 10 new features for ubuntu 1710

469
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,080
And I wanted to take that list. I want to I want to put it in text somewhere

470
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,520
So I want to I actually kind of like to get your your take on it

471
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,520
But I expanded on the list and I actually think is I already have more features to add to it

472
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,940
But let me know if i'm missing anything. So 1710

473
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,160
Um, and I I want to I want to preface before I say this i'm

474
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,280
I don't have any skin in the game. Uh right now I run solace the machine to my left

475
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,880
runs

476
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,440
Arch the machine the next machine to my left runs arch. What are you running right there to my right?

477
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,160
This is running arch. Okay, so we have and then we have two arch systems upstairs

478
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,960
We have an arch server here and a proxmox server

479
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,240
The only ubuntu system in the jupyter broadcasting studio is the one running the mumble machine that noah installed

480
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,960
So I don't I don't have like an agenda here. I don't have any there's nobody paying me to say this

481
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,440
No agenda, but i'm going to say that I will say this

482
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,440
um

483
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,080
I would ask both of you and anyone in the mumble room to tell me what what distribution release

484
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,240
Has ever had a feature list like this and I haven't even added all of them yet

485
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,320
This is what I have right now the top 14 new features for ubuntu 1710

486
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,360
And gnome replaces unity number one, obviously

487
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,360
Tons of bluetooth improvements a thousand bug fixes a new blue z stack

488
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,200
number three

489
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,600
Switch to lib input number four improved 4k multi-monitor and scaling

490
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:13,600
Technology support we've talked about that high dpi improvements number five upgraded to network manager 1.8 much improvement big improvement

491
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,000
There number six new sub sub equity equity, whatever. It's the zoo server installer

492
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,080
Number seven is the minimal images 36 megabyte 20 smaller images huge. That's a huge that's a huge savings

493
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,640
Number eight finally for fuck's sake auto remove of old kernels from slash boot

494
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,960
Number nine extended for encryption with fs encrypt number 10 improved cuda and cpu acceleration support

495
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,120
And this one i'm i'm feeling like could almost be two but i'm including hardware accelerated codecs in that one

496
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,240
Hardware accelerated codecs

497
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,120
I'm going to say it one more time hardware accelerated codecs. Just going to mention that

498
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,280
Uh new doc that we've talked about with the upstream collaboration the gschema support for uh

499
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:00,320
Elegantly handling settings changes and disappearing when you turn on dash to dock and now with the status icon support, which is great

500
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,920
Net plan by default switching from if config is number 12 number 13 is gcc7 out of the box

501
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,960
And number 14 is wayland by default and number 15

502
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,240
Which I don't have on the list yet because it hasn't happened yet because all of these have happened

503
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,440
All of these have happened what is about to happen?

504
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,560
What is about to happen potentially is kernel 4.13 as well, which will be feature 15

505
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,440
And i'll have a top 15 list for ubuntu 17 10

506
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,600
Now I haven't seen anybody put a list together quite consecutively like dustin did now i've built off of dustin's list here

507
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,960
But I challenge you to tell me one other release of any linux distro

508
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,960
Ever since you've been following linux that has been this packed full of features and this big of a change

509
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,840
Hmm chris, I can't think of one dude. I can't either. Like this is this is big. This is really big

510
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,680
And this is this is in the middle of a company restructuring

511
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Reorganizing of the company

512
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,840
Like there are some companies where that would put them on their back heels for a year just to sort that shit out

513
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,360
Well, I gotta be honest chris I have been through distro after distro lfs as you know, uh, gen 2

514
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,840
Arch the whole nine yards and I gotta say

515
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm more impressed with this new ubuntu spin than all of that. Yeah

516
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,480
Yeah, it is and that's and I haven't even finished the list yet. No, you haven't

517
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,760
You know

518
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,440
I can think of things with individual components like maybe system d switch or other things that were that were of similar scale

519
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,800
but these is a

520
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,800
It's a far-ranging set of changes. This isn't even the lts like if all this stuff is decent in 17 10

521
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,440
All this stuff just has to be even decent in 1804 for the lts to be great

522
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,240
Like yeah, but that's that's exactly the fact. I have to test it for the lts

523
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,080
I mean you can't introduce these to the lts. You have to test them first

524
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,160
It's the way to do it though. It is it's a classic ubuntu style development approach. It's a tried and true method

525
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,240
So if I can just add to to that list, yeah

526
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,000
the

527
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,600
Um dustin gave a couple of presentations whilst he was at ubicom

528
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:17,520
Um, and the slide that you've used there was from he was doing the closing keynote

529
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,000
So he did the the keynote that that that that wrapped up the event

530
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,240
and

531
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
What he was presenting

532
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:33,520
was all of the feedback that had been captured from those various user surveys that

533
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,520
That he's been running

534
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,620
Through hacker news and reddit and slash dot and omg ubuntu

535
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,360
And all of those things that were on um, dustin's slide

536
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:55,200
Were the top thing so they he did a whole load of natural language processing to actually figure out what people were asking for

537
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,280
and basically

538
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,680
Everything that was in dustin's slide were the top things that people were asking for

539
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,280
And therefore they got addressed in this cycle

540
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,280
So that was the the crux of his presentation in that your feedback is important and matters to us

541
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,840
And here's us

542
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:19,360
Actioning the things that are most important to you. I i'm not going to name names of other distros

543
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
There has been distro releases recently

544
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,800
where legitimately the new wallpaper is

545
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,360
Part of the release notes because that's like the the minimal amount of change

546
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,360
um

547
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,040
I I just I really am impressed. I am really impressed like when

548
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,400
When when mark made his initial initial announcement, I just was having a conversation with somebody about this yesterday

549
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:49,040
That's somebody being michael dominic when mark made his announcement that uh canonical was done with unity and that ubuntu would be shipping

550
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,880
gnome, I think a lot of people walked away with the impression that it was sort of like a

551
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,240
Wiping the hands. We're just gonna we're just gonna give you a stock gnome. We're not gonna bother with it and uh have at it

552
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,320
That the desktop wasn't being focused anymore. Hope you enjoy your stock gnome. We're done and uh,

553
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
I I just I

554
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:15,120
I have a I have a loose appreciation from the outside of the amount of work that must have gone into this

555
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,240
Which means it must have been 10 times the amount of work that i'm picturing

556
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,880
So it was anything but that it was the opposite of what a lot of people were pontificating was the end of the ubuntu desktop

557
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,800
It's uh, yes, and that's top 14 new features that like are worth like talking about how many of those are like server?

558
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,800
Features, right? There's a lot of stuff here that shows like they they're they still care

559
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,240
They are innovating on these things right and seeing this kind of feedback cycle and work that's exciting, too

560
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,480
And one of the reasons i'm excited for kernel 413, which is on target, you know

561
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,760
We it's not locked in yet, but it's on target for 1710 is it's got the baked in mainlined app armor support

562
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,120
So it's like it's sort of like a

563
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,720
It's like it's sort of like a coming of age in a way for app armor

564
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,400
which snap confinement's based on which is the which is the

565
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,320
mandatory access control horse that both susa and ubuntu have bet on

566
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,680
And it's my preferred out of s between se linux and app armor

567
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,560
Having worked with both of them production. I clearly understand app armor and se linux

568
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,200
I just sort of funnel my way through and so if I had to implement one I would prefer to use app armor

569
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:23,040
So talking about the kernel as of yesterday 413 is in the proposed pocket

570
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,600
That's awesome. Yeah, that is I will update that list

571
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,760
I can't I'm holding that as my 15th feature to add to the list because that's okay

572
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:37,200
Well the one to add alongside network manager is in addition to network manager 1.8

573
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:44,160
The captive portal stuff is enabled and fully working now and lots of people were making good use of that

574
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:51,040
Um at ubu con because everything was behind a captive portal and it was kind of fun to see them all sort of

575
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,040
Blinking and then grinning at the captive portal screen just popping up when they joined the wi-fi networks

576
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,640
I have no idea what to expect network wise while i'm in new york

577
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,920
Uh, we're trying to decide if if we should try to do user air from the hotel room while we're in new york

578
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,640
So no one we're gonna be there should I think so?

579
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,280
I but we just don't have we have no idea what the connectivity is gonna be

580
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,240
You know, I wish there was a way like we need like a database. Mm-hmm has a captcha

581
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:21,920
Has you know requires you use their dns like well all these like little qualifiers, you know, google has this database

582
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,280
They just don't share it with us

583
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,320
So getting that built in into network manager or is it is a part of network manager wimpy or is it a component?

584
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:35,600
Alongside a network manager. I wasn't clear. Yeah, so there's there's two pieces to it. There's um a component in network manager that needs to be enabled

585
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,480
um that actually does the um detection of

586
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,880
Of um, you know your connectivity state and whether you're behind a captive portal or not

587
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,680
um and that that emits, um

588
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
over dbus and then there's

589
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,200
a component that's

590
00:44:53,660 --> 00:45:00,400
Hardwired to the gnome shell that then looks at that to determine what the network status is and when it

591
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,160
Picks up the signal that you're behind a captive portal

592
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:10,640
It fires open a web view and takes you to that captive portal brilliant. I really will appreciate that

593
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,720
That's become very important recently in my life

594
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,280
um now I got oh go ahead I will just say because

595
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,680
Let's just get this out of the way because there are people that care about this stuff

596
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,640
In order for that to work. It has to ping some known host in order to look for various status. Oh sure. Yep

597
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,820
Okay, and that's connectivitycheck.abuntu.com

598
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,500
abuntu.com

599
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:37,940
In the privacy settings for abuntu 1710 is the option to disable

600
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:43,060
That connectivity check so if you don't want it to leak, you know stuff

601
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:49,140
Um, then you can just disable that and you will have no captive portal automatic detection

602
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,540
And if you want to run like that an interesting feature I noticed in firefox

603
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,980
Which I don't know when it cropped up, but i'm told fairly recently

604
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:03,940
If you open firefox and it's behind a captive portal firefox detects that now and prompts you accordingly as well

605
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:10,740
That's nice. That is really nice. That has been something that has kind of been wonky on some setups in the past and

606
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,460
Really hurts inexperienced users. I think so. I have two more items now that you're here wimpy

607
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,460
Just that I would love to chat with you about

608
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:23,060
um i'd love to sort of back our way into 1710 matte edition of abuntu here because

609
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,860
Um, I know that there is a big feature for me

610
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:31,640
That uh, I loved when I was on the unity desktop that has made its way into abuntu matte 1710

611
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,260
And I don't know if you saw the feedback

612
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,300
I imagine you must get all kinds of different feedback for this stuff

613
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:44,340
But one thing that I saw people talking about which seemed really misinformed was well now I have to drop matte because it's just

614
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:50,900
Adding all of the bulk and cruft that modern desktops have and what i'm alluding to is pretty much full-on

615
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:55,140
And correct me if i'm wrong full-fledged hud support like we had in unity 7

616
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,140
Unity 7 in abuntu matte

617
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,900
If you go with the mutiny theme you turn on hud support you turn on compiz

618
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:06,580
You're getting really close to where you were with unity 7 and it's got certain people certain neck beards

619
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:13,300
Upset and so I got this email from this guy who says that he's switching now to xfce

620
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,620
Because matte is getting too bloated

621
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,500
So I thought maybe if you explained a little bit of how hud works

622
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:23,780
About how what what what talks to hud and how that all happens and maybe help people understand how it's not a bunch of bloat

623
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,780
And tell people what the feature is

624
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:31,220
Well, the feature is the ability to search the menus

625
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:38,200
So, you know your file edit view tools help menus that you see in all of your applications

626
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,380
It's the ability to search through those so you hit the alt key

627
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,700
An overlay appears and you start typing to filter down

628
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,940
What features of the menus you want to see you could type print for example?

629
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,860
Instead of having to go grab your mouse go to file go down to print

630
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,980
You could just keep your hands on the keyboard and type in print and that would come up

631
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:07,700
Yeah, and it's particularly useful for applications that have lots of filters. So audio editors, um, you know the office suites and

632
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,020
inkscape and

633
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:17,220
Gimp, yeah, you know when when there are no convenient key bindings to complex filters. It's a great way to find them very quickly

634
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:22,500
Now behind the scenes the way this all works is through um, gtk models

635
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:27,380
model menu and some dbus services, um, and

636
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,420
What's providing that dbus registrar is the new global menu?

637
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,060
So the global menu provides that dbus registrar and then we also

638
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:42,260
Load a gtk module which is called unity gtk module

639
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,860
Which is kind of a misnomer

640
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,940
What it's actually doing is providing the app menu model stuff

641
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:55,780
It's got very little to do with unity itself. And so to just sort of clarify your point there a bit

642
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:01,220
What's happening is these menu options are being exposed via dbus. So it's not like there's some

643
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:05,720
Global scraper running in the background that's reading all of the menus of every application

644
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:11,780
The applications are advertising these features to dbus dbus then enumerates that to the hud and

645
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:16,900
That's already happening in the background regardless. It's not a big bulk out of processing, correct?

646
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:23,140
Yeah, and if and if you run one of the themes that doesn't use the global menu, then none of that stuff is there

647
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,500
Anyways, none of that stuff is resident in memory. Okay. Okay

648
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,580
Now what I would say is if you

649
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,000
Really feel that that is an unacceptable additional

650
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,860
amount of memory and it's

651
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,860
Not much by the way

652
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:49,380
Then fine run libuntu run zebuntu go elsewhere. That's absolutely fine

653
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:56,260
From the very first day that we created a buntu mate. I have an objective in the

654
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,300
In the objectives of the project

655
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,700
the application choices would

656
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,340
feature feature rich

657
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:09,400
Applications and wouldn't um chase after lightness or whimsy. Mm-hmm

658
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,840
and

659
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,400
Ubuntu mate still runs on a raspberry pi with one gig of ram

660
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,960
If you've got less than one gig of ram and you're upset that ubuntu mate doesn't run well in you know

661
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:29,640
One gig of ram then fine go elsewhere. I that's absolutely fine by me. I think it's a perfect balance

662
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,040
I think the I think the project I mean is

663
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:39,320
Is constantly evaluating this question and striking such a good balance between modern-day desktop features and a traditional computing paradigm

664
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,640
It's it's with as much as I talk about 1710 right now

665
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,960
I'm not necessarily sold on running straight ubuntu 1710

666
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:54,440
I'm also heavily considering giving the ubuntu mate spin a try simply for all of these little added extra perks here

667
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,960
How is the how's the new alpha been received by the community?

668
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,040
How's the new alpha been received by the community? Uh, very

669
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:09,320
Very well, it's beta one now, right? It's it's beta one. Yeah, um, I did a presentation about it at ubucon

670
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:17,240
It was very well received. Um, yeah, uh and where I was also um when I was at ubucon

671
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,280
The etienne is our new qa lead

672
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:25,080
He's been involved in the project for some considerable time but has recently taken on the role of qa lead

673
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,800
Oh congrats, and he lives in france. So he made the trek up from the south of france to paris

674
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,280
And we met for the first time over the weekend. Oh, very good and spent some time together planning

675
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:39,080
So that was really great, you know to to meet people on a project who you know, you've not met in person

676
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,320
Um, I absolutely love that. That's one of the reasons i'm looking forward to going to new york

677
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,280
Yeah, and this thing about you know, i'm gonna rage quit a particular distro

678
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:55,320
Um fine, but the thing is is you're talking about leaving a distribution where all of these options are options

679
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:03,960
And you could just use a different, you know, we've preserved that traditional layout the the as granddad remembers it to panel layout

680
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:08,280
That has been there forever with gnome 2 is still the default layout

681
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:15,320
Yeah, and it doesn't use indicators and it doesn't use the hud and it doesn't use compiz or any of this stuff

682
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:21,880
So I don't understand the rationale for right i'm rage quitting because it's got all of this stuff

683
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,480
Yeah, but I have to go and turn on that is not default. It's crazy talk. Yeah. Yeah, I agree

684
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:32,440
All right. So the second item I have before you can uh before you can stop talking so much is uh, this is all

685
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,880
This is your fault just as I was coming to closure

686
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:42,280
On the lais and one. Oh, yeah, just as I was getting to some sort of peace with that

687
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:49,080
You tease me with mail spring, which isn't actually available for download yet. No, but it is a fork of nalaya's mail now

688
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,160
Wes, I know uh, you myself wimpy. We've we've been a little community here

689
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:59,240
We've been big nalaya's users in the past and then they announced that they were shutting that ass down turns out their api

690
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:06,360
Makes them a bunch more dough. I guess. Yeah. Yeah, so wimpy found uh, mail spring at get mail spring.com. Say hello

691
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:13,000
Say hello. I'm kind of looking forward to this looks nice though. Yeah, it has essentially all the same features that you came to love

692
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:19,960
And expect uh from the lais it has uh, the really creepy but yet advanced and surprisingly useful open tracking features

693
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,600
I don't know about self-hosted or any of that

694
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:28,840
Uh, but i'm thinking about signing up none of that. None of that self-hosting is required. So nihilus mail

695
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,360
Um or nihilus n1 was the original mail client

696
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:38,040
Mm-hmm that used all of the cloud services to do all of the mail syncing, right?

697
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,840
The nihilus mail which was the open source was more like an offline had that sync engine integrated locally

698
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,920
So you didn't have to go elsewhere

699
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,880
now what's interesting about uh, get mail spring is that um

700
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,240
Ben gotto who was one of the original members of the nihilus mail team, right?

701
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:02,440
Right. His company is now stewarding this fork

702
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,320
And he was the principal developer of nihilus mail. That is interesting, isn't it?

703
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:12,520
Yeah, and what they're already doing is they're like reworking that sync engine

704
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,560
So the sync engine was written in java script

705
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:22,140
I imagine node and they've already replaced it with a new sync engine which is implemented in c++

706
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:27,340
Plus and they're claiming that it's uses 50 less ram and it's considerably

707
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,300
faster and

708
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,300
improves battery endurance

709
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,740
So it looks like they're trying to get all that new that

710
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,900
refactored sync engine integrated before they

711
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,620
They make uh make it available for download

712
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,020
but i've i've already signed up to this to

713
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:51,180
Stay informed of developments and i'm very very interested to see how this pans out. I'm thinking about doing the same

714
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:57,580
I I I really I really liked nihilus mail specifically in one but nihilus mail, too. So i'm thinking about doing the same

715
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:02,620
What do you think wes you you think it's possible? Maybe like a new hope. Maybe it's a new hope wes

716
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:09,020
Yeah, well, I mean I appreciate a lot of what what they had done and having a bunch of this all be open source anyway

717
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:14,300
Yeah, right like why not? This is this is what we continually talk about as being an advantage

718
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:19,660
So if there's even a shot that it works out for us i'm i'm on board i'm I wouldn't uh, I

719
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:20,700
I'm

720
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,660
Not always in favor of c++ strictly better than node or not

721
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:30,780
But if it's actually faster and more performant, it seems like they are like what I got out of those summaries is

722
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:37,420
Like a you know craftsmanship and a care and a loving tuning that I would love to see

723
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:43,100
Um, and uh, I think it's it's a good sign that it's one of the original authors. Mm-hmm

724
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:49,660
Um, thanks for pointing out to me. Yeah. Yeah, I can't wait to see how this develops. Um, because

725
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:56,540
Uh nihilus was the great white hope for the you know, the the new generation of mail clients pretty mail clients

726
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:05,260
And I I was only saying, uh to poppy a few days ago, you know when when these projects die somebody, you know

727
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:11,580
There's usually like, you know five or six rage forks immediately afterwards and there was none of that with nihilus

728
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:17,340
Probably because it's a complex code base and then I saw this and I was like, yes, this is this is what we wanted

729
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,020
I know it sounds you're saying it sounds kind of silly but I I

730
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:26,780
I really got my head around email for a few months there like I haven't for years and after they announced they were killing it

731
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:34,060
Off I switched back to my traditional like webmail thunderbird kmail combo, which is horrible and um,

732
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:37,500
I don't I don't think i've opened my inbox this week

733
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:42,300
Because I've just been when I get busy like that without the ability to see the thing that nihilus gave me was

734
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,980
Two things that were so great was the I snooze for later

735
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:51,100
So I could set a reminder and I could come back to it so I could I could clear them out of my inbox

736
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,100
But but get back to them

737
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:57,980
and the other thing that I found super useful was it's surprising the the

738
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,620
creepiness and and

739
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:05,500
Well done implementation of tracking they had where they had some sort of server-side component

740
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:11,420
With embedded code that was really good at at detecting when you opened the email

741
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:16,140
Which is an incredible indicator for when you're about to get an email it turns out

742
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:23,180
And this is what I learned after using and one was that almost everyone who emails me on a reoccurring basis

743
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:29,820
Opens the last email that they got from me and just hits reply and changes the subject deletes the body and sends me an email

744
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,260
Like everybody does that. I thought that was just something I did

745
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:38,380
Everybody does that and so what happens is when they open up the old email I get a notification

746
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,180
And I know in about five minutes. I'm gonna get an email from a sponsor

747
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:47,020
And so I know this sounds dumb, but I can mentally prepare myself for that communication

748
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:50,620
I can I can like clear psychologically clear my schedule, okay?

749
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,420
I'm gonna respond to this. I'm gonna think about this and I actually was getting email done

750
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:59,820
It was a couple of just snoozing and really good notifications

751
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:05,660
Snoozing and really good notifications. Um, yeah, I really loved it. So i'd love to see a fork

752
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,900
You know i'm gonna be watching that with some some interest

753
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,900
We'll have a link to that the show notes if you want to check it out

754
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:14,300
I have a quick mention before we move on with cheese. We still have oh my gosh

755
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:19,580
We still have backtrack and the gen 2 challenge to get to wow. Oh my gosh jam packed

756
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:24,300
This is a lot going on. Um, so just a quick mention. I wish we could quick now

757
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:30,620
I wish we could spend more time on this. Uh, the mangero project is happy i'm sure I would assume

758
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,100
To announce that they got an oem

759
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,220
To ship a laptop pre-installed with mangero

760
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,340
xfce edition, so uh

761
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,300
There you go, joe

762
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:47,580
It's good for you. Uh, and it's uh, it's the spitfire mangero special edition

763
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:52,140
It's powered with a seventh generation intel processor 32 gigabytes of them rams

764
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:55,260
dual drive bays and um, it can

765
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:02,140
Pretty much probably take whatever you throw at it's got a 1080p ips display. We don't talk much about mangero

766
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,380
I mean, I haven't used it for a while

767
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:10,940
Yeah, well, you know, uh growing up. My grandma always told me if you ain't got nothing nice nothing nice to say

768
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,380
I can't even I I um

769
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:19,580
Yeah, i'm not a big mangero advocate. I don't we don't review mangero very often

770
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:24,540
I don't talk about mangero, but I know there's a portion of our audience that that definitely has had success with it

771
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:27,420
So I and I mean they seem like they have a fair amount of momentum

772
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,500
They've got their own community going which is great

773
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:32,620
I this is why I thought we could have made a segment out of this because to be honest with you

774
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,700
It feels like a trend

775
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,820
Distributions more and more are starting to ink deals

776
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:41,980
I think probably the most prominent and successful one is the entryware about to

777
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:47,580
Mountain one because to me that's sort of like the best of both worlds great hardware great company great distro

778
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:54,780
Uh, and you're starting to see elementary os with different trying and solace rumors and all this all these things that seem to be brewing

779
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:59,340
And it seems that all of them sort of have one common denominator and it's clevo

780
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:05,500
And I think that's the enabling technology here because clevo is providing the base platform of the laptop

781
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,900
uh, the

782
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:11,020
Oems can then focus on the software implementations a bit more

783
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:15,020
And so what you are getting and it's going to take a little while for the consumers to catch up

784
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:20,080
I would think except for our audience is you're going to get different levels of implementation

785
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:26,300
So you're going to have some clevo resellers that have a really solid implementation. They really have nailed the firmware issues

786
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,020
They've nailed compatibility issues. They've worked back and forth with clevo

787
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,660
Maybe they even have some leverage

788
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,940
I wonder if at some point we'll see like a clevo competitor

789
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:36,780
so that

790
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,220
so

791
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,220
Yeah, I was I was going to say

792
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:44,060
It's not always clevo undoubtedly clevo features

793
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,620
Is could you give me an example of one that's not clevo?

794
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,220
uh

795
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:54,780
The first couple of generations of the entra where apollo were top star. Yeah top star. Uh, but this one is clevo

796
01:00:55,740 --> 01:01:01,760
Uh, the current generation is yes. No, no, no, I mean, yeah, sorry. No, I mean the station x the the mangero spitfire

797
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:09,740
Is um, i'm not familiar with what what's being shipped there, but it could be it looks i'm just saying that yes

798
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:14,060
It's the these linux oems are not

799
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:22,060
Absolutely always clevo. Okay quite often they are but there are other odms that get used as well. Yeah. Okay. That's a fair point

800
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:25,900
I think that's a fair point. I think this one is this one. Um, I can't remember

801
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:30,460
I I got the clevo make at one point, but i'm pretty sure I I tracked it down to a particular clevo make which is

802
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,780
similar to probably the

803
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:38,460
Apollo galago line of machines i'm not I I to me I feel like that's um

804
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:43,580
Um that only matters in so much as how good is the oem at doing the implementation? Yes

805
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:50,780
What kind of constraints does that put on the whole process and you can't get around obviously do you like the clevo hardware?

806
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:56,380
Like that's a component some people do some people don't that's fine. Yeah, um, but I do feel like these odms

807
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,540
top star or

808
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:01,420
clevo or whoever are making it possible for

809
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:07,180
distributions to offer a out-of-the-box distribution experience so instead of

810
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:10,780
Of buying a box of cds now you can buy a laptop

811
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:14,940
And how long did we talk about how that that was important for the linux desktop, right?

812
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,220
Even if it's not the hardware we want or even the distribution we want

813
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:22,380
It's certainly a different category than I have to buy and hope that this will work

814
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:25,980
Yeah, and it you know, if you think about it in terms of selling a box set of dvds

815
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,940
I used to buy the susa box set. It was like six discs

816
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:33,180
Um, you know, I used to get the free cd from uh, ubuntu

817
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:37,980
Um, man, jero and mandrake was mini disc. This is kind of like that same thing. Don't you think?

818
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:43,740
What and what's important about this is that you know, we've we've said for years and years and years

819
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:49,980
The reason why linux isn't more widespread is because you can't go into brick and mortar stores and buy it

820
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:50,860
Yeah

821
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:55,580
Now the next best thing to that is having online retailers that make it available

822
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,660
Um, and you know, we've seen a number of these

823
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:03,420
Uh linux vendors popping up recently particularly in the uk

824
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:07,980
um, obviously intro where i've been around for some years now, uh, but we've had

825
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:14,220
Station x star labs and I think this one called nimbu or something like that

826
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:18,940
So there's been three pop up in the uk in you know, quite quick succession

827
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,940
And then another one that i've known about in spain

828
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:27,980
But um had the good fortune to meet at ubucon this weekend is slimbook

829
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:31,340
And they have some very very nice gear

830
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:37,820
That they had on show and there were lots of us and ours and lots of people saying i'm going to struggle not to buy

831
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:41,020
One of these they had some really terrific kit

832
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:46,460
Um and chassis that i've not seen before so I don't know where they're coming from, but they're really impressive

833
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:50,940
That's exciting. And and they're the company that are providing that kde neon book

834
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,660
Oh, yeah, very good

835
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:56,220
huh, okay, so

836
01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:01,180
This the more we talk about it. Um, I I not only did I see this taking off more and more

837
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:07,420
But I can also kind of understand why system 76 feels compelled to ship pop os imagine if they had

838
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:11,660
Um an inside track or they saw the way this thing was blowing

839
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,420
This wind was blowing this direction where you're going to start having super specialized

840
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,860
you're going to have solace laptops and elementary os laptops and

841
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,620
ubuntu mattei laptops and mangero laptops

842
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:24,380
and

843
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:29,820
Then you're going to have the large vendors like hp and lenovo and of course dell

844
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,260
shipping stock ubuntu

845
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:37,100
So they don't have that extra value add area

846
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:40,620
There's a gap there. I can see the logic path. However

847
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:47,020
My my counter argument to that would have been there's still a market for somebody to do a really rock-solid

848
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:52,540
Vanilla ubuntu implementation because at the end of the day that's going to sell way more than any of these things do

849
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:56,220
Probably combined especially with what we were just talking about like customer feedback. Like

850
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:59,420
I like I have no problems with dell but like

851
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:04,940
Close customer feedback about software design is not something that they have a ton of experience with compared to say

852
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:10,620
Let's like system 76 is a little bit closer with their customer base. I would say yeah, and I could so you can see that

853
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:17,660
That path. Yeah, you know, you look skeptical beard. No, I was just gonna say it's still really interesting to me that it's

854
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:24,060
It's manjaro that's coming out with a laptop. Like if I made a list they'd be pretty far down on who I would have expected

855
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:27,420
To come out with the laptop. I guess that's who you know, right? Yeah, I guess

856
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,460
Because you could see like certain distributions

857
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:36,700
Well, I guess yeah, are you implying that maybe it's it's uh implying

858
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:42,060
More growth to manjaro than we realize is that what you're saying? Like maybe there's maybe there's more going on than we realize

859
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:44,460
like

860
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:49,020
I I feel like they they must think that they have a fairly large user base if they're coming up with hardware now

861
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:56,300
Yeah, I mean they gotta figure they're not just manjaro, but whoever's shipping the laptops must think they have enough user base as well

862
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:00,700
That's it is it is that statement, isn't it? It's the they somebody did the business math here

863
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:05,900
So it's now time for the manjaro challenge. So where's my integrus laptop? Yeah

864
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:11,340
Well, but that's the thing. I mean the thing is is that you know, there are lots of people using arch linux

865
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,500
Or so the internet would have you believe

866
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,500
Yes, it would I

867
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:23,500
I would suggest that most of those people that say they're running arch linux have either installed antergos or manjaro

868
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,540
There are probably very few actually installing arch

869
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:30,940
Do you think that's true? I mean really though wimpy because once you install arch

870
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,100
You don't really have to install it again

871
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:37,420
Like it's just installed and it can be installed for a very so you can install it once six years ago

872
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:42,380
And then have you ever installed arch linux? Yes. Yeah, I have and I would say it you have have you yeah

873
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:47,980
You've not always just installed and gen 2 and gen 2 but I always I will I will grant you

874
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:52,140
That if I were if I were in the last two years going to install arch

875
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:57,500
I would absolutely go integros and not even consider going stock arch. It's just why waste the time

876
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:03,100
My point exactly it's all about time. Yeah. Yeah. Okay fair enough fair enough

877
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:08,860
I always just boot into an integros live cd and then install stock arch really? Yeah

878
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:14,700
because then you have a gooey you have chrome or whatever and but otherwise I can install everything in antergos and like

879
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:18,380
Two pacman commands if I was going to do it today if I for some

880
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:23,900
Reason wanted to install stock arch today. That's probably maybe how I would do it if I was going to think about it

881
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:25,900
Huh?

882
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:31,100
It's just I think you're right wimpy is it really is. Uh, it really is like uh, it's

883
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:37,180
Now it's a it's a badge of honor in a sense on the internet to run arch and so everybody proclaims they run arch

884
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:43,500
But maybe the most maybe you're right. Maybe the majority of them are really mangero users. Maybe they're all mangero users

885
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,260
That's not arch

886
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:48,940
I mean, I hate to be that guy. I hate to be that guy because I hate that guy

887
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:54,620
I hate that guy when you're like looking for a problem. He's like, oh you're using mangero. Sorry can't help but it's not arch

888
01:07:54,700 --> 01:08:00,380
I can't believe that mangero has more users than antergos though

889
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:02,940
It's been around longer

890
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:08,780
No, not by much. Yeah, but you remember people used to really buy into that mangero is tested arch thing for like years

891
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:12,860
Yeah, like they have the delayed release. Yeah people that always pushed me away from it though

892
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:17,900
Well, yeah, because if you thought about it for more than 30 seconds, of course it would but people that didn't think about it

893
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:21,420
That that sounds like yeah arch but tested like debian does well shit

894
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:25,420
I'll put that on my rig. I mean, you know, if you hear it like that, that sounds good

895
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:33,020
It's like arch but all that. Yeah, but then when you you know, yeah, of course if they only have maybe 3000 people running the testing version

896
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:40,060
It doesn't really do anything other than just slow down the updates. That seems like a bad idea, but that takes 30 seconds

897
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:43,660
I feel like we're suddenly crapping on mangero and I feel bad

898
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:49,500
Yeah, I mean, you know, you're right if you have nothing to say we should be celebrating

899
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:55,580
We should their glorious success of getting an oem behind. Yeah, because it's a big deal for any

900
01:08:56,780 --> 01:09:01,740
Validation and it's a big deal for linux because it means you know, we've we we saw those

901
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:10,060
Uh net craft is it net data? Yep, statistics three point something percent. Uh linux uses a growing trend there

902
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:16,460
There is obviously a growing market for these oems to sell linux devices and linux laptops

903
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:23,980
And we should be applauding that and encouraging it because it doesn't actually matter what distro is being sold. That's one more

904
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,980
laptop

905
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:30,620
One more person joining us and one less of them and more resources spent like getting

906
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:37,100
Getting firmware getting polish ironed out things that are in theory somewhat portable to whatever you want to run one

907
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,900
You know you think about two the other the other net effect

908
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:46,700
This is having is it's another reseller who is pulling on clevo to support linux better. So

909
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:49,820
There could be a come because of this because of this market now

910
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,780
There could become a point where clevo is one of the best supported

911
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:55,660
Out there because they got all these people selling clevo machines

912
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:59,900
And I know that some of these oems that are using you know

913
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:06,300
The likes of um clevo are starting to talk to the firmware update guys to actually get these

914
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,760
You know the firmware and bios for these devices

915
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,100
Supported by gnome software and firmware update

916
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:19,340
So, you know if this trend grows there'll be more people putting more pressure on these odms

917
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:20,860
to

918
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:22,860
Release their bios and firmware

919
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:29,660
under licenses, um or agreements that enable these things to go into these public repositories so they can

920
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:35,340
benefit from automatic updates and we don't have to be like barbarians booting off, you know

921
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,180
Yeah, yes, this is a serious

922
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:41,980
This is a serious tip of the hat to the managerial project because like we said earlier somebody did the business math here

923
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:45,580
And decided it was worth their time which is a real validation to the project

924
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,500
This is the kind of like real supply chain

925
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:52,540
Like you were just saying like the supply chain stuff that will make longer term change that is very different than just

926
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:59,180
You know some software. I want to know your thoughts wimpy though on them choosing to do a customized xfce spin

927
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:01,500
That's been quote unquote tailored for the hardware

928
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:07,420
I don't know anything about xfce. So you're asking the wrong guy. I'm sorry. What do you think? I mean, really?

929
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:11,740
What do you think it means to say? Why why xfce? What's that about? Is that a mangero thing?

930
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:17,420
I thought that was the default desktop for mangero. Maybe I thought only masochists use xfce

931
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:22,860
I can't I can't I can't joe's not listening. You do know one. Yeah

932
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:28,060
I can't you know, you spot you thought of speaking of speaking of joe the market research

933
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:34,140
Uh, I did a little digging for linux action news a couple episodes one episode ago and uh got some of the

934
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:38,220
Insk got some of the information behind where that market share number came from

935
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:44,700
And um why we hear about it from time to time and how many sites are involved in that information

936
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:48,220
So I would recommend you check out recent episodes of linux action news

937
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,460
I think it was 16, but that's off the top of my head

938
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:54,300
Where I kind of did a little deep dive into where that three percent number is coming from

939
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,300
It's actually um

940
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:00,780
Of course i'm saying this but uh, I actually think that three percent number is low

941
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:07,340
And I only and I I say that I say that after I researched how they're getting to the number

942
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:12,860
And once I realized how they're getting to the number i'm pretty confident, but I don't know of course

943
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:17,900
But i'm pretty confident saying that it's low and you you think so too wimpy. Well, pauline hub tells us so so

944
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:21,100
Yeah, well, yeah. Oh my god

945
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:23,980
Oh, yeah, well, yeah. Oh my god

946
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,060
Okay, so it's true they publish the stats every year

947
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:34,860
We've got significantly more perverts than three percent. Well, let's be honest. I mean, it's a great platform for porn

948
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,700
We've said that before it truly is

949
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:39,100
It's the best platform for porn as far as i'm concerned

950
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:44,860
Because and I think uh, you know porn shops have been good to linux running linux servers on the back end serving tons of video

951
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:51,020
Absolutely, the server side the infrastructure side and the fact that we don't launch executables has been really great for

952
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:54,060
linux, yes

953
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,060
Oh man, well there's be safe everybody

954
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:03,020
This is the more you know on the unplug program

955
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:08,060
Okay, so we have many things still to get to I don't know if this is going to work

956
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:13,340
Uh, but we I do I I spent some time to blowing off some steam this week

957
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:16,780
Uh, I got a lot going on. I got a lot. I got a lot in my head

958
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:21,740
I got a lot i'm trying to figure out and I thought what better way to focus all of this random energy

959
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:29,900
Than to try to break my tp link and belkin, uh smart devices turns out my tp links run a 26 kernel

960
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:32,300
linux 26

961
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:36,000
Yeah, yeah, so I had some fun and uh, what is this 2005?

962
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:40,700
Kali linux, we're finally going to talk about it. We should have we really should have led with this

963
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,940
I didn't really we just kind of meandered this whole episode

964
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:47,180
Uh, but we're going to talk about kali linux here in a moment. But first, let's take a moment and get real

965
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:49,520
Let's get real about digital ocean go to digital ocean.com

966
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:56,060
And use our promo code do unplugged. It's one word after you create your account. This will give you a $10 credit

967
01:13:56,060 --> 01:14:00,940
You can spin up a server. It could be a buntu. It could be fedora can even be free bsd or centos or debian

968
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,020
I mean

969
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,020
Do you have any free bsd droplets beard?

970
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:11,180
Hmm, why would anybody do that? Yeah, I don't know. I mean wes would you have any reason for a free bsd droplet?

971
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:14,700
Well, maybe you want to run some jails. That'd be a great way to run like yeah

972
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:22,380
I guess if you want end-to-end zfs, I just prefer the industry standard docker on my uh, on my uh industry standard abuntu

973
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:24,700
I mean, I just me, you know, it's just me wes

974
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:29,980
I don't I don't know why I am still needling the bsd now guys and I don't know why it's like

975
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:31,580
It's just something I just it's in your blood

976
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:35,900
Now this is my moment in the show to needle the bsd now guys and I take it almost every week

977
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:37,900
I take it almost every week

978
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:43,340
But anyways, we're gonna catch you with the net bsd droplet someday and you are gonna have so much shame

979
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:47,980
You know chris is probably because i'm bsc now. They need a less. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. That's true

980
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:53,180
Why would anybody install linux? Uh, I was just gonna say, uh digital ocean has been saving my bacon recently

981
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,580
I spun it up by droplet to run open vpn

982
01:14:56,140 --> 01:15:00,940
And that's been very very very handy, but uh, i'll save that for another story because I believe uh, mr

983
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,020
wimpy has one from the

984
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,320
ubucon ubucon

985
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,320
Yeah, I do

986
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:14,280
Poppy and I did a couple of snapcraft workshops at ubucon as one does

987
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
One on the saturday one on the sunday

988
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:22,120
And we went into a classroom and it wasn't set up the way we needed

989
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:26,600
so we span up a bunch of do droplets and

990
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:31,960
configured all of the course material on it and we did it all with do ctl

991
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:39,800
And a simple script to go and zap all of the machines with what we needed and we ran our classrooms off do droplets

992
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:45,160
Ah, very good. That's nice. And then afterwards do you destroy them or do you still have them just destroyed them?

993
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:48,040
Yeah, and it cost us a few pennies to run, you know

994
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:54,920
Several hours of classes on on dozens of droplets that reminds me of the time that uh, just this last linux fest northwest

995
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,720
I think it was this last one. I can't remember if this was the event

996
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:02,200
But during the live stream we spun up a digital ocean droplet transferred some stuff over to it

997
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,280
And then when we were done we destroyed it

998
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,640
And it's I it's I don't know there's something about that

999
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:09,320
This feels ultimately powerful

1000
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,960
Like it's really a lot of incredible compute power

1001
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:16,840
On demand and you can spin it up and you can use it and you can run your linux that you like to use

1002
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:23,160
And there's great documentation and a simple dashboard and an elegant api and they got data centers everywhere

1003
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,640
And it's just available to you when you need it

1004
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:30,040
If it makes you feel a little bit like tony stark and I I just love it if you use our promo code

1005
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:34,200
Do unplugged one word you get the ten dollar credit and then you can play around

1006
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,960
Run like the three cents an hour machine with our ten dollar credit

1007
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:45,000
It's great digital ocean.com use the promo code do unplugged after you have created your account over digital ocean.com. And by the way

1008
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,720
In their community documentation section

1009
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:54,040
They have a new tutorial on I guess it's really an introduction to load testing your box

1010
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:59,240
So if you want to test network latency cpu memory disk io all that kind of stuff

1011
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:03,080
They got a really great tutorial on it and it's it's applicable to anybody running linux

1012
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:07,480
But it's just an example of the value that they add to digital ocean users too

1013
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:13,960
Because obviously it's applicable to digital ocean droplets. I want to give a challenge to the community chris. Oh, yeah, I want them

1014
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:15,880
to

1015
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,640
Come up with things

1016
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:22,120
To do with a digital ocean api that nobody's ever thought of. Ooh, that would be good

1017
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:29,640
I want to see ridiculous things like stuff. They never plan for yeah digital ocean.com create the account that user promo code do unplugged one word

1018
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:31,960
now

1019
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:33,480
Finally, let's talk about kali linux

1020
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:39,000
And I feel like the only way to appropriately talk about kali linux would be to talk about backtrack linux because last time you and I

1021
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,080
spoke about this audience

1022
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:45,240
We were really talking about backtrack linux and it was a solid distribution

1023
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:49,640
People came together and they created something that was kind of unique. It was kind of the

1024
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:53,020
uh smashing together of slacks and

1025
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:54,780
Opix

1026
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:59,660
And then they would sort of smash it together and do these big releases with all these kind of features and I really loved it

1027
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:01,180
um

1028
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:07,260
Full disclosure. I I used it professionally to make a living for a while. So obviously i'm a little biased about backtrack, but loved it back

1029
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:15,660
Really was a great tool and um, but but things move on people move on projects change and they later on down the road decided to

1030
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:19,260
Essentially change things up and rebase

1031
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,140
And they rebased on debian

1032
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:25,100
And around this time they launched and they called it kali linux

1033
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,900
and kali linux is a

1034
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:33,820
Penetration testing distribution that's targeted towards ethical hackers. So let's crack open a beer here

1035
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:39,020
and talk a little bit about kali linux because this week I was having some fun and I

1036
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:44,540
I want to say there's a few different ways you can use kali linux you

1037
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:52,140
Surprisingly could legitimately use it as your desktop distribution gnome 3. They've got a couple of extensions installed like the applications menu

1038
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,100
In fact wes if you want

1039
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:59,740
This thing right here I was running it this week on the i'm going to turn on you see

1040
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:03,900
Let's see if the studio cams working because if I don't know if it is or not because I want people to find out

1041
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:10,220
I want people to see this thing here. So i've got it here on the dell precision 7720 laptop massive, which is just a

1042
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:15,820
Monster and the thing about this laptop is it reminds me a lot of the bonobo that I had back in the day

1043
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:17,900
When I was doing penetration testing

1044
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:20,540
And uh, so here wes i've got this is oh, yeah

1045
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:26,620
This is kali linux running off of the live uh thumb drive there and take a look at like the application menu stuff and whatnot

1046
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:31,980
It's um, you could just use that as your daily driver. I'm running gnome here. It's not bad

1047
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:38,460
Yeah, gnome 3 and they also have uh support for vmware. They have in fact vm kernel 4.9. Yeah

1048
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:41,420
Yeah, it's you know, it's they got vmware fusion

1049
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:46,460
Boot images and all kinds of different ways. What is this traditional style menu plugin?

1050
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:49,740
They've got installed and one of the nice things they support is persistent mode

1051
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:56,060
So you can still boot off a live media but save your data on a gpg encrypted persistent state. That's excellent

1052
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:57,820
Yes, it is. It is excellent

1053
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:01,500
It's very nice when you're doing different kinds of work when you're doing a multi-day project

1054
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:05,580
And that is a very nice feature. Oh, they've got open vos in here. That's one thing I was going to mention

1055
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:08,780
Well, let's talk about that. So open vos is where I wanted to start

1056
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:12,860
so I want to I want to walk people down breaking their own network and

1057
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:16,860
You got to start by discovering your own network and there's a lot of different ways

1058
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:18,940
You can do this end map is a great tool as well

1059
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:23,020
But I want to point you to net discover it's installed by default on kali linux

1060
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:28,060
And it's a network address discovering tool and it will really quickly it'll if you if you pull that

1061
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:35,420
I've got some screenshots. So anyways, it'll it'll quickly it identify all the machines on your network and the vendors who make the hardware

1062
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:42,300
So I could very quickly see all of the tp link and the belkin and the three amazon echo devices that are on our network

1063
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:47,980
Because it gave me vendor and what I assume it's doing although I don't know this for sure. But what I assume it is doing

1064
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:53,180
Is in the background it's looking up the mac addresses of these devices with a vendor database

1065
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:57,820
And it's matching mac address to vendor and then it's saying okay. Well it has these ports open

1066
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,700
It has on this network ip address and this is the hardware

1067
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:08,140
So within about 30 seconds using net discover and the command is really simple in my case. It was net discover space

1068
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,840
192.168.0

1069
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:13,420
Dot zero slash 24

1070
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:17,100
And that told it to scan my entire network

1071
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:24,240
192.168.0.0.24 now my network is a 192 network if you had a 172 or a 10.1 network

1072
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:29,840
You would need to adjust your command but net discover space 192.168

1073
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:36,840
Zero dot zero slash 24 you execute that command and within seconds net discover will find every device on your network

1074
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,840
It'll give you the manufacturer information about it

1075
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:45,680
And see this seems super helpful because there's a lot of tools I've used where I've been very frustrated with like a like an NMS

1076
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,400
That does auto discovery, but does a bunch of other stuff, too

1077
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:52,280
So if I could just have one tool that would keep me apprised of changes to my network

1078
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:56,600
But without having a bunch of nonsense, I don't know that too great for that. It's really great

1079
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:01,640
yeah, so then you get your list of machines you want to go after the machines you want to attack or audit and

1080
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:08,320
For me it was the TP link devices, and this is where open vos comes in so how did you know about open vos?

1081
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:13,600
Oh, I'd looked at using it at various employers before yeah, so there's there's several different

1082
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:22,080
assessment tools these are tools that will scan a host IP and just bang on every single port try executing different commands if it

1083
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,080
Gets a telnet connection

1084
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:28,320
It'll try to log in like it just does everything to abuse a box and you can have it abuse an entire network

1085
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:33,160
Or you can have it just hammer a machine, and it's not necessarily going to execute a payload

1086
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,320
But it's going to tell you what doesn't work. What is vulnerable

1087
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,360
If it leaks a certain time stamp that could be used to decrypt data

1088
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:45,720
It tells you all these things about a host which I was curious about with these TP link devices

1089
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:48,140
Which didn't really give me much information

1090
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,700
Unfortunately, but open vos or open VAS the reason why I went with it

1091
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:57,980
It stands open VAS by the way stands for the open vulnerability assessment system

1092
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,800
That's what the VAS is is the vulnerability assessment system

1093
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:06,800
And I started using it because it reminds me a lot of a tool that I used back in the day called Nessus

1094
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:12,280
Oh, yeah, the Nessus vulnerability scanner. Yeah, so this is along that same line

1095
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:16,420
It's an open source vulnerability scanner that subscribes to a database guys

1096
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:23,460
This is key it subscribes to a database and it pulls down all of the latest vulnerabilities and exploits constantly

1097
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:24,900
So you have the latest

1098
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:29,620
That's where the real like automation stuff that you don't have to do anymore and by the way the first word ever doing

1099
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:33,640
And all of the open VAS packages are in Kali by the way, so it's real easy

1100
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:39,480
there's a meta package you can apt-get you can apt install open VAS and it pulls down the common and the core and

1101
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:45,040
There's a first-time setup wizard you can run under Kali Linux and it will go down it will set up the database

1102
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:48,040
Which I believe might be Postgres by default on Kali

1103
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:55,280
Excellent pulls down all of the vulnerability assessment updates which on on our hundred megabit connection here at the studio took 45 minutes

1104
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,840
Download so it will take a long time and do it where you have a fast connection

1105
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:05,340
But once it's done you can throw the weight of the security community's entire knowledge set at a system

1106
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:09,780
And you can just punish it to see what it what it is vulnerable to

1107
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:13,320
And one of the things that's a lot of fun is once you get results in open VAS

1108
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:17,260
And there's other ways to do this under Kali open VAS is the way I like to do it

1109
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:21,880
But there's other ways but what I do is I take the data set I get from open VAS and I run it through

1110
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,200
something called Metasploit

1111
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:31,440
Metasploit is more like a list of known exploits and and it's like

1112
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,640
Macros to execute them Metasploit is like

1113
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:41,520
Imagine a whole bunch of shell scripts that do bad shit on your system. Only it's everything. It's like remote RPC connections

1114
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:46,480
It's sequel database connections. It's HTTP stuff and you tell Metasploit. This is the host

1115
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:53,000
This is the vulnerability it has which I got using open VAS you tell Metasploit now. Okay, here's the IP. Here's the port

1116
01:24:53,000 --> 01:25:00,560
Here's the it's running Apache go execute a shell on that system. So you say here's Apache. Here's the IP now go give me shell

1117
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:07,140
That's what Metasploit does and it's it's so much fun because you can look at a system with open VAS and go

1118
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:12,560
Oh, they have a vulnerability in MySQL and then you go tell Metasploit go talk to MySQL at this IP

1119
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,220
And now you own the box. Yep, and it can be a great way to go verify that

1120
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:21,440
Did your patch sets actually apply go Metasploit it if you get in then? No, they didn't yeah

1121
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:30,400
Exactly, and I've linked in the show notes an article on the Kali Linux docs page about using Metasploit and it's a it's it's

1122
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:35,800
Something you could load to your machine and have it and dedicated to a hard drive or something like I'm doing we can have

1123
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:40,440
On a thumb drive and from time to time you fire it up and just do an audit of your network a little Kali and Docker

1124
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:45,600
Yeah, I like to think of Metasploit as like unit tests for vulnerabilities. Mm-hmm

1125
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,320
Mm-hmm. Yeah, and it's um

1126
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:54,280
Kind of complicated to set up. It's not hard. I won't say hard, but I'll say it's complicated to set up

1127
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:59,840
But once you get set up, it's pretty easy and met and Metasploit. It's pretty much set up out of the box on Kali

1128
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:05,120
Yeah, which is really cool. So what I decided to do was just sort of bang on these TP links now

1129
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,880
They don't really return much. So what I noticed is TP link is

1130
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:15,520
They have they've they've changed all of like the return codes all that although like they had the the version identifiers doesn't return any of that

1131
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:19,520
Stuff so I think when people say they have like a hardened Linux they have Linux

1132
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:25,040
It doesn't respond to any ports except for the ones they need and the services that respond don't give you any identifying information

1133
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:30,640
So if you somehow knew the version of like some software that was on there

1134
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,920
via like another leak of the companies like if there was a TP link a

1135
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:39,680
TP link leak about the version of Linux or the version of

1136
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:44,760
Node or the version of NGINX that they have on that little tiny little plug

1137
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:49,280
Then you can attack it with Metasploit, but because when you do a vulnerability scan

1138
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:56,000
They're not revealing any version information. They're not except for the kernel version, which is exactly what you would want

1139
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,680
That's that's what you you don't you don't want somebody be able to come into your network and scan your network and get all the version

1140
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:05,200
Information for the embedded Apache server and the embedded database server. You don't want that so

1141
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:10,520
Based on my just really quick scans of both the Belkin Wiimote devices and the TP link smart switches

1142
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:18,080
While they're running old versions of Linux these little smart plugs they're running old versions of Linux

1143
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:23,840
There's $65 computers running Linux or $35 if you buy them on sale, right? Yeah, but they're

1144
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:32,160
They're like bastard I'd bastard eyes versions of all of the software that have been modified and gimped to not fully be functional or report

1145
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:36,920
Themselves correctly, which I guess at the end of the day. I'm happy about I wouldn't necessarily want them to

1146
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,760
but it was sort of it was sort of like a

1147
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:49,640
Revealing in a sense to just even get like the kernel version and the ports and all of the IPs and all of the Mac

1148
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,640
Address like I felt like I had a better

1149
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:56,080
Understanding of my network. Yeah, even though I didn't really crack a TP link

1150
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:00,000
I didn't crack one of these Belkin's and I didn't I kind of didn't really try too hard

1151
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,160
I kind of didn't really try too hard. I

1152
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:08,600
Did walk away with the sense that now I have like a complete picture and I took screenshots, too

1153
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,720
So like now I have like all the IPs of all my network devices

1154
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:17,720
What their Mac addresses are what the vendors are so I know how many you know, it's a nice baseline, right?

1155
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:22,240
So that you add future stuff and it looks way different or you see a bunch more activity like you can now

1156
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:25,320
Benchmark against. Yeah. Yeah, I I really I

1157
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:30,520
I really just would say just just for fun go spend an afternoon banging around with Kali Linux

1158
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,520
I highly highly recommend it and

1159
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:37,000
If you're if you're looking for different implementations go check out their download page

1160
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:42,200
They have several I've linked to a couple different ones that I use but they have Kali hunter or net hunter

1161
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:47,460
They have the VM version. They have 64-bit and 32-bits. They have Katie Matei

1162
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,040
enlightenment 17

1163
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:55,460
It's just to have like a hundred different spins and I just I just went for the stock 64-bit Kali ISO

1164
01:28:55,460 --> 01:29:02,640
Which is a gnome 3 based and you can find it at K a li org slash downloads for that and

1165
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:08,580
If you got an extra one pour one out for backtrack, that was a real tool back in the day

1166
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:14,360
I really like that guys. We are we are plum overtime. We're not just out of time

1167
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:18,260
We are over time right now and I and I wanted to mention before we go

1168
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:23,460
So let's you know what? Okay. Alright, so let's do this. Let's I hate to do it. I can't believe it

1169
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:25,060
I see the pain in your eyes

1170
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:31,460
Let's punt the gentoo challenge to next week because before we go I just want to give everybody a heads up about I know

1171
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:36,500
I'm sorry guys. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But before we go, it's okay Chris. I'm still compiling

1172
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:42,540
Anyway, there's a community announcement. I want to make the our friends over the Ubuntu podcast have something special in the works

1173
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:47,420
Whippy, are you still here? Can you tell us about what's going on in regards to a giveaway over at the Ubuntu podcast?

1174
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:51,900
Well, it's not a giveaway. It's a a hard-earned competition

1175
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:57,300
We ran a competition in partnership with intro where

1176
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:05,900
We reviewed the intro where Apollo the current generation and they allowed us to use that as the prize

1177
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,700
and in a competition

1178
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:14,540
Which we've been running for many weeks and the winners of that competition will be announced this Thursday

1179
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:22,460
we've been tweeting all of the entries via the Ubuntu podcast Twitter channel over the last three days and

1180
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:29,940
On our subreddit all of the entries are there so you can go and upvote those entries

1181
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:37,600
We've already picked our winners. We're interested in seeing what the audience thinks compared to what we've picked as the winners

1182
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:42,500
So you can go and have a look at people that have composed music written stories

1183
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,500
Poems

1184
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:46,540
created applications

1185
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:52,940
Drawings there's just a a wide range and the theme was

1186
01:30:54,300 --> 01:31:02,260
20 so create something in 20 colors or 20 shapes or 20 lines of code or in 20 minutes and

1187
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:04,300
people have really

1188
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:07,820
Run with it. We just really interesting selection

1189
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:12,860
We got it. I got a you and I have to consult next time because we just gave away the XPS 13 we just gave

1190
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:18,780
It away and you got you got real stuff. You're like comics and music. Yeah. Yeah, that is great

1191
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:22,780
Yeah, it's so interesting because every time you do a contest like this, of course

1192
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:25,460
I can say this for you because I don't know if you guys want to

1193
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,140
You really discover how awesome your audience is

1194
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:36,620
Absolutely, I mean we we loved looking over these entries and they they're all fabulous and

1195
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:42,420
It's we opened it up because we didn't just want a load of people giving us a bunch of code

1196
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:47,220
we deliberately opened it up so that our listeners, you know who are

1197
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:55,620
Authors or artists or musicians and not coders could also, you know compete on a on a level playing ground

1198
01:31:55,620 --> 01:32:02,860
And it was absolutely brilliant. I think that's great. So check out the Ubuntu podcast and I look forward to hearing that episode now

1199
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:09,020
Unfortunately, that means the gentoo challenge will be punted. Whoa. Who saw that coming?

1200
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:13,980
I didn't see that coming couldn't have happened couldn't it couldn't have been predicted couldn't have been all those times

1201
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:19,820
I hours spent compiling for nothing. It's darn it this time. I'm going with dash o3, you know what?

1202
01:32:19,820 --> 01:32:21,820
I'm gonna wipe the whole thing and do it all over again

1203
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:25,740
Oh come back next come back next week Beardsley

1205
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:36,100
Mr. West at West pain and you can follow me at Chris Elias at Jupiter signal and Linux unplug dot red dot com

1206
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:55,100
See you back here next week

1207
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:09,100
Oh

1208
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:13,060
Okay, oh, yeah

1209
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:18,360
Well since we didn't do the gentoo challenge, I got a different idea for my my title

1210
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:25,220
Suggestion is changing. I feel like maybe we should go with the Kali Linux segment instead since that's what we in. I

1211
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:32,580
Guess the sad part is I was just about to install good. No, you should still do it

1212
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:35,180
You can you can report back next week about how installing gnome went

1213
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:41,420
And I'm doing it without system D from a third-party repo as well. Oh you crazy girl. You crazy

1214
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:48,420
That is save it for the future. We'll definitely talk about yeah, I'll save it for next week man. Don't worry. Okay, okay

1215
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:52,100
Speaking of the abundant podcast contest that you know as you know

1216
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:58,420
He opened it for designers and things and as a designer and a writer I submitted some Python code. Hey, oh

1217
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:03,900
I also installed a boon to 17 just now by the way

1218
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:10,300
I know the it's ironic that we're trying to do the gentoo challenge because all I really want to do is just load all the different

1219
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,300
versions of a bunch of

1220
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:16,540
Yeah, it's a good for them though good for the by the way

1221
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:21,120
I put it on my macbook that I got for my birthday really a new one or a used one

1222
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:26,280
It was one off of eBay because my dad didn't want it. What's the year? What's the year? What's the year?

1223
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:33,280
2013 late version 15 inch with Nvidia graphics. That's what I have. That's that is the sweet spot right now

1224
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:36,780
I mean and you know what? It's still a good system. It's still

1225
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:43,840
The high dpi display on it looks crisp as hell. Yeah, I know I

1226
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:47,200
I've night cuz I had had you know, it really sucks though

1227
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:52,940
The only thing is the only good desktop that looks on it with the no display. No, I'm

1228
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,840
Yeah, I know. Oh, I know

1229
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:02,200
I that really bites because you can't do XFC. You can't do Katie. You can't do none of that with but it looks

1230
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,420
Amazing. It looks like the screen good it

1231
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,120
But please don't don't like the screen. Yeah

1232
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:12,000
I've had high dpi on a 13 inch screen

1233
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:18,760
But when we put Linux on the MacBook Pro with a 15 inch high dpi whole nother level, but yeah, it's a whole nother level

1234
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:24,080
It's so good. The only thing that I've had troubles with is getting this graphic switching to work properly

1235
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:30,000
Oh, I don't even bother. I just run the Nvidia all the time. Yeah, I get you. I tried gentoo on it

1236
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Oh talk about a nightmare
