1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
You've got a workstation with drives in it that has ButterFS, is it a RAID or is it just

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,680
straight drives?

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,940
It was a single disk with ButterFS as the root file system and my home partition was

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,920
on that same root disk.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,240
Anything fancy like LZO compressor or anything like that?

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,920
Everything that you covered in your recent ButterFS article, I've been doing that for

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,920
two years.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,920
Okay, alright.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,440
So now, as it happened, fate came to calling and I lost the drive.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,560
So I was able to actually restore from backups and I was determined not to lose my Arch install

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,800
that I'd been nurturing for two years.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,440
This is where I'm at right now.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,480
So I R-synced the whole thing over and there were a few files that were complaining that

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,320
they were lost sectors and what have you and it was mostly Firefox cache and stuff like

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,400
that.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,480
So I went with it and I bit the bullet.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,120
So what I've done is I've got two drives now in that machine, an SSD for the root file

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:09,900
system which is ButterFS and LZO compression and all that good stuff, but a second spinning

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,760
disk which I'm using for my home drive and I've put XFS back on that because I trust

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
it.

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,560
See, this is what I was wondering is if XFS isn't maybe the way to go.

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,720
Until I experimented with ButterFS a couple of years ago on Arch, I've used XFS on everything

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,640
for donkey's years and it's never gone down.

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
Yeah, you've been wimpy.

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
XFS all the way.

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Yeah, it's pretty good.

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,120
Yeah, I mean XFS back when I really cared about it and also because I needed extended

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,120
attributes XFS was the way I went.

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:45,400
This time around, it's like Linux needs an answer to the ZFS problem so bad and I think

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,380
it's way worse than as a general community we acknowledge it.

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,200
CPU comes from a large server storage back end.

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,320
The benefits of ZFS and just sort of like the brand that it is now accumulated so you

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,080
just say the name ZFS and people kind of associate a lot of factors with it.

34
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,240
Just that alone is going to deploy more free BSD than I think we've seen in a really long

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,300
time and so for me, my take was well here I am, I'm doing these shows, I want to live

36
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,080
in Linux's answer to ZFS, I want to experience it and now I'm a year and change into it and

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,040
I'm pretty disappointed in the result.

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,160
So it sounds like Wimpy, your solution was copy it off in the format.

39
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,840
Well because the disk that it was on was dying but yes I took that as an opportunity to actually

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,640
switch to XFS and I was thinking of doing it anyway and your whole thing there about

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:43,480
ZFS is quite correct because I run a completely Linux data center except I've just bought

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:50,160
two stonking TrueNAS devices because of ZFS and Linux doesn't have an answer to ZFS and

43
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:58,440
I think Linux's answer to ZFS will actually be ZFS and I can't see that ButterFS is going

44
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,040
to because apart from anything, despite the fact it's flaky and it is flaky because every

45
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,200
time you look at the kernel revs, you'll see that it's fixing corruption issues and things

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
of that nature.

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,000
The fact that the built-in tools can't properly read it, it's supposed to be the native file

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,400
system Linux and yet and I know it's for technical reasons DF isn't aware of reserved blocks

49
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,880
and things like that but it boggles the mind.

50
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,440
It seems so disconnected and I just can't get over it, it just seems like such a disconnect

51
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,200
and it's so disappointing because there are aspects of using ButterFS that I've enjoyed

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,000
like the performance, the compression has been quite good, the feature set I feel like

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,480
you get does not have a huge performance penalty, of course I've been using it exclusively on

54
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,480
SSD so I probably shouldn't make that as a proclamation but at least in my experience,

55
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,880
I've got an incredible feature set with very little overhead on a system that has been

56
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,120
fairly good except for these final problems that I've now reached to do and the problem

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,680
is these ones, there seems to be no solution other than reinstalling.

58
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,760
The issue with this is, and this has never really been a problem for me before, is this

59
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,520
is really like the one install, I really don't want to reinstall because I really, you know

60
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,720
I haven't had a Linux distro that maybe lasted a year or more, I usually nuke and pave even

61
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,320
just to test things out for the show but because of the hardware setup I have now, I've been

62
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,880
able to keep this thing dedicated to it and it's nice.

63
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,560
Don't reinstall, I didn't have to, get yourself a second drive.

64
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,120
I mean I know I could, I know that's the part I'm not looking forward to.

65
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:39,160
So Chris, I have a mate who works on Butterfess and he suggested that wiki article and I just,

66
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,280
you know I'm not teaching you to suck eggs or anything but have you gone through the

67
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,240
steps on that which is quite clearly for people who are in your situation?

68
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
I think so.

69
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
In fact I think I...

70
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,480
The only way you're ever going to stop Butterfess from taking too much goddamn space is turning

71
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,880
off copy on write.

72
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
Yeah I know.

73
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,200
The only feature is basically everything that takes up all the space.

74
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,680
Unfortunately that's one of the big huge benefits of Butterfess.

75
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,680
Yeah exactly.

76
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
I don't think so.

77
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
I don't think so at all.

78
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
Well maybe not.

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Maybe I should change my mind about that.

80
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,200
I did, so when I first started running this problem about a month ago, I did a Linux action

81
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,120
show special on like Butterfess and this was one of the things I went through and I did

82
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,000
like initially reclaim like 10 gigabytes of space.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was really stoked.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,840
In fact I even installed another Steam game to celebrate and then quickly that has already

85
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,760
gone back to like only one or two gigs free and then I do a scrub or I do a defrag and

86
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,800
then it kind of frees like one, two gigs free and so like every time I keep going back through

87
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,320
and take another pass at it and I try something to clear up space or I delete something, clear

88
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,060
out the package cache or you know or whatever.

89
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,700
So if I disable copy on, I haven't done the disable copy on write though.

90
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,160
Every Butterfess installation I do, I always disable copy on write.

91
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
Can you do that?

92
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,760
You might as well not be using Butterfess at that point.

93
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,440
Well but then you still get compression and trim, you still get compression and deduplication

94
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
and trim.

95
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
I don't use dedupe but you get it.

96
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
So that's not bad.

97
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,560
Well use F2FS then in which case.

98
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,920
Well it's actually funny, all you guys want to use ZFS but here I on purpose don't use

99
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,440
FreeBSD because the ZFS progs package is not good enough and up to snuff.

100
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,040
I stay on Linux because of XFS even though I philosophically like FreeBSD better.

101
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,120
So you think, so why are you running Butterfess with copy on write disabled if you could just

102
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
use XFS?

103
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Testing.

104
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
That's all testing.

105
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,520
I generally use XFS for all my actual installations.

106
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

107
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,520
Okay.

108
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
That's kind of why I put it on there.

109
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,840
And the reason I still run Butterfess in the root drive is because when I'm doing rebuilds,

110
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,880
the way that the Arch build tools are set up is if you're running Butterfess, you can

111
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,240
create a chroot and then clone from that rather than having to create a fresh chroot from

112
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
everything each time.

113
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,520
A bit like the way jails work so it speeds up the build process.

114
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Hmm.

115
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,140
I certainly recommend dropping by hash Butterfess on because they are very good in there.

116
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,240
That's what I should do before I go too far, really before I go too far down the rabbit

117
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
store.

118
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Yeah, don't wipe it or do anything.

119
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,840
If you actually want to save it, yeah.

121
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,720
Well what happens is I keep thinking, even though I've been using it for well over a

122
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,240
year, I keep thinking to myself, well this is Arch, eventually it's going to blow up

123
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,040
and when it blows up, that's when I'll nuke and pave and I'll just switch to a different

124
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
distro.

125
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,200
But the thing is it just hasn't blown up yet.

126
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
And so now-

127
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,320
Well, it's more reliable for me than people make it out to be.

128
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,800
My server is sat on top of my fridge and the repetitive slamming-

129
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
That's a great server spot.

130
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Well, yeah, it's not, I know.

131
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
But it's the only space I've got.

132
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Yeah, no, it's like-

133
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:46,560
The repeated slamming of the fridge door means that the eSATA cables have popped out of the

134
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
array on more than one occasion.

135
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,680
I SSH into my server and the file system has gone read-only.

136
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,160
I just go into the room and I just pull the cables out the back of the sata array, plug

137
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,080
them back in again and remount it and it's fine.

138
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,080
It recovers.

139
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
It's not a problem.

140
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,080
I have not had any data loss with ButterFS.

141
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,840
And there is the story of Canonical's build infrastructure.

142
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
No.

143
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Oh, yeah.

144
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
No, I haven't had any data loss.

145
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
I'm thankful for that.

146
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,040
I loved the idea, but yeah, I actually-

147
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,560
So here's my question, and Heavens, I wonder if you play with this.

148
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,920
Once you disable copy on write, does it free up all of the blocks that it saved in the

149
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
meantime?

150
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,360
I'm not sure if it'll actually remove all the previous snapshots that it's trying to

151
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
keep.

152
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Yeah.

153
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,600
But most of the time, or at least a lot of times with time, since it's B-tree based,

154
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:42,300
as you do your snapshots, the B-tree gets bigger and the depth gets broader and deeper.

155
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,440
So when you trim it, you're going to get faster because your tree, your B-tree, is going to

156
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,120
be a lot less deep.

157
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,440
And is scrubbing that trim?

158
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
Because that counts.

159
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
I'm not sure.

160
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Yeah.

161
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Okay.

162
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
So that would be something I might look.

163
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
You know, that sounds like questions to toss in the ButterFS IRC.

164
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,860
I like that idea.

165
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:05,760
Maybe I can get this thing fixed and not have to reload.

166
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,400
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's powered by guacamole this

167
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
week.

168
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,760
My name is Chris.

169
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
And my name is Matt.

170
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Hey, Matt.

171
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,480
I had a little chips and guacamole before the show, and I thought, you know what?

172
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,600
I'm drawn from that today.

173
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
I'm drawn from that guacamole.

174
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,160
Hey, we've got a fun show coming up on today's episode of Linux Unplugged, episode 54.

175
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,520
We're going to have a little chat with Sam from the Mocha Project.

176
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,240
Sam's working to make Linux look a little better.

177
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,960
Not just Linux, as a matter of fact.

178
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,100
He's part of probably a new group of folks out there trying to bring a little beauty

179
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,040
to Linux desktop, and I think they're succeeding in a big way.

180
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,360
So I want to talk to him about what they consider to be a theme layer and how that works and

181
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,480
learn a little more about the Mocha Project.

182
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,600
We're also going to discuss a little bit of Linux-powered RoboCars.

183
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,720
That should be interesting, self-driving cars.

184
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:57,880
And then, using our mumble room as our counsel, we will have to discuss the situation in Munich.

185
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,420
The reports are going crazy this week that Munich is pulling back from their 10-year

186
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,440
initiative to convert to the Linux desktop, and that they'll be re-embracing Microsoft

187
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,220
any minute.

188
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:14,640
So we'll discuss that and maybe why it's not as dramatic as some, it would seem to be Softpedia

189
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
making it sound.

190
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,080
So that'll be all coming up in today's episode.

191
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,360
But first, like we do, we're going to start with our emails.

192
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,400
You guys always send in some great emails to linuxactionshowjupiterbroadcasting.com,

193
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,240
or go to jupiterbroadcasting.com and click the contact link.

194
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,160
You can choose unplugged, send it right to us.

195
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,760
So Heath writes in, we've been kind of covering this whole MacBook phenomenon that we noticed

196
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,380
at OSCON, and now elementary OS is targeting MacBooks.

197
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,020
So Heath writes in and says, hey everyone, I absolutely have and will again purchase

198
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,800
Apple computers with the sole intention of installing Linux on them.

199
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,240
Disclaimer, I'm a developer.

200
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,740
You summed it up perfectly, a laptop with a decent resolution, even 1080p, won't cut

201
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,740
it anymore.

202
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,240
I need the latest processor and SSD in a compact form, and you're left with a very short list.

203
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,240
I certainly don't agree that the Apple closed source walled garden vendor lock in philosophy,

204
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,040
but when it comes to high-end laptops, I haven't found anyone that competes.

205
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,960
I don't know if I totally agree with that, but I think it's easy to slip into that, especially

206
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,280
because the marketing is really pushed in your face.

207
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,080
He says, in regard to the similarities between elementary OS and OS X, all I have to add

208
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,400
is that while they may visually be very similar, they offer very different functional workflows.

209
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,320
I'm forced to use OS X for work, and I'm constantly frustrated with their outdated window and

210
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
workspace management.

211
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,280
Conversely, I'm annoyed with elementary OS, if I am annoyed, well, it's just Linux.

212
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,800
There's always a config file for that.

213
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,400
Obviously, everyone has their own preferences, that's why we use Linux, right?

214
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,540
We weren't happy with the status quo.

215
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,920
But if you dismissed elementary thinking it was trying to just be an OS X clone, I'd recommend

216
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,740
giving it a test drive, because it's really very different.

217
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,360
I agree with that ending statement, too.

218
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,720
I think some people do just sort of cast it off as an OS X clone and call it good.

219
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,180
Oh, yeah, no, it's much deeper than that.

220
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,360
There are other OS X clones that are much more clone-like.

221
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,720
This is actually trying to differentiate the experience from the ground up, I think.

222
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Yeah.

223
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,200
A little follow-up on those Chromeboxes that Noah mentioned kind of bit him in the butt

224
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,520
last episode, I think it was.

225
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,960
Bryce writes in, he says, tell Noah, he can put those Chromeboxes into production.

226
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,640
And remember, Noah had this problem where the gal hit spacebar and reset the BIOS and

227
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,760
disable the ability to run the Linux, because she just wanted to move the power plug?

228
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,880
Well, he says, this script will flash the BIOS of a Chromebox, and then you can install

229
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,080
normal Linux.

230
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,600
My main PC is now an Asus Chromebox with eight gigabytes of RAM and Linux Mint installed,

231
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
and everything works.

232
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,800
And I just completely wiped Chrome OS, the script linked above works on the HP Chromebox

233
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
also.

234
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,720
And we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

235
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,520
So I would ask Noah about that, but he's actually in route right now to LinuxCon.

236
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,600
He'll be doing coverage for us this week at LinuxCon.

237
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,480
So if you're going to be at LinuxCon starting on the 20th in Chicago, stop by and say hi

238
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
to Noah.

239
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,760
He'll be the one wearing Google Glass.

240
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,920
So probably not too hard to find.

241
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
No.

242
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
All right.

243
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,040
The last email for today's show comes in from Michael, and he has a question for us.

244
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,920
Matt, he says, hey, Chris and Matt, a longtime fan.

245
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,840
Thanks for continuing to put out the best show anywhere, and I can't live without it.

246
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,120
I'm sure that's very true.

247
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,400
I'm just wondering, if you ever thought about doing a segment on flash drive distros.

248
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,280
I've got four USB 3.0 drives on my new laptop, and it seems like such a waste not to have

249
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,320
at least one of them doing something as cool as actually facilitating my whole operating

250
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
system.

251
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Which one would you recommend?

252
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,600
Is it feasible to make one of your distros full time, a desktop OS based on a thumb drive?

253
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Again, I love the show.

254
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Keep up the great work.

255
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Sincerely, Michael.

256
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,600
So, I was thinking, what do you think, Matt?

257
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,880
Should we do like a thumb drive distro roundup at some point?

258
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,100
I've been toying with the idea for a while as it sits now, because I mean, previously

259
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,720
it was either going to be like a puppy Linux or maybe a damn small Linux or something like

260
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
that.

261
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,960
I mean, something very lightweight that you can run in the background.

262
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,480
But boy, I don't know.

263
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,960
That could be interesting, because I've tried a few that didn't really leave a great taste

264
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
in my mouth.

265
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
So, it might be worth trying.

266
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Yeah, because it's got to be a right strike.

267
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
So, right here I've got...

268
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Yeah.

269
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
It's got to get that balance.

270
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:07,640
So, right here I've got a Patriot Rage, 64 gigabyte, supersonic Rage, USB 3.0 thumb drive.

271
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,440
And I've actually, I've ran off this for a couple of days when I had some stuff going

272
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,360
on with one of the NUCs, and I didn't feel like troubleshooting it.

273
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,360
I installed Fedora 21 on the beta on one of these thumb drives, and then ran off that

274
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,960
for about two days.

275
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,720
And because I think this Patriot USB thumb drive is specifically designed for performance,

276
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,400
and it's USB 3.0, and there was nothing else on the USB bus, I actually, I really felt

277
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,320
like it was performing very well.

278
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,600
And then I started to toy with the idea of a NUC here at the studio, a NUC back at the

279
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,000
house, and a thumb drive between them.

280
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,560
That could be really cool, right?

281
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
Because the NUCs, if they're the same...

282
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
I think so.

283
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,760
Same hardware, maybe same monitor on both ends, so it's always the same screen resolution.

284
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Huh.

285
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
I'm just saying.

286
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
You know, that could work.

287
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,600
So, maybe we'll do a thumb drive review episode.

288
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,280
That might be really neat, because that might be something both Matt and I could toy around

289
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
with.

290
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
So, stay tuned for that.

291
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,440
If we do that, we'll give you guys a heads up.

292
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,360
Hey, let me give you a heads up about DigitalOcean, our first sponsor for this week's episode.

293
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,640
Go over to DigitalOcean.com right now and check them out, because we've got a special

294
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,680
promo code that if you use this code, you'll get a $10 credit.

295
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,840
So you're probably saying, Chris, what is that?

296
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,040
I'll tell you.

297
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
Unplugged August.

298
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,120
All one word, lowercase.

299
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,120
Unplugged August will get you a $10 credit over DigitalOcean.

300
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,960
Now, if you're not familiar, and you need to get familiar real quick, DigitalOcean is

301
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,980
a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

302
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,040
to spin up a cloud server.

303
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,280
Users can create a cloud server in about 55 seconds.

304
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,320
However, sometimes people get it done a little faster.

305
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
A little faster.

306
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,240
Jimmy Jr. wrote in, he says, I created my DigitalOcean server in 36 seconds.

307
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
Hi, he says.

308
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,760
I spun up an Ubuntu 1204 VPS at DigitalOcean in 36 seconds.

309
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,120
He attached the screenshot, but I didn't grab it.

310
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,840
And he says he'll be turning it into an encrypted email server.

311
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
What a great use for DigitalOcean.

312
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,840
One of the great things about DigitalOcean is they have data center locations in New

313
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,400
York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and London.

314
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,000
They just announced they're turning on IPv6 support in their third New York data center.

315
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,460
So if you know about IPv6 and know why that's a big deal, DigitalOcean can get you a droplet

316
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,240
in one of their New York data centers with IPv6 support.

317
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,600
Their interface is amazingly simple and intuitive.

318
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,660
Their control panel is powerful, and power users can replicate that power on a much larger

319
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,320
scale with DigitalOcean's straightforward API.

320
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,360
And if you're an Ubuntu user, check out the applet that you can get for your menu bar

321
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,120
that allows you to manage your DigitalOcean droplets right from the menu bar.

322
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
You just drop it down.

323
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,520
It sits right up there in the little notification area.

324
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,640
It's really cool.

325
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,600
And when you use the promo code UnpluggedAugust, you get a $10 credit.

326
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,560
You can try out that $5 rig, which will get you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte server,

327
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,880
one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer for $5.

328
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,840
I've been using a $5 rig for months, and I've spun up a couple of new servers recently because

329
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,040
it's so obvious once you start using it.

330
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,600
It's so obvious.

331
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,440
DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code UnpluggedAugust.

332
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,800
And a really big thanks to DigitalOcean, and congratulations DigitalOcean on adding IPv6

333
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,000
to another data center.

334
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,760
You guys are rocking it.

335
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,640
And thanks to Robert Danny Jr. for sending in his DigitalOcean success story.

336
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
That was kind of cool.

337
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
Good stuff.

338
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Yeah.

339
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,800
Hey, Matt, joining us now on the Unplugged podcast is the creator of the Mocha Project.

340
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,200
His name is Sam, and Sam is joining us on the mumble line to talk a little bit about

341
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Mocha.

342
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Hey, Sam, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

343
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
All right.

344
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,520
Thanks for having me.

345
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Oh, absolutely.

346
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,960
Thanks for joining us.

347
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,680
If you've followed any of our shows for a while, you know I'm a big fan of making the

348
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,180
Linux desktop more purty.

349
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,680
So I really like following what groups like you and the Numix Project are doing and making

350
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,520
not just a set of themes that work on one system I use, but across all of my systems

351
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,780
so I can finally have, you know, a little bit of consistency, but each device is still

352
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,400
sort of meant for that particular task.

353
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,120
So I wanted to start with you.

354
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,560
What was your motivation for starting with Mocha?

355
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,680
How did you get started?

356
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,200
And has it evolved into something bigger than you were expecting?

357
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,840
Well, I started it for myself, basically.

358
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,920
I wanted a look that I couldn't find anywhere in the other themes.

359
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,760
And I decided to share it with the community.

360
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,280
And from there, it kind of took off as people started using it and sending me requests and

361
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
such.

362
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,280
And I don't know, it just got very popular, I guess.

363
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,920
That makes sense.

364
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,640
So you call it, too, I've noticed you call it a theme layer.

365
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
What is that?

366
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
What is that?

367
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,960
Well, it's made up, really.

368
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:43,000
It's just that you can, because I do like theme, a GTK theme, or icon theme, shell theme.

369
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You can replace your entire default set with the Mocha styled one and layer it on top,

370
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
let's say.

371
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,960
I've made it across RPM based stuff, and Arch, and Ubuntu, and you can basically put it wherever

372
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
you want to put it.

373
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Very good.

374
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
So I call it a layer.

375
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,220
Yeah, I like that.

376
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,240
So tell me about, I noticed there's also other projects that are coming out right now.

377
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,760
There's not just Mocha, there's Numix and a few others.

378
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,600
Is that a friendly cooperation?

379
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,560
Are you guys inspired by each other?

380
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:22,240
Is there any kind of maybe animosity, because it's kind of the same turf?

381
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
I don't know.

382
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
There's no animosity.

383
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,320
I know a few people in the Numix project, and it's a friendly, it's more a friendly

384
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:37,280
competition and we make fun of each other sometimes.

385
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,080
What do you think about some of these distributions that are partnering with some of these theme

386
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,200
groups, like Antigros and Numix, who have come up with the Numix Frost theme and bundled

387
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,640
it with their distro?

388
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,560
Anybody talk to you about that, and do you find that to be a potential area of growth

389
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,560
possible?

390
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:02,920
Well, there was talk with Ubuntu GNOME to get it included in that one, not as default,

391
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,200
but just as an option for users.

392
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:12,760
But I am open to getting it on as default in some other OSs or distros.

393
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
There's no reason.

394
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
Yeah.

395
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
I think that'd be interesting.

396
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,400
Kind of the really last question I kind of had for you is I wanted to get your take on,

397
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,320
I don't know if it's a business model, a way for these projects like yours, like Mocha,

398
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,560
to generate a little money.

399
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,160
Is it partially, do you see a part commercial, part free?

400
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,960
Is it going to be donation driven?

401
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,680
Because it seems in the past folks have tried this and have had a hard time making it worth

402
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,240
their time.

403
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,760
For me, I'm not that, I've tried, it's more an experiment and trying to see if it'll commercialize

404
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
well.

405
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,720
And I just pay what you want or download it for free or just pay that $2 or whatever it

406
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,280
is I have.

407
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:01,200
And more often than not, people like the free thing.

408
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
All right.

409
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,560
Well, so if folks want to check it out, go over to mocaproject.com.

410
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,880
You can get Mocha and he's got themes up there for Cinnamon, for Plank, for Gnome, obviously.

411
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,360
He's got icon themes up there.

412
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,880
Android wallpapers too, it looks like.

413
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,680
Mocha for Android as well.

414
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,160
Icon packs.

415
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,660
Really a lot of stuff.

416
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,160
You must be working your butt off.

417
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,280
And folks, I have to tell you, this kind of stuff takes a lot of time.

418
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,880
So you might want to consider tossing a few bucks his way if there's something you like,

419
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,880
if you feel like it makes your Linux a little more beautiful and increases your enjoyment.

420
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,760
Sam, is there anything else you want to touch on before we run?

421
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,800
No, not really.

422
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
All right.

423
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Very good.

424
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,160
Well, keep us posted because I'm a big fan of projects like yours.

425
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:53,920
I think, I believe, and if you look at Xiaomi's new MIUI OS 6 that they just released yesterday,

426
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,440
to me, I don't know if you've noticed, but a lot of those icons look a lot like some

427
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
of the stuff you're doing.

428
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:05,040
I think projects like yours are inspiring designers at these ginormous companies, and

429
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,680
they are implementing your ideas.

430
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,240
I don't want to say ripping them off, but they're definitely being, I think, inspired

431
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
by your ideas.

432
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,840
If you look at their new operating system, if you look at their new OS, a lot of those

433
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,760
icons have a bit of a Mocha look to them, or some of them maybe have a little bit of

434
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,400
a Numix look to them.

435
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,000
And I think that's interesting, and I think you guys are setting a trend, even if you

436
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,320
don't have millions of users.

437
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,480
So I congratulate you, and thank you for joining us, Sam.

438
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,880
It was fun to chat with you, and keep us posted on future developments.

439
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Well, I'm flattered.

440
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,480
I don't think those guys are influenced by Mocha.

441
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:41,080
I get people compare it to Mui or iOS, but thanks anyway.

442
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,680
No, I wouldn't sell yourself cheap.

443
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
You might be surprised.

444
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,800
Well, those have been around longer than Mocha has, I think.

445
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Yeah, maybe.

446
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
You might be right.

447
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,640
I noticed it was sort of a, it seems like a trend that's been picking off, but okay.

448
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,880
All right, so Sam, thank you again.

449
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,320
It was really great to chat with you, and keep up the great work, guys.

450
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,760
Go find them at mochaproject.com, and kick in a few bucks towards Sam, if you like the

451
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
work he does.

452
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
And try it out.

453
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,640
You might build a, Sam, are you, like, can I also get it from, like, Distro Repos?

454
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,560
Are there, like, packages available for, like, Arch, and Ubuntu, and all the others?

455
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,600
Oh, I think he's gone.

456
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Dang.

457
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
All right, that's okay.

458
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Oh, shoot.

459
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
He'll be back.

460
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
That's okay.

461
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
I have him up there in stage, and working on that Echo, so he might be back in a bit

462
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
and answer it.

463
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Or Rotten will get it for us.

464
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
All right, Matt.

465
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,000
Well, we're going to talk about, a little bit about robotic cars.

466
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,520
Producer Eric went to a conference and got a whole bunch of really good deets that he

467
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
wants to share with us.

468
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,120
So, before we get to that, I'll just take a quick break, and I want to thank Ting, our

469
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
buddies over at Ting.

470
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
Go to linux.ting.com.

471
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Linux.ting.com.

472
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
Why?

473
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,480
Because you're going to save $25 off your first Ting device, yeah.

474
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,000
Or you'll get a $25 credit if you have a Ting-compatible device.

475
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,560
Either way, it's a pretty great deal, so linux.ting.com.

476
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,160
That also just kind of lets them know you heard about them here on the show, and then

477
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,160
once you go there, you can try out that savings calculator.

478
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,120
Take a look at that bad-mama-jamma.

479
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
Put your numbers into there.

480
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
The actual usage.

481
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
That's the trick.

482
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,720
See, Ting's all about what you actually use.

483
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,800
That's, get ready for this, you pay for what you use.

484
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Ha ha!

485
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Right?

486
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Yeah.

487
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
That's kind of concept, right?

488
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,000
You're not paying into some imaginary number of minutes that you may or may not use, and

489
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,680
so you always have to budget high so that way you don't get screwed.

490
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,240
No, every Ting line is a flat $6, plus any taxes for the man, and then it's just your

491
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,240
usage on top of that.

492
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,200
They take your minutes, your messages, your megabytes, add it all up, whatever buckets

493
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,080
you're falling into, that's what you pay, and it's so easy and so straightforward once

494
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,560
you switch to that model that you kind of look at the old model and realize what a gimmick

495
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
it is.

496
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,520
So go over to linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com, try out the savings calculator, and put your

497
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,120
actual usage in there.

498
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,780
If you are in my range, now I think the craziest we've had was Rotten Corpse.

499
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,360
I think Rotten Corpse was like $3,200 or something ridiculous.

500
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,640
Mine's like $2,000 in two years.

501
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,440
$2,000 I've saved by switching to Ting, and here's what's great.

502
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,840
I've got LTE everywhere I go, built-in hotspot and tethering, it's included with the plan.

503
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
Ting's like, hey, you want to use this as an ISP?

504
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
Go at it, bro.

505
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,840
I don't care.

506
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,840
Hey, you don't ever want to use our data?

507
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,840
Go at it.

508
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,840
I don't care what you've got.

509
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Bring it.

510
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
Ting doesn't care.

511
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,400
They don't care because they just want you to be happy.

512
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,160
That's why they've set up no-hold customer service, too.

513
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,400
You can call them right now, 1-855-TING-FTW, we should call them during one of these shows

514
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,600
because they're open right now, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., East Coast time, a real human, an

515
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,440
actual human being answers the phone and is like ready to answer your question.

516
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
Oh, you got a question?

517
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Yeah.

518
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Oh, you need something solved?

519
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
I can do that, too.

520
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,960
The other thing that's really cool about Ting as a long-time customer is their transparency.

521
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,080
Over on their blog, they're constantly posting stuff, like here's a behind-the-scenes video

522
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,200
with product management, and you can interview with their product manager.

523
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,560
They've got the customer service reps on here across the whole board.

524
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,880
There's the ICE Challenge, all of that stuff.

525
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,040
It's really an awesome company that really is on a mission.

526
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,400
They realized, hey, guess what?

527
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,400
There's a market need to make the wireless industry better.

528
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Literally.

529
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
And they are trying to fill that.

530
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,800
The people behind Ting are also the folks behind some other great properties you might

531
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,880
be familiar with.

532
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,840
They're two cows, and they have a mission to do this.

533
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,720
They recognize a market they can go into and fix things up.

534
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,040
I got to respect that, too.

535
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,320
Linux.ting.com, go try out a device because you're going to take $25 off when you use

536
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,400
that promo code.

537
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,600
You're going to own that device.

538
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
It's yours.

539
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,700
You're only going to pay for what you use.

540
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,320
There's no contract.

541
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,600
You're not getting locked into Ting.

542
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,240
If you don't like it, you're not locked in.

543
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,320
There's no early termination fee.

544
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,200
And to make things a little easier, they also have an ETF relief program for your existing

545
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,200
crappy carrier that abuses you.

546
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,520
They'll help you get out of that.

547
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,720
Go over to linux.ting.com to get started.

548
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,640
And a really, really big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

549
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,920
So Producer Eric, tell us about this conference you went to.

550
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Well, I went to, this was a conference that a friend of mine put on.

551
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,800
It's called the Think Big Conference, and it took place in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho at North

552
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Idaho College.

553
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
And it was actually really good.

554
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,080
It was just a one-day event on Friday, just this past Friday.

555
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:05,440
And it was where we had, basically, my friend Nick, it's his vision to put together a, basically,

556
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,160
bring tech companies into Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.

557
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,200
Coeur d'Alene has been kind of suffering from the economy, and he sees a great idea of bringing

558
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,000
a whole bunch of different tech companies.

559
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,720
And one of the things that, one niche that is kind of coming out of this is robotics.

560
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:29,520
So there's a whole idea of bringing the robotics industry into Coeur d'Alene.

561
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,800
So that's just part of it, but the first, you know, we're talking about RoboCars here,

562
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,640
and that's what Brad Templeton, Brad Templeton is one of the guys who spoke, he's the first

563
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,920
guy who spoke.

564
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,640
This guy, I mean, he helped build Usenet.

565
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,920
He was there helping build the internet in the early 70s.

566
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,880
And now he's working on RoboCars.

567
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,880
Yes, correct.

568
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,480
That's kind of what he's up to right now.

569
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,020
Now, does he see it as specifically RoboCars, or does he see it as, well, everything that's

570
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:05,040
going to be mechanized and automated will eventually be a robot of some form?

571
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,720
What he sees it as is, in this case, specifically, he didn't really talk about that.

572
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,040
He just talked about the cars themselves.

573
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Okay, I noticed a MacBook up there, so not a Linux user.

574
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,840
No, that wasn't his.

575
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,840
That's my friend Nick's laptop.

576
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,840
Oh, okay.

577
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,600
He was just holding the presentations.

578
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,520
But yeah, he wasn't a Linux user, from what I could tell.

579
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:35,400
Basically, his whole point was that human drivers, like 3,400 are killed every year

580
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:42,240
in the US, costing $871 billion, 1.2 million people die worldwide due to driving.

581
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,000
And it's just crazy.

582
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,760
The thing is, we actually do have self-driving cars that are here now.

583
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:55,280
Mercedes and BMWs both manufacture cars that drive themselves if there is heavy traffic.

584
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,600
So you can purchase those.

585
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,280
They're extremely expensive, but they're out there.

586
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:07,760
One thing that we were talking about was that if people had access to self-driving cars,

587
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,280
then people with disabilities could benefit.

588
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,760
It would be like a poor man's teleporter, you could call one up, almost like you do

589
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,800
with Uber.

590
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,840
I've also thought about it, it's almost like a cab in a sense.

591
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,520
I could potentially tell my truck here at the studio, go home, and then Dylan could

592
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,500
get in the truck and it could just automatically drive back to the studio and he could visit

593
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,760
dad for an hour.

594
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
Correct.

595
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Exactly.

596
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,760
There are all sorts of benefits.

597
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,160
We spend hours on the road.

598
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,080
Myself, driving up to the studio every now and then, that's a 90-minute drive.

599
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,320
That's three hours out of my day.

600
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,680
But in terms of if cars could drive themselves, then we could use that time.

601
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
To drink and drive.

602
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Yeah, to drink and drive.

603
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
There you go.

604
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
I was going to black out.

605
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
Credit to Blackout in the chatroom for that one.

606
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
Yeah, there we go.

607
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
To me, more accurately, drink and ride then.

608
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Right, of course.

609
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
Yes, very good point.

610
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:13,400
But what's interesting is that it would potentially use far less energy than we use now.

611
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,840
If they could all be electric cars, they could even be more efficient.

612
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,120
One thing though that I did question, there was a question and answer session, I asked

613
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,000
how much does open source play a part?

614
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah, that's my question.

615
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,160
Yeah, for instance, what's driving the car?

616
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,280
What's behind the car?

617
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,240
What's managing it?

618
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:42,040
Basically what Google is using is they base their project, their self-driving car, off

619
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:49,760
the source code from a car that Stanford University had in a contest and won this project.

620
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,640
Google hired those people, the people from Stanford, to develop the Google car that we

621
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
have been making news.

622
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,440
I thought the Google system was Ubuntu based.

623
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
It is Ubuntu based.

624
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
Okay.

625
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:09,400
That's why I said, the source code actually for the car that won that contest that Stanford

626
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,560
has, that's available on SourceForge.

627
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,160
So you have that, but most of the companies that are developing self-driving cars have

628
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,600
proprietary code and they're keeping it locked down and there's confidential.

629
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,080
He said he couldn't disclose too much without basically screwing over his NDA on a lot of

630
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
these things.

631
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080
Okay.

632
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,200
But he wasn't clear as to what my question was and I said, well, what if people want

633
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,640
to audit the code to know what's driving them around?

634
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,440
And personally, I don't know about you, but that's why I wanted to bring to the discussion

635
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,440
today is what kind of things can we expect from this?

636
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,880
And this is coming fast too, because we talked this morning on Tech Talk today about the

637
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,300
vehicle to vehicle communication standard that the US is working on that will be mandated

638
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,440
to be in all cars sold in the US by 2020 and it allows for them to communicate speed to

639
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,040
each other, potential collision information, things like that.

640
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:13,100
And that's, I would assume, designed to facilitate localized automated driving decision making.

641
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:20,600
And I also deeply am concerned by, it's sort of like, it's not the same thing, but I have

642
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:27,620
the same feelings about voting machines, is I really feel like that code needs to be public.

643
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,800
The public needs access to that code.

644
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:35,740
And in order to have a truly nationwide driverless system where I could be comfortable putting

645
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:40,060
my son in the truck by himself and having to drive him over all by himself, it really

646
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,560
needs to be something that everybody's on the same page with.

647
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,280
And that means whatever software we pick to manage and run it, I think it's going to be

648
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,420
the one that gets used for decades, right?

649
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,420
By everyone.

650
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,420
Right.

651
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,420
Yeah.

652
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,960
And you know, I was, basically my question was inspired a little bit by Karen Sadler,

653
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
who we met at OzCon.

654
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,200
She was the person who wanted to see the source code for her pacemaker and was basically overall

655
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
told no.

656
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
That's right.

657
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Yeah.

658
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,960
And when I hear stories like that, I'm just like, that's a safety issue.

659
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,840
There are people who are going to want to be able to see that source code so they can

660
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,720
trust what they're using more.

661
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,600
Well, it's also a safety issue in the sense of bettering public safety by allowing more

662
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,040
really smart people to look at that and find problems and fix them.

663
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
Right.

664
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
It's Lance's law.

665
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,960
You know, the more eyes on a project, the safer it is.

666
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,040
This is, you know, and the other problem is, and this is something we touched on on Tech

667
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,600
Talk today, was the security implications here.

668
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,440
And how, you know, when these vehicles are communicating with each other using this vehicle

669
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,960
to vehicle communications technology, they talk in, I think, what did it say, 10 packets

670
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,080
a second or something like that.

671
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Not crazy.

672
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,080
Something like that.

673
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
Or 10 times a second.

674
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
That's what they said.

675
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,080
10 times a second.

676
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,080
But they're communicating things like, this is my current speed.

677
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,940
I am doing 60 miles per hour.

678
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:00,200
If you could intercept that signal as somebody, you're not hacking their car, you're hacking

679
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,400
your own car, and then transmit false information.

680
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,080
You could potentially alter all of the cars around you, either bringing them to a stop

681
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,440
or speeding them up or causing chaos.

682
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,080
And I go back to open source means we could audit this and look for these types of vulnerabilities.

683
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,120
Obvious statement.

684
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:24,320
We all agree on that, but we are watching the legislation and the industry, not necessarily

685
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,200
always together, steaming down a path that I don't think as Linux users and open source

686
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,280
advocates we're going to be all too comfortable with.

687
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
Yeah.

688
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,240
And that's one thing that Brad Templeton touched on, was that there is definitely going to

689
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,380
be some security implications, and there is definitely going to have to be some security

690
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,400
work done on cars, because, like for instance, the cars that are out on the road with the

691
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,000
computers that are onboard, they're not built with security in mind.

692
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,880
That's going to have to be a reality for whatever is running the cars in the future, especially

693
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
self-driving ones.

694
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,880
Yeah.

695
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Big time.

696
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Big time.

697
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,680
And there are some systems, like we talked about it before, that have the CAN bus, where

698
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,920
the Bluetooth radio is on the same bus as the brake monitoring system, because that's

699
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,920
the way the regulations specify it must operate.

700
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,560
And you compromise the Bluetooth radio, and now you have access to the CAN bus system.

701
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,560
It's a bad situation.

702
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,560
Yeah, exactly.

703
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,480
It's just a bad situation if you compromise any part of that.

704
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,520
And I guarantee, and this is something we've mentioned before, is that there's going to

705
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:33,720
be times where people are going to have to do updates to their software, like Alan says,

706
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
patch your S.

707
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Yeah.

708
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,720
So, yeah.

709
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,840
Or there's going to be, or could there be car manufacturers who eventually abandon applying

710
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,180
updates to these cars?

711
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:48,280
And how will you get people to properly apply updates to their vehicle?

712
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,180
Because they're sure as hell not doing it to their routers, even though it could be

713
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,760
very harmful not to.

714
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,760
People don't update their routers, people aren't updating a lot of their set-top devices.

715
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
They just don't bother.

716
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Right.

717
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,000
So the car is going to have to also, likely, using the argument of public safety, be self-updating

718
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,480
without user intervention.

719
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
So it's going to...

720
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Exactly.

721
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
And then do we want closed-source software that's self-updating?

722
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,480
Yeah.

723
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,560
And that's the other thing I'm seeing, like current cars with their GPSs, you have to

724
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,000
actually pay for a GPS update.

725
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,200
And I think that's ridiculous, because that could potentially be a safety issue, especially

726
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,200
as cars get more and more automated.

727
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,680
Unless they update the celebrity voice.

728
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,680
Yeah.

729
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,680
Yeah, that's true.

730
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,680
Got to get Arnold.

731
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Get Arnold.

732
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,680
I think TomTom made a Snoop Dogg one.

733
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,880
Yeah, this is one of these... Matt, I don't know how you feel about this.

734
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,200
This is one of these where it's like, part of me is totally ready for automated driving.

735
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,960
I still, of course, want to be able to drive.

736
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,440
But the other part of me is pretty freaked out by a lot of the security and privacy.

737
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,120
Because another thing to keep in mind, if every person is being driven by a central

738
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,640
computer system, then everybody's being tracked where they're going.

739
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640
Does that bother you?

740
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,000
Well, so here's the biggest piece of it for myself, from my own perspective, anyhow, is

741
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,600
that I think you've got to look at it from... Let's get our house in order before we

742
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,120
start handing over more things for people to regulate when they don't understand the

743
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,480
technology they're regulating anyway.

744
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,840
We can start off with the internet and let them actually learn how it works first.

745
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,600
Then when they got a handle on that, then let's let them handle regulating how our cars

746
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,600
work.

747
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,600
That scares the hell out of me.

748
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,400
Because not only are you going to be concerned about closed source and stuff like that, but

749
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,200
the fact of the matter is, where is this person from that is in charge of the regulation?

750
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,300
What's their background?

751
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,300
Do they understand it?

752
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:36,120
Do they have a vested interest in a past company that is going to benefit from this new... There's

753
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,080
a lot of holes in that that concern me.

754
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,280
So I think we're way too early on that.

755
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,400
Not from a technology point of view, but from a common sense point of view.

756
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
Yeah, I get you there.

757
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,400
Dr. Dovin, what do you think about it from a data security standpoint?

758
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,800
From my understanding, even though we don't have as much efforts in the automated cars

759
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,080
in Europe, there is already legislation in place.

760
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,080
I really hope that the data is considered from the user.

761
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,200
If that's the case, the data is considered yours.

762
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:12,960
Under the current digital laws, you actually have the right to tell them to delete everything.

763
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,120
They have to comply legally, otherwise they will get fined like hell.

764
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,360
I think as consumers, one thing that maybe we can influence, and I think we have to demand

765
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:26,440
it from the manufacturers, is we do not want the Android update catastrophe that we have

766
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,400
now where Samsung releases one update, and maybe Motorola releases another update at

767
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,600
a different timeline, and LG, and et cetera, et cetera.

768
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:39,120
Wouldn't that be awful if Toyota puts out an update that maybe Honda takes another year

769
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,520
to put out, and maybe Lexus never ships it?

770
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,000
And so you have all these different cars, and that will make the system stupid.

771
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,240
It will make it vulnerable and stupid.

772
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,680
You could have literally people driving around in 2,000, 3,000-pound vulnerability boxes.

773
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
I mean, honey pots.

774
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,040
It has the potential, as you make these cars more sophisticated, and you're actually running

775
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,280
an entire operating system on there to get dicey fast.

776
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,280
I'd like to hear the audience's ideas for solutions, and maybe some folks that are out

777
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,680
there working on some of this stuff have some insights, so go over to jupitabroadcasting.com,

778
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,200
click the contact link, and choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown.

779
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,240
Hey, one final point, I just overheard this while Brad was talking, and somebody behind

780
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,200
me said, if cars are driving themselves, where's the fun?

781
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah, there's that, right?

782
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,080
Yeah, that's huge.

783
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,080
I do enjoy driving.

784
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,320
That's why I always hope that, at least in my lifetime, on the main roadways, like freeways

785
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,880
and highways, that's automated, and then when you get off the freeway, the steering wheel

786
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,200
reactivates, your seat sits up, and it's okay.

787
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,200
You're driving now, human.

788
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,200
And by the time you're onto the off-ramp, it's transitioned into human mode.

789
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,960
Right, right.

790
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,280
That would be because, really, I don't need to drive the freeway.

791
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,600
And if the computer can do it twice the speed I can, then maybe we'd never have traffic

792
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,560
jams, or very few traffic jams, until there was a breakdown.

793
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,560
And that would be great.

794
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,720
But on the off-roads, let me have my fun.

795
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,200
I've got some laws to violate.

796
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Hey, we...

797
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,200
Can you?

798
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
Yeah, go ahead.

799
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,680
In EU, they actually...

800
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,840
It's mandatory that you...

801
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,040
To be able to disable the automatic driving and be able to drive the car as well.

802
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
Oh, really?

803
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,040
Yes.

804
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
So why are you guys so...

805
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,800
Why are they so on the ball with this when it doesn't seem to be the same stink, necessarily,

806
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
behind automated driving?

807
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,440
Why are they so ahead of this already?

808
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,880
It seems to me that even though we don't have the companies, the companies are struggling

809
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,040
a little bit because they're putting their feet in the water.

810
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,960
And it's also a way of inviting companies.

811
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,520
Look, we have a well-defined framework coming here, and you're ready to set up shop and

812
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,520
do your business.

813
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,280
Yeah, and I guess, too, they want to get left behind, right?

814
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
Yeah.

815
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,560
Because I was looking at this proposal that the US is working on that they announced today,

816
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,560
and it's US-specific.

817
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,300
It only applies to US cars.

818
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,960
It's only mandated in the US.

819
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,000
So it could mean that Europe ends up with an entirely different car-to-car communication

820
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,020
system than we use in the US.

821
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,640
But not the end of the world.

822
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,660
But look at the steering wheel situation.

823
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,240
We somehow made that work.

824
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,680
Yeah, it's not like we did that with measurement.

825
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,680
Oh, wait.

826
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,680
What?

827
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,680
What?

828
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,680
Get the king in here.

829
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,680
All right.

830
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,080
There is an elephant in the room that people have been asking me for days if we're going

831
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,760
to talk about it, and it's been snowballing.

832
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,520
It's this report coming out of Munich that they're about to abandon Linux and switch

833
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,520
back to Windows.

834
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,400
But before we get to that, I want to thank Linux Academy.

835
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,140
I think Linux Academy is a great sponsor for this show because you guys know what's up.

836
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,140
You know how this works.

837
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,160
We only pick sponsors that we think are truly great, and I got a chance to meet the guys

838
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,840
behind Linux Academy.

839
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,680
And it's really cool because I can relate with a lot of it.

840
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,160
They were off on a path, an IT career, which was great, but really felt motivated to do

841
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,000
something that could help the Linux community.

842
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,160
And so they combined their efforts.

843
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,280
They've got web folks there.

844
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,280
They've got educators there.

845
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,000
They've got Linux admins there.

846
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,260
And they're all working together to create Linux Academy.

847
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,240
If you go over to linuxacademy.com, slash, unplugged, you can take advantage of a special

848
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,240
30% offer.

849
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,480
It's the summer of learning over at linuxacademy.com, slash, unplugged.

850
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,480
Go there right now if you would.

851
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,560
I'd appreciate that.

852
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
And sign up.

853
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,720
And here's why you want to sign up for Linux Academy.

854
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,720
They're always making it better.

855
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,200
They're constantly adding new courseware, holding live events where you can ask the

856
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,200
educators directly.

857
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,680
They have step-by-step video courses that you can download and watch offline, or audio

858
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,240
versions if you want to listen while you drive, kind of like a podcast.

859
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,240
The study guides are great.

860
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,400
You also get to keep those, download those.

861
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,400
And it comes with your own server.

862
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,900
So if you get somewhere in the course material where you're ready for a server, they'll spin

863
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,960
up the VM and make it part of an integrated course experience.

864
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,760
And each course tells you how long each section's going to take, so you know how much time you

865
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,000
need to dedicate that evening or that day.

866
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,520
Whenever you're ready to just make yourself better, you go there, you log in, and you

867
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,040
know, okay, I've got 45 minutes to make myself a little better, to intellectually challenge

868
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,340
or stimulate myself.

869
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,640
Why not take advantage of it?

870
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,860
Plus, with their 7 plus Linux distributions available, they'll automatically adjust the

871
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,520
courseware to match the distribution you've chosen, which is really slick.

872
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,440
And you know that they were thinking, eh, some people aren't even going to need this.

873
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,240
Pretty much everybody's going to choose Red Hat, but they're Linux users.

874
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,240
So they know.

875
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,240
They know what's up.

876
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,040
And they're also expanding their OpenStack sections and AWS sections.

877
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,220
And they have good scenario-based training in all of those areas.

878
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,280
So when you walk away from Linux Academy, you'll really feel like you've actually implemented

879
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,400
one of these things in production, because part of the courseware will involve you actually

880
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,600
deploying an application that depends on the services you're learning about.

881
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,160
I think that's really smart.

882
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,080
Plus, since they automatically spin up a server for you, you're not worried about raising

883
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,680
like a bill on the Amazon Web Services while you're just learning.

884
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,200
Because that's all part of your Linux Academy subscription, and they're managing that for

885
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,200
you.

886
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,200
It's pretty slick.

887
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,600
So go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

888
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,600
Check out some of their content.

889
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,640
Once you become a community member, you can hang out in their forums.

890
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,640
People will help inspire you.

891
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,240
If you ever get stuck and need a little bit of motivation, just that little push.

892
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,820
You know, like people recommend if you go on a diet, you should diet with somebody else.

893
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,140
That way, or if you're getting off the booze, you should find a partner or a sponsor.

894
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,880
Go find your sponsor over at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

895
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,160
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

896
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,960
Yeah, it is a great one.

897
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,000
Okay, let's talk about this Munich situation because it is snowballing out of heck.

898
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,680
One of my favorite headlines came from Softpedia, Munich disappointed with Linux plans to switch

899
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,760
back to Windows.

900
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,160
Bracketed updated.

901
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,800
And we've also gotten some other ones like Ed Botts having, I don't know if you saw Ed

902
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Botts, Matt.

903
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,180
He's having a heyday with this.

904
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:27,920
Microsoft commentator Ed Botts is pleased as punch about this Munich news.

905
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,400
But it sounds like the story might be a little crap.

906
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,560
Is anybody in the Mumba room kind of up to date on the Munich situation and want to chime

907
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,560
in with some background?

908
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,800
Well, isn't it the deputy mayor of Munich that is just proposing going back to Windows

909
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,800
and nobody else?

910
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,800
That one guy.

911
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,800
Yeah.

912
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,800
Yeah, just the one guy.

913
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,800
Yeah, one guy.

914
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,200
Yeah, that's kind of, you just nailed this entire story.

915
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,400
And what's so funny about this, kind of proud of myself too, actually, now that I think

916
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,920
about this, I was reevaluating stories Friday, Saturday, and Sunday morning for the Linux

917
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
Action Show.

918
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,760
I always am looking at our mix and constantly thinking, well, maybe I'll add this to the

919
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,760
news.

920
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,040
Because sometimes, you know, we might cover four news stories in the Linux Action Show,

921
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,360
but I've followed 30 or 40 that week personally and chosen which ones to put in the show.

922
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,520
And that's why I feel really bad when we get it wrong, but I feel good when we get it right.

923
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,240
I saw this story, it initially popped up online, and the problem really comes, it's coming

924
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,480
from a German media outlet and it's all in German.

925
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,760
And so there's a translation problem that happens.

926
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,280
The headline's awesome.

927
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,320
And then once guys like Ed Bot run with it, it kind of adds some legitimacy to the story

928
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,820
and then it's everywhere.

929
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:39,440
And this is a way where the Linux community eats their own fricking tail because it started

930
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,440
here.

931
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,840
It started in, not here, like on Jupyter Broadcasting, it started in the Linux community.

932
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,280
We started this and then we snowballed it and then the rest of the media, who now pays

933
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,200
close enough attention, picked up on it.

934
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,800
And now the meme is that Linux has failed Munich and they're going to switch back to

935
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,800
Windows.

936
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,440
Even though it's the deputy mayor, it's the one guy, it does sound like there has been

937
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,440
some legitimate like customer satisfaction issues from the end user standpoint.

938
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,700
It also sounds like there's been some improper training and any kind of transitions difficult.

939
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:12,440
So I don't mean to discount the entire story, but what I am not so pleased with is just

940
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,560
how once again we're seeing another story go crazy.

941
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,940
Am I missing something?

942
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,940
You know, I don't think so.

943
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,940
I think you pretty much nailed it.

944
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:22,000
Cause if it's essentially really stems down to one guy, I mean.

945
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,800
Well, Der Devlin wants probably, go ahead Der Devlin, you probably want to say that

946
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,280
one guy maybe has the power to make the change.

947
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,280
Yeah.

948
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,640
And that, that is a legitimate concern if he's saying that.

949
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,040
But I do believe it's a false disappointment.

950
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,520
Don't you think that's even still, shouldn't the headline be deputy mayor decides to roll

951
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,520
back from Linux?

952
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,080
Not Munich decides to roll back from Linux?

953
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,920
Well, he decides over Munich, I guess.

954
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,920
So for all that.

955
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,920
No, they have a city council.

956
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,680
It's not as flashy.

957
00:46:52,680 --> 00:47:00,720
For example, for me is a false disappointment because they've done an exchange of programs.

958
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:06,400
There is little time and from that exchange, they hadn't invested like even half of the

959
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,800
money they were investing in windows to be actually saying that they did a degradation.

960
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,280
Like they tried to save everything at once.

961
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,280
And of course that will bring bad results.

962
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,720
Do you think maybe Microsoft is influencing this deputy mayor since they just set up an

963
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,200
office in Munich?

964
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,200
Yes.

965
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,200
Yes.

966
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,080
And they did mainly because of that guy.

967
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:38,760
Yeah, so this is kind of like, this is kind of like how the city of Seattle was planning

968
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,920
to deploy fiber internet everywhere.

969
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,360
And then when the mayor who was backed by Comcast got elected, they killed it.

970
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,000
Now it's a little black and white.

971
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,760
That's not exactly what happened, but it has that feeling from afar.

972
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:56,120
However, since I'm not sure, but this is at least from people I know a little bit the

973
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:02,920
reaction in Germany is because also these NSA spying things actually lead people to

974
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,600
drive a little bit away from these US companies.

975
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:13,200
And as a result, I'm not sure if the citizens are not going to pull up some to revert that

976
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,680
situation if that's the case.

977
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,440
Yeah, the chairman's also pointed out that he's been a self-admitted quote unquote Microsoft

978
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,440
fan.

979
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,800
He says Microsoft has been flexible and helpful.

980
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,800
I bet they have.

981
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:32,000
I bet they've been extremely flexible and extremely helpful to the city of Munich recently.

982
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,760
It really doesn't matter what happens now though.

983
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,760
The damage is done.

984
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,200
The fact that this has spread like wildfire around the internet, that Linux was a disaster

985
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,240
and Munich made a tragic mistake.

986
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,600
It really doesn't matter what the decision is now.

987
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,560
That is the headline the decision makers are going to have in their mind.

988
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,240
The correction will never be issued.

989
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,360
There won't be a correction ever made.

990
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,400
No, and Microsoft will be lapping this up.

991
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,480
I'm sure it will be up there on their whymicrosoft.com website before long.

992
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,400
Along with that, you can practically hear the sigh of relief.

993
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,680
These old quotes that they like to roll out.

994
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,280
Yep, and it feels like this is a reenactment of some of that.

995
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,680
And I think you've got to look at this and think who really loses are the citizens because

996
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:17,660
this is an opportunity for the output of their government to be stored in open formats using

997
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,240
code that benefits the people.

998
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:24,080
And when a government, when a large institution is using things like Libre or Open Office,

999
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,560
then they have more people using that.

1000
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,920
That helps that project.

1001
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,840
So that helps everyone who uses those projects in the entire world.

1002
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,960
And it is a great way for a community funded organization like a government to do something

1003
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,120
that helps everyone in the technology field.

1004
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,880
And the fact is, is that the things that they are creating for those people belong to those

1005
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,280
people and that if those documents cannot be opened by the people, then it is a disservice

1006
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,440
to the citizenry.

1007
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,320
And so it is not just like saving money.

1008
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,600
It is deeper than that.

1009
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:58,240
And that is, as our buddy would say, the most egregious thing about this.

1010
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:06,400
So Chris, my perspective on this is you don't just switch from Windows to Linux overnight.

1011
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,400
Well it took them 10 years.

1012
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,400
Exactly.

1013
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,120
And similarly, you're not going to switch back overnight.

1014
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:15,440
They're not going to nip down to Best Buy PC World or whatever and buy a thousand laptops

1015
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,240
running Windows 8.1 and say, there we go, we've switched back again.

1016
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,480
They're going to have a mighty project to switch back again.

1017
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,860
And that's the opportunity at which people who are stakeholders in the Linux community

1018
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:33,600
can bid for that work or, you know, back up our claims that the total cost of ownership

1019
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,040
on Linux is lower and that you have better more freedom on Linux.

1020
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,680
I think one guy making a statement that they're going to move back is not…

1021
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,000
It's more of a PR hurt.

1022
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I'm not so worried about…

1023
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Yeah.

1024
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,320
Whatever happens to one particular place happens.

1025
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,700
It's just more of the…

1026
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,220
Just adding to that narrative that sort of hinders Linux adoption, it just drives me

1027
00:50:52,220 --> 00:51:00,720
crazy because it feels a little dislegitimate, I'm trying to think of the right word, illegitimate.

1028
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,600
And the fact that the Linux, in inverted commas, Linux-friendly press have jumped on this,

1029
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:12,800
probably more than the mainstream press have, gives it more legitimacy than if, you know,

1030
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,600
this was a press release from Microsoft themselves.

1031
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,600
Right.

1032
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,600
Yes.

1033
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,600
Very much so.

1034
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,600
Very much so.

1035
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,600
Very good point on the legitimacy aspect.

1036
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,600
That's very true.

1037
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,600
And I think that's also kind of like…

1038
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,560
And isn't that the exact…

1039
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:27,400
Isn't that the exact group of people who should be getting this story right?

1040
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,280
Like, who does it help by getting this inaccurate?

1041
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,400
Like, it doesn't help anyone.

1042
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,760
Yeah, research is apparently done.

1043
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,760
But here's the thing.

1044
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,060
I saw this story on Saturday before last and decided, you know what, this doesn't look

1045
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,680
like it's worth running, this is more hype than it is anything.

1046
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:50,040
I recognized that Saturday night, like at 9.30 after putting three kids to bed, and

1047
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,000
I would manage to suss it out somehow.

1048
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
And I'm not some genius.

1049
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Clickbait.

1050
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Clickbait.

1051
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It's so annoying.

1052
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Yeah, slow news day for many people.

1053
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I guess.

1054
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
You know, maybe it is that.

1055
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Gosh, that's cynical.

1056
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
But maybe it is that.

1057
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Yeah, maybe it is.

1058
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,400
Anyways, we'll keep watching it because it could develop into something.

1059
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,760
I think maybe that's why it does have some legs is because it could eventually, PR damage

1060
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,760
is done.

1061
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,640
Like what Popey said right now, if they did switch, it'd probably be another massive transition,

1062
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,760
which we would then have to report on ad nauseam.

1063
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,600
But we'll see what happens.

1064
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,200
But don't believe everything you read on the internets.

1065
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,520
And it's funny because it does hurt a little more since it started internally first, I

1066
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,520
think.

1067
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,240
I don't know, maybe that's also why I'm just a little sour about it is because it started

1068
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,240
in our community.

1069
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,640
It wasn't, like Popey said, it wasn't started by Microsoft or something like that.

1070
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,640
So it cuts deep.

1071
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,640
Cuts deep.

1072
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:44,000
Chris, you've got something of a platform here and Mike Saunders, who is one of the

1073
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,520
Linux voice team, lives in Germany.

1074
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:51,040
And he's spoken about this and understands the issue quite well from a German perspective.

1075
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,000
So maybe it'd be worth getting in touch with him and getting on one of your shows because

1076
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,720
it's a platform to help air the truth.

1077
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,320
It'd be great maybe to have him come on next week if he's around.

1078
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,480
I'll try to get a hold of him.

1079
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,080
Let's chat more in the post show about that because yeah, that'd be good to get him on.

1080
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:08,120
You could join us in mumble and kind of break it down for us.

1081
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,640
Before we run, just a couple of little pluggy plugs.

1082
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:15,760
If everything goes as planned, we might, boy this is a big if, but just check out the calendar,

1083
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,900
check my Twitter feed.

1084
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,720
We might have some live feeds from LinuxCon.

1085
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,840
Noah is kind of wrangling all together right now so if it doesn't work out, it doesn't

1086
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,840
work out.

1087
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:29,560
We will have interviews soon from LinuxCon going on starting tomorrow.

1088
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,720
We may have a live feed from the floor and if we do, it'll be over at jblive.tv.

1089
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,840
I don't know when it would be because we're not going to stream the sessions.

1090
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,520
That's their domain, but we might stream some stuff from the floor.

1091
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,840
Just check twitter.com slash Chris LAS because if it happens fast enough, I might not even

1092
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,040
get a chance to add it to the calendar.

1093
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,760
It might just be one of those click click things.

1094
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,700
Just keep checking my feed and we'll also record and have all kinds of good coverage

1095
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:57,800
coming up from LinuxCon 2014 happening right now in beautiful Chicago, downtown Chicago.

1096
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,680
Don't forget, I'm also seeking your runs Linux, your personal runs Linux.

1097
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,840
It could just be a quick blurb with a picture.

1098
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,760
You could take it with your smartphone of your Linux setup.

1099
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,080
A video is even better if you've got a few minutes to maybe do a, is it called a selfie

1100
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,080
video?

1101
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,080
I don't know.

1102
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:16,040
But I'd like to see your setup and maybe your face and you could upload it to YouTube and

1103
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,800
then send it in to linuxactionshow at jupyterbroadcasting.com with a link and a description.

1104
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,840
I'd love to make those my runs Linux picks for upcoming Linux action shows.

1105
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,280
I've been having a ton of fun doing that.

1106
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,160
And last but not least, if you love what we do, if you enjoy a few of the shows over at

1107
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,420
jupyterbroadcasting.com, please consider going over to patreon.com slash today.

1108
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:37,760
That's where we're crowdfunding expansion of the Jupiter Broadcasting Network.

1109
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:43,040
It is a tech talk today Patreon in the sense that the show is associated with it, but the

1110
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,520
funds go to all of the shows on the network.

1111
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,760
They pay for physical goods, contract goods, a software we have to buy or whatever it would

1112
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,760
be.

1113
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,180
It's just kind of depends on the month or LinuxCon expenses, for example, for this month.

1114
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:58,120
And that money over at patreon.com slash today funds everything, not just the tech talk today

1115
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,120
show.

1116
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,080
It's kind of like my thank you.

1117
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,600
That's why I do that show is like, I feel bad taking your money.

1118
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,680
So here's a show I'm doing for you every single day to say thank you.

1119
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,040
And you can support any of our shows by going to patreon.com slash today.

1120
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,360
We have pledge levels in there that you can just jump in at.

1121
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:15,480
Matt, is there anything else we want to cover on today's Linux Unplugged?

1122
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,920
Well, I think you hit all the important pieces and that's definitely going to be interesting

1123
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:23,080
to see where the whole, you know, the whole Linux situation goes overseas.

1124
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,360
That whole thing just stinks.

1125
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,360
Yeah, we'll watch it.

1126
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,360
We'll watch it.

1127
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,360
Yeah.

1128
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,360
All right, Matt.

1129
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,720
It's going to be Sunday, so have a great rest of your week.

1130
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,720
It's nice out.

1131
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,160
It's really nice out.

1132
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,880
I know it's weird, but go out there, get some sunshine.

1133
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,880
The big orange thing in the sky.

1134
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,560
Yeah, now I'm going to go home to Ange and the kids and we're going to go play in the

1135
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,560
water park.

1136
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,560
Nice.

1137
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,560
Yeah.

1138
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,560
So everybody say hi to Ange in the chat room.

1139
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,160
Say enjoy the water park.

1140
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:50,000
And don't forget you can join us live, jblive.tv, 2 p.m. Pacific on Tuesdays.

Hang out in our chat room or join our mumble room.

1142
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,560
It's an open mumble room.

You can get the address in our chat room, jblive.tv, jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for your

1144
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
time zone.

1145
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
All right, everyone.

1146
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,120
Well, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1147
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:30,920
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1148
00:56:31,120 --> 00:57:00,200
I'm going to drop it on your brain faces and you just, you just let it marinade.

1149
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,200
Let's see.

1150
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,200
Where was it?

1151
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,200
Good question.

1152
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,200
Good question.

1153
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,200
Oh yeah, here it is.

1154
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,200
Yeah, here we go.

1155
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,200
Here we go.

1156
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,200
Okay.

1157
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,200
I promised somebody I would, I would bring this topic up to you guys.

1158
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,200
I want to get your take.

1159
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,200
Corky started a thread.

1160
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,760
He said is rolling really the future of Linux?

1161
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,760
Oh boy.

1162
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,120
He says with Linux Mint Debut Edition and Solid XK kind of announcing plans to go from

1163
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:26,200
semi-rolling to more sort of stable, are we seeing the pop of the rolling bubble?

1164
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,000
Anyone want to take that one?

1165
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,920
Well, here comes the arch fan boys.

1166
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,480
I'd say rolling is.

1167
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,040
Oh, you cut off, Rodden.

1168
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:39,240
Your mic's still on, but I don't hear you anymore.

1169
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,240
Weird.

1170
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,240
Is that better?

1171
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,240
Yeah.

1172
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,240
Okay.

1173
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:47,200
I was thinking like maybe the, the rolling is not necessarily a rolling or stable as

1174
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,040
in like one is better than the other.

1175
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,080
It's more of a particular type of experience that someone wants.

1176
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:56,200
So the fact that Linux Mint Debian is going more stable, which makes sense because the

1177
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,400
other version is stable, uh, uh, Solid XK going more stable so they can just not have

1178
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,400
to deal with it.

1179
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:08,120
And if they're trying to attack, they're trying to go to a particular type of the audience

1180
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:13,520
or whatever, then it makes sense that they would do that because they're going for the

1181
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,080
new users or the, the, the business area.

1182
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:21,800
Whereas rolling is typically not associated with that.

1183
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,800
Chrome OS is rolling.

1184
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,800
Chrome OS is rolling.

1185
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,800
Chrome OS is rolling.

1186
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,800
Chrome OS is rolling.

1187
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,800
Yeah.

1188
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,160
Anything rolling properly vetted is fine for businesses.

1189
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,240
I mean, that's, that's the thing.

1190
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,040
It's just heavier vetting, you know, just as much rolling, but heavy, you know, just

1191
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,040
vet the hell out of it.

1192
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,040
It's great for business.

1193
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,040
There's no problem.

1194
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,040
I agree.

1195
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,200
I use, I use rolling in production as well, but it is, I'm just saying like the people

1196
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:47,480
who want rolling can get rolling and there's really no, there's, there's no, which one

1197
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,480
is better.

1198
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,480
It depends on the person choosing it.

1199
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,480
Right.

1200
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,480
Yeah.

1201
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,480
That's true.

1202
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,480
That's true too.

1203
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,360
We had a good response to Corky says, hi Corky, I think the discussion is getting parked by

1204
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,400
a lot of distros and perhaps the big fat super distro story is coming to an end.

1205
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,280
The real value of rolling is the availability of services and applications.

1206
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,920
And I think the sourcing model is about to change.

1207
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,980
Shouldn't the, shouldn't the future be as simple as we finally standardized on one package

1208
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:18,240
format powered by system D. Big projects start shipping source code and containers, containers

1209
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,860
for each iteration.

1210
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:24,560
Big ones take the lead like Firefox or LibreOffice.

1211
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,360
I as a sysadmin install an application and I'm able to set up per container.

1212
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:32,920
If I have it auto update a rolling, thus getting a custom rolling release where the application

1213
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,440
levels are rolling, but they're totally isolated from the main system.

1214
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,400
The distro upgrade becomes far less critical.

1215
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,960
This is the core OS philosophy.

1216
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,440
You containerize everything and then the damage when you update the core OS is much less wide

1217
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,440
spreading.

1218
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,440
Worst case, it doesn't boot.

1219
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,120
It doesn't fix that problem, everything's back up and running the libraries, the software

1220
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,720
and the containers were never touched.

1221
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,920
Distro upgrades would become far less critical and easier to manage.

1222
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,860
This is also something that Fedora Cloud is working towards.

1223
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:02,000
Both Fedora Cloud and core OS, especially core OS, not so much Fedora Cloud, truly believe

1224
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,600
in updating as frequently as possible.

1225
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:10,100
Core OS is building a enterprise grade server OS that's being deployed by Rackspace today

1226
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:14,160
on the concept that a server operating system should be rolling.

1227
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,760
You containerize the apps.

1228
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,600
So it boils down to are we talking about desktop users or servers?

1229
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,200
Well, I think the technology applies in both cases.

1230
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,840
Just like we see it right now on phones, you bring in sandboxing, you bring in containers,

1231
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,600
you isolate the application off from the system, all of a sudden it doesn't really care.

1232
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:35,240
It might not even care if you switch from QT4 to QT5.

1233
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,880
It could be that level of separation.

1234
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,040
Yes, it adds waste, blah, blah, blah, but if it's managed properly, it's not so bad.

1235
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,040
Hard drives are big.

1236
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,240
Chris, we did exactly that on the phone.

1237
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,520
We containerized and we switched from QT4 to QT5.

1238
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,520
And how did it go?

1239
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,560
As long as you did the atomic things, it should be fine.

1240
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:57,620
There were some apps we did an audit and there were very few, like less than 10, that needed

1241
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:01,920
to be recompiled because they had binary components, but the vast majority of them were QML, so

1242
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,920
it wasn't a problem.

1243
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,840
That's got to be the future.

1244
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,840
It's got to be, right?

1245
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,840
Yeah.

1246
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,600
Well, that will be coming to the desktop.

1247
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,600
There's no doubt about that.

1248
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,600
What we're doing on the phone, we're going to push to the desktop as well.

1249
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:20,080
So you'll get image-based updates and click packages in containerized formats.

1250
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,080
I don't know.

1251
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,080
The chat room is giving me a hard time.

1252
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,360
I've had a couple of things break on me.

1253
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:28,360
I'm trying to think of the major breakages and it's been mostly VirtualBox, but I saw

1254
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,680
that like seven months ago.

1255
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:35,720
I'm thinking from an update standpoint where on a server, you're not going to want to update

1256
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:40,880
it nearly as often as say a desktop, therefore I wouldn't use Arch on a server, even though

1257
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,880
I did at one point.

1258
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,960
It's just kind of experimental, but the thing is, you've got to update that thing every

1259
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:47,960
so often.

1260
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,440
Otherwise, you go to update it and it breaks.

1261
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,800
I come at this from two aspects.

1262
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,440
I come at this from a security conscious standpoint.

1263
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,940
Old software that hasn't been fixed by security seems really unhygienic.

1264
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:00,940
It's very gross.

1265
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:01,940
It's nasty.

1266
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:02,940
It's dangerous.

1267
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:05,400
I'm a little risk adverse in that sense.

1268
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,480
It seems risky, not just for yourself, but also as an internet citizen, it's bad for

1269
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,380
everybody because your machine can get owned and used for bad things that launch attacks

1270
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,380
against other people.

1271
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:18,120
There's almost a social responsibility to have my router updated, my boxes that I connect

1272
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,120
to the internet updated.

1273
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,400
I almost do feel a bit of a social responsibility there.

1274
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,860
To me, getting new code in there, I feel like we are such a bunch of wusses.

1275
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:32,920
We have somehow locked ourselves into the philosophy that whenever software updates,

1276
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,140
every update has to be huge.

1277
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:38,220
What about just only a rolling distro that pretty much just is always rolling security

1278
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:42,720
fixes or things like just minor stuff.

1279
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,880
I wish we could redefine what rolling means and have one standard definition that everybody

1280
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,320
agrees on because rolling to one person is not the same rolling to another person.

1281
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:56,120
Then they'll argue at it from their individual standpoints like, well, rolling means that

1282
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,520
you could have major feature changes in an application and that's scary.

1283
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,800
Then another person is like, yes, but rolling means a config file could change and it could

1284
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:03,800
break.

1285
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,320
Then I'm sitting here going, none of that in practice has been a big problem and I have

1286
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:09,960
fresh software that's totally up to date and secure as possible.

1287
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:15,740
There is obviously some pros to it on desktop and especially on server, then it just becomes

1288
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,000
a matter of making it work.

1289
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Well, guess what?

1290
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,320
It's just technology.

1291
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,640
It's just computers.

1292
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:25,200
We have the ability to figure it out.

1293
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,200
I think the idea of rolling itself is fine.

1294
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:33,240
Where I am becoming increasingly frustrated though, like say with an arch-based distribution,

1295
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:37,440
is the fact that I have no problem, no matter how bad it gets borked, I can get to a command

1296
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,160
prompt, I can revert the package who gives a rip.

1297
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,600
But when I just updated 1500 of them, no.

1298
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,600
That's when you piss me off.

1299
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,880
It's like, look, I'm a reasonable fella, but this is getting to be stupid.

1300
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,860
It's too much on, I guess the arch problem is like you go two, three weeks and now it's

1301
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,400
like 500 packages or 400 or 200 or whatever.

1302
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,040
Well, and the rub is that here's the real rub.

1303
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,040
That's my problem.

1304
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,040
That's my choice.

1305
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,040
That's my bad.

1306
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:03,840
I'm the one, it's too big of a bonehead to update on a regular basis and so I got to

1307
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,200
eat my own dog food.

1308
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,200
That's not against arch.

1309
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,600
That's the fact that I'm really lazy when it comes to updates.

1310
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,600
I don't care.

1311
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,600
I don't want to deal with it.

1312
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,200
I want to do it occasionally and then leave me alone.

1313
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,680
Yeah, no, I get that.

1314
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:18,640
And I think that's a totally legit use case because that's how a lot of businesses are.

1315
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,120
That's how a lot of the machines here in the studio are.

1316
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,120
I'm busy.

1317
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:24,120
But you also got to own the responsibility of how you handle your updates.

1318
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,080
I own the fact that I am really neglectful there.

1319
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,080
So I own that.

1320
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:33,800
One of the things we've done here at the studio is we have two arch servers, one that we primarily

1321
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:34,800
use.

1322
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,880
And what we just did is, all right, well, these are the roles we envision for this.

1323
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,080
And if it goes out beyond this role, we spin up a new VM.

1324
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:46,700
So that way each box individually, like, I have gone two months without doing a package

1325
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:52,000
update on that arch server and then I'll do an update and it's like 25 packages.

1326
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,280
It's not a big, yeah, no, it's not bad at all.

1327
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,680
And it's like all like, yeah, it's all safe stuff.

1328
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,320
Well, I think when you're using rolling, you use your own level of stagnation, depending

1329
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,760
on what your needs are.

1330
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:04,760
Yeah.

1331
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:05,760
Yeah.

1332
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,360
And you can control how many packages you're adding to it.

1333
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,920
I mean, if you're like on an arch, for example, and you've just gone on a shopping spree on

1334
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,720
the AUR, you know, you're responsible for that for sure.

1335
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,720
Yeah.

1336
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:15,720
Yeah.

1337
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:32,760
Yeah.
