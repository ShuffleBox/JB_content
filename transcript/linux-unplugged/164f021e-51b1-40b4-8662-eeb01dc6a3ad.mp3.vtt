00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
Brent has been officially initiated into the stay-up-all-night-at-the-studio

00:04.800 --> 00:07.800
cramming to get a project done right before you got a travel club.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.400
Everybody gets to join that at some point.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.500
Yeah, it doesn't come with a lot of perks, really.

00:12.500 --> 00:14.700
There is a jacket, but we have to measure Brent first.

00:14.700 --> 00:15.800
Yeah, we forgot to do that.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.700
But Brent really banged it out with some help from my wife.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.800
Absolutely as well, Hadeah, she helped.

00:22.300 --> 00:25.000
And the two of them stayed up until 3 a.m.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
before Brent's flight to build something really special for us.

00:28.900 --> 00:29.900
You got to tell them what it is, Brent.

00:29.900 --> 00:31.500
I don't want to steal your thunder.

00:31.700 --> 00:34.200
Well, I'll just say, you know, originally I was disappointed

00:34.200 --> 00:36.900
because all my flights changed and I wasn't going to be able to do this project.

00:36.900 --> 00:40.200
And then last minute, Chris, I don't know, you must have changed things

00:40.200 --> 00:44.200
so I could manage to build the server rack.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.000
I bought out all the COVID tests around here.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.600
Clearly, I don't know how much you paid for that, but it must have been a lot.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.200
It's probably more than a server rack.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.700
I bought them all out so that way you had to delay your flight

00:52.700 --> 00:54.200
and yeah, it worked out perfectly.

00:54.400 --> 00:57.700
Yeah, we actually, you know, loaded the SUV up with a whole bunch of wood

00:57.700 --> 01:00.900
and went and bought some used casters that are pretty awesome

01:00.900 --> 01:05.200
and built a pretty sweet custom case for all the servers that we have inbound.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.000
So 3 a.m. at the studio. Totally worth it.

01:08.200 --> 01:15.400
Yeah. And now we have a sweet server rack for our server studio data center garage.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.900
I think we're going to need to remember to put some links on the show notes for this one.

01:17.900 --> 01:21.400
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.400
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. And my name is Brent.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.400
Hello, guys. Both of you are looking sharp and ready to go.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.400
We have a great show.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.400
You know, we've been looking at the data, we've been following the trends,

01:32.400 --> 01:38.400
and we think we've cracked what it really takes to drive Linux user adoption these days.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.400
Like, if we were saying, you know, we're going to need a lot of data,

01:41.400 --> 01:44.400
we're going to need a lot of data, we're going to need a lot of data,

01:44.400 --> 01:47.400
we're going to need a lot of data, we're going to need a lot of data,

01:47.400 --> 01:50.400
if we were savvy YouTubers, we'd have a zany face,

01:50.400 --> 01:53.400
and our thumbnail would say something like,

01:53.400 --> 01:56.400
don't miss this one trick all distros should be doing.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.400
And it'd be really kind of like attention grabby.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.400
But we think we have something here.

02:00.400 --> 02:04.400
We're going to share with you our hypothesis that we formulated

02:04.400 --> 02:07.400
after some late night binging of server builds.

02:07.400 --> 02:12.400
But before we go any further, before we get into that and the picks and the feedback,

02:12.400 --> 02:14.400
we got to say hello to our virtual lug.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.400
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.400
Hello.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.400
Hello.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.400
Hello.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.400
What a handsome bunch.

02:23.400 --> 02:24.400
Look at that.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.400
Oh, man.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.400
And they all got matching hats.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.400
Why didn't we get –

02:27.400 --> 02:28.400
Yeah, we weren't clued in.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.400
There's a whole like swag black market happening around the show,

02:32.400 --> 02:34.400
and we're not getting any of that action, you know.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.400
So I'm sure some of them will show up next Sunday,

02:37.400 --> 02:41.400
because next Sunday is our meetup, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

02:41.400 --> 02:43.400
if you're in the Pacific Northwest.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.400
We're going to do a little – here's what I think.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.400
I don't know exactly how it's going to go down yet,

02:47.400 --> 02:49.400
because we're always – we're flexible.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.400
We're a couple of wild and crazy guys, so we're easy.

02:52.400 --> 02:57.400
But I'm thinking we do a little meet and greet at 11 a.m.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.400
So start showing up at 11 a.m. is what I'm thinking.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.400
So that probably means you got to get here at like 10.30.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.400
Yeah, yeah.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.400
And then we do a little meet and greet, do some introductions.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.400
I'll have a couple of devices out that I'd like to see if people could get working,

03:09.400 --> 03:11.400
the devices that Brent and I have been playing with recently.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.400
A few meetup challenges to go around.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.400
I like it.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.400
I like many of those devices.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.400
Yeah, actually, you know what I'm looking at?

03:17.400 --> 03:18.400
Here's another one right here.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.400
We could throw that in the pile too.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.400
I got to get these charging though.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.400
You're right.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.400
I just walk through the studio and pick a few up that are sitting around the studio.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.400
Then we'll do the show live, right?

03:26.400 --> 03:28.400
So we'll put the speaker out there.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.400
People can hang out in the living room.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.400
Throw the live stream on the TV.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.400
You got it, right?

03:32.400 --> 03:35.400
And then after we're done with that, we'll go out there.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.400
We'll start cooking it up.

03:36.400 --> 03:40.400
And I encourage people if they got something they can bring with them

03:40.400 --> 03:44.400
that they can heat up in a microwave or an air fryer or oven or on the grill,

03:44.400 --> 03:46.400
bring it with you or if it's cold.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.400
But if you don't, we're going to try to come up with a few things.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.400
And then we'll just do eating and hanging for a bit.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.400
Talk about cryptocurrency, I'm sure, because that always comes up now

03:55.400 --> 03:57.400
anytime you do a public event.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.400
And talk about Linux because whenever we're doing a JB event,

04:00.400 --> 04:02.400
that always comes up too.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.400
So we'd love to see you.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.400
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.400
It'll be happening next week during the live stream.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.400
And, you know, we could probably have the stream going.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.400
I could see that.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.400
People come in.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.400
We'll probably do, you know, a couple of chats on mic.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.400
Have them hot.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.400
Why not?

04:16.400 --> 04:17.400
That could be fun.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.400
Try to capture a bit of the experience.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.400
Yeah.

04:19.400 --> 04:23.400
I know it's limited because it's just up here in the corner of the states.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.400
We are.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.400
But it is the times as they are.

04:26.400 --> 04:31.400
But we are actually formulating plans for a 2022 road trip.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.400
By formulating, I mean we're talking about how we should probably make plans.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.400
That's how far we are in the planning.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.400
The only one is think about needing to think about it.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.400
We got real good intentions.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.400
We sure do.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.400
We got the best intentions.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.400
We have some news to get into.

04:44.400 --> 04:49.400
One of them I just love covering because one of my predictions is already coming true.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.400
How great is this?

04:51.400 --> 04:56.400
Flat Hub is going to verify first party apps and allow developers to collect the monies.

04:56.400 --> 05:00.400
We'll have a link to gaming on Linux here where Liam did a write up that's really good.

05:00.400 --> 05:05.400
And he says Flat Hub is going to gain a way to process and verify apps from first party teams.

05:05.400 --> 05:12.400
As in developers who directly publish their app and manage the Flat Pack package process for Flat Hub.

05:12.400 --> 05:18.400
Not only that, but Gnome want to give developers a way to collect donations and subscriptions too.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.400
Maybe important for sustainability.

05:20.400 --> 05:25.400
Then there's some talk about having a way for developers to share some of that revenue back up with Flat Hub.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.400
So interesting.

05:27.400 --> 05:31.400
That I think is a great idea because Flat Hub is a good service and that listing.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.400
I mean it takes resources to run.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.400
And I think it plays a good important part in the ecosystem.

05:37.400 --> 05:43.400
It looks like there's also going to be a way to distinguish first party publishers and third party publishers.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.400
That's good.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.400
We've discussed this a few times already.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.400
It comes up a lot unfortunately.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.400
So some clarity there.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.400
That's appreciated.

05:51.400 --> 05:55.400
And I think it means I've already won my prediction.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
I think.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.400
I mean we don't know the details but I feel like.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.400
See now unfortunately I'm hoping that somehow Flat Hub goes bankrupt in the year.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.400
Flat Hub doesn't exist at the end of the year.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.400
Just so you know.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.400
It's not worth it.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.400
Never mind.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.400
How badly do you want to see me lose?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.400
I've just been so good lately.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.400
I don't know.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.400
Did I do all right?

06:13.400 --> 06:14.400
I can't remember.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.400
But I am very happy to see that news.

06:16.400 --> 06:29.400
And isn't it fascinating that one of the things that's driving Flatback adoption and just sort of user adoption and developer adoption is centralizing on Flat Hub.

06:29.400 --> 06:35.400
But one of the very core issues that people had with snaps was the centralization at Canonical.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.400
This is just a different group with a different kind of centralization.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.400
But because I guess it didn't start here.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.400
We're OK with it.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.400
Or is it just because it's not Canonical.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.400
I'm not sure.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.400
I don't I don't know.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.400
There is a fun.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.400
I mean we're a funny bunch in that sense.

06:48.400 --> 06:53.400
You know it kind of matters the some of the intention some of the philosophy for how we built it.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.400
You know that.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.400
Well we could run our own if we wanted to.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.400
We mostly don't though.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.400
Because why would we want to.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.400
But we can.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.400
OK now I want to talk about the Seuss Liberty Linux announcement.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.400
This has been quite the clown show to watch.

07:05.400 --> 07:22.400
Now our backstory on this just under full disclosure is we've been watching this since I don't know October because there was some data that showed up in the repositories that suggested a distribution named Seuss Liberty Linux was hitting the update repositories in the Apple repositories.

07:22.400 --> 07:27.400
And looking at it it seemed to be maybe there is even a good amount of them.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.400
You know not just like one or two enough to be noticeable.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.400
Yeah yeah.

07:30.400 --> 07:37.400
But this week we got the announcement of Seuss Liberty Linux and it's not a Linux distribution.

07:37.400 --> 07:41.400
It is a support offering.

07:41.400 --> 07:50.400
I've been a fan of Seuss recently but I have to say this is one of the more hilarious boondoggles in Linux recently.

07:50.400 --> 07:54.400
So they announced Seuss Liberty Linux which on its own sounds like a Linux distribution.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.400
It does.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.400
Yeah yeah.

07:56.400 --> 08:02.400
It turns out it's a support offering that supports Seuss systems and RHEL based systems like CentOS.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.400
You know those mixed Linux environments.

08:04.400 --> 08:11.400
They use the offering of breaking you free of lock-in as like the main value pitch of the platform.

08:11.400 --> 08:19.400
But the entire claim is ironic because if it was locked in they wouldn't be able to offer the Seuss Liberty service in the first place.

08:19.400 --> 08:24.400
So it clearly shows there isn't lock-in and that you can use different vendors like Tuxcare or others.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.400
Was that ever surprising?

08:25.400 --> 08:27.400
No. And so that's ironic too.

08:27.400 --> 08:33.400
But then here's the other thing is nobody knew if it was a Linux distribution or not because it was the worst kept secret.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.400
Everybody knew there was a distro in the works for a bit.

08:36.400 --> 08:43.400
And clearly all of the marketing and all of the communication language and the branding is Seuss Liberty Linux.

08:43.400 --> 08:51.400
So when it launched there were even Seuss employees on Reddit claiming it was a Linux distribution.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.400
And kind of embarrassingly the register ran with the headline that reads,

08:55.400 --> 08:59.400
Seuss announces something for those who missed the old CentOS Liberty Linux.

08:59.400 --> 09:05.400
And the whole pitch was it's their new distro and they say it seems to be based on a rebuild of CentOS 8.

09:05.400 --> 09:09.400
Although how they knew that since there was no distro released is anyone's guess.

09:09.400 --> 09:13.400
And everyone was confused by this and it's hilarious.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.400
And I have a little bit of bacon.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.400
Oh fry it up.

09:16.400 --> 09:21.400
Before I get to it, do you have any thoughts on this entire boondoggle since we've been watching this since the beginning?

09:21.400 --> 09:23.400
No, I mean it just does.

09:23.400 --> 09:26.400
Hearing you sort of go over it right now.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.400
Okay, trying to laugh a little less.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.400
It's unfortunate that there's not very clear communication here.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.400
You know like that's too bad.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.400
Maybe some folks will actually find this new product offering useful.

09:37.400 --> 09:44.400
Trying to look at that part of it seriously, it's just kind of unfortunate that that's all going to kind of get ignored for what we're talking about now.

09:44.400 --> 09:49.400
Right, and then to kind of add to the kind of funny launch.

09:49.400 --> 09:55.400
It may not even still be, but the day that they launched it when Wes and I were going over everything to really try to put this all together.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.400
Because we wanted to get our first take in LAN right.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.400
What was this?

09:59.400 --> 10:02.400
Right, we didn't want to go out of the gate calling it a distro because it's not.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.400
But like at the time they launched it, I couldn't even see a way to buy it.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.400
Like they talk about it on their website like you can buy it online from the SUSE online store.

10:08.400 --> 10:12.400
But when you go there it's not actually offered in the drop down of product offerings.

10:12.400 --> 10:17.400
And you didn't, I tried to get you to, but you didn't seem interested in scheduling a call with them.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.400
So I wouldn't be surprised if the sales aren't off the hook.

10:20.400 --> 10:21.400
But I could see existing.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.400
It's still 404 in at least this product page.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.400
They changed the URL slugs for products.

10:26.400 --> 10:30.400
So the link in the announcement, originally they edited it now.

10:30.400 --> 10:34.400
But originally it had a singular word product in the slug.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.400
But the URL is actually products with a plural.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.400
Yeah, yeah.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.400
See that's just unfortunate too.

10:40.400 --> 10:46.400
So there's that and then you have the whole issue of why did everybody think it was a distro?

10:46.400 --> 10:47.400
Like why did everybody get it wrong?

10:47.400 --> 10:51.400
Besides the messaging just being totally wrong and the way they describe it, it sounds like a distro at first.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.400
I got my theory.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.400
Here's my bacon about this.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.400
I think it was a distro.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.400
I think it was a distro until about the end of the year.

10:59.400 --> 11:06.400
And then they pivoted strategy because maybe somebody listened to LAN or maybe it just became obvious or, you know, enough momentum build up.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.400
But this was my take in LAN when we first talked about this rumor.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.400
And I think it all kind of holds out.

11:11.400 --> 11:17.400
Everything makes sense if this was going to be a distribution and it was going to be part of this offering, right?

11:17.400 --> 11:18.400
It was going to be part of the support services.

11:18.400 --> 11:23.400
So if you wanted to get this, you could manage your SOO systems, CentOS systems.

11:23.400 --> 11:29.400
And if you wanted to just maintain compatibility and not jump into stream, you could use their CentOS 8 rebuild.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.400
That is what they were going to do.

11:32.400 --> 11:41.400
But then they realized they would be creating the same exact paradox that Red Hat found themselves in, right?

11:41.400 --> 11:47.400
Red Hat had a problem where the thing that paid the bills was also be given away for free.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.400
And it was basically engineering versus sales.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.400
And you're never going to resolve that kind of conflict.

11:52.400 --> 11:57.400
Eventually, sales is going to win because sales has numbers they have to hit.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.400
They have a KPI they got to hit and they got to deliver results.

12:00.400 --> 12:05.400
So eventually that machine turns inward and looks for where they're giving away the milk for free.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.400
And they stopped that.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.400
That's exactly what SUSE was about to start doing.

12:09.400 --> 12:15.400
They were about to start giving away for free a rebuild of CentOS that competes with SUSE Enterprise Linux.

12:15.400 --> 12:23.400
And how the hell can you charge a premium, which they do charge a premium, for SUSE Enterprise Linux if you're giving away CentOS for free?

12:23.400 --> 12:25.400
It just doesn't make any sense.

12:25.400 --> 12:32.400
And I think they had to have that conversation internally and they realized it's a lot harder to fix this once we make this launch.

12:32.400 --> 12:38.400
And we'll just end up committing the same exact crime in communities' eyes that Red Hat did.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.400
This had to be the conversation.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.400
This is our chance to not make the mistake.

12:42.400 --> 12:49.400
We got to make this decision before we release it because once the cat's out of the bag, once the genie's out of the bottle, it's really embarrassing to put it back in.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.400
It gets worse from that, right?

12:51.400 --> 12:59.400
If you think about it, the other aspect of this that I don't think a lot of people think about is that those sales pay those engineers, right?

12:59.400 --> 13:04.400
So it gets – what's the word I would use for this?

13:04.400 --> 13:08.400
Particularly sadistic or masochistic.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.400
Masochistic, that's it.

13:09.400 --> 13:23.400
When you do this to yourself because then you wind up in a situation where those people that build those things that you enjoy for free aren't getting paid to keep doing it and so they can't.

13:23.400 --> 13:28.400
And that makes things super, super complicated.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.400
Yeah, that's complicated is a good way to put it.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.400
So this SUSE Liberty thing, I know it sounds confusing.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.400
It's not a dis or at least not yet.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.400
Maybe that's still part of the plan.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.400
Who knows?

13:38.400 --> 13:39.400
We're going to keep an eye on things.

13:39.400 --> 13:44.400
Linode.com slash unplugged.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.400
Now I kind of feel like you should do this one.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.400
Somebody wrote in and said have Wes do the Linode read.

13:48.400 --> 13:52.400
I wonder if you've heard me do it enough that you could do a Linode read.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.400
So it's Linode.com slash unplugged.

13:54.400 --> 13:58.400
Go there for $100 in 60-day credit and support the show obviously.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.400
I mean you've got to support the show.

13:59.400 --> 14:00.400
But why use Linode, Wes?

14:00.400 --> 14:01.400
Oh, there's so many good reasons.

14:01.400 --> 14:07.400
I mean one, it's kind of a – it's one of the services that Chris can use reliably, you know?

14:07.400 --> 14:12.400
You don't have – you can interface with all kinds of programmatic APIs and fancy command line clients.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.400
But also –

14:13.400 --> 14:14.400
You could use your Kubernetes.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.400
You can use your Kubernetes, yeah.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.400
But you can also just spin up, you know, Linux machines.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.400
As soon as you want.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.400
They've got like the distros that you probably already want to run.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.400
I mean oftentimes –

14:23.400 --> 14:24.400
All the distros really.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.400
It's easier, you know, if there's a new server release.

14:25.400 --> 14:29.400
I don't need to bother with something on my laptop because Linode's got the distro.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.400
They've just released it.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.400
It's on Linode.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.400
You can just boot it up right there.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.400
Yeah, you want to go play with Stream?

14:33.400 --> 14:34.400
It's on there.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.400
You want to try Alma?

14:35.400 --> 14:36.400
It's on there.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.400
You know what else we use the heck out of?

14:38.400 --> 14:39.400
That block storage.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.400
I mean do we store things any other way at this point?

14:42.400 --> 14:43.400
No, probably not.

14:43.400 --> 14:48.400
I mean if you want to mess around with disks and partitions like an animal from the 90s, you could.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.400
That does not sound like our style.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.400
No.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.400
There's so many great reasons to use it.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.400
Plus did you know, Wes, you might not have known this.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.400
Best customer support in the business.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.400
Oh, yeah.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.400
Yeah.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.400
All the time.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.400
They're available for you when you need them.

15:01.400 --> 15:05.400
And 30 to 50 percent cheaper than those big hyperscalers that are just trying to vendor

15:05.400 --> 15:06.400
Lucky in anyways.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.400
Yeah.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.400
And when you look at some of those hyperscalers, they've got everything.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.400
There's no way to tell like is this a good product?

15:12.400 --> 15:15.400
Is this one of your like premier things or just a random offering you have to be competitive?

15:15.400 --> 15:20.400
And I feel like with Linode, the things that they offer, they're really going to stand behind.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.400
You nailed it.

15:21.400 --> 15:22.400
You know why?

15:22.400 --> 15:24.400
They've been doing this for 18 years, almost 19 years now.

15:24.400 --> 15:31.400
And like legitimately 20 years on the internet is like 100 years in real life.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.400
Maybe even more.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.400
Same as dog rules, right?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.400
Yeah.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.400
Maybe even more, man.

15:35.400 --> 15:39.400
Like 20 years doing something on the internet is mind blowing.

15:39.400 --> 15:43.400
They were really in on this stuff early and they just made a great product.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.400
And you know, they're independently owned.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.400
They didn't have to go the crazy VC funding route.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.400
They got 11 data centers around the world and they've been supporting the hell out

15:50.400 --> 15:52.400
of Linux media now for like almost two years.

15:52.400 --> 15:56.400
They've also got some pretty great out of band access for when you really break your

15:56.400 --> 15:57.400
machine.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.400
Not that I've had to use that.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.400
No.

16:00.400 --> 16:04.400
Like when you want to load some crazy image on there that they don't have in the dropdown,

16:04.400 --> 16:05.400
you can actually get it done.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.400
Yeah.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.400
They're not going to artificially limit you.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.400
They're ready to get weird with it.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.400
We have.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.400
We have gotten really weird with it.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.400
Linode.com slash unplugged.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.400
All right.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.400
Well, if there was one trick to win over Linux users, maybe we've discovered it.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.400
I don't actually think it's us.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.400
I kind of say all this tongue in cheek.

16:22.400 --> 16:28.400
Well, we've crunched the data, done our research and maybe, maybe noticed a trend.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.400
I don't know.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.400
I'm not too serious.

16:30.400 --> 16:35.400
But I think we found something of a draw for Linux users.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.400
Yeah.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.400
What they're looking for in a distro.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.400
I think so.

16:38.400 --> 16:39.400
In 2022.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.400
At least a large percentage of Linux users.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.400
I think it's almost beginning to trend depending on what data sets you.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.400
Yeah.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.400
You know, it's hard to generalize.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.400
We're not trying to say this is true for everyone.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.400
Yeah.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.400
Yeah.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.400
Yeah.

16:51.400 --> 16:55.400
To understand where we're going with this, you got to come take a stroll with us through

16:55.400 --> 16:56.400
Linux Mint 20.3.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.400
What?

16:57.400 --> 16:58.400
Yeah.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.400
So this is going to get us to our point.

17:00.400 --> 17:05.400
20.3 came out recently and it's a nice looking release.

17:05.400 --> 17:09.400
Brent, I think probably has the most experience with Mint as a former longtime user.

17:09.400 --> 17:13.400
So I think we should start with you and your impressions on 20.3.

17:13.400 --> 17:17.400
Unfortunately, I didn't get to spend like a week or two with it, which I probably would

17:17.400 --> 17:18.400
have loved to.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.400
Hey, not yet anyway.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.400
Not yet.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.400
There you go.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.400
But I do have a long history with Linux Mint.

17:23.400 --> 17:28.760
When I first started, I used Subuntu for like, I don't know, six months or something and

17:28.760 --> 17:32.000
then was desiring a little bit more and landed on Linux Mint.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.440
This was probably, I don't know, five plus years ago, maybe even more than that.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.080
And I used it for a few years.

17:38.080 --> 17:43.160
I even tried their Linux Mint Debian edition for a while, which is their sort of rolling

17:43.160 --> 17:46.420
release cadence edition.

17:46.420 --> 17:47.420
And I liked it.

17:47.420 --> 17:53.040
Eventually it felt, I've been trying for years to sum up why I moved away from Linux Mint

17:53.040 --> 17:58.400
and I think it's because it felt like there were some restrictions on it.

17:58.400 --> 18:02.120
It's almost like Mac in that if you're doing what they want you to, it works great.

18:02.120 --> 18:06.000
If you're trying to do anything outside of what they want you to, then it becomes a little

18:06.000 --> 18:07.380
bit of a challenge.

18:07.380 --> 18:10.080
But at the same time, I was really interested in jumping back in.

18:10.080 --> 18:16.080
It's been several years and I think I do have this fondness for Linux Mint, even though

18:16.080 --> 18:18.340
I haven't thought of it for several years.

18:18.340 --> 18:26.400
So jumping in was interesting because Cinnamon feels exactly like it used to, which was really

18:26.400 --> 18:27.400
kind of nice.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.080
It actually felt like coming home in a sense.

18:30.080 --> 18:34.680
And then when I poked around, I started discovering, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, there's all these like

18:34.680 --> 18:40.480
defaults that are seem sane and are pretty lovely for, you know, what they advertise

18:40.480 --> 18:43.660
on their website, which is that most of their users come straight from Windows.

18:43.660 --> 18:47.160
And I think that's a really reasonable approach.

18:47.160 --> 18:52.840
But as I dug in, I started remembering all of those limitations that just felt, I don't

18:52.840 --> 18:56.000
know, not quite our style these days, maybe.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.800
And so I got mixed feelings.

18:58.800 --> 18:59.800
I think that's fair.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.600
I agree with everything you said.

19:01.600 --> 19:08.040
It really is iterative improvements with Mint, which means that if you've taken a few years

19:08.040 --> 19:14.400
off from trying it, and I also tried the Cinnamon edition, and you sit down and try it, I really

19:14.400 --> 19:17.280
can perceive the improvements over time.

19:17.280 --> 19:22.480
I felt specifically from just the last release to this release, out of the box, high DPI

19:22.480 --> 19:23.800
support is nice.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.220
The GTK theme is cleaner.

19:26.220 --> 19:31.340
And so I, just as a thought experiment, because I haven't been using Mint for a while, I first

19:31.340 --> 19:37.560
installed the previous release, brought that all up to date, used that for a day, and then

19:37.560 --> 19:42.800
wiped it and installed 20.3 and immediately just wrote down my thoughts on the differences

19:42.800 --> 19:45.500
just to kind of get an idea of what kind of improvements.

19:45.500 --> 19:51.320
And for the most part, it's like new apps, like the new things app and the high DPI support

19:51.320 --> 19:53.480
out of the box is really nice.

19:53.480 --> 19:58.520
I also felt that Cinnamon was greatly improved from the time I'd used it previously, a little

19:58.520 --> 20:02.680
less shiny, like less transparencies and window effects.

20:02.680 --> 20:05.200
But now it feels very solid, really stable.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.320
I didn't have any crashes.

20:06.320 --> 20:09.440
I even threw a bunch of widgets in the menu because I used to always be a surefire way

20:09.440 --> 20:10.960
to crash it.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.480
But no, it did fine.

20:12.480 --> 20:17.760
It really does kind of now hit that sweet spot between Plasma and Gnome.

20:17.760 --> 20:19.600
There's rough bits still.

20:19.600 --> 20:25.760
The app store feels really low effort, like they're just shipping the default and not

20:25.760 --> 20:27.200
putting any curation in there.

20:27.200 --> 20:32.720
Like when you go, for example, right now on mine, when you look at the editor's picks,

20:32.720 --> 20:37.480
there's half a dozen apps that are listed in this editor's picks as if somebody hand

20:37.480 --> 20:39.040
selected these.

20:39.040 --> 20:44.840
But then there's two entries for wine with two different icons and one's version 3.7

20:44.840 --> 20:50.160
and one's version 4.0 and I can't really determine which one is like the one they consider the

20:50.160 --> 20:53.040
default because it doesn't expose that information.

20:53.040 --> 20:56.840
And there's no flat hub, there's no flat hub integration.

20:56.840 --> 21:00.520
So that kind of stuff I was a little disappointed to see, but I could see them adding that stuff

21:00.520 --> 21:01.720
over time.

21:01.720 --> 21:07.160
But what I'm really impressed by is if you get out of your head as a long time Linux

21:07.160 --> 21:11.720
user, and you look at this as somebody who's just trying to get some damn work done, they

21:11.720 --> 21:16.640
have really nice things in there like a USB image writer is installed by default, an application

21:16.640 --> 21:19.560
called backup is installed by default, and it's a decent little app.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.440
We've talked about time shift before.

21:21.440 --> 21:27.120
They have just system diagnostic and information, you just click that, it's in there, it's obvious,

21:27.120 --> 21:30.800
and they've managed to keep it uncluttered, which is impressive because you could see

21:30.800 --> 21:34.440
adding all these little tools and these X apps over time would really clutter things

21:34.440 --> 21:35.440
up.

21:35.440 --> 21:39.680
They managed to keep it pretty clean and kind of decide when to pull things out as well.

21:39.680 --> 21:43.080
So because they've done this iterative work, and they've been evolving all of this stuff

21:43.080 --> 21:47.560
for a while, and they've been able to keep up in this release with some of the more recentish

21:47.560 --> 21:48.560
GTK trends.

21:48.560 --> 21:53.720
I mean, of course now GNOME 42 is out, and Libidwadi is now a thing, and they're nowhere

21:53.720 --> 21:54.720
near that.

21:54.720 --> 21:55.720
But...

21:55.720 --> 21:56.720
You're right.

21:56.720 --> 22:00.200
I mean, in the longer view sense, it was nice to see the dark style support and some

22:00.200 --> 22:02.800
added accent colors and stuff.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.680
None of that was there the last time I tried Cinnamon.

22:04.680 --> 22:05.680
Right, yeah.

22:05.680 --> 22:06.680
And it's just all...

22:06.680 --> 22:10.920
I could go over to the advanced side and turn on experimental fractional scaling.

22:10.920 --> 22:11.920
Oh, right.

22:11.920 --> 22:17.440
And I think I'm running to 140 or some weird number, but it actually looks fine.

22:17.440 --> 22:18.440
It doesn't look blurry.

22:18.440 --> 22:25.020
They did a good job, and that kind of day-to-day steak and potatoes thing somebody needs from

22:25.020 --> 22:29.840
a desktop computer like it used to always be, it really kind of feels like they're nailing

22:29.840 --> 22:35.920
all that stuff while not getting sucked into the technology stack of the week kind of situation.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.380
I'm curious on your thoughts, though.

22:37.380 --> 22:38.560
I think I agree.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.440
There's a lot of elements that stand out as being thoughtfully looked after.

22:41.440 --> 22:45.600
And then there are some holes where they're just missing pieces.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.200
I liked a lot of the welcome experience.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.800
It detected and asked about, did I need to improve my video driver situation, which I

22:51.800 --> 22:52.800
thought was pretty nice.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.320
And there's just a few things kind of like prompting you to set things up.

22:55.320 --> 22:59.800
Although once you start diving into, say, snapshots or the firewall, you do kind of

22:59.800 --> 23:01.660
run out of rope on having your hand held.

23:01.660 --> 23:04.500
So I think some of this stuff is maybe more easy in the welcome screen for someone who's

23:04.500 --> 23:07.720
really just switching from Windows, and then it gets advanced kind of quickly.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.040
But I can't fault them for that.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.920
Those are just complicated topics.

23:10.920 --> 23:14.600
In the past, you know, I did use Cinnamon a lot on a work machine that I had to do a

23:14.600 --> 23:15.760
boot with Windows.

23:15.760 --> 23:19.320
And so that kind of, you know, the interface style matched up pretty well, and it wasn't

23:19.320 --> 23:20.320
a machine I customized.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.320
I was just curious to revisit.

23:21.320 --> 23:23.720
Could I just could I use it as a boring old workstation?

23:23.720 --> 23:25.880
And yeah, I think it still works pretty nicely for that.

23:25.880 --> 23:30.880
It's somewhere in between, you know, maybe the pure simplicity of a GNOME experience.

23:30.880 --> 23:34.660
You get some of the plasma things, but without having as much customization to maybe need

23:34.660 --> 23:39.080
or be tempted to do, because that's exactly where I think I would still deploy Cinnamon

23:39.080 --> 23:40.080
is.

23:40.080 --> 23:43.380
In an environment where I just want to forget about the DE, you know, it's not ugly enough

23:43.380 --> 23:44.380
to be offensive.

23:44.380 --> 23:46.200
I can just forget about it.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.400
Gets out of your way, but does have some power features when you want it.

23:49.400 --> 23:53.780
It is interesting also, we mentioned sort of catching up in the, you know, the GTK world,

23:53.780 --> 23:58.080
but catching up on the Ubuntu derivative world, when I was going through the, you know, the

23:58.080 --> 24:00.840
boring old installer, I don't mean that in a bad way, but just the boring old installer

24:00.840 --> 24:01.840
still knows EFS.

24:01.840 --> 24:06.080
You know, you just get ext4 if you don't go with LVM, right?

24:06.080 --> 24:09.720
Maybe wonder what's gonna happen with that flutter transition?

24:09.720 --> 24:10.920
Is Mint keeping the sold version?

24:10.920 --> 24:13.360
Are they gonna adopt where Canonical goes?

24:13.360 --> 24:15.040
I bet they don't.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.040
I bet they don't.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.040
Yeah.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.040
Good question.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.040
I wonder.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.040
I mean, I'm kind of tired of that installer.

24:20.040 --> 24:24.640
I mean, it sure does work, but I feel like I've been using it for about 10 years.

24:24.640 --> 24:25.640
I don't know.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.200
But I guess it gets the job done, right?

24:27.200 --> 24:31.820
It'd be nice to see some like advanced options around ZFS or ButterFest, but I get that's

24:31.820 --> 24:32.820
not their demo.

24:32.820 --> 24:34.640
And I gotta take that into consideration.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.720
So here's where we're going with this.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.840
Even with all of this said, you know, it's the steak and potatoes.

24:39.840 --> 24:44.680
It is the, what is on the label is what you get Linux distribution.

24:44.680 --> 24:48.020
It's a great landing spot for Windows users.

24:48.020 --> 24:51.900
And I think that makes sense for a lot of us, but there's still an element that's missing

24:51.900 --> 24:56.360
that seems to be drawing users away from Mint at a rapid pace.

24:56.360 --> 25:01.140
So much so that they seem to be attempting to address this over the last year or so.

25:01.140 --> 25:05.620
And I wasn't familiar with this until I went digging around, but I've discovered that Mint

25:05.620 --> 25:07.700
is now publishing Edge ISOs.

25:07.700 --> 25:08.700
Have you seen this?

25:08.700 --> 25:09.700
Yeah.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.080
They've done it for the last couple of releases.

25:12.080 --> 25:18.840
And it is simply a version of Linux Mint with newer kernel drivers, a newer kernel.

25:18.840 --> 25:27.440
Like right now they are shipping 5.4 in Mint, but in the Edge version they're shipping 5.13,

25:27.440 --> 25:30.720
which has a bunch of nice improvements in there.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.680
And we talked a little bit about this on Linux Action News.

25:33.680 --> 25:39.960
So for an expanded look on this, it's worth listening to that, but boilingsteam.com ran

25:39.960 --> 25:43.280
a post and the headline is this.

25:43.280 --> 25:48.960
All roads lead to Arch, the evolution of Linux distros used for gaming over time.

25:48.960 --> 25:55.860
And you look at the data from ProtonDB and from Steam, and it seems kind of obvious.

25:55.860 --> 26:04.560
Linux users are migrating over time in considerable numbers away from Ubuntu and Debian and Mint.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.560
Those are taking it the hardest.

26:06.560 --> 26:12.440
And they're moving over to Arch Linux, Manjaro, Garuda Linux, and Endeavor OS.

26:12.440 --> 26:17.480
Boilingsteam writes, Arch has gained progressively, some share solidly now at 20% for several

26:17.480 --> 26:21.160
months, but the whole landscape looks a lot like Arch derivatives now.

26:21.160 --> 26:27.000
Manjaro is almost as big as Arch itself, and Garuda Linux and Endeavor OS are 6 to 7% of

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
the mix.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.400
In effect, almost half of the gamers on ProtonDB are running some form of Arch.

26:34.400 --> 26:38.400
And when you look at the data trend, which they visualized here, we'll have a link in

26:38.400 --> 26:46.360
the show notes over the years, you just see a steady progression of Arch over and over.

26:46.360 --> 26:52.880
And it isn't really even kind of like a, it's not like a huge jump, it's just this slow

26:52.880 --> 26:58.680
and steady, it does seem to speed up as we get closer to now.

26:58.680 --> 26:59.680
What do you think this is?

26:59.680 --> 27:01.800
Do you think it's the Arch user repository, Wes?

27:01.800 --> 27:06.280
There's probably a lot of things, you know, we've kind of mentioned maybe the, what could

27:06.280 --> 27:10.400
be perceived as a lack of investment or excitement around the Ubuntu desktop.

27:10.400 --> 27:14.280
There's probably also an element of some of these Arch derivatives being more explicit

27:14.280 --> 27:17.940
about marketing to gamers and having a lot of improved experience around just getting

27:17.940 --> 27:20.400
up and going and having a system that's like ready to game.

27:20.400 --> 27:24.640
So there's probably a few factors maybe combining, and Arch is just fun.

27:24.640 --> 27:25.640
Yeah, I think you're right.

27:25.640 --> 27:32.400
And I think that one of those factors, which is what Linux Mint recognized is newer kernels

27:32.400 --> 27:36.720
because people want newer drivers and they want newer drivers because they're switching

27:36.720 --> 27:41.360
over to Linux to try it for gaming and they want the best frame rate, the best performance,

27:41.360 --> 27:44.640
the best hardware support possible.

27:44.640 --> 27:49.640
And while I was on Mint, I tried out the tool called Mainline.

27:49.640 --> 27:54.920
So there used to be this Ubuntu kernel picker that would use the canonical PPA and install

27:54.920 --> 27:59.240
a mainline kernel, but that developer quit work on the project, I guess.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.820
But there's Mainline now.

28:00.820 --> 28:04.800
It's a command line app that you install and it makes it really simple to list all of the

28:04.800 --> 28:06.800
available kernels for your system.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.040
And then you can just do like a mainline install latest.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.040
Oh, cute.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.560
Like a little kernel manager right there for you.

28:11.560 --> 28:12.560
Exactly.

28:12.560 --> 28:16.200
And it takes care of getting the right headers and the build files and doing all the boot

28:16.200 --> 28:19.460
manager stuff and it all makes sure it gets pulled down from canonicals PPA.

28:19.460 --> 28:20.940
So it's a legit source.

28:20.940 --> 28:23.780
And so last night on my Mint box, and you could do this, you wouldn't have to get the

28:23.780 --> 28:25.840
edge ice or you could do this on Ubuntu.

28:25.840 --> 28:28.720
I installed kernel 516 using this tool.

28:28.720 --> 28:29.720
Oh, look at you.

28:29.720 --> 28:32.720
But hey, I mean, there's some stuff in Proton, you know, for Proton in there.

28:32.720 --> 28:33.720
So why not?

28:33.720 --> 28:34.720
You get the few tech stuff.

28:34.720 --> 28:40.680
And here's the reality now is you get this really nice, tried and true, slowly iterated

28:40.680 --> 28:46.480
Cinnamon Mint desktop that isn't going to change on end users very much.

28:46.480 --> 28:49.480
And with this kind of tool, or you could do it yourself, you could get the latest kernel

28:49.480 --> 28:51.600
and you get a lot of benefits that way.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.120
And I think users are just opting to go with distributions that do it for themselves.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.520
And I think even canonical sees this.

28:56.520 --> 29:01.100
They see what's going on with these trends because they're hiring a Linux desktop gaming

29:01.100 --> 29:02.900
product manager right now.

29:02.900 --> 29:07.300
And canonical wants to, quote, make Ubuntu the best Linux desktop for gaming.

29:07.300 --> 29:11.060
And they want to, quote, work with partners in the Silicon world to ensure the latest

29:11.060 --> 29:15.000
graphics drivers and tweaks are built in for optimal frame rates and latency.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.720
Well, how do you do that?

29:16.720 --> 29:19.660
You got to get their code upstream in the Linux kernel.

29:19.660 --> 29:22.600
So that means you have to ship a new kernel, right?

29:22.600 --> 29:27.140
That's what the deck has to solve that you can have all this code going to Linux kernel.

29:27.140 --> 29:30.480
But if you're shipping five dot four, it doesn't matter.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.840
It's all it's not in a kernel that you're shipping anymore.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.920
So canonical can't solve this problem.

29:34.920 --> 29:39.240
They can't work with this is from their job post, quote, work with partners in the Silicon

29:39.240 --> 29:42.600
world to ensure the latest graphics drivers and tweaks are built in.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.480
They can't do that.

29:44.480 --> 29:49.040
And they also say they want to work with mechanisms such as anti-cheat capabilities and make sure

29:49.040 --> 29:53.320
that they are available to ensure fairness and product availability for Ubuntu users.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.480
They're not going to do that again unless they work with an upstream kernel because

29:56.480 --> 29:59.000
some of that stuff is landing in the kernel, thanks to Collabra.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.880
I mean, I suppose you do have what you have hardware enablement, you got PPAs, but does

30:02.880 --> 30:07.800
that just not have a different lack of appeal to feel more of a as an afterthought?

30:07.800 --> 30:12.040
Well, I think if you look at why people are deploying Manjaro or Garuda, it's because

30:12.040 --> 30:13.680
it's just the default.

30:13.680 --> 30:14.920
It's defaults rule supreme.

30:14.920 --> 30:15.920
You got that.

30:15.920 --> 30:18.180
Plus, then you got, well, they're not testing against it, right?

30:18.180 --> 30:21.880
Like the idea is these other distros are building their distro with the idea that you're going

30:21.880 --> 30:26.620
to have the latest kernel like Fedora, but, you know, the Ubuntu developers aren't.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.160
They're assuming you're using the kernel they're shipping.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.080
I would imagine that probably factors into some people's thinking.

30:31.080 --> 30:36.520
But you know, it kind of makes it more appealing to me to use an Ubuntu or a Mint with a newer

30:36.520 --> 30:37.520
kernel.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.240
There must be a downside, though.

30:39.240 --> 30:45.200
So if somebody knows linuxunplug.com slash contact, I assume stuff breaks at some point.

30:45.200 --> 30:50.480
You know, like I could see maybe virtualization or container software thinking you have the

30:50.480 --> 30:51.480
wrong version of the kernel.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.260
I think you just have to try it and find out.

30:53.260 --> 30:59.000
So I'd like to know what you think of our growing hypothesis here that it's perhaps

30:59.000 --> 31:00.640
gaming that's driving this change.

31:00.640 --> 31:08.400
Like it is so common now for people to start recommending things like Pop or Manjaro, especially

31:08.400 --> 31:09.840
in the YouTube community.

31:09.840 --> 31:13.120
Like we just saw that with the recent Linux challenge.

31:13.120 --> 31:17.360
People just a couple of years ago led with Ubuntu.

31:17.360 --> 31:21.560
Like do you remember however many years ago when Noah and I did the Linux switch challenge?

31:21.560 --> 31:22.560
How long ago was that?

31:22.560 --> 31:23.560
Was that 2016?

31:23.560 --> 31:24.560
Maybe.

31:24.560 --> 31:28.440
I mean, it was just it was never a debated topic.

31:28.440 --> 31:32.960
The USB thumb drives that we were handing out had Ubuntu on them.

31:32.960 --> 31:33.960
It wasn't even a debate.

31:33.960 --> 31:37.400
And it made the most sense because it had the largest network effect.

31:37.400 --> 31:41.600
And I still think it makes probably the best new user distro when you consider that.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.520
Because when you are on Windows, you have the whole world of software and everyone else

31:45.520 --> 31:46.720
is using what you're using.

31:46.720 --> 31:51.360
So there's tons of guides and information, but when you switch to Linux, it's a smaller

31:51.360 --> 31:52.360
circle.

31:52.360 --> 31:53.360
Yeah.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.360
And you haven't learned the right terms to Google yet.

31:54.360 --> 31:58.000
So you got to hope that, you know, the generic results match and that's Ubuntu.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.960
And Ubuntu is the biggest supported one out there.

32:00.960 --> 32:05.240
And so I still actually think if new users are going to use Linux, I mean, you know,

32:05.240 --> 32:08.140
Pop and Manjaro get really close because they're the same structure and all of that.

32:08.140 --> 32:14.200
But it is interesting how, you know, for the existing Linux user anyway, like, I guess

32:14.200 --> 32:18.700
I have to admit that as gaming has so rapidly improved, again, we still have a long way

32:18.700 --> 32:19.700
to go, of course.

32:19.700 --> 32:24.800
But now that gaming is so viable, I suppose I might consider thinking about that more

32:24.800 --> 32:25.800
for my desktop install.

32:25.800 --> 32:29.160
Where in the past, you know what I mean, like I might have a dedicated system or I might

32:29.160 --> 32:31.940
just not care about that so much because I would just do casual gaming.

32:31.940 --> 32:36.520
But if it's really easy to do some pretty good gaming, then yeah, right.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.200
Maybe suddenly that's something you're interested in changing.

32:38.200 --> 32:41.040
Well, you and I have been following the kernel development pretty closely for the last year

32:41.040 --> 32:42.040
and a half.

32:42.040 --> 32:46.600
And the thing is, there's a lot of cool performance improvements landing on Linux kernel right

32:46.600 --> 32:47.600
now.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.480
There's been some recent major performance work gone into there.

32:50.480 --> 32:55.160
We cover that stuff in LAN and it makes me so stoked to run a newer kernel.

32:55.160 --> 32:56.160
I want that.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.160
There's a lot of things.

32:57.160 --> 32:58.160
Totally is.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.160
Totally is.

32:59.160 --> 33:00.160
All right.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.440
We can cover, we can follow this up in the post show.

33:01.440 --> 33:05.000
So if you got comments, save it for that or go to linuxunplug.com slash contact and

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
let us know.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
You think we're crazy.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
You think we're onto something here.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.520
I'd like to hear your opinion on it.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.660
We do have a spot of housekeeping around here.

33:13.660 --> 33:17.800
I want to say, first of all, thank you so much to our members, UnpluggedCore.com or

33:17.800 --> 33:21.360
our network supporters at Jupiter.party.

33:21.360 --> 33:24.120
You get access to the full live stream, like everything.

33:24.120 --> 33:30.460
It's a whole other show in there, plus no like cutting stuff out, no swearing.

33:30.460 --> 33:32.300
It's like raw, man.

33:32.300 --> 33:35.840
Probably shouldn't put it out there, but we do and we make it available for you in a feed.

33:35.840 --> 33:39.600
But if you're, and if you're a network member, you get access to all of the shows ad free

33:39.600 --> 33:40.600
out there.

33:40.600 --> 33:44.560
Also, I want to say thank you to the people who've been using the new value for value

33:44.560 --> 33:47.600
payments in their podcast app via lightning.

33:47.600 --> 33:53.280
We got helipads set up this week and now we can read messages as they boost in real time.

33:53.280 --> 33:54.280
It's so cool.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.920
And it makes a little pew pew sound when people boost.

33:55.920 --> 34:01.160
So if you have no idea what I'm talking about, you can go to newpodcastapps.com and go get

34:01.160 --> 34:02.160
yourself a new podcast app.

34:02.160 --> 34:07.960
But it looks like the most popular one amongst our audience is the fountain podcast app.

34:07.960 --> 34:09.440
Yeah, I'm trying to myself.

34:09.440 --> 34:10.920
And it is a pretty interesting app.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.280
And what's neat about it is they have this little boost mode.

34:13.280 --> 34:18.320
You hit that and you can leave a message and it tells us what episode you're listening

34:18.320 --> 34:21.320
to, which is that's a bit of data we've never gotten before.

34:21.320 --> 34:22.320
Yeah.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.320
Less people self report, right?

34:23.320 --> 34:24.320
But yeah.

34:24.320 --> 34:25.320
Yeah.

34:25.320 --> 34:26.320
Oh my God.

34:26.320 --> 34:27.320
That's so cool.

34:27.320 --> 34:30.480
Like it was like all of a sudden we were sitting there and we were working really late.

34:30.480 --> 34:33.800
It was like eight or nine o'clock on a Sunday.

34:33.800 --> 34:38.600
And we had we pulled this thing up and right then somebody sent in a boost.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.240
And it was like all of our moods.

34:40.240 --> 34:42.000
I called Brenton from the garage.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
He was working.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
He was working on the rack.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.320
I called Brenton.

34:45.320 --> 34:48.640
We all like looked at the boost because the first time we brought a helipad and it changed

34:48.640 --> 34:49.640
our night.

34:49.640 --> 34:51.920
You know, it's not like it's like it's not a bunch of money, right?

34:51.920 --> 34:53.560
They're just a few sats.

34:53.560 --> 34:56.800
But it's so cool to see those messages coming in real time as people are listening.

34:56.800 --> 34:57.800
Yeah.

34:57.800 --> 34:58.800
And some of you are so sweet.

34:58.800 --> 35:01.240
Yeah, there was some really nice messages in there, too.

35:01.240 --> 35:02.400
And helipad lets us read them.

35:02.400 --> 35:03.400
So that's pretty neat.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.160
I think we'll do that on future live streams.

35:05.160 --> 35:07.560
Our community on Matrix has grown like crazy.

35:07.560 --> 35:11.720
Linux Unplugged dot com slash Matrix, if you want to join that, we'd love to have you join

35:11.720 --> 35:12.720
us over there.

35:12.720 --> 35:13.720
And we have several rooms.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.540
We have rooms for each of the show.

35:15.540 --> 35:21.520
We have a crypto chat where people are having rational, level headed, honest conversations

35:21.520 --> 35:24.440
about crypto currencies, even during a crash.

35:24.440 --> 35:26.920
And all that's going down at Linux Unplugged dot com slash Matrix.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.480
And you can join us over there.

35:29.480 --> 35:32.920
And I suppose I'll plug the fact that we'd love to have you join our Mumble room because

35:32.920 --> 35:34.000
we got the Luplug.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.480
We've got this year's show that we do live.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.120
We do other events in Mumble.

35:37.120 --> 35:40.460
Details Linux Unplugged dot com slash Mumble.

35:40.460 --> 35:42.440
And you can hang out with us on Tuesdays.

35:42.440 --> 35:44.880
We've been doing a little live stream here and there.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.640
And every now and then we put them out as an extra, too.

35:46.640 --> 35:49.280
Hey, it's just a, you know, a friendly community of nerdy people.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.280
That's right.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.920
What's not to like?

35:52.920 --> 35:56.760
So the air the airline lost Brent's mailbag.

35:56.760 --> 35:57.760
You hear about this?

35:57.760 --> 35:58.760
No.

35:58.760 --> 35:59.760
Yeah.

35:59.760 --> 36:00.760
Those airlines, you just can't trust them.

36:00.760 --> 36:04.360
Yeah, I guess I still don't really understand why you're putting all of the feedback out

36:04.360 --> 36:07.120
on that thermal printer and carrying it around with you.

36:07.120 --> 36:10.360
We could just save it on security, security, Chris.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.360
Maybe.

36:11.360 --> 36:12.360
OK, I guess.

36:12.360 --> 36:13.960
Just doesn't seem like a good way to do it, Brent.

36:13.960 --> 36:17.360
You know, I will say I had to start my fire with something and I ran out of fire starters

36:17.360 --> 36:23.040
and you know, just saying.

36:23.040 --> 36:25.440
We do have a pick for you this week, though.

36:25.440 --> 36:26.440
This is so cool.

36:26.440 --> 36:30.840
Like if it was just one of these, it'd be worth it for the pick segment.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.760
But this is a suite of tools called SSH tools.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.000
Yeah, you heard me.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
That's right.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.880
And the first one alone, I feel like, is completely pick worthy.

36:38.880 --> 36:44.680
It's called SSH ping and it checks to see if a host is reachable via SSH.

36:44.680 --> 36:45.680
Like are your log in failing?

36:45.680 --> 36:50.200
Is there is it, you know, denying you and is the syntax is exactly what you'd expect.

36:50.200 --> 36:56.520
So SSH ping, then the number of times, so like dash three for three pings and then the

36:56.520 --> 36:57.520
host.

36:57.520 --> 37:01.320
And then it checks to see if it can get connected on that port and it tells you like the same

37:01.320 --> 37:02.840
kind of output you get from ping.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.360
Yeah, it looks just the same.

37:04.360 --> 37:07.280
And over here, my terminal, it's got some nice colors, too.

37:07.280 --> 37:08.280
So that's handy.

37:08.280 --> 37:09.280
Oh, really?

37:09.280 --> 37:10.280
Yeah.

37:10.280 --> 37:11.280
A few other nice tools, though.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.280
Like I'm just I'm like an SSH fax.

37:13.280 --> 37:14.280
Yes.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.640
And that's just, you know, what's what's the deal with this machine print out a handy little

37:16.640 --> 37:20.720
print out about what the service running, disks available, memory, that kind of thing.

37:20.720 --> 37:23.080
That is my that is my other favorite one.

37:23.080 --> 37:28.200
It's also just a great way to figure out what your machines are advertising via SSH.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.200
So that one is really cool.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.440
So that one's called SSH dash fax.

37:31.440 --> 37:35.760
And then, of course, there's also SSH host keys, which prints the server host keys in

37:35.760 --> 37:38.120
a couple of different ways to read that.

37:38.120 --> 37:43.960
You got SSH key info in here, a bunch of other ones, including SSH force, which enforces

37:43.960 --> 37:47.000
password authentication, even if they do have a key.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
I mean, all that stuff.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
It's really neat.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.520
And they have packages for a bunch of different distros, including 2204 and a bunch of other

37:54.520 --> 37:55.520
systems.

37:55.520 --> 37:56.520
So we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.040
Also, it's just bash so you can download it from GitHub if that's your style.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.040
Oh, look at you.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.040
Is that what you did?

38:01.040 --> 38:02.040
I assume.

38:02.040 --> 38:03.040
Indeed.

38:03.040 --> 38:04.040
That sounds like US pain.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.240
You maniac.

38:05.240 --> 38:09.160
I have no idea what we're going to talk about next week because I haven't been able to square

38:09.160 --> 38:16.320
like how are we going to do a meetup and an episode like, right.

38:16.320 --> 38:19.640
So we're going to figure that out.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.120
I don't know exactly because I think so.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.520
I think we're going to homework now.

38:22.520 --> 38:23.520
Yeah.

38:23.520 --> 38:24.520
So that's going to be our that's going to be our job.

38:24.520 --> 38:27.880
But if you can make it, we'd love to see you come hang out with maybe bring a topic as

38:27.880 --> 38:30.880
well as a snack.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.640
That would be pretty great.

38:32.640 --> 38:35.200
But I know it's such a it's such a long shot for people to make it.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.780
But honestly, we just really want to see people.

38:36.780 --> 38:38.080
It's been a while.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.920
That's how long I can make it between road trips and meetups and stuff.

38:40.920 --> 38:41.920
I've made my.

38:41.920 --> 38:42.920
The audience is amazing.

38:42.920 --> 38:43.920
And we miss you.

38:43.920 --> 38:44.920
That's true.

38:44.920 --> 38:45.920
That's true.

38:45.920 --> 38:46.920
All right.

38:46.920 --> 38:47.920
And we'd love to hear more from you to Linux.

38:47.920 --> 38:48.920
Unplugged dot com slash contact.

38:48.920 --> 38:49.920
We'll probably have your feedback next week.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.440
You can also join us live.

38:51.440 --> 38:53.040
We do this now on Sundays.

38:53.040 --> 38:55.120
You start around noon Pacific.

38:55.120 --> 38:56.120
See you next week.

38:56.120 --> 38:59.160
Same bad time, same bad station.

38:59.160 --> 39:03.400
And be sure to catch Linux action news to find out everything that's going on now.

39:03.400 --> 39:07.960
It's released on Thursdays and we're capturing what's going on right there in the week.

39:07.960 --> 39:08.960
I'm liking it.

39:08.960 --> 39:12.080
Turns out we really nailed the kind of timing as far as the news cycle goes.

39:12.080 --> 39:13.080
It's been nice.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.800
And we'd love to have you join us.

39:14.800 --> 39:15.800
Linux action news dot com.

39:15.800 --> 39:18.880
We put it out every single week.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.160
Links to what we talked about today at Linux unplugged dot com.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.160
What else, Wes?

39:22.160 --> 39:23.160
What else do we got to mention?

39:23.160 --> 39:24.160
Hmm.

39:24.160 --> 39:25.160
Live.

39:25.160 --> 39:26.160
Did that.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.160
Did that.

39:27.160 --> 39:30.160
If it's been a while since you checked out the extras feed, now's the time to catch up.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.160
No kidding.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.160
That is.

39:32.160 --> 39:33.520
See, the man knows.

39:33.520 --> 39:34.520
Extras dot show for that.

39:34.520 --> 39:37.880
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode and we'll see you right back here

39:37.880 --> 39:38.400
next Sunday.

40:07.880 --> 40:21.520
Hey, Brent, could you step over a little closer here?

40:21.520 --> 40:22.520
We need to.

40:22.520 --> 40:23.520
Yeah, I got to get in the cone.

40:23.520 --> 40:29.600
The cone of silence.

40:29.600 --> 40:33.560
We got a we got a major problem, guys.

40:33.560 --> 40:34.560
Major problem.

40:34.560 --> 40:35.560
I didn't want the audience to hear this.

40:35.560 --> 40:36.560
There's a leak is there?

40:36.560 --> 40:37.560
No, no.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.160
That would be a big problem.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.600
But I don't I don't I don't want to tell the audience this, but I don't think the Sunday

40:42.600 --> 40:46.200
crew is as good at making the titles like the Tuesday crew was.

40:46.200 --> 40:47.200
I don't want to throw shade.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.000
I know how they're going to take that.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.240
So I don't know what we should.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.760
We got to come up with a way to inspire them.

40:51.760 --> 40:53.480
Some sort of title contest.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.520
I mean, this title is.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.520
Are you seeing this?

40:56.520 --> 40:57.520
Yeah.

40:57.520 --> 40:58.520
Anyways, we got a post show to do.

40:58.520 --> 41:15.840
The cone of silence.
