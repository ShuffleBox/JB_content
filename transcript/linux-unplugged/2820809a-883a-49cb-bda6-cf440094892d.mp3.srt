1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
NASA has announced they are mapping out plans for bigger, stronger, more capable Linux copters

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,800
for future trips into space.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,000
One concept is the Mars Science Helicopter, advocated as a way to greatly expand the exploration

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,520
zone on the Red Planet, including possibly deep dives into some caves.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,040
This is so great, and I think it clearly means Linux on Mars was a success, and I think that

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,320
also means that obviously Linux is going to take over the solar system.

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:51,460
Hello friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

8
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,460
My name is Chris.

9
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,460
My name is Wes.

10
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,200
Hello Wes, are you applying for those Mars sysadmin jobs right now?

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Yeah, we'll see.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,360
Working on the old resume anyway.

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,120
I mean, that's either the ultimate work from home job or the ultimate work on location

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,120
job.

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,120
I'm not sure.

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,320
This episode is brought to you by the all new iCloud Guru, the leader in learning for

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,320
the cloud, Linux, and other modern tech skills.

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,400
They have hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs, so go get certified.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
Get hired.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,440
Get learning at iCloudGuru.com.

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:24,160
All right, well, so coming up on 4.14, we've got a lot.

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,240
First of all, we've been building a new server, something that we're putting together for

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,740
the road trip.

24
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,520
It's a tracker.

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,720
We've wanted to do this for a while, and we've done it with some commercial software in the

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,840
past.

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,360
This time we wanted to build it with all free software, a safe and secure open source self-tracking

28
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,680
tool that you could use for yourself and your family and your friends, or we're going to

29
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,440
use so you can find us on our JB reunion road trip.

30
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,360
It has lots of features, including social groups and stuff like that, but we're using

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,760
own tracks to do something a little specific to build something and we'll tell you about

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,200
what we're creating and how we deployed it all and why we think that own tracks is a

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,280
safe and secure way to track your location and control your data if you would like.

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,120
On top of that, an old friend joins us on the show today to chat about how we handle

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,880
things in the Linux news when they get a little awkward.

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
Welcome back to the show, Michael.

37
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
Thanks for having me.

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,240
It's been a while.

39
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
It has.

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,760
It's been like years, so we're glad to have you here because in the last couple of weeks

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,640
there's been some weird things in the news, and we thought maybe we'd go a little meta

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,560
this week and talk about why we cover it and how we cover it.

43
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
Oh yeah.

44
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
I'm so excited about that.

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a little dicey this week.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,640
Past couple of weeks, really, if you think about it, because there's been a couple of

47
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,720
these in a row, so it seems to actually have cranked up quite recently in the past year

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,880
where we know we had, there's times we have downtime of drama for a year, none at all,

49
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,520
and then all of a sudden now it doesn't seem like it's stopping.

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
Ebs and flows.

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,880
It just comes, it comes in these big waves of it, so we're going to dig into that today,

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,400
but before we do that, I want to bring in our virtual lug to help us go through all

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
of this.

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,600
Let's give a very greetings virtual lug.

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Hello everybody.

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,760
Good to have you in there today, Neil.

57
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,360
In honor of our conversation in the post show, which is the post show for the members, I

58
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,920
am installing Fedora rawhide KDE spin live during the show today.

59
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,880
I don't know how to respond to this, Chris, except for what, you know, I had deep in on

60
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,680
here and I have some follow up thoughts on deep in that I want to share in the feedback

61
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,520
and I recently had Windows 11 on this laptop.

62
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,440
I just feel like this laptop needs a real good purge, needs a clean slate, and so I'm

63
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,560
going KDE spin Fedora rawhide on this ThinkPad X1.

64
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,760
I'm going to see how it does.

65
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,360
And you've got Neil signed up as your personal assistant.

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Should anything go wrong?

67
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,440
Well, last week he told me it's going to be perfect and flawless, so I'm assuming that's

68
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
not what I said.

69
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
I'm pretty sure.

70
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Yeah, I'm pretty sure those are what you said.

71
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,780
So by the end of the episode, I should find out who we, the install, I just kicked off

72
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,780
the installation.

73
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,720
It's at 18 percent right now.

74
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,820
Also just because I apparently like the chaos, I'm running on battery too, because everybody

75
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,820
knows.

76
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,560
Yeah, everybody knows when you install your OS, you want to run on battery.

77
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,920
That's what they tell you right at the start of the installation, right?

78
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
What could go wrong?

79
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,280
Chris, you just invited everything to go wrong.

80
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,280
Yeah, I know.

81
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
I know.

82
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,480
I got good news.

83
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,340
We've been chatting with friends in the Denver area and we're locking in what could potentially

84
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:33,360
be a very awesome meetup location in Denver, which I will update our meetup page when we

85
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,600
have all of the details locked in.

86
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,400
So if you haven't signed up yet, we have two meetups that are scheduled.

87
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,000
And then the idea is with this tracker that we're building, you can watch where LadyJupes

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,040
is going.

89
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,400
And if we're in your area, you can reach out to me on Telegram and maybe we can just meet

90
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,560
up impromptu, just do a little mini meetup, but we'll get into that.

91
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,760
It's all coming together this week.

92
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,180
I'm really excited.

93
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:02,000
It's all finally coming together and the technology to make it possible is all running on Linux

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,040
and we'll tell you about that.

95
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,840
But let's talk about this situation with the news.

96
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,960
It really came up when the hoopla around Audacity broke out into the public starting back around

97
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:19,120
in May when the Muse group awkwardly announced that they had acquired Audacity as you can

98
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,800
in the open source world by essentially acquiring the IP rights and the copyright and paying

99
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,680
off the developers.

100
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:33,400
That had snowballed into a series of miscommunications and mishandling with Audacity's most passionate

101
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,240
community over issues like the privacy policy, their CLA, their contributor agreement and

102
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,160
other things around metric tracking that always strike a chord with people.

103
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,880
They all came up relatively quickly when you consider that this all just kind of went down

104
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,760
two months ago and these things have been revealed since then.

105
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,480
And it can be awkward for us to cover some of these stories because there's a lot of

106
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,680
drama that gets spun up in all of this, especially when you have Forks that launch and then 4chan

107
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,800
gets involved and starts trolling people.

108
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,840
But then not long before that, there was the Freenode situation which was immensely complex

109
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,080
and an important story with nuggets of information at the core of it that you need to know but

110
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,960
just draped in drama, completely wrapped in drama.

111
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,840
And so we thought this week maybe we'd have a little meta-conversation with you the listener

112
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,040
about how we view these types of stories, how and why we cover them and maybe a little

113
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,160
bit of the logic behind what we hope to get conveyed to our audience when we actually

114
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,760
kind of go into these stories that seem, at least on the surface, like they're loaded

115
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,100
with a lot of personal feuding.

116
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,880
And so that's why it was great to have Michael join us because those of you who used to listen

117
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,560
to the show, you know Michael's been on the show before, but Michael also runs his own

118
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,920
new weekly news podcast this week in Linux and of course is a co-host on the Destination

119
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,540
Linux podcast and has been following these stories and he's had to consider how he wants

120
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,880
to present this information to his audience and he's had to go through is this a story

121
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,640
worth covering and make that call and make that decision and I'm sure there's been times

122
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,340
Michael where you're like I'd just rather not talk about any of this because it's just

123
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,400
so dramatic.

124
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
There have been.

125
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,040
There's sometimes over the years that these things have come out, there have been a couple

126
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,520
times where I see how important is this to cover and if it is not important, if it's

127
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,940
just drama that is for the sake of drama, well then I do my best to not talk about it.

128
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,280
But if there's cases like the Freenode thing or the Audacity thing, you kind of have to

129
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,920
consider the fact that there's no way you can't talk about it.

130
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:39,660
So how do you handle that sort of topic becomes the issue on those weeks and the Audacity

131
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:47,080
one is a really interesting one in this space because there's some validity to both sides

132
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,400
and both arguments and you kind of need to balance how you present both sides without

133
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,480
trying to – and also I give my opinion as well, so I don't – I want to make sure

134
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,260
that my coverage is as balanced as possible while also providing my opinion and trying

135
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:13,920
to express the overall encapsulation of the topic without doing it overboard.

136
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,760
And this particular Audacity topic, I've covered it a couple of times on my show and

137
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,560
this past episode when I said I wanted to do it in a very concise way and try to cover

138
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,260
all the bases as quickly as possible and that turned out to be 20 minutes.

139
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,200
So that didn't really happen.

140
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,120
You know what else I was thinking about while you were saying that that's gotten trickier

141
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,940
in the last few years.

142
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:43,480
More social angles and social issues are working their way into free software news stories

143
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,180
like I think of Linus or RMS.

144
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,020
These are stories that have like a technical angle to them but they also have a social

145
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,020
angle to them and that is not exactly why we got into tech in the first place to cover

146
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,020
social stuff.

147
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,020
Right.

148
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,020
That's a good point.

149
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,660
I think that we wanted to talk about the technology and the innovations that are happening and

150
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,500
that happens a lot and it's really fun to talk about these things and also try to find

151
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,160
new and exciting things that you might not have heard as an audience and present that

152
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
to them.

153
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,600
So trying to follow all of these things but there are times where the social aspect comes

154
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,660
in and you kind of have to deal with it and sometimes I've dealt with it well, sometimes

155
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,660
maybe not so much.

156
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,820
I guess it depends.

157
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,860
It does add an aspect that you have to dig through like something that Wes and I will

158
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:39,460
find that we're doing a lot for Linux action news is just trying to read through threads

159
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,340
of people going back and forth that are having a conversation.

160
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,800
Somebody is yelling at somebody.

161
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,500
The University of Minnesota kernel patch hole, you know, kerfuffle is a great example of

162
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,540
going back and forth, mailing list and trying to build out a timeline of what's going on.

163
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,740
Well, and you know, some of these facts you're getting or maybe facts with quotes around

164
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,140
them, you know, they're coming from individual players who have their own agendas in whatever

165
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,260
story you're trying to cover.

166
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,780
And so you've got to kind of build your own model of how these actors view events so you

167
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,560
can really try to understand at least what they're saying and what position they're coming

168
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
from.

169
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,620
Yeah, it seems to me there's also an inclination for certain outlets to go hard on the drama

170
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,500
and really focus on that and turn it up to 11.

171
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,460
And people have figured out how to game that in the in social media and with blogs and

172
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,780
GitHub and all these ways that you can get your message out there.

173
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,100
And I think of like the Freenode situation.

174
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Clearly it's a really complex issue.

175
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,780
But something that we noticed and doesn't I think factors in is the folks that launched

176
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,660
Libera chat were unusually organized.

177
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,940
They clearly had a lot of premeditated maneuvers before they broke off from Freenode.

178
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,060
Were they right in doing so?

179
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,380
It seems in retrospect, yes, likely.

180
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,700
But I felt like the audience needed to know that it seemed like the Libera chat folks

181
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,500
had essentially pre-organized and were ready to go.

182
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:06,260
And one of the most clear demonstrations of that was that they all had public statements

183
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,140
and they all linked to each other's public statements and they created this cross reference

184
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,860
of public statements that just blasted the narrative out there and really got their take

185
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:22,500
on the situation miles out ahead of what the remaining Freenode staff could communicate.

186
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,540
And that is an interesting element to a story that while it doesn't really change the facts

187
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,660
on the ground, perhaps is still worth knowing.

188
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,020
It's like trying to dig those nuggets out and try to identify that stuff.

189
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:40,100
I think in the open source world matters just a little bit more because I think it's it

190
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,280
creates these lasting stories that we tell ourselves.

191
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,160
We tell ours like the story of what happened to Freenode and the story of what happened

192
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,860
to Audacity will be spread around in comment sections and on podcasts now forever, for

193
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
hereforth.

194
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,860
Right.

195
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,060
And so while that stuff is developing, I kind of feel like maybe we have a shot and I'm

196
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,060
curious to know your thoughts on this, Michael.

197
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,100
It's like I feel like maybe we have a shot on trying to participate in that initial conversation

198
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,580
and try to get some of the initial history right.

199
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,580
Oh, yeah, definitely.

200
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,540
I think that's very interesting, especially when you're talking about the Freenode one

201
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,940
and you're talking about the the kernel ban situation with the University of Minnesota.

202
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,900
Those were topics that were very volatile, very quickly.

203
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,460
And we're trying to balance the topics, whereas the Audacity has been happening over the course

204
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,200
of a few a couple of months.

205
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,300
So it's kind of built up and you can kind of you have more time to dig in, whereas the

206
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,220
Freenode one was so quick.

207
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,900
And there was, as you mentioned, it's really interesting that they had everything prepared

208
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:46,940
to go in that sense, as well as all the server stuff was in two days of the potential announcement

209
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,940
coming out.

210
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,580
All of a sudden, everything's ready to go.

211
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:56,380
So that does kind of create a, well, do we talk about it now or do we wait until we have

212
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:02,940
time from the other people involved to see if do we have all the information or do we

213
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,860
want to jump ahead of it?

214
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:11,820
And with the case of Freenode, I think there was like a four or five day delay for them

215
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,700
to give a reaction.

216
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,100
And that kind of created a situation of like, I don't want to talk about it until I have

217
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:25,780
both sides, because then otherwise it seems like I'm just pushing one agenda or one opinion.

218
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:31,820
And that is a position that I don't ever want to be in, because I want to be the reporter.

219
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:38,580
My job that I've chosen to do is provide the information, provide the news, and then if

220
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:47,840
it's a dramatic news or a social kind of inflammatory news, then I want to cover it on as many sides

221
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,540
as possible to make sure that at least it's a fair coverage.

222
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,260
And then also, I'm going to put my opinion in there as well, because it's not just reporting,

223
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,360
it's also like content in an entertainment fashion too.

224
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,820
So when you do these kinds of topics, you kind of have to balance it.

225
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,700
So I'm not sure exactly which one, one of these topics I waited until more information

226
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,420
came out.

227
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:20,420
And some topics in the past, I have chosen to jump ahead of it, and then that backfired

228
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,420
before.

229
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,920
So you kind of have to test the waters, so to speak.

230
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,140
And it's made me a lot more cautious in terms of how I want to handle it every time I've

231
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,260
done it.

232
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:40,540
And it seems to be getting more and more frequent, which is an interesting kind of turn of events

233
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,980
in the past year and a half, two years of what used to be very rare.

234
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,200
Now it seems to be quite often.

235
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,060
So I guess on the bright side, I get more practice for the shows.

236
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:58,580
Yeah, what do you suppose has caused that, the heat's been turned up on these stories?

237
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:04,500
People have more time to see what's happening versus the previous issues where the whole

238
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,160
working from home thing and the quarantine of last year and those things, people having

239
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,040
more time to pay attention.

240
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,820
And I think that people are digging in more as well and finding these different things.

241
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:23,980
Some of these topics would not have been found likely in a previous time period because they

242
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:30,340
were a pull request or a mailing list posts or something like that, that not a lot of

243
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,020
people are paying attention to.

244
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,140
But because more people have more time to pay attention, they can dig in a little more.

245
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,020
Something Wes and I talk about sometimes, and I'd like to know your thoughts on it too,

246
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,640
is there's two audience in a sense out there.

247
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,180
There is the audience that knows open source, they're free software users, they're Linux

248
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,580
users, they understand this stuff, and they have a different set of priorities around

249
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,520
privacy and metric collection.

250
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,920
Let's take this Muse group stuff for example.

251
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,860
You could argue that if say like an Apple news podcast was covering what the Muse group

252
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,620
was doing with Audacity, they think it was great because now Audacity could be listed

253
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,100
in the Mac app store.

254
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,500
They think all these things that Audacity is happening to Audacity are great.

255
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,620
I'm curious how that impacts how you think about this stuff because you've got Linux

256
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,920
users and then you've got new people that are just discovering this ecosystem that might

257
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,580
have a different perspective on these stories.

258
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,580
Yeah, that's an interesting point.

259
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,500
I think when it comes to these other communities looking into it, they're going to be looking

260
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,540
at it from a much different light, as you said, and with the reactions that we have

261
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:39,140
in this community and the open source community and those sorts of things, I think that there

262
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,860
is a balance that we need to consider more often.

263
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:50,780
I think that when it comes to these kind of reactions that are so bombastic of like how

264
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:56,460
dare you even consider the possibility of telemetry, I've gone on record before that

265
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:01,740
I think that telemetry is not bad automatically just to exist.

266
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,960
You can do it properly.

267
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,300
You can do it in an ethical way.

268
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,180
You can even do opt-out in an ethical way.

269
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,820
It depends on what kind of data you collect, how you collect it, and how you present it,

270
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,620
and whether or not you ask permissions.

271
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,120
There's some people in the community who see any form of telemetry whatsoever, even if

272
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,700
it is the most minimal amount you can possibly get, and that is too much.

273
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:33,940
I think that we see sometimes these topics in the case of Audacity or MuseGroup where

274
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:43,220
they react so harshly so quickly that it kind of puts a negative bubble around it for the

275
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,380
people in the different communities.

276
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,980
They see it as like, oh, these people don't want to even consider, they don't want to

277
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,980
be open-minded.

278
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,980
Right.

279
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,420
A lot of times, that's how the business unit on the other end of that reaction, I've had

280
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,540
several guests that I've kept in touch with after they've announced a Linux product, and

281
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,340
then they didn't package it right, or they didn't build it against the right library

282
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,500
or whatever, and they get a lot of negative reaction, and they don't take it well.

283
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,220
They don't try to listen for the signal in the noise and figure out what they need to

284
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,220
address.

285
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,740
Instead, they just sort of take it as an attack and a front.

286
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,340
Kind of like the Witcher 2.

287
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,340
They had a massive backlash because they had the audacity to use wine.

288
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,420
How could they dare ship it?

289
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,460
And of course, it was a fully tuned, fully tuned, and they had tested it.

290
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,100
It wasn't just like its general random-ass build of wine.

291
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,100
Yeah.

292
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,660
And such an ironic turn of events is that the Witcher 2 does this, and they get so much

293
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,660
backlash.

294
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,660
Valve says, you know what?

295
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,460
We're going to make a better wine.

296
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,460
Yay!

297
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:52,020
Now all these games run on the platform in the same way that the Witcher 2 did, and the

298
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,140
perception is so different.

299
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,980
I was thankful for the Witcher 2 work being done in the first place and also with the

300
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,980
work for Proton, just to be clear.

301
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,280
This is not a comparison to saying these are both bad.

302
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,280
They're both great.

303
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Yeah.

304
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,220
Whatever support you want to make Linux have support for Linux, continue to do so.

305
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,980
The other thing that is kind of funny to see, and I see this a lot in the written press

306
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:21,460
the most, is when projects announce that Flatpak is the future of software distribution, it's

307
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,260
hailed as a remarkable achievement that should have happened already.

308
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,540
And then when Canonical announces that Snaps are the future of software distribution, it's

309
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,060
considered like, how could they?

310
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
It's an overreach.

311
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,420
It's Canonical trying to control the Linux landscape and application deployments on Linux,

312
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,460
which maybe some of that's true, but it's just funny the different kind of reactions

313
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,360
you see depending on the stories and how it sort of sets the tone for conversation in

314
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,360
the community.

315
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,460
I think that's very interesting as a point as well, because there's the case of the way

316
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,780
that they are perceived is very different, but my favorite part about that particular

317
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,720
thing, the Flatpak versus Snap, is when I've seen people say, how could Canonical do this

318
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,660
when we already have Flatpaks?

319
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:08,700
And then I have to point out, the first release of Snaps was a few weeks prior to Flatpaks.

320
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,300
So that's not a thing that matters.

321
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:17,020
And it doesn't really work out the way that a lot of people want to present it of saying

322
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,380
they're doing a not-admitted here.

323
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:21,060
And it's like, well, they were kind of first.

324
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,940
Flatpaks have a different policy, and if you want to say, I like the policy system that

325
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,820
Flatpaks handles better, fair enough.

326
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:33,620
But that's not typically what is described in that particular situation.

327
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,900
So I think it's really interesting that a lot of companies are choosing to go with Snaps,

328
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:44,460
and I'm more than happy to say welcome to the community and welcome to the ecosystem.

329
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:50,460
And other companies are picking Flatpak, and I'm actually kind of ecstatic when they choose

330
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,460
Flatpaks.

331
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,980
I think that there's a lot of value to the Flatpaks, and my preference is Flatpak.

332
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,660
But personally, as long as it's on Linux, we're good.

333
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,380
Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.

334
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,380
Entirely agreed.

335
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,420
I'm curious, Michael, looking to the future, I know when Chris and I are sort of putting

336
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:14,220
together a Linux action news, there are repeatedly a similar set of written outlets that are

337
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,260
doing a lot of the grunt work, covering things first, scraping through mail server logs,

338
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,340
checking on discussions in GitHub and figuring out what's going on out there.

339
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,220
And there are people like Michael Larable, in particular, Pharaonix, who are spending

340
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,060
a lot of time to do this that enables a lot of great work on top of it that you and I

341
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,380
and Chris are all doing.

342
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,020
Seems like, I don't know how tenable that is.

343
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,940
We're all depending on advertising revenue, and much like in regular journalism, I'm not

344
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,420
sure they get enough credit.

345
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,600
Oh, absolutely.

346
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,940
That's why I started, every time I talk about a source that is a critical piece, I always

347
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,340
promote the source, or I at least have a visual element saying this is where it's from, or

348
00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:00,380
in some cases, like the last episode of Twill, I talked about some stuff that OMG Ubuntu

349
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:05,040
found from their forums and digging into that thing, and I'm going to absolutely say that's

350
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,120
where it comes from.

351
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,060
And I do think that a lot of times, even on other blogs where they don't really give credit

352
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:16,620
or sometimes they'll give credit with the word source and a link, and I think that's

353
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,220
the least you can do, but I think it is something that they should get a lot more credit than

354
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,820
they do, and especially like a high five to Pharaonix because there's a lot of great content

355
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,820
on that website.

356
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,260
Yeah, I think he gets a hard time.

357
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:34,300
Everybody's all Pharaonix and they roll their eyes, but man, that guy is publishing seven

358
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
days a week.

359
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,340
He's doing a lot of this stuff hands on himself.

360
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,340
I think he might be a machine.

361
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:44,820
I look at my list of RSS feeds because we're already going to subscribe to stuff, and you

362
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,380
go like, okay, there's one from this website for this week, five from this website from

363
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:54,740
this week, and you look at Pharaonix, okay, five from this day and every other day.

364
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,100
Yeah, and that can be Saturday and Sunday sometimes.

365
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
It just doesn't matter.

366
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,180
So there are those resources.

367
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:08,300
I've been thinking more about it too, like what could we do putting all of our resources

368
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:14,180
together too to help generate new original reporting, and in a way we do it by interviewing

369
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,980
projects and stuff like that.

370
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,300
We both do our part, but I feel like there's probably even more, and I don't have an answer,

371
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,060
but it's something that has been on my mind.

372
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:27,160
It feels like with the whole lockdown COVID stuff, it was like a year and change to kind

373
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:34,500
of rethink about events and what events to go to and what events I miss covering, and

374
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,420
I kind of have, you know, maybe I'm kind of working out a new model of what events I might

375
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
go to.

376
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,420
Have you given thought to that?

377
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,420
Yes, I have.

378
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:51,000
In fact, when I previously did events, I would go to events and think, you know, can I justify

379
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,960
the cost of going to these events and all these other things?

380
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,380
And then, you know, when you have the case of the COVID thing happening, which is unprecedented

381
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:03,220
experience that everybody has no expectations to what's going to happen.

382
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:09,180
I had no forethought to think I'm going to miss conferences.

383
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:17,380
So now when it starts back up, I mean, absolutely next year, I can guarantee you that my plan

384
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,720
at least, maybe I can't promise it, but my plan is to be at every single one of the conferences

385
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,140
I could physically go to.

386
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,020
Hopefully we'll see you there.

387
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,540
I mean, completely agreed, right?

388
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,940
Yeah, just get back in the game again for sure.

389
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,940
Oh yeah.

390
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:36,020
Well, what do you say we continue this fun on Destination Linux?

391
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,060
That sounds like a great idea.

392
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,140
So how about this weekend?

393
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,180
I'm in, I'll be there.

394
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:46,880
So I'll be there on Sunday and you guys stream it live at dealinlive.com and of course we'll

395
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,000
have links to this week in Linux and Destination Linux and Michael's profile in the show notes.

396
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,540
Check that out and Michael's hang out and stick around with us if he can and we'll just

397
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,060
keep chatting on stuff and feel free to jump in as we go through some of this.

398
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,060
Yeah, for sure.

399
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,940
All right, thanks for making it.

400
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,060
linode.com slash unplugged.

401
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:11,500
Go there to get $100 in credit for 60 days on your new account and of course, do I even

402
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
need to say it?

403
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,700
But of course you support the show, that's linode.com slash unplugged.

404
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,700
Linode is our hosting provider.

405
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:22,500
In fact, the project we built today, of course we built it on Linode and I actually really

406
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,660
enjoy that process because it's a chance for Wes and I to talk about like, well, what's

407
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,340
this thing going to do and do we want to deploy it on an existing Linux?

408
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,580
We have some of these application servers that we've built that we'll just deploy containers

409
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,420
on or do we want to have a dedicated system?

410
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,620
And what I really appreciate about Linode is the pricing works such that whatever your

411
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:45,520
style is, it's going to work for you and it ranges 30 to 50% cheaper than what the other

412
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,620
cloud providers are offering and they have 11 data centers worldwide you can choose from

413
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:56,780
and every single service, even if it's just like one $5 a month rig.

414
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:02,600
But if you got like we have a lot now, they back it by the best customer service out there.

415
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,520
They're just like winning awards all the time, it's impressive and they're available by phone

416
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
or ticket.

417
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:14,060
Every step of the way, Linode has focused on building a really good experience around

418
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,740
running applications on Linux in the cloud.

419
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,900
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

420
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,780
In fact, I've even seen people run Windows on Linode because they give you that level

421
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:32,340
of access to the metal if you want it, but they wrap it in a simple, clean, easy to use

422
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,340
dashboard.

423
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,580
So if you're not a pro or you've never set up a server in the cloud before, you're not

424
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,580
going to get lost.

425
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,180
You know, a few months ago I set up a sync thing server in the cloud.

426
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:46,660
I was just talking to Joe about this this morning and I opted to go with a $5 a month

427
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,580
up Linode just because I figured like, why not just throw a machine out that I can connect

428
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,620
to a lot of disk?

429
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,060
And so I did just that.

430
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:58,100
I set up that machine and I just added it to my sync thing network.

431
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,380
So I share all of my shares with that.

432
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,180
And then from that, I share it with the additional systems and they all sync with each other

433
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:10,540
and it kind of creates a peer to peer sync system that is much faster than just one server

434
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,980
to one server.

435
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,500
And I love that because what it means is during the day, I can have something here at the

436
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,500
studio that syncs up to my Linode system.

437
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,380
And then when I bring my system online in lady jupes, the files are coming both from

438
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,700
the studio server now and from the Linode server and it loads up super, super fast.

439
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:36,340
And because my cellular system in the RV is multi network, I can actually saturate multiple

440
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:42,660
cellular provider connections simultaneously and Linode can send as much as I can take.

441
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:47,540
And so I can move files and data around using sync thing transparently, which is one Linode

442
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,540
up in the cloud.

443
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,000
And there's all kinds of things you can experiment with.

444
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,140
You can learn, you can test and you can deploy in production.

445
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,220
So go get that $100 in 60 day credit at Linode.com slash unplug.

446
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,340
Try this stuff out for yourself.

447
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:08,660
Learn something, build something and support the show Linode.com slash unplugged.

448
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,180
Now we do have a few things to clean up around here.

449
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,700
Come on, Chris, you leave the studio like this.

450
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,700
I know.

451
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,700
I know.

452
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,700
I don't know what that plate of wings is doing over there.

453
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,940
I think it's still safe to eat.

454
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,940
Oh, good.

455
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,940
Cause I've had a few.

456
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,940
Good.

457
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,940
They were delicious.

458
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,420
In the meantime, I want to remind you about our meetup page cause it's back.

459
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,460
We're beginning to actually try to schedule things again.

460
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
We'll see.

461
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,800
But uh, go to, go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for that.

462
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,500
Also if you want to contact the show, you got some, some feedback or something you'd

463
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,340
like us to cover.

464
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,340
We'd love that.

465
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,500
Linodeplug.com slash contact.

466
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,780
And also I invite you to join our virtual lug.

467
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,240
It happens every Sunday at noon Pacific.

468
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,160
You can find your exact time at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar.

469
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,980
It just happens in our mumble room, in the lobby, people hanging out, talking about Linux

470
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:02,820
or maybe you're outside grilling and you just want to jump on with some like-minded geeks.

471
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,700
We invite you to join them and details for that mumble server.

472
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,460
They're over at Linux unplug.com slash mumble.

473
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,420
That's all going down every single dang Sunday.

474
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:20,660
So join them and hang out and get geeky in our virtual lugs Sunday meeting.

475
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,980
Now we decided to set up a tracker and we didn't want something that was running on

476
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,900
a commercial service or routed through Google maps.

477
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,900
We wanted something that used free software that we could self host and own tracks has

478
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,800
been on our list to try for a while.

479
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,020
We've taken a couple of passes at it.

480
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,900
It allows you to track your own location and you can keep that completely private if you

481
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,020
want and never share it with anyone and just use it for yourself.

482
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,960
An example of why you might want to do that is automations.

483
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,420
You can have things like lighting and whatnot respond to your location on own tracks.

484
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,020
And what it does is it runs on your smartphone.

485
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,480
In most cases there's an app that's in the play store in the Apple app store and every

486
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,380
time your phone moves, what they call a significant distance, it connects to the server via whatever

487
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,540
connectivity you have available and checks in with your location.

488
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,240
And there's a couple of ways you can do that.

489
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,040
One of them is MQTT.

490
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,520
You can send it over MQTT or another one is HTTP, which you can probably guess what we

491
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:24,500
went with and describe the setup that we decided to go with Wes with own tracks and the method

492
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
and how we're hosting it.

493
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:31,480
Yeah, well, of course we're using Docker because what we always do at this point and we're

494
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,360
using a component of own tracks called the recorder application, and it's really lightweight

495
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,480
and easy to get started with, which I like because I mean, the idea of having this data

496
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,680
seems really nice.

497
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,760
I'm one of the people that enjoyed knowing where I'd been in the past, just sort of reminiscing

498
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,060
or keeping tracks or checking when when was I there.

499
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:53,160
But I don't love the idea of Google having all of that.

500
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,720
But if I have to stand up yet another database, well, I don't know.

501
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
That's one more hurdle.

502
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,140
So it was nice to see that this own tracks recorder, you don't really need much.

503
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,800
There's a Docker compose file that you can get started with and then tweak to your needs

504
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:11,540
stands up and it does have options for both MQTT and HTTP.

505
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:17,960
And one nice thing about it is it can be an HTTP to MQTT bridge application and we'll

506
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,240
get to that.

507
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,880
But we basically got this started, expose the port to the internet, we're using traffic

508
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,880
to proxy it and slap on some SSL, what you get out of the box is a nice little application

509
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,840
that you can post updates over HTTP to just send some JSON, I think it's actually the

510
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,200
same JSON payload that you would be sending over MQTT, but you just sort of configure

511
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,520
which endpoint you send in your Android or iOS application.

512
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,720
And then it's going to record it all locally, and to boot, serve up some geo JSON, or even

513
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,920
render some open street map for you to track where you've been.

514
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,520
So that geo JSON lets you pull that into other applications, like Home Assistant, or let

515
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,840
you generate your own map if you maybe wanted to have something embedded on a website with

516
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,760
a live tracker and you wanted to have a map that really was unique and fit the theme of

517
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,460
your website, you could use this to generate the data for it.

518
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,920
Or like Wes said, it'll build one for you using open street maps.

519
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,800
And honestly, they look pretty good.

520
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,580
Yeah, I think that's like more than enough for our purposes.

521
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,880
But then of course, you know, if you want to go above and beyond, you've got the raw

522
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,560
data, which is great.

523
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Yeah.

524
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,040
And you can save it and just use it for I don't know, building charts and graphs of

525
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,940
your travels, or you could use it to do what we want to accomplish, which is make a public

526
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,400
tracker available that you can check in on.

527
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
And here's what I'm thinking.

528
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,380
And we're close to it, but we're not all the way there.

529
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,920
And I'd love advice if anybody in the mumble room has any tips or ideas or anybody listening

530
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,360
that would like to write in and give me some advice, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

531
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,120
But I want to play with Hugo.

532
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,680
I could use something else, but I've been thinking I should play with Hugo.

533
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:01,160
I was picturing a small Hugo site that has this live tracker built into it.

534
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:07,600
And on that page would also be information about the road trip and the meetup locations

535
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,080
and maybe like a picture feed from pictures we've taken from the road trip.

536
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,080
Something kind of simple.

537
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,600
Oh, like a one stop shop sort of site that's all about this upcoming trip.

538
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,080
I got the perfect domain for it.

539
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,080
Are you ready?

540
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,080
What did you get?

541
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
Colony tracker.live.

542
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,280
So I'm thinking like future trips and stuff, you know, track, track, colony tracker.

543
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,560
I'm, Wes, I've been thinking more about it.

544
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:35,520
You know, I've been thinking like, I feel like we should talk more about decent community

545
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:41,940
interaction and how to be a good citizen in the Linux community and how to foster an environment

546
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,680
of collaboration and turn down the heat.

547
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,840
Help create the community we want to be a part of.

548
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,840
I like it.

549
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,840
Right.

550
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,360
And I've been thinking the people that want to do that with us can be colony members.

551
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,480
And so I've been, I've been just brewing on this idea.

552
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,380
And so I like this idea of the colony tracker because I think a big part of this is going

553
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:02,740
to be a big part of, I should say, to be specific of turning down the dial on the, on just the

554
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:08,360
heat of conversation and just the tone I think will be when we get back in meet space and

555
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,380
we have IRL bandwidth to interact with each other.

556
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,020
I feel like there's going to be a pretty major shift because one of the main experiences

557
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:22,600
I have had, and I know this is probably true for both Michael and Wes, is interacting with

558
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,680
people in person, they become a friend for life.

559
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,360
Interacting with people over the internet, I can be friends with them.

560
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
It's nice.

561
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,360
You know, I can like them a lot.

562
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,880
I won't even think about that.

563
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,720
I won't consider it like a relationship that lacks depth, but people I meet in person,

564
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,920
I could end up being friends with for the rest of my life.

565
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,720
We create really strong bonds.

566
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,060
That's a really interesting point because I've had conversations and stuff.

567
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:51,160
I've met people on IRC, met people on, you know, mumble or zoom or all kinds of places,

568
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,640
but in person there is a lot more to it.

569
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,880
And it's interesting because the reason I earlier said that I wanted to go to every

570
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:05,120
conference is because the interaction of going to a lug and then like moving that lug to

571
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:10,560
a virtual one because you have to, the vibe is so different that even though just the

572
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,920
simplest, it's the same people, but for some reason that it's such a different experience

573
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,080
so drastically that I agree that when you're doing it in person, you can, you can build

574
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,080
a bond.

575
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
It's much deeper.

576
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,360
An in-person event, an in-person meeting, you know, even if it's just something simple,

577
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,760
going out and having lunch, that's like a good, rich beer, like a really tasty beer

578
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,400
like the CNX Tuesday and online events are like an O'Douls, like an alcohol free beer.

579
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,840
It's like you get the, you get the essence of beer, you get the idea of beer, but it's

580
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,840
not a beer.

581
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,880
It doesn't taste like a beer quite, quite right.

582
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,880
And you don't get buzzed.

583
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,120
It's better than nothing, but it's not really meeting your need.

584
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:52,760
And so the idea with this live tracker is not everybody can make it to Salt Lake City

585
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,080
or Denver, but there is a lot of people in between those two locations.

586
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,320
I'm leaving from the Seattle area and working my way out and my experience has always been

587
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,600
people always want to know where you're at, what route you take in, and of course it's

588
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,240
always changing when you're, anybody who does a lot of road trips, you know, things change.

589
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,760
And so the live tracker, it sort of solves that problem.

590
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,480
It gives people real time idea of where I'm at and then we can just do these micro meetups

591
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,040
and just have in real life connections.

592
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,200
Correct me if I'm wrong, but when the, when I used to be a part of JB, I remember there

593
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,320
was a part where you had something like this before.

594
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,240
Is this like a similar thing you're going to do?

595
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,960
And if so, is there like an experience between like the software you use then versus now

596
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,840
and like how it's interacted since the, you know, since the previous time?

597
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
Yeah, right.

598
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
Great question.

599
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,120
Cause the previous iteration was based on this commercial truck tracking system called,

600
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,480
this was the Rover tracker.

601
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
Yeah, yeah.

602
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,580
It was called like Lancy and Aaron.

603
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:56,440
It's really designed for shipping companies who want to track their trucks.

604
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,880
And so the nice thing about that is there's a hardware device that has its own cellular

605
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,880
connection.

606
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,280
And of course it's a crappy cellular connection, but they have its own and you can just stick

607
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,760
it on your dash and it just runs and it just updates their maps.

608
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,180
The problem is, as you would expect, it's some old clunky commercial product that has

609
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:22,440
an expensive subscription and the map is antiquated and you can't really do much with it and you

610
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,600
can't self host it.

611
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,600
And so those were like, those, those are just like all the things that just kind of, I never

612
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,800
liked about it, but it solved the core problem of, of location tracking in an embeddable

613
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
map.

614
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,400
But we wanted something this time around.

615
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,240
Like if we're going to build it again, we wanted to self host it.

616
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,840
We wanted to have no monthly subscription.

617
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:45,880
And then what's really nice about own tracks is it, it gives a lot of different types of

618
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,840
data output that we can use to automate and use for different things.

619
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:57,360
So it provides like a very rich set of API options for you to pull information out of.

620
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,600
And it's all controllable by what information gets shared and how it gets shared.

621
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,640
And it's something that we can run privately.

622
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,380
Like I don't mind if West sees all of my location data, right?

623
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,840
But I wouldn't necessarily want that in maybe some commercial cloud service anymore.

624
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,520
Like my, my, my preference has changed there.

625
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,440
And then I like the idea too, of using that data to drive automations here at the studio.

626
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,880
You turn on lights when I arrive, just even cycle the fans.

627
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,760
Cause of course I've geeked out all the cooling I bought for the summer is all on smart plugs

628
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,020
that are controlled by home assistant and all of that stuff could be automated when

629
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,640
home assistant knows my location.

630
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
Yeah.

631
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
And that's where it's neat.

632
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,640
The recorder app can act as like you, you can send HTTP updates from your phone and

633
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,760
then it can publish those updates to an MQTT topic that then home assistant can be configured

634
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,560
or open have a lot of these systems can be configured to read from and then pull in those

635
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
updates.

636
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,720
So we haven't actually tried that yet, but seems promising.

637
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
It's very interesting.

638
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,520
It sounds like you could take this and because it's with home assistant, you could do all

639
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,640
sorts of stuff with this data.

640
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Like when you just get room somewhat close to your house, you could be like setting it

641
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,720
up so that your thermostat turns on and make sure it's the pristine, perfect temperature

642
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,400
or whatever, like those kinds of things.

643
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,920
And it does seem like a very, I'm looking forward to seeing how it works out for you.

644
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,200
I mean, I probably wouldn't do it myself because of effort, but it does sound very interesting.

645
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,800
Well, you know, a lot of this I made West do.

646
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,320
I always have to disclaim that, that, you know, a lot of the heavy lifting was done

647
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,360
by West and you know, he's got a lot of other stuff going on too.

648
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,360
It's not the only thing he's doing and he still does.

649
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
He still gets it done.

650
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,280
I just like seeing you turn your home into an experiment and then I get to see when it

651
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,800
goes well and we all get to hear about when it goes very poorly.

652
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,940
Fair, fair.

653
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,880
So if anyone out in the community would like to help me build this colony tracker dot live

654
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,600
page, I'd love to do it in Hugo and I'd love to work with somebody on that and mentor me.

655
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,800
But if you want to build it with anything you want, as long as I don't care, I don't

656
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
have to be involved.

657
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
I don't have to go your way.

658
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,120
But I'd love either some mentorship on building a site for this or if somebody has a passion

659
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,560
that they could just crank something out and wants to help us create a page with some information,

660
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,880
we could put some branding on there, you know, get a little information out there for everybody.

661
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,320
Please contact me, Chris at Jupiter broadcasting dot com or use our contact page because I

662
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,280
think that could be something really fun.

663
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,040
And you know, it doesn't have to be Hugo.

664
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,280
West knows behind the scenes for about six months.

665
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,520
I keep trying to work Hugo into just about every episode.

666
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,000
We've snuck into a few places here and there, but I don't think you've quite got it out

667
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
of your system yet.

668
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
No.

669
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,120
And it's not a bad thing to plug in because Hugo is a very nice CMS.

670
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,960
I think it's quite a good static site gen.

671
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,660
The fact that you can do so much of it at the command line, like, you know, that really

672
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,840
got me is like, I love that that you generate it at the command line and all of that.

673
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,280
And there's a lot of great themes out there.

674
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,840
It just seems like it's a pretty solid, like you said, CMS and then it regenerates super

675
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,840
fast pages.

676
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,680
Yeah, it's a static site generating CMS and it's there's other things that do very similar

677
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,680
stuff.

678
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:59,640
So I'd say it's probably in out of all of the hundreds that exist, I would put it maybe

679
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,400
in the top three.

680
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,360
I'm also very picky about these things.

681
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,720
So I don't want to be like, oh, it's the best.

682
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,240
So it's I'm just saying it's definitely up there for sure.

683
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,000
But I think that there is a question that everybody is going to have to ask you about

684
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,600
this data that you're doing with the colony tracker.

685
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,120
And that is how much of it is going to Muse group?

686
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,320
Yeah, I have to sign a CLA too.

687
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,160
I don't understand why West was just really, really adamant that I signed the CLA.

688
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,240
You didn't read it too closely.

689
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,240
I'm glad of that.

690
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,720
Now I just signed it.

691
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,720
Yeah, that's true.

692
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,720
That's true.

693
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,160
I feel like the trick will be to turn it off when I don't want to be tracked off to remember

694
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,160
to do that.

695
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,600
But I was thinking the nice thing about having it on the Android phone is if we get this

696
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,480
working, I could put the you know, my pixel in my pocket and go to the meetup.

697
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,640
And then if people want to know where the meetup is, they just check the colony tracker

698
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
and go there.

699
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,440
So you have your like personal device and then your I want to be tracked device.

700
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
I like it.

701
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
Yeah.

702
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,880
And I'll probably often just leave it in the RV and you can track us as we go and telegram

703
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,160
me and we can set up something.

704
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,320
But I figured if I wanted to go out to lunch and was totally cool with people showing up,

705
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,360
I just take it with me and maybe just tweet or I don't know, I haven't figured that part

706
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,360
out yet.

707
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,440
Honestly, this is where YouTube would be a lot easier.

708
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,480
Like if I was doing YouTube videos or something, I could just pop on my channel and say, Hey,

709
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,480
I'm doing this.

710
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
I've thought about that.

711
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
That's a lot of work.

712
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,480
That's a lot of work.

713
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,480
Wes, get on it.

714
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
Yeah.

715
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,480
Wes.

716
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,480
Seems like a good idea.

717
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,480
All right.

718
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,760
Well, you're going to have to give me a remote camera access.

719
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,560
Linux dot entropy dot works.

720
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,480
Use promo code love 13 and save 15 percent.

721
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,600
You know, entropy is an industry leading mobile and web development studio based out of the

722
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,600
UK.

723
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,080
And they contacted me because they're listeners of the show and they have been building out

724
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,480
clients around the world, including Mars Wrigley, Walmart, MediaCom, the Financial Times.

725
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,700
And they want to reach out to the community members.

726
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,120
It's not just about the big companies.

727
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,080
They want to reach out to everyone and build a brand.

728
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,960
They want to be known for building Flutter applications and developing applications for

729
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,000
Linux, for the Mac, for Windows and even for the Web.

730
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,680
You know, they run their whole shop on Linux.

731
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,920
There are a bunch of Linux hardware geeks in particular.

732
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,040
They love love playing around with that kind of stuff.

733
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,640
And some of their team, some of their team, I've been told they hang out.

734
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,800
They've got their distros of choice and that's where they they stay there.

735
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,360
But there is absolutely like a distro hopper contingent on the team that's constantly jumping

736
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,800
around and trying out the different distros.

737
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,680
So they have a long standing connection back to the Linux community.

738
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,120
A lot of their tooling is built around Ruby and of course, Flutter for mobile and the

739
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,120
desktop.

740
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,920
I mean, they they really are emphasizing when their clients come to them that, yes, we build

741
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,920
for the Linux desktop.

742
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,640
Would you like to build an app for the Linux desktop?

743
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,700
And I love hearing that, you know, somebody has to push that forward.

744
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,240
And they've pioneered some of the most complex Flutter apps that have ever really been built,

745
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:04,960
including Flutter apps that have image recognition and machine learning built into them.

746
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,480
And Entropy can rapidly build an app for iOS, Android and Windows and Mac OS.

747
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,760
And yes, of course, the Linux desktop in essentially no time.

748
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,860
They're already one of the global leaders in Flutter development with dozens of deployments

749
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,040
in just the last year alone.

750
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,980
I think we all see where this is going.

751
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,960
It gives us an opportunity to find something that's better than Electron.

752
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,880
It still delivers on that multi-platform delivery promise.

753
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,180
And thankfully, it puts Linux right there at the front of the line with Canonical and

754
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,960
Google backing that.

755
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,480
There's a good shot that's going to be around for a while and that's going to go places.

756
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,680
And I think Entropy sees that and they're ready to start building apps for people.

757
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,280
Wes and I had an app idea for a Flutter app that takes advantage of PipeWire that just

758
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,240
like can list the process IDs.

759
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,660
You select the process ID and it can grab the audio using PipeWire.

760
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,760
You could build that out in Flutter.

761
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,760
It'd be a great app.

762
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,280
In fact, Entropy would love to discuss any ideas you might have and just chat with you

763
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,880
about the Linux desktop in general.

764
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,800
Regardless if it moves forward into a project, they just love to get in touch and chat.

765
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,300
That'd be an opportunity to geek out.

766
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,860
So get started by going to linux.entropy.works, fill out the contact form, and use the promo

767
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,480
code LUP13.

768
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,720
You'll also save a little money when you do that if you do end up starting a project.

769
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,520
There's never any pressure.

770
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,600
They're always just happy to chat and discuss Linux and chat about Goofy Chris on the Unplugged

771
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,600
program.

772
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,600
They'll do that too.

773
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:35,680
So go check them out and use promo code LUP13, linux.entropy.works.

774
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,800
Well we've got some feedback.

775
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:44,680
Michael Staggs over on Twitter tagged you wondering about the security of Deepin.

776
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,540
He writes that, I know in the current political climate, China and security are both hot button

777
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:55,600
issues, but I don't feel we can give Deepin a pass on security.

778
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:00,520
It's so bad that the OpenSUSE audit team won't even audit their stuff anymore.

779
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,960
Yeah, that's a shame.

780
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,080
You know, so Michael, he tweeted me a couple of links to some bugs that are pretty concerning

781
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,080
in Deepin.

782
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:14,580
However, they're from 2019, and they're bugs on OpenSUSE's bug tracker, not on Deepin's.

783
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,920
So it's entirely possible that that code isn't even being used or has been replaced, it's

784
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,340
hard to say.

785
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,440
But it is an interesting, you know, consideration.

786
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,040
It's kind of off on its own island, and it could have its own particular security ramifications

787
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,680
when you are creating your own new apps.

788
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:37,280
I really, really, really wanted it to be like the distro I could recommend to new users

789
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,800
because it's fresh and it's clean and it asks some great questions when you're setting it

790
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,600
up that are simple and I think great questions to ask.

791
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,440
And I thought, boy, wouldn't this be great, especially if they add Android app compatibility.

792
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,880
But it is just too different.

793
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,800
It's like running some crazy ass esoteric distro on your server and then, you know,

794
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,280
walking away and expecting somebody else to pick it up.

795
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,620
Like, I just can't in good faith say go for new users, deploy this unless you yourself

796
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,400
are a Deepin user and you're helping them with it.

797
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,400
Right.

798
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,360
I mean, the farther away you step out of the mainstream, the more of that support burden

799
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,120
you got to take on yourself.

800
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,120
And especially if you're a new user, that's not really something you're capable of.

801
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,280
I think what they're billing over there is really neat, but it's probably not the first

802
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,760
distribution to recommend to new users.

803
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,760
I spent about a week and a half with it.

804
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,720
And so I decided now to wipe it off here.

805
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,080
And I have put Fedora 34 on here.

806
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,080
Let's see.

807
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,760
I'm going to first boot right here, let's log in, see if Fedora rawhide.

808
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,600
So I guess this is technically, I guess this is technically what Fedora 35, going to be

809
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,360
Fedora 35 eventually.

810
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,200
And I'm happy to report it looks like everything went good.

811
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,400
The ThinkPad is now running rawhide with plasma.

812
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,480
I want to see what version it is, though, because that's obviously all that matters

813
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,480
here.

814
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,040
That's the whole point of why you're doing this, right?

815
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,560
It wasn't just for the freshest nano you could get.

816
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,840
That's always a consideration.

817
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:59,240
But I'll build it from source if I have to, whatever it takes to get the freshest nano.

818
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,240
Whatever it takes.

819
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,240
All right.

820
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,520
So survey says I am on plasma 5.2.2.3.

821
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,760
I'm happy with that.

822
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,800
That's great.

823
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,680
And I'm on Wayland.

824
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,960
And it looks really good.

825
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,960
It looks smooth.

826
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,200
I think this is not a bad default to start with, at least.

827
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,200
All right.

828
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,440
Well, you just check back in after a couple of DNF updates.

829
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,440
Yeah.

830
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,960
Let's see how it goes.

831
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,800
What could go wrong running rawhide on my laptop, right?

832
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,040
One of the things I loved about when I switched to Fedora is that you can get the latest and

833
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,400
greatest plasma without having to wait for the next release.

834
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,920
It's not necessarily that that's coming to 35.

835
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,480
That also might just come to 34 stable as soon as they're ready to take it out of rawhide.

836
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,480
Generally, yes.

837
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,360
However, the timing of things has worked out that the latest plasma isn't right.

838
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,160
I mean, that was the whole thing that Neil convinced me of last week is that's where

839
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,320
it all went sideways is the way the release windows are working out.

840
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,340
It's going to be a long period of time.

841
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,640
And so if you want fresh plasma, I knew it.

842
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,640
Neil was to blame.

843
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,760
Oh, it's totally Neil's fault with five twenty three.

844
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,760
I know there's going to be a little bit of a little bit delay, but that, you know, I'm

845
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,320
on five twenty two dot two and I'm like, I'm OK with that.

846
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,320
Yeah.

847
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,320
Yeah.

848
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,320
Yeah.

849
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,320
To be fair here, right?

850
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:14,480
Like it's not like you're going to experience a huge gap because five twenty three itself

851
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,160
doesn't even get branched from the development trees in plasma upstream until after Fedora

852
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,880
Linux thirty five is branched downstream.

853
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,940
So like the final release of plasma five twenty three doesn't happen until like I think it's

854
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:33,920
a week or two weeks before Fedora Linux thirty five's GA, which is just too close to pull

855
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,960
it in right away.

856
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,780
And that just means that it'll get pulled in post GA and update like within two weeks

857
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,300
or so afterwards.

858
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:47,960
But if you are really feeling compelled to want the absolute latest and greatest, then

859
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:52,040
Fedora Rawhide does, in fact, have it and we'll get it right away.

860
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,800
But you take everything that goes with that, right?

861
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,400
And that's that's really the core of it.

862
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,000
Or you can use the the copper repos I mentioned earlier.

863
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,560
One of our SIG members actually rebuilds everything from Rawhide for plasma for stable releases

864
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,120
and you can activate those and do that.

865
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,720
Man, you could have mentioned that before I installed Rawhide.

866
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,720
I'm just saying.

867
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,680
Well, Chris, I tried to tell you I tried.

868
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,680
But you were you were on a kick was like, oh, yes.

869
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,680
So is Rawhide any good?

870
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,840
And you know me, I can't help it.

871
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,280
I there's something wrong with me, dude.

872
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,000
It's what drove me to Jen two years ago.

873
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's still there.

874
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,340
Well, you know, I have machines that run Rawhide because as a Fedora developer, like it makes

875
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,600
some sense for me to at least have one or two that do it.

876
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,520
And it's it's totally fine.

877
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:44,920
Like I generally don't have issues with it these days, which sometimes can be kind of

878
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,920
a disappointment.

879
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,920
Yeah.

880
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,920
Right.

881
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,920
Yeah.

882
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,920
But it works pretty well.

883
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,280
Like the the major advantage of running Rawhide, at least from my perspective as someone who

884
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:59,020
likes to help make the ecosystem better, is that you get the absolute latest Linux kernel

885
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:03,960
in Mesa as they are coming and you can like before they're released.

886
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,460
And so you can see how well it's working for your hardware.

887
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,440
You can give feedback to the developers and they can actually do something useful about

888
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,100
it to hopefully make it better sooner, because like by the time a release is out, like those

889
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,560
merge windows have passed.

890
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,360
And so it's it takes longer for fixes to come out.

891
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:24,720
But if you're testing it as the get snapshots are landing in in Fedora or the RCS are landing

892
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:30,880
in Fedora, Rawhide, then you have an opportunity to make sure that those things are fixed very

893
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,880
quickly.

894
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,480
It sounds like something I want to play with as well at this point.

895
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:40,040
Now, I'm not typically the one who wants to like the bleeding edge kind of thing, but

896
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,040
I do now.

897
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,040
I do.

898
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,320
Just don't do it on your production machine.

899
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,320
You know, that's what I figured.

900
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,520
Yeah, I'm not I'm not crazy enough to suggest that.

901
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,520
Yeah.

902
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,320
Meanwhile, my production systems are all on Ubuntu 18.04.

903
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,320
It's pretty boring.

904
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,320
I know.

905
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,320
I know.

906
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,320
All right.

907
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,320
But with that, the cone of silence.

908
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,320
Hey, Wes, come here for a second.

909
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,320
Get in here.

910
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,320
Is that you?

911
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,320
The smell?

912
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,640
I mean, yeah, I'm sorry about that.

913
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,640
I'm surprised that hat fits in here.

914
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,640
Jesus.

915
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,040
Anyways, I wanted to let you know and I don't tell anybody else, but I know you've been

916
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,760
wanting to up your credentials game.

917
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,760
I know you.

918
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,760
You talk about this all the time.

919
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,320
You always want the latest certs.

920
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,480
But our friends over to Cloud Guru have a course on Linux file sharing that helps you

921
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,020
prepare for the LPIC two engineer exam.

922
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:26,080
And in that course, they cover the basics, but also advanced configuration options for

923
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,640
Samba and NFS.

924
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,960
So I wanted to give you the link to this.

925
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,960
I'll just put it in the show notes.

926
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,240
I don't like I don't want to say it in the show because I don't want everybody to go

927
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,400
get the certification and then, you know, take your job.

928
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,360
Well, and it's a little embarrassing how bad I am at Samba can face.

929
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,360
Right.

930
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,240
I mean, yeah, because you can't just do test parm and get all the details.

931
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,080
Anyways, I just thought you should maybe have the link.

932
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,080
So I'll put it in the show notes.

933
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,080
That's what I'll do.

934
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,540
I'll put like in a cloud guru link in the show notes and then that'll take you to this

935
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,540
Linux file sharing.

936
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,540
Thank you.

937
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,540
You're welcome.

938
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:52,800
Just let's not mention it on the show.

939
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,800
The cone of science.

940
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:00,200
All right, well, that does bring us to the end of this week's episode.

941
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,200
We'd love to hear from you.

942
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,520
You can tweet us at Linux unplugged or go to Linux unplugged dot com slash contact.

943
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,080
The whole network is at Jupiter signal over there.

944
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,000
We do announcements, live streams, that kind of stuff.

945
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,680
It's really kind of like our blow horn, but you can also send feedback at the Jupiter signal

946
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,280
and we receive it there.

947
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,800
Of course, there's lots of fantastic podcasts, including our sister show, Linux Action News,

948
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,500
and the self hosted podcast over at Jupiter broadcasting dot com.

949
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,440
Check out Linux Action News if you haven't.

950
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:30,320
We've been discussing the audacity story from the very beginning over there.

951
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,780
And last but not least, we'd love to have you join us live.

952
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,720
We do this here podcast on a Tuesday.

953
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,520
Join us at 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m.

954
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,520
Eastern.

955
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,520
See you next week.

956
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,520
Same bad time.

957
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,240
Same bad station.

958
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,440
Yes, make it a Linux Tuesday.

959
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,600
Why not join the mumble room?

960
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,360
Then you get a low latency audio stream.

961
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,920
And the fun thing about that is if you're on Linux and you connect using mumble, the

962
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,760
entire stack end to end is free software because we're doing it right here on Linux

963
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,000
two using mumble.

964
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,220
You connect, you get low latency, real time audio, and you're doing it all with free software.

965
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,840
And it's also one of the best sounding ways to catch the show.

966
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,400
That is at Linux unplugged dot com slash mumble and you just join us and hang out and then

967
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,400
you're ready for the look plug too.

968
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,680
It's kind of great.

969
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,920
It's like a power move for the show.

970
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,880
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the unplugged program.

971
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,220
We're not going to see you here tomorrow.

972
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:45,440
We won't see you the next day, but we will see you next Tuesday.

973
00:54:47,220 --> 00:55:03,920
I was enjoying a nice sea of this Tuesday, see you next Tuesday, one beer and I'm just

974
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,120
totally scrambled now.

975
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,720
It's like that thing really hits.

976
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,320
We'll see you every Tuesday.

977
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,800
Yeah, that's true.

978
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,800
That's what I should say.

979
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,440
You know, I still have that burn from the steam valve.

980
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,000
Man, you know, I kind of expected this this rawhide thing to be kind of a train wreck.

981
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,600
But man, you know, the default plasma setup after all, because I've just tried so many

982
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:29,280
different desktop environments recently from Windows 11 to deepen to cosmic.

983
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,720
And now to just throw plasma on rawhide on here.

984
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,400
It's so simple and straightforward now.

985
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,200
It's like plasma has become the just simple, obvious, straightforward UI.

986
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,200
It's weird.

987
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,120
Welcome to my side.

988
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,120
This reminds me of a conversation we had like seven years ago or something.

989
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,120
Yeah.

990
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,120
Yeah.

991
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,200
Well, you know, 40, 40 was compelling for a while, especially on a laptop.

992
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,360
I really like where they're going.

993
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,800
But then I read this.

994
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:01,520
I read this great piece that Joey wrote for OMG Ubuntu about where the genome sees its

995
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,520
future going.

996
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,960
And I just looked at that and I thought, yeah, OK, that settles it for me.

997
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,920
Plasma is the desktop environment for me.

998
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,760
I am definitely and clearly and now it has been explained to me in multiple ways.

999
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:38,880
I am not the target user for that desktop environment, and that's OK.
